further you all right there you go she's close we better go i know someplace safe you weren't looking so good i let you rest who are you answer me you're used to talking that way to people on sushima but not here samurai i don't even know if you're real draw your blade find out how real i am if you're from ikky you know who won the battle of cloud forest rained two weeks straight before that battle flash flood killed samurai and islanders alike we are lost my turn to ask questions what's a samurai doing on iki island the eagle sent the scouting party to tsushima when i saw what they did to her people i knew i had to stop them so you saw the effects of her poison more than that she made me drink it and you can still hold a conversation first time i've seen that how long does it take to wear off as far as i know it doesn't i won't let that stop me how long have the mongols been here few weeks wiped out most of the raiders my crew are the last holdouts i can help you fight back and drive the eagle from iki a samurai helping ravens anything to stop the eagle what's your name jin from yarikoa let me think about your offer jin from a yarikawa you're not slipping away that easily i need to find more survivors and you need to get your head on straight catch up to me at a farmhouse on the western coast and we'll talk more if the eagle's poison doesn't break you first it won't [Music] uh clear my head then meet tenzo i can't let the eagle tribe destroy this island you rang from your father's death for years there is nowhere left the nightmare will grow worse you cannot face your father's death alone without my wisdom you will lose your soul to madness why so restless what do you think looking for redemption you won't find it here hmm i know this battlefield [Music] i tried to forget this place are you well my lord this doesn't feel like victory let me take you to your father is this how it's supposed to feel lord otachi victories don't have to feel good [Music] this wasn't about glory it was a message to all of ikki how about these raiders at your peril these weren't warriors they were untrained villagers with rust enough i require private wood with my son no the duchy feed the men and get them drunk come here father what happened today these villagers were helping hide the raiders we butchered them all the men in the village the samurai ran hot yes but these fools attacked us [Music] the man i killed the man you killed was a criminal you did well today better than i expected father we fulfilled our orders from al jitor where's your head high today you were a warrior if you were here today father you condone my actions so freely i need this gym i can't put a bounty on the coast anyone can claim it he's all didn't think you'd make it what happened here friends of mine lived on this farm i hoped they'd join our fight but those mongol bastards got to them first the least they deserve is a proper burial won't be long i'll help you you don't have to do that i know i want to grab a spade may they find peace in the next life i didn't take you for a religious man i'm full of surprises you said you would think about bringing me to your crew have you made up your mind that depends is the eagle's poison still affecting you yes but it hasn't slowed me down take me to meet your raider friends and i'll prove i can help you fight back all right samurai we've got the ride ahead of us try and keep up where you taking me an old radar stronghold we used it to hide from the samurai now it's keeping us safe from the mongols you're not worried about taking a samurai to your secret hideaway of course i am but we need every fighting arm we can get just watch yourself once we get there ever since the sakai invasion samurai are slightly less popular than a pit of venomous snakes the sucker invasion the butcher of iki i came here to help not listen to you insult the samurai you want to play nice with the raiders better get used to it there's a hidden entrance to the stronghold up ahead logos we found the entrance let's see how good you are with that blade samurai i'm right here [Music] samurai [Music] [Music] good you're not too sick to fight we're not getting in this way that's doing any outsiders find our home we block the entrance and kill the witnesses no exceptions i hope she's more welcoming to invited guests we'll find out soon enough is there another way in only by sea there was a path years ago before my time don't know if it's still there it's worth a shot his throat was opened while he slept his blood sprayed your tent silence [ __ ] you all right yes sometimes i hear the ego's voice like she can read your mind or something no i hear my own thoughts things i didn't know i was thinking but in her voice i hope it wears off i see why the summer i never found this hideaway of yours it's the only stronghold on ike that survived the sakai invasion let's hope that holds for the mongols no way to cross there's always a way samurai has to say [ __ ] like that do pirates have to move off just the clever ones neat trick i could use one of those it was a gift from a brilliant friend he passed sorry together minus setback look for a way around hmm you're welcome to join me all right i'm fine you're doing great don't die not that bastards they're after one of our ships friends of yours would become friends yes i knew that that makes four craft we've lost the eagles washing i'll get us through here how did you join up with hune we enjoyed the hospitality of the sucker in together you mean fort sucker terrible fool but we left with our heads intact most of the guests weren't so lucky almost there he is luring you into a den of murderers they will kill you just as they killed your father when we step through that gate there's no turning back everything you do is on my head don't make me regret this samurai you don't have to worry about me tenzo i promise good keep that attitude and you'll be fine just stay close keep your sword sheet and let me do the talking you're back you brought a samurai here wait until hunde hears about this i'll tell her myself get back to your posts i'm watching you samurai let's get you to pune impress her and the wolves back off and if i don't impress her i've seen her tie men up and leave them to drown at high tide even hung one traitor from the master for ship for the girls tweet but i don't know what she'll do to the summer [Music] those people more victims of the eagle's poison not as lucky as you tenzo you're running out of clean rags check the drawers i have a shirt you can strip down let's go chin finish way was that your house they needed more than me yes watching us for my favorite pouch tenzo get your ass up here coming pune remember look nice and stow the samurai attitude welcome back tenzo i can explain i hope so because right now i'm really curious why you brought the samurai into my home you sent me to find people who can fight fight for us not against us if i wanted to come for you you would know it it's all right tenzo i want to hear this samurai dig his own grave i'm here because the mongols invaded my home too and if the ego isn't stopped on your shores she's going to bring her army and her poison to tsushima we can defeat the eagle and save both our homes but only if we work together he's your catch tenzo what's your take maybe he helps us or he's skewered on a mongol spear and you get to brag about one more samurai dying on iki island either way we've got nothing to lose you're in zamurai i hope you don't get seasick when the next storm hits we're taking every boat in this cove and attacking that mongol warship sounds like a good way to lose half your men get me about that warship and i can sink it [Laughter] tenzo get this fool out of my face jin may have a point we can't get close enough to board the warship but a mongol boat from ike resupplies them every few days we can take their supply ship and make the delivery ourselves tenzo if you think this can work you're in charge i need a dozen men jin can be one of them they're yours the supply ship docks on the northeast side of the island look for a small inlet steep cliffs i'll meet you there it has been a pleasure just watch your steps samurai their noses [Music] careful my lord riku has a taste for warriors what are you talking about black henriku the cursed pirate captain who terrorizes iki island from beyond the grave hmm blackhand rico did he die at sea years ago that he did i am kashira i sailed on riku's bloodstained banner the things i saw still haunt my nightmares perhaps you can tell me the tale of course i hope you have a strong stomach black henriku was once the cruelest pirate captain to ever terrorize icky island he carved up his victims piece by piece always saving a morsel for his loyal companion a vicious monk rico built his armor to honor a brutal sarugami this monkey demon inhabited his armor its cursed whispers drove riku to take risks tempting him with the spoils of battle while pushing him to the brink of ruin six years ago black and rico attacked a refugee ship its cargo children we threw the young ones overboard the samurai protector he skinned alive his crew watched in horror while riku's monkey fed on the trimmings then mutiny black henriku's crew plotted to poison their wretched leader he was stabbed through the chest and blinded by the poison but he clung to life protected by the armor of the sarugami riku set his ship ablaze and fled with his monkey while his crew burned to death in their fiery tomb before he died riku hid his sarugami armor somewhere on iki island now he haunts the coast a wrathful spirit who preys on anyone brave or foolish enough to seek the cursed armor of black hand riku [Music] so you sailed with black henriku and applauded his death someone had to stop him and no one has found his sarugamiana many have tried but they all fell victim to his wrathful spirit people say the monkeys of icky are his eyes and ears if that's the case he already knows i'm interested where did your ship go down i don't remember much of that night but one other crew member survived minato she spent her time hiking mountain tsuchi trying to forget the horrors we lived through thank you for the tale be careful the monkeys are watching black henry crew sees everything come here to samurai you were broken long ago without me to guide you your soul is doomed to useless not um enough [Music] whatever it is i've heard what she does to people you are not alone in this world if you ever need guidance will help you clan adoption is dead you can't blame yourself [Music] youtube [Music] hold still who have guessed saved by a samurai are you minato who's asking a ronin looking for some long-lost armor i hear you used to sail on the black hand rico quiet you hear you so you believe the stories some nights i feel riku watching me i can hear his pet monkey sucking merrell from bones i know it sounds crazy but i swear those beauty monkeys are watching us do you remember anything about the night of the mutiny anything that could help me find this final resting place we were anchored just off the north eastern shore there was something under the water something glowing the moon's reflection moon wasn't out that night glowing water it's not much but it will have to do do yourself a favor forget the armor [Music] where is tenzo talking to a friend [Laughter] [Music] the ego speaks the truth going to keep me waiting gin next time don't be so quick to kill your enemy he may have known something useful he spilled plenty you called him a liar what did he tell you nothing they can't wait the ship should talk soon once it does tell your men we'll take it quietly if we cause too much damage the eagles warship will see through our disguise before we get close enough to attack don't worry from yarikawa we'll take that supply ship without a scratch i'll get some rest the ship will be here soon it's time they've brought robots ashore we'll borrow them to reach the supply ship the fog will work in our favor if they see us coming we risk scaring them off let's get moving is the eagle's poison still in you i won't lose focus if that's what you're asking it's not you said it made you see things things i'd like to forget like getting blood stains on your favorite silk a little worse than that all right i'll bite what's the worst thing that happened to jin from yarikawa losing my father we were in battle together i'm sorry don't be you didn't know [Music] so [Music] you know the drill quick and bloody [Music] the shores house ready the boats damn it the fog is lifting garcia's coming incoming get up and start fall back no i can go around take out those weapons you'll be blasted to pieces show us what a summer i can do what's that fire [Applause] oh the raiders know who you are they are leading you into a trap you're not real when you die will the raiders pray for you the same one they spoke before murdering your father what was that prayer again you know the words they haunt you may your death benefit all beings be quiet [Music] you're helping people who spit on your father's name when he died were you too weak to save him it wasn't my fault oh [Music] sure took your time silencing those cannons i thought you needed a chance to catch your breath how thoughtful what's going on with you one moment we stand shoulder to shoulder but next you're ready to cross blades not now samurai we have a job to do and let's finish it and talk after set a course for the eagles warship let's hope they don't notice it's manned by a crew of raiders [Applause] we need more than hope tell your men to hide when we get with inside of the warship an empty ship that won't look suspicious it will buy us time to get close past the range of their heavy cannons we'll wait for them to board us and we'll attack set off the black powder stores rip open the beast's belly you better be right about this chip looks big or close they're on to us we have to attack now not yet hold attack send these bastards set the black powder to blow today we struck a blow for four days refuge next we take back ikky and one day escape the endless wheel of suffering good work tenzo i think fuller is going to be pleased no she's going to skin both of us alive what are you talking about you tell me lord sakai one whisper of your real name and every person in this refuge will line up to split you wide open say my name force me to defend myself this is what the eagle wants samurai and raider spilling each other's blood she knows we're a threat if we work together [ __ ] who told you i was a sucker was it the mongol you interrogated the eagle wanted you to know this is what i get for trusting a damn samurai i grew up here you know learned to swim in the shallows helped build half these holes [Music] broke my arm falling off the rock wall trying to impress my wife you were married years ago she didn't make it through childbirth funny helped me bury them this is my home these people are my family if they find out i brought the butcher of iki's son here they'll stake both of us down make us a feast for the crabs i won't let that happen this stays between us yes we're in this together the eagle's hurting thanks to what we did today we can save iki island if we stand together but our fight is just beginning you samurai and your speeches i'll tell fune your plan worked when you're ready i'm sure she'll want to thank you in person somehow i doubt that be careful tenzo and watch what you say you too jin from ryakawa [Music] care to test your skill the tournament welcomes all fighters you're holding duels during an invasion everyone needs a little entertainment during wartime besides we're using bokeh to avoid injuries i only duel with a clear purpose you want purpose we offer generous rewards as long as you win if you are interested the contenders are waiting at the i suppose i could use some sparring practice in honor of your fine katana we will call you octo some advice each combatant has a unique style with distinct strengths and weaknesses challenge a contender don't keep the people waiting sword made of steel you must lack technique this katana is for war for you i'll use one made of wood i once impaled a man with a wooden sword did it when i was 13. and you're still bragging about it i've beaten plenty since then then stop dwelling on the past and show me your skill today challenges kai i'll rip you open and now it's time introducing first and his opponent the brutal raid kite kicks and punches are allowed first to five touches wins resume [Music] pullback disengage lucky bastard well done jim i can't believe i'm about to say this but good work with the warship is that a thank you don't push it my ships can finally leave the cove if you're itching to hire a boat back to sushima i won't blame you we're days away from everyone on ike falling victim to the eagle's medicine or joining her army and if iki falls my home is next all right jean from yarikawa stick around and you can help us clip the eagle's wings she rode from fort sakai hours ago my scout saw her leave with her main force she must be planning something where is she now no idea she's covering her tracks well but she left her stronghold exposed now that her main force is left this is our chance to take back fort sagai while it's lightly defended even with fewer guards it won't be easy to breach the place is a prison camp captives are being tortured and forced to drink that witch's poison until they swear loyalty to the eagle i know i escaped once before some of my best men are trapped inside free them and they can help you liberate the fort then i'll finally have enough forces to take the fight to the eagle tail meant to tighten the defenses around the refuge if this works the eagle is going to be angry i hope she is he wasn't supposed to be here was tucker brave at the end i'm sorry i couldn't darkness [Music] forgive me cocky someday we'll go for a peaceful ride [Music] [Music] face me [Music] [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] am i free are you with fane we were before the eagle captured us what are you some kind of samurai i'm a friend your boss sent me to free her crew and take back foot sake the eagle may be gone but she left her commander in charge kunbish is torturing prisoners breaking us down before we're forced to drink the eagle's poison then he won't leave this fort alive go report back to funeral i can fight i will fight find a weapon and join me i can't wait to get back may your death benefit all beings you couldn't save your father what makes you think you can save his form let's drive the mongols from this place break open the cages through the gate drive up the invaders take the fight to them forward [Music] this is it fight for your freedom we're clear move forward remember the night your father tied starving bandits to trees as punishment not so different from this the eagle knew you'd return samurai you have received her sacred drink a gift offered to warriors and princes worthy of becoming one of her shamans is that what she wants to make me a shaman your transformation has already begun you can accept her gift become her shaman and learn to soar in the eternal blue sky or i will break you in the name of the eagle a gift is a curse and i will never bow to her rule [Music] [Music] [Music] you will hang like the peasants [Music] a wasted gift [Music] here you could observe the eagle i would never be her shaman uh where is your gratitude you deserve nothing less than death hmm [Music] [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] you waste the eagle's gift to you you waste the air we breathe coward kill them all take their the rest of you free the business [Music] you stop [Music] your patience will grow worse driving you to madness and death if only you had accepted the ego's gift [Music] [Music] killed some of my best friends glad to see the coward get what he deserved even if it took a samurai to run him through he fell because we worked together but the ego she knew i would come here that's why she left fort sakai undefended so i would take her bait and kumish would deliver her message now the bastard's dead and she's lost the fort thanks to you you can finally fight back yeah there anyone who can fight and report to funny everyone else can shelter here with a few repairs fort sucker will stand against the mongols good thinking but before you run off take these saddlebags figured a samurai could put them to good use i will thank you travel safely and i'll see you back at funes refuge i followed her from the beginning right out of fort sucker there's the samurai who freed us from fort sakka i thought i'd see the day you outdid yourself this time my men returned safely and fought sakai is in our hands we finally have a fighting chance against the eagle any news on her whereabouts not yet but i did learn something while you were busy my scouts recovered orders the eagle sent to her shamans it sounds like she wants to capture a samurai did she name them no but i think we can guess who she's hunting what i want to know is why does she want to take you in alive the eagle captured me when i first arrived i escaped but maybe she wants to finish what she started what aren't you telling me samurai renee jin we were searching for the eagle lost her but then we stumbled on one of our patrols tracked them all the way back here the cliffs outside are crawling with mongols we had to sneak back in to avoid being seen the eagle knows we're close she's going to find us she's retaliating this is payback for her worship and the death of her lap dog kumish we can evacuate to the ship abandon your home now and you lose it forever you'd rather die here we could draw them away from the refuge fight them on land they outnumber us so do the samurai you know the terrain better what about an ambush somewhere we have the advantage we have a plan round everyone up tenzo we need to go now [Music] i sent scouts ahead of us they'll lure the eagles forces to kill for a village i've got people preparing an ambush what about the people who live there it was abandoned after the butcher of iki destroyed it your father put the entire village to the sword and you did nothing to stop him a lookout tower we got a good view up there get people in the most likely places a few of us on horses can hold back and respond where we're needed like stopping a wildfire we need to cover a lot of ground where should we position the men place them among your father's innocent victims the tree line station people there to keep watch if they see something they can signal us with those fireworks we took from the ship sent them off the moment your people see the invaders then we ride in hide people in those houses and granaries where your father's victims here terrifying and weeping and that the mongols don't get close have riders ready to hit their flank force them in range what would you do there the moment the villagers saw your father's men approach they knew they were due that was where they fell back what who fell back where we could fall back if we're overwhelmed we'll reinforce it with whatever we can throw together get everyone in position we'll hang back for now they don't know the [ __ ] your father inflicted here the horror you failed to prevent [Music] ride to your posts signal when you spot the invaders you said that was where they fell back you were here when your father massacred the village it wasn't a massacre what do you call armed men slaughtering an unarmed village a village hiding armed fighters and their families the people who lived here ambushed our patrols set traps that named and killed the warriors slit their throats where they slept what did you expect you came here to kill us a friend of mine grew up in this village after the summer i left i found his body but it took me a week to find his head in all the mud i'm sorry denzel you're sorry do you have any idea what it's like to find your friend like that do you know how many lives your father destroyed too many if i could change that i would but you didn't others had to end this cruelty and i watched him die i could have saved him but i didn't why not they're here get to the horses they're coming get ready if the mongols overrun us we'll fall back here the group will stay to bolster these defenses fighting on the side of your father's killers what would he say [Music] boy [Music] [Applause] [Applause] that's all of them easy pickings right gin a good start fireworks on the way let's go [Music] this is just like the old days she's enjoying herself remembering how they slaughtered the samurai quickly let's radio welcome to the mongols there's a few drums of black powder on those carts you've been busy aim for the barrels [Music] little that's the last of them we held them off for now you'll never forget the sight so much blood the ground was soaked in it devastation all around you look what kazuma did the butcher quiet more fireworks to the west we can't keep this up forever let's go feeling all right yes keep moving you think the fallback defense is already people need more time we'll hold back the invaders as long as we can hold up fireworks we had lookouts posted here i don't see them it might be an ambush let's take a closer look they've captured the lookouts hang back i can sneak in surprise the mongols [Music] [Music] oh that's all of them untie them you'll be free soon i thought i was dead thank you all fireworks on all sides the eagle tries making its move [Music] there are too many of them and we're spread thin we're out of time everyone get to the horses we treat to the tower we'll face it there lead the way they need help [Music] hold the invaders here [Music] [Music] [Music] give chase cut them down [Music] so may your death benefit all beings [Music] may your death benefit all beings i've heard that before from my father's killer you're hearing things it's the eagle's poison say the prayer for yourself before i end your life do it on this blood-soaked ground where your father massacred hundreds he was trying to save lives you knew who i was what you did to my father you lied to my face you lied to yourself your father was my enemy not you how did someone so worthless defeat cosmos i don't know luck he slaughtered dozens of us before we brought him down broke his leg i think all i did was finish the job get on with it samurai not yet you killed my father by luring us into an ambush at senjog that's how we're going to kill the eagle we need more than the two of us talk to fune and meet me near the canyons we can't hide who you are anymore but if i tell fooney do it tell her i'm jinsakai she knows i fight for iki my actions prove it [Music] tell her i am not my father if i was you would be dead [Music] i sacrificed everything i knew to save our people you did nothing what if this never ends ah the light here reminds me of a song my mother would play how did that melody go keep going one step at a time it's an ambush bastards you pay for that [Music] [Music] [Music] on our walks my mother would regale me with funny stories about the cats that roamed the palaces in kyoto [Music] no other way to settle it [Music] i would pepper her with questions but soon enough it was time for book and practice my mother would bring me to the swordmaster gruff country samurai but i think she wanted something else for me are you lost without your father to guide you your path leads to madness and death [Music] i wasn't sure you'd show up wasn't sure you would either quinn i take it tenzo told you who i am he did sakai and if we weren't in the middle of a war you would both be gathering flies we won't survive the day with blades held to each other's necks first we stop the eagle then we'll settle this deal i came to hear your plan sakai how's the band of raiders supposed to take down an army of mongols the same way you defeated the samurai 15 years ago you lured my father into senjog took his life and forced the sakai clan to retreat we can do the same to the eagle tribe how do we get her attention she's hunting me if i provoke her she'll chase me into sanjo gorch where we'll be waiting to spring the ambush and send them to hell it could work we'll have to find the eagle first she's always on the move hunting new victims to poison i have scouts combing the island they'll find her when they do i'll get our attention not alone you won't any day now the eagle will find our refuge and burn it to ash if this is our best chance to stop her i'm going to make sure she takes our bait then it's settled tenzo see to the scouts i'll prepare the ambush i'll camp here until we're ready we have one shot to bring the eagle to ground make it count gin scout spotted the eagle's force it's funny in position the canyons are crawling with raiders we just have to lure the mongols to them we'll meet my scouts they're keeping an eye on the eagle's force when we attack i'll get her attention you said she's hunting you what does she want with a poison samurai she wants to make me one of her shermans what one of her followers at fort sucker said she wants to recruit me but she forced her poison on you the sacred medicine is poisonous to most but her shamans use it as a rite of passage are you still seeing visions yes they're getting worse i warned you this would only end in madness enzo over here the mongols are sweeping the island looking for the samurai is the eagle with them she called a halt and released some of her eagles to fly we weren't spotted let's get a better look look for the eagles helmet shouldn't be hard to spot that's her the eagle is here where i don't see her right there she sees us move in there [Music] no not now except my gift become my challenge your gift is poison refuse me and you will die just like your father damn it's the eagle got away look for her it was never here [Music] what happened the mongols were waiting for us but if the ego wasn't here and where is she where am i silent what place on this island calls to you where were we destined to meet again it can't be [Music] i underestimated the eagle you sure you didn't want to become her shaman offer us up to your new master i'm no traitor when i was imprisoned poisoned i thought the ego was someone else i told her about my father how you ambushed us at senjog so she knew your father died there then she learned you joined our fight first we were planning something big she's one step ahead but we can still win this desert the entire force is attacking they'll overwhelm funny where are you i know you're here face me god the bastards came out of nowhere what happened we'll explain later did you see the eagle she led the attack killed half my men we need to fall back to the refuge we won't get a second chance at this we have to bring down the eagle now you're as stubborn as one of my crew then let's go listen up we're hunting the eagle into the canyon it's too late the battle is lost you failed like you failed your fun do you remember how you let him die [Music] your mind is lost how do you know this battle is even real still with us i'm fine but when your father was desperate you healed you all right yes keep fighting good work keep hunting for the eagle how are you holding up i used to only hear her voice now i see her feel her presence maybe being here makes the visions more intense [Music] are you not tired lord suckas come i will give you peace and i will give you cold steel hold it together remember your talent your father's dying screams echoed off the canyon wall let me take away your pain i'll send you to hell uh [Music] [Music] the eagle is waiting east of here where my father was killed i'm not betting everything on your gut samurai you go east tenzo and i cover the other path no i'll go he needs me good luck to both of you with me run the mongols down meet me in the heart of your pain let me heal you damn it give me silence jin you need to turn back too late now this is the place where you killed my father the sacred medicine brought you here do you know why to end your reign of terror no to be healed for years you hid your pain the sacred medicine allows you to see it against my will your medicine is a weapon don't let the darkness take you chief let your spirit soar in the eternal blue sky i don't soar over my people i serve them even the people who killed your father yes even them what a waste handle the other stenzel i'll deal with the ego [Music] how can you fight you will die here like a coward [Music] before you understand hmm [Music] [Music] now i breathe [Music] [Music] face the judgment of your ancestors lord sakai father [Music] help me um [Music] [Music] we should have died here together like warriors i'm sorry i failed you father not me now clan my second name is tarnished the people here accuse us of terrible things sometimes what is necessary he's also terrible the actions i took were not easy but they needed to be done [Music] you did what was needed on the battlefield not at home i needed a father one lost your mother i was left with a son i didn't know how to help [Music] so i erase the samurai it's time jin [Music] do what is necessary rid our clan of shame and defeat avenge me [Music] no i will never be like you the way you lived was not my choice i knew death was not my fault [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] one day you face the judgment of your ancestors one yay may your death benefit all beings [Music] [Applause] [Music] now's your chance [Music] are you all right i'll live what about you still hearing her no i'm sorry so am i sounds like a celebration i bet the check on pune tell the good news go on i'll join you later don't wait too long [Music] um [Music] hiding in darkness [Music] my father struggled to rise free at last from life [Music] looks like the samurai wants a word with you both look well feeling better with the eagle gone nice work by the way same to you the eagle tribe will lose their foothold here if we keep fighting yeah that's funny he said we find me later sakai i could use the help of a samurai who knows how to keep a secret looks like you're healing up it only hurts when i laugh so i should be fine around you you only laugh at your own jokes anyway but i'll never swing up late like i used to no more robbing innocent merchants on the high seas how will you make yourself useful too many people here still suffer from the eagle's poison there's no cure but i can ease their pain maybe even help some recover like you the eagles medicine forced me to relive my father's death gave me another chance to avenge him what did you do i realized i didn't need revenge i've spent my life running from a dead man trying to live up to him blaming myself for his death hating myself for choosing to live so i turned my back on the past and put my guilt behind me and that cured you the darkness never leaves completely but it recedes maybe that's how to heal the others guide them through the memories help them face their fears i hope you're right years ago i could never have imagined saying this but i'm glad we met tensor never thought i'd do this either but thank you gene samurai bowing to a radar now i've seen everything [Music] [Music] you
