look just like Goku and he was a kid that's enough chitchat they're here yeah we're well looks like you've been expecting us you've got that right Oh what's an immediate to it here McKeon oh I get it it's been said that namekians possess extraordinary fighting skills as well as magical abilities you must be the one who created those Dragon Balls we've heard about know about the Dragon Balls that's the whole reason we came to this beauty planet now hand him over you may be an immediate but there's still only one of you this is gonna be like swatting away flies sorry to burst your bubble but I didn't create the Dragon Balls or anything else my specialty is destruction and if I'm a fly then just try and SWAT me very well let's see what the namekian and his little friends are capable of yeah looks like you and me are thinking the same thing Vegeta [Music] these guys look pretty tough huh it's the end and Cha Cha's with him hey guys so I relate Yamcha young Chuck you mean the person Poirot was talking about yep the one and only he must be Goku's kid well he definitely looks the part [Music] um nice to meet you my name is go on look at that a few more pipsqueaks have come to play relax

[Music] Goku humor me you wouldn't happen to be talking about Kakarot would you yeah so what's it to you ah just as I thought I guess the Dragon Balls revived him after all do you truly believe that he can save you after all he could barely handle a weakling like rabbits he's gotten stronger since then I'm sure of it he's gonna make you beg for mercy do you hear me he's gonna make you beg oh I wouldn't underestimate Goku if I were you oh yeah he's so tough then where the hell is he huh he'll be here my dad's definitely gonna come then I guess we'll just have to wait for him won't we three hours is all he gets and not a second longer three hours now there ain't no point in waiting around screw it I'm gonna have some fun nappa didn't you just hear me so sorry Vegeta okay guess I got a little carried away the big o for shaking in his boots the smaller guys the one we need to keep an eye on I'm sure of it come on Goku quit making us wait and get over here already come on show us just how much stronger you've become dad [Music] [Music] Goku where are you all that time for him not to show up hey you think we can make a break for it these guys mean business they plan on wiping out the entire planet dad piccolo you should get out of here as things start to get hairy what do you mean you die call me dice to write if that happens then we can kiss the Dragon Balls goodbye I don't need your sympathy just focus on winning right yeah mr. piccolo are you go ku we need your help [Music] don't have much time left [Music] [Music] time's up too bad I guess Kakarot was too scared to show his face finally you twerps are in for a world of pain it's it's incredible and it's heading this way Wow you're right is huge and it feels kind of familiar holy Goku could have this much energy jack where vegeta are these Punk's telling the truth we'll find out soon enough whether this is actually Kakarot or not power level 5000 no no way you scatter must be busted or something nappa hurry up and kill the riffraff there can be a real pain if they team up with Kakarot but what about the Dragon Balls forget about them I've got a better idea that namekians home planet should have Dragon Balls even more powerful will do far better heading there instead don't you understand if Kakarot actually lives then that legend has to be true I'll handle them until my dad gets here if you die will definitely lose call me and the dragon boss a run like you can't handle them all alone handle me huh this kid over here is a real riot [Music] [Music] all you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here

Vegeta I'm sensitive crazy energy over there I'm picking up two massive sources of power there's two even bigger ones and what's smaller too those numbers don't add up wait somebody died close he'll pathetic defeat the great Demon King Piccolo will go down like this protecting a little brat like you it's laughable I believe you and your dad it's stupid softness rubbed off on me but go on I I want you to know is the only real friend the only real friend I ever had [Music] these past few months they really weren't half bad you better not go on [Music] it appears I'm not long for this world but but at least it seems piccolo has finally surpassed me I I can die happy knowing that wasn't planning on killing him just yet but whatever I can't wait to see the look on Kakarot face when he sees his little twerp squashed like a bug [Music] huh that piccolo tension Hana it Yamcha Tatsu commie they're all gone I'll let you get away with this what are you looking at Punk you got something to say I'm gonna pound you into a pulp there's no way a small fry like you stands a chance against the mighty nappa [Music] like me like you getting better damnit hey John downturn nobody like you Napa that's more than enough I'll take care of him since it's a direct order I'll let Vegeta handle you but I'm not done playing just yet oh no you don't [Music] I don't think he can fight anymore now take him

everyone back first I'll take petit again [Music] this ought to be a good spot no people are animals of sight i Saiyans are worth as warriors as measured and judged at birth those with no potential IQ are sent to inferior planets like this thrown away and forgotten like the garbage you are with enough hard work and training even garbage can surpass the elite that's quite a sense of humor you've got

me this favor let him live so I can fight him again someday okay fine I guess if anybody's got the right to ask for that it's you I mean if it weren't for you this whole planet would be toast but if we're gonna do this then you gotta blow this guy away with everything you got when he comes back you got it you're going to regret this yeah you won't have another miracle to save you next time enjoy

saw piccolo and said something about him being Adam eken they said the namekian home planet planet namek should even have more powerful Dragon Balls then then that means if we head over to that dynamic place or whatever we we might be able to get our hands on some Dragon Balls [Music] hey it's me Goku you know in the fight with Vegeta he lost a lot of our friends and with piccolo gone we
