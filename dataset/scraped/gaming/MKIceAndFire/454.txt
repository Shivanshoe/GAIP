encode your dna [Music] [Music] define your genetic structure choose a genetic resilience choose your first style pick your main color saboteur sentinel dead i chosen that'll work here's somebody with a troubled past drawn into the spotlight of a story that's already begun we're already at a crossroads choosing a path in life is that fork in the road where you make a choice or simply stop living but for you it's not only a crossroad but a choice a reflection of your key the primal energy that flows through everything allow me to introduce myself i'm the dark side of you your inner voice to be precise an echo of the balance and consequence of your actions as you move forward so glad you realize who you really are let's keep to the bright and better path moving on you can't contradict yourself like that you made the right choice to begin with why would you change your mind because you can't deny what's deep within your heart sometimes a thought is just a thought in the end it's the way you act that counts but remember this is just the beginning of the end eventually it'll be my way or the highway right is always right stories of death on the bodies left behind a reminder that we're at the mercy of nature and the one that preys on others do you remember the beast that shattered your family or did you choose to forget you turned your back on our world and got lost in your own meanwhile the predator only grew stronger you better make a run for it this is not the time no place to end this story this time it was best to run and live to fight another day let us hope you're ready for it when it comes [Music] the predator isn't the only threat the wildlife started to mutate when the end of days began and the tree of life started to die [Music] [Music] so hot metal [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] all right one hand after the other the oil sludge is everywhere for most it only means death but some have adapted to the new environment evolution has its ways [Music] so uh that will come in handy cracker dude right in the face so foreign so one down soon [Music] [Music] all that exercise helps [Music] uh look an emergency box from the once was a rare sight that pipe looks weak the claw bar should come in handy whoa it's time to find a way out of this place no really i mean it's the morks produce biomatter in their multi-organ that they shed under distress lobs that affect the cellular coding strands of any living being when abs including you [Music] good wonder who put it here [Music] [Music] toxinol built vessels called arcs to save themselves from the impending doom but was it too late it is only from the flight logs of the single arc they left behind that we know other arcs traveled through the sky and beyond it seems those that came before us never lost hope in finding a new home for their kind god [Music] just a few moves left make them count there are few records of the chain of events that led to the big apocalypse eons ago but it's clear the world wasn't prepared for how recklessly the toxin oil corporation would make its mark on the world their rare earth mining and nuclear industries generated tons of waste and without consideration for the future they dumped it all in landfills until they ran out of space that's when they made the big mistake they began dumping the toxic waste in the surf just off the coast instead assuming that it would sink and decay with time and they were right but no one was prepared for what was about to unfold once in the surf the radiation interfered with the genetics of the wildlife and created bizarre mutations in their offspring it had an inconceivable impact on biodiversity and the entire ecosystem the world as they knew it crumbled as nature retaliated it would never be the same again and what remained of it became ours [Music] the sound of spark metal going pew pew is never a good thing it's coming from behind that door a warning label the box looks like a potential brain melt it's going to take a bit of puzzling to short-circuit the door just a few moves left make them count there you go [Music] [Music] the wheeled one is outnumbered you'd better help him out envy oh foreign that's the last of them let's talk to the wheeled one before backup arrives [Music] oh he wants to thank you for taking his side against the scavengers he sounds familiar you just can't figure out why he presents himself as out of date he knows he's way overdue but he hasn't given up he doesn't seem surprised that you don't recognize him you were just a child back then the night everything changed [Music] there have been rumors of a one-eyed ronin seen outside the great wall and he's happy to see it's true the legend of the one-eyed child that grew up as an outcast is old and sad yeah the child could have been anyone but the evil it had fled had left a mark a facial scar to remember the past it's a scar you're covering under that eye patch isn't it but he would have recognized you anyways you look exactly like your mumma there's no doubt you're the child and that what looper lupin did to your village your mumma and popsy was the beginning of the end he says it has taken you a long time to bring the past back up to the present to find your way back but he's grateful you have it was after the attack that the unity fell apart your mumma's disciples divided and formed tribes as a reaction to the blight that had fallen upon the land wherefore whereby the impending threat of the world eaters bringing down the tree of life is ever so close he also worries about the jagne tribe that's actively working for a doomsday and purging of the world had it not been for the tree of life no one would have survived he hopes you at least remember the tree [Music] oh [Music] as it's a bit of a hike here from the village he wonders if your mumma knows you are here sounds like he thinks she does despite your heart growing dark there's nothing as powerful as a moomer's love [Music] he understands why you came all the way out here to see them the potato people [Music] the potato people or nano are a wonder somehow interlinked with this little tree here fueling its source of life [Music] you might be right like potatoes they're packed with energy an excellent source of tea [Music] the nano prefer to hide in glitter grass he says you should get over there and ruffle it see if you can make one come out of hiding [Music] [Music] you found one you should be proud they don't come out for everyone [Music] the nano's key energy is just what the pension needs to complete its cycle and grow into a tree of life [Music] the small tree you saw up there where you met will eventually grow into a tree of life and start giving back to nature it'll be the heart of the land [Music] you need to support the tree for a long time to come the only way it'll grow tall is with the burst of key released from the nano as they become one with the tree [Music] you'll need a neck to catch the knowledge and he wants you to use his but asks you to be gentle the nano are sensitive beings an embodiment of key the primal energy [Music] [Music] go catch the mono with you handle that net like you've never done anything else he's impressed he's grateful for all the help he can get there's lots of nano out there that need to be guided to the roots of the pensa tree they're hiding in the glitter grass that mostly grows deep inside damp caves where they draw mineral from the natural rock [Music] one day he hopes the tree will have grown tall enough to sustain the world [Music] but today your focus is getting this one to become one with the tree [Music] yes [Music] now that you've seen the nano's connection with the tree with your own eyes you have no reason to doubt from this day on he'll make nurturing the pencil into a tree of life a life goal not only for our villages sake but for all of us everyone [Music] one day the land won't be as peaceful not [Music] you can already see the effects from how reckless those before us acted and unless something changes we're doomed the land won't survive the side effects of the old world's industrial advances [Music] he says you'd better hurry back to the village before your mumma comes looking for you you did good here today [Music] that's not true she's the reason there's still unity and the only one strong enough to keep the six one foo disciples disciplined he lost you there for a while but no memory is alone it's part of a trail you can follow ah [Music] he says he remembers every single day he devoted to growing the tree of life but now he's afraid it might be in vain the tree started to die when the end of days began and it wasn't long after that that the world eaters arrived the genetic evolution that occurred after the apocalypse the toxinol corporation inflicted on the land set the world eaters dna into overdrive [Music] his friend gizmo is working on a mechdon and needs help defeating the jumbo puff at the end of the west route whiz is still repairing his octopod to confront the murk puff that dwells deep down under the surface at the end of the northwest route noco has tamed the majority and is preparing to take on the hoof puff at the end of the east route [Music] finally goop is almost done with the goo glide a machine able to ride the waves of the surf all the way out to the porchy puff at the end of the route to the southeast out of date says his friends are gearing up to stop the world eaters there's one at the end of each route the road ahead won't be easy but he's counting on your support his friends aren't strong enough to end this on their own he wants you to understand that you'll all die if the tree isn't saved [Music] his friends have prepared something specific for each world eater the mechton the octopod the majut and the goo glide are almost ready to ride regardless you'll meet again once you've played your part in the tribe war and the situation with the world eaters wow [Music] you're getting the hang of it [Music] quickest way out is through the roof where they came in and the rope looks strong enough to climb [Music] know that the tree of life is dying its days are numbered without help it can't endure the environmental change and the salt from the world eaters [Music] so [Music] a signpost maps it out for the cartographically challenged [Music] let's see so that must be the world eater that chewed off out of dates leg you'll need a hat trick to bring that down the world eaters have made their marks on our world over time that's not the first nor the last village it'll leave in its wake look a survivor glad to see someone made it out alive [Music] he's heard the stories about the terror inflicted by the world eaters to other enclaves but never expected one to come all the way here he worries there won't be much left to save if this continues even if the tree of life survives the attack [Music] he doesn't know what your connection is to this place but something tells him you've stayed true to your heart [Music] anyway he needs help and says it's by your actions you'll be judged not by your intentions he's grateful for that you still seem to have a spark of light in you that's a spark of light in you what's there to like about light it hurts to look at not as much as it hurts to look at you always making this personal and you're always trying to pretend it's not there's out of date again he must have missed something important out of date says you will make a better stand against the world eaters with the support of a tribe and there are two nearby the myriad tribe is likely to be a good match as they act on the understanding of the greater good and have a code of honor regardless of who you choose it won't be easy as the conflict between the tribes is worse than ever teetering on the brink of war the myriad's conviction to stop the world eaters began when the leviathans rose from the depths of the surf siding with the myriad's movement for wholeness in a fragmented world might seem like the logical thing to do but is it the right thing one thing's certain though destiny arrives all the same [Music] the japanese tribe only ever had one conviction to bring balance to the world by wiping out the weak they believe a cleansing is necessary to restore the world and want to let the world eaters bring down the tree of life but siding with chutney isn't necessarily a bad thing fate will find a way [Music] out of date says someone needs to break the stalemate and shift the balance of power to either japanese or myriad's side he believes the tribes sifus myriad especially will listen to you and expect you to pay at least one of them a visit and play your part he can sense you share myriad's view on the world the myriad would embrace someone willing to fight against the tyranny of the jagme out of date we'll be waiting for you beneath the tree of life if you lose track of what you need to do regardless you'll meet again once you've played your part in the tribe war and the situation with the world eaters so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] think of all the things you can cut with this so [Music] three [Music] [Music] foreign another fork in the road it's either the tunnel or the motor bridge wouldn't it be it's unusual that natural tunnels like this still exist most of them got flooded uh your key energy is all used up uh this area was beautiful before the tribe war began look at it now it's a war zone oh that's the myriad tribe's fortress will they be friends or foe you should head up there that way you'll know let's see it's a beaten path to that door if you go there you'd better make an entrance [Music] says they're wary of strangers says the sifu is popular these days as the tribe grows stronger by the day he suggests you let the sifu do the talking when you meet he prefers it that way [Music] of the greater good and a code of honor they believe uniting the tribes is the only way to restore the peace the seafood is convinced that defeating the world eaters and saving the tree of life is the only way to make the world a better place he welcomes you to the myriad fort and introduces himself as the tribe's sifu hello but he was hoping you'd show up the news of a vigilante ronin on crusade crossing the great wall through the cracking bunker 101 has preceded you all the ghosts are gonna hide the wall that separates them from the other side the wasteland you came from he guesses the time spent there just left a blank space in your memory as empty and barren as the wasteland itself he's convinced you've returned for a reason and is glad you chose to come here there's something about your spirit that sparks memories of you as a kiddling he can still sense you're kind-hearted the sifu says sometimes one memory can make another come to life he hasn't thought about your mumma for ages even though she taught him a lot he was one of the original wong fu disciples originally it consisted of unarmed combat and the six weapons the boomerang the shuriken the bow the staff the nanchok and the hook and chain says it's time to set the past aside at least for now unrest is sweeping the land and there are rivals in all directions myriad wants unity between the tribes their goal is understanding of the greater good and establishing a code of honor if you believe there's some good in everyone there's still hope for tomorrow you'll unite the tribes and defeat the world eaters to save the tree of life [Music] he was hoping you'd join them you understand that there's no harm in doing good to others was waiting for something to tip the balance in their favor and with you by their side he's confident you can unite the other tribes the one you should coerce first is the jagni tribe the japanese tribe may believe that fear and hatred will lead them to domination a vanquisition of the tribes and destruction of the tree of life won't be the restart they want it's just an end to everything [Music] their kin have run out of options and found themselves backed into a corner even those who desire peace have been forced to prepare for war you need to take the struggle to the enemy or the enemy will bring it to you when survival is threatened there's no other option left but war he wants you to focus these are the new rival outposts your tribe needs to take control of he says you'll regret not being on their side the only way you'll learn their secrets and the tribe weapon now is if you defeat him and that will never happen you both have gentle minds so they want to wage a gentle war a war that bonds as much as it breaks tells you not to be afraid your fate cannot be taken from you claim the rival outposts and earn the right to wield the tribe weapon once you've dealt with the rivals outposts you'll challenge their sifu to unite their tribe with yours and let your kin share land again they passed the point of no return as their words lost power and see no other way forward than using violence to combat violence seeing you brings back his memories of the old village myriad wants unity between the tribes their goal is understanding of the greater good and establishing a code of honor he remembers your kind and unselfish soul and consents you still have it in you the will to do good anyway the memories you make with your family are strong and can sometimes come to life passing the old village on your way to the first rival outpost might help [Music] he can't blame you for not remembering but he can sense the stillness of something lost glad to see you out and moving about in the daylight says you should take care offers you extraordinary prices for extraordinary things looking for a bargain [Music] [Music] better beware that's a mump up ahead they were hit hard by evolution the wonky ones especially deformed so [Music] ready to dive back so what time is lost on this place but it evokes a tingling sensation there's something special about it drawing you closer [Music] let's see as time passes memories fade and sometimes feelings change it's not about who you were it's about who you become this story is far from over echoes of a long lost past like whispers in the wind [Music] here's someone who takes each day as it comes [Music] he asks how you are today [Music] then he wants you to know that if you find yourself going through bad times you should just keep going [Music] he wonders where you've been he hopes you've been out at the lake practicing your swimming technique he understands hard that's why your mumma only has six disciples doing just one thing helps you get more done in less time he thinks you should really know how to swim by now [Music] why not there's no better time to do what needs to be done than right now he says that wasn't too bad was it [Music] he says a feeling that you're going to drown is a great reminder of the need to learn how to swim but you need practice lots of practice [Music] he's sure you'll have to face the consequences of that sooner or later anyway you just need more time in the surf that's the only way you'll ever learn how to swim you can never try too hard judging by your mumma's look it seems you forgot something you promised you'd train with her before the sun goes down it's time to go you know you can't make up for lost time you should know practice makes perfect [Music] she says nobody is perfect that's why you practice she'll see you at the village square a she'll be waiting for you there will be a surprise for you at the end too here's another familiar face with lights on his mind asks how you're feeling today [Music] he's learned that things are never as bad as they seem you'll feel better in the morning he was hoping you could help him pick up some scrap for a thingamajig he's working on [Music] he's happy to hear that from someone that's a part of the coming generation you owe it to yourself to protect the environment you should look for things that are recyclable it shouldn't take you too long to find some [Music] he wonders what usefulness you found [Music] fruit typo he says every little thing comes he can work wonders with almost anything and asks if you know how to upcycle [Music] that's the spirit you can't make a difference unless you get your hands dirty he'd love to teach you to upcycle and the scrap you found would be a good start [Music] you did well but he can't help but wonder why you decided to craft a weapon [Music] he appreciates those able to deliver a sharp remark he understands but hopes you won't be needing it anytime soon [Music] he thinks mastering the six weapon styles of wong fu is more than enough for anyone don't know he's looking forward to seeing what you'll make next it seems you have a talent for this it looks like she's starting to lose her patience you know she doesn't like waiting for you she wants to see you on the village square right away [Music] then you've got a good excuse you share a responsibility to prevent hardship on nature and the environment it's your future she wants you to grow up and start thinking for yourself you really need to find yourself before she's gone she won't live forever you know that but she intends to make the most of every day she gets especially the ones you share together [Music] you've always followed your own path but this time she needs you to follow her [Music] then start by meeting her on the village square and take it from there she knows you're a free spirit always on the move like the wind they look determined better watch out [Music] he asks you to stop right there and wonders where you think you're going he says that it's not too late for you to turn back though there's no way they'll let you pass he wants to know who you think you are you'll have to face pain at some point he offers to help you get it over with [Music] hmm she asks if you're hurt what happened [Music] she's there for all disciples that's her commitment a sifu and when she needs them they're there for her and each other the most important thing is that you're okay it's time to focus on your training now [Music] can't see she suggests that you forgive your enemies nothing annoys them more [Music] [Music] here's someone close to heart doing what he does best seeing you always puts a smile on your popsies face he wants to know how you're feeling [Music] he asks if you could help him too before you leave for training [Music] you'll talk to her sure but you know she wants you to accept responsibility for your own actions and future he suggests you get going and find him gadgets and ideas for how you can upcycle some old fabrics [Music] [Music] he's curious to see what you found [Music] he's gathered so much over the years and it's hard to remember everything nothing's wrong with his memory it's just short [Music] are proof that you tried and that counts that you failed this time doesn't mean you can't succeed the next he says it's about time you learn how and offers to teach you starting with the scrap you found the style might be too edgy for his taste but he looks sharp on you [Music] agrees at least that [Music] he's looking forward to seeing what you'll make next it seems you have a talent for this [Music] [Music] it's about time you got here [Music] she says she is eager to get started you don't have much time left before the sun goes down do i move andrew but there's enough time left for repetition and you need it training dummies don't hit back [Music] wants you to prove that with some practice first [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] that's all she's ever asked of you [Music] been working on a present for you with the help of gizmo and whiz ah you should go see him and find out what it is you've deserved it says he's always thought so well of you just like her [Music] catchy can't see your mumma says she's never seen an apparatus as green as this little thing it's wonderful [Music] figuring that out is half the phone [Music] a piece of scraptronics like this has built in old world tech that makes it a potent communication device it's called an automaton and it's hardwired to your dna it'll follow wherever you go and see whatever you see you're lucky to have such a fine helper with you your mumma says you look tired no wonder it's been a long day she's so happy you made the most of it rest and you'll find strength for tomorrow [Music] nothing could stop loopalooping from setting the world on fire [Music] your mumma urges you to blaze a trail a burnt kiddling will learn to dread fire that's just adding fuel to the flames give it a last burst and you'll make it this time there's no escape she can hear him coming he wants to destroy her the time to fight is coming whether she's ready for it or not whatever happens you need to know she loves you and everything she's done has been to protect you your popsie and those she was chosen to lead do i moved she tells you to stay back this is her fight it has nothing to do with you history has finally caught up with her she loves how brave you are but she can't be worrying about you while she fights this is her fight here it comes the past coming to hold the present you must go through fire and water to make it out of here your mumma says you can make it if you believe in it where she goes you go blood is thicker than water [Music] you're in deep surf don't make waves the surf goes where it wants to go it'll take you to the shore as long as you go with the flow [Music] uh [Music] [Music] death is not to be feared by one who has lived life with a pure heart a part of her will live on in you the creature is hungry for more nothing is going to stand in its way now if a sacrifice is made for someone else it's not lost but passed on to the next life must go on real sacrifice comes from love and necessity when all other options are exhausted the ultimate test of consciousness is the willingness to give up anything to save what you truly care about what you do for yourself dies with you what you do for your kin remains and makes you immortal in their memory [Music] as the moment fades and is lost the only thing that remains is loneliness it doesn't mean you'll forget your past it simply means you need to move on [Music] quick work for a shiny blade the tribe's caught a fluffy hulk better watch out it's no pet they couldn't keep it down fluff hulk's on the loose [Music] thank you all fired up you're feeling mighty what's up you gave them no choice but to take it down even though they plan to take the fluff hulk out to the far fnaki leaves and let it go me my keller chakun they've received news a ronin had strengthened their ranks and were looking forward to meeting you out a group of myriad crusaders already headed out to japanese mercadorpos outpost and are waiting for you there you should hurry there and help them best the outpost you complete them from this point on the myriad is unbroken toxinol was something called a corporate juggernaut and our world still bears the marks of the massive ecological catastrophes they inflicted upon the land the apocalypse they caused was the end of days for their world but for us it was simply a beginning look an emergency box from the old days when you needed to pack a punch to survive wow bet that knock makes a tight fist so uh tunnels like this still carry echoes from the past can you hear it this a smartphone [Music] [Music] so so so uh that noticeboard filled with the leftovers of used to be once you're getting close to one of those old toxinol brick towns pay attention the toxinol corporation made this place and then just threw it away when they were done with it toxin all never cared about the waste as long as they didn't have to pay to clean it up there must be a track somewhere in this brick town just hope it's not buried [Music] [Music] let's see [Music] so you made it through another long night [Music] up for grabs [Music] [Music] [Music] at least you're not coming out of this empty-handed [Music] [Music] looks like the frey sparker's knobs need to be in sync if you want to get the hardware working [Music] just a few moves left make them count it's a fry sparkler mindset boom you got something it's not exactly what you wanted but you got it right away [Music] heroes are only heroes for others but they do the work or their heroes to no one [Music] that's interesting [Music] [Music] you found the track amazing it wasn't destroyed so much of this place was just discarded lucky the track somehow made it when toxin all abandoned the place it fell apart fast not too many like living in a ruin hole like this the tracks moved on from bricktown and you should too at [Music] [Music] resources are too few and scarce at least for now there's something special about that blade you found the whereabouts the deepest darkest forest in the land sometimes hard to see for all the trees [Music] so [Music] oh give your eyelines a chance to adjust to the door [Music] new smarts for you [Music] oh that's a resource totem a monument left behind by those that picked scrap trying to keep the area clean glad to see some wood scrap there so that's a jack knee tribe outpost [Music] right between the eyes your favorite the daytime makes it harder for things to sneak up on you [Music] is glad you're no true-blooded jagni and says how embarrassing it would be to be related to a do-gooder like you oh understand you have other [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so gross this place stinks [Music] [Music] keep your powder dry [Music] [Music] [Music] calamity climb climb [Music] so mercado's outpost a jagne tribe stronghold the forest is wonderful [Music] let's see [Music] says it's time to set the outpost free inflict as little damage as possible as you make your way through to the rival captain if you can you should try to convince the captain to give up the outpost and join your cause [Music] they're ready to enter the outpost when you are every step you take towards your end goal will bring you closer to a better world here's the first line of defense [Music] oh that's a bomb lover and hit the spot corrected that twirly wheel works that drain pipe spin the twirly wheel and open that drain everything's clocking together every lock has a key keep going that cage is holding a helper [Music] [Music] uh they never lost hope you'd come but weren't sure if they'd last long enough to see it says the tribe's been hard on them wants revenge on those who caged them but trust you'll take care of it huh foreign a sharpshooter the scaffolding looks unstable [Music] better stay clear of the red ray here's the second line of defense uh [Music] timber better big bump will bring it down off the light a barrel shoot smack it to get a barrel out of it then hit it toward the gate and blast it that looks slowly shoot it and watch it blow not too close though you're in almost there [Music] the outpost belongs to your tribe now he says you made them weaker but they won't give up your sifu thanks you your tribe is growing stronger [Music] don't come says you did a great job capturing the outpost you've earned the privilege of carrying the tribe's weapon figures the honor belongs to the tribe too out of date says he's doing his best to keep up but from what he can tell it seems you're making progress with the tribe conflict he had a feeling you'd get along with the myriad tribe but it remains to be seen what the future holds for your alliance [Music] you seem to share the same values as the myriad tribe you both have the same optimistic outlook on life but out of date emphasizes that solving the tribe conflict won't matter unless you help make a stand against the world eaters that doesn't sound good out of dates forebodings are justified the jumbo puff needs to be taken care of he says the time has come to confront the jumbo puff at the end of the west route the what gizmo is working on making his mechton strong enough to endure the oxygen-deprived dead zone all the way out to the world eater wherefore where where you should get over there and see what you can do to help [Music] so he knows things that you need to know the rival tribe still has two outposts left it's up to you to change that the tree remains intact but you must all make a change to save it one thing we'll be around when you return thinking he knows things that you need to know says you'll meet again [Music] [Music] [Music] claims gizmo crafted your automaton feels like you should find him and thank him says talking [Music] never know what's hiding out in the dark [Music] a flush stool from the back in time it's an apparatus that sink sunks yellow juice and brown bobs let's try out the brush away see if you can off chase some drip droppings seems like the tighteners on the piping need to be unturned correctly to drain the flush stool [Music] just a few moves left make them count that's the kind of trouble you really want to wash away makes you look smarter [Music] so no one's going to see you coming in the dark the board mainly has posts from those that used to work at the chug yard back in the days gone they don't make much sense these days not much more to say about the board but gizmo is holed up in the under yard here working on that mektong of his the toxinol corporation used to run chugger chuggers out of here big machines on rails with smokestacks that fouled the air they can carry you anywhere you like well anywhere that they go to and then you can leg it from there you're on the right track keep your eyes open so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] this box once tailed a chugga chugga now it's just off track look at that right in the chug yard follow the rails and you'll find all sorts of little treasures scattered all over the place of course not but they get you closer to wherever you might want to go good work finding that track they can teach you so much about the world keep looking for more tribes always scavenging for strap and the yard has plenty to go around but they should have stuck to looting instead of playing around with sprockets uh oh [Music] go [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well what do you know busy ram banging the door this is your chance let's see what we all share the same destiny destruction or survival yes you can do anything the sky's the limit now let's take this back to earth wow you really took that all the way down to the end in flames that's the good stuff [Music] it's a wonder some of these up and downs still work yes they built machines better in the past the spent nuclear fuel the toxinol dumped in the surf had detrimental effects on the marine habitats while the overflowing landfills contaminated the groundwater combined this sent their world hurtling on an inevitable road to ruin [Music] i need to brush up on my wando but i have a feeling he believes it was you that caused the bang at the yard oh and he says he knows you you used to call him gizmo he gave you the oil greased hands when he taught you how to up cycle your body gizmo remembers you as a nice kiddling and he can still sense the warmth of your good heart but gizmo says how you experience a memory can be different you know the story but sometimes the truth it brings is personal it carries so much hate and its insatiable hunger has only increased over the years since it claimed revenge on your parents [Music] gizmo says he also has re-memories from the long gone but unlike you he doesn't think of the past for it's gone he understands history made looper looping a big part of your past your present and soon your future you still believe there's some good in everyone you still have hope for tomorrow he says you should know that what's meant to be will always find a way but history shouldn't consume you gizmo encourages that you should forgive but never forget it will provide some comfort to your soul and keep the memory of lost loved ones in your that heart wait no bright light blinds it's it's dangerous i've got all the cold sick burns you need dark oh do you have to insult me over this i don't have to but i want to would like to know if you ever doubt the choices you made on the path that brought you to this point would you have been happier going in a different direction supposes that's all any of us can do hard to believe the world is actually going to survive just seemed impossible till now grateful to you for coming back and doing your best to change things you were the only chance they had wonders if you liked working with the myriad they always seem so centered and so seeking [Music] everyone does they seem unusually dedicated to finding them but that's not important now gizmo says it's taken a long time to bring the past up to the present and where you go from here is up to you you need to set the past aside at least for now he can't leave the under yard as he has no protection against the vacuum in the dead zone so you need to salvage scrap to upcycle the mechton starting with the old crate outside your body you should return when you've retrieved the scrap there's no time to waste if you want to make the mechton strong enough to fight the jumbo puff [Music] it's the part of the land that suffered most from the apocalypse it's deprived of oxygen making it next to impossible for anything but creatures that were most contorted by the contamination [Music] so there are places up ahead far worse than this they're short of breath and death to this zone better take care he who half breathes half lives [Music] [Music] that's the leftover you're looking for what wait [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] shout about it later [Music] he says that's enough to get the mechdom functional you'll have an engine a fuel soaker a gun and a gathering net but no armor nor enough oxygen supply [Music] he made a suction device so the mekton can use the black tar as an instant refuel you can also use it to clear oily goo puddles so you can pass and access hard to get to areas he's been working on another project for the mekton a cannon but it needs ammunition and by that he means the scripts he says if they're trained right they'll turn into a distraction for the jumbo puff the best way to find scripts is to go talk to moog he knows the ins and outs of every breathing thing left alive after the apocalypse unfortunately this means you'll have to venture farther out into the dead zone than moog's camp on the steep depot once you find moog you'll be able to give you directions to where you'll find scripts it's a little feisty and tough critter a perfect for a live ammunition if you ask him [Music] [Music] time to walk on your own legs you look like you've been doing this your whole life getting that much closer to perfect [Music] the grease monkey's mech phone is built sturdy just like himself can you imagine how this place used to look before the dead oil flowed might want to hold your breath before you head any further you're about to witness the breathtaking vistas of what's known as the dead zone uh so yes too thin here right out uh [Music] uh [Music] go [Music] uh this mechton is much more graceful than it looks that over there is steeper depot the cliffside that mood hangs onto [Music] let's see this one's impressed to see you out here he figured you'd be dead by now not many are as tough and clever as you must be [Music] [Music] choosing what to kill and what to spare are the most important decisions you'll make you might have a steady aim but you need to be sure that you pick your targets with care it's hard to make those life or death decisions for others but someone's got to do it otherwise they'll do it themselves and you know they'll miss [Music] [Music] says it's wild that the world seems to be coming back but he supposes that means more monsters for him to shoot [Music] wonders why you work so hard to keep things alive bullets help thin the herd instead [Music] says you should give up on working with the stubborn myriad he keeps trying to put out their lights and they keep putting up new ones [Music] says they keep the monsters away he needs them closer not farther but enough of that right [Music] he says the wildlife nature has changed and turned against us instincts of survival took over when the world changed he's not sure about their veggie diet anymore and if it's changed who knows what it's done with the chemical composition of their body output [Music] right now though he feels he's come to a point where he's got a pretty clear idea on the whereabouts of monsters both tall and short says as big as they are the world is bigger to find where they are you need to see where they've been mooc says you must learn to walk before you can run it takes practice before you can call yourself a monster hunter [Music] fortunately for you he can help he understands you need to start off with something small before you go big there's no better place to start than a squip cave hunting down a couple of these little critters for yourself should keep you on your toes [Music] says you stick to the haunting and shots present themselves later [Music] foreign you feel brightheaded now wait it's the strip hole up place is just filled with critters oh why walk on your own legs a hero has to stand on its own solid [Music] once the volatilization from the nuclear waste evaporated a volatile gas rose through the soil and infested structures even toxinol's own buildings so in a way they caused their own death [Music] [Music] don't forget the past learn from it oh idea go knock the lid off that sludge truck it'll fill the place up and you can get up to that entrance there yes hold on to it [Music] looks like this a crit uh you need to line up the switches so they match [Music] good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework now you're ready to ventilate your boat they can't come soon enough blades screaming beware uh in the old world roads like this really led somewhere now most of them lead to disaster take matters back into your own hands everyone's going to hear you coming you need to line up the switches so they match just a few moves left make them count good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework everything is at stake these are awesome [Music] he says that's enough scripts to sustain the mekton's claw crane cannon with infinite ammunition well done it's not his cleanest invention so far but it gets the job done use it to suck up gooey oil puddles in the mekton's way so you can pass [Music] gizmo's made vehicles before to confront the jumbo puff himself but failed but this time it's different the mekton will be strong enough to do the job [Music] it's time to put a stop to the world eater now otherwise he fears the damage it's caused to the tree already will be too much to handle he asks you to not even think about taking on the jumbo puff on foot you will need the mekton to do the job take his word for it there's time to improve the mechdon before you confront the puff there are more wreck boxes out in the dead zone with gear you should be able to equip the mechton with on your own welcome typo he sure you remember enough of what he taught you about upcycling to fit some scrunky gear to the mechdon on your own don't know gizmo wants to help if he can oh god wonders why you can't see how pointless all your efforts are the japanese built everything they have from what they could find in the woods says you should take it easy gizmo wants to help if he can [Music] says that says he misses your mother because she was more than a teacher she was a friend wouldn't be surprised if you met again gizmo wants to help if he can glad you're wise enough to work during the day okay says your piece of junk would be worth more polished up and shiny [Music] says you're welcome back [Music] [Music] [Music] you
