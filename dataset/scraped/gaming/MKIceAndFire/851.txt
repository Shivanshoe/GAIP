about you how did you come to live in england i wish i had a more intriguing story for you i came from sun sao far from here for no real reason curiosity i suppose this is not an exotic story a young woman excited by the prospect of travel granted passage on a trading boat do you miss your home yes often i intend to return one day or perhaps cook some friends and family to join me here but i am in no hurry well you're most welcome here oh i should soon have a few spices from the east to add to our feasts as much as i love your hospitality your food is well you are doing your best don't be a stranger what is it you do here again when you hunt any animal bring it here for a trade and if you get something really special i'm happy to mount it that said though i can't do much until you build me a place to work it won't do tanning hides on makeshift tables and dirt say hi to petra if you see her but yes it happens right here my father told me once that all a good army needs is bread water and an accurate map axes and shields are beautiful as well but i think your father is onto something yes he was simplifying of course you'd need clothes and rest as well and good company of course not as pithy when you say it like that no ah glad to see you made it gerbette thanks to sigurd he was a good guide in even better company he told me some incredible stories the best ones were about you hopefully nothing too embarrassing there were a few gems not to interrupt davor but what have led chestershire the alliance is one the sons of ragnar are friends to our clan glad to hear it well done to you both avor a word of note someone has set up shop outside a trader i believe i met him redder a strange young man but somehow charming he will make for fine company i think i look forward to knowing him better you have not been long in england have you i see by this map you have barely scratched mercier give it time little lord wessex untouched northumbria baron you still have much to see yes it is a work in progress word of our growing settlement has reached outside ears so have a look around you may see a few new faces i want to see the alliance tell me about grande britsa a force of danes called the summer army by the saxons is camped north of grander bridge at some ruins across the river we should curry favor with their leaders because my scouts did not meet them in person so i can say little for the state of their army consider this a starting point i will leave right away good and may the blessings of freyja follow be careful out there admitted elvis i am the superior wartsmith admit to a falsehood i would sooner square a circle what is happening here holger wishes to prove that flighting is a lesser art i am correcting him it is unrefined unpalatable unpleasant i could beat you without a lick of practice fat is not so you thick-headed avor care to judge a flight thing i would happily judge brothers show me what you have i will begin there's a skin deep resemblance twixt holger and me for inside he's just hot air and bad poetry well in all but our talent we're certainly twins it should be no surprise to see which of us wins not bad now hear this um you see flighting is simple so hearken to me look anyone can do it it's so easy but the true challenge in life is to do something more like writing sagas painting pictures and and um lore yes lore there what do you think ava alves is the clear winner hogger i should have expected no less from you avor you have no ear for these things a pity thank you avor for acknowledging the natural order salve evil we have not yet been introduced i am octavian claudius britannicus a collector of roman relics quite a name you have if you were wondering what good i will bring to the settlement you need only look to the greatest empire the world has ever known yes i've seen their great ruins always impressive but you have not seen them restored to their former glory and i can help of course i will need a place to store my collection i will build you something when i can have patience i will bonham fortune in your travels evo good to see can you remind me what you do here if you need something tattooed you come here and i do it and you can bring me whatever designs you come up on too but of course no shop no tattoos build something for us when you can and then we'll get working i'm all see you later a4 uh this will make a fine space for my work ever thank you well if your work benefits us i will see that you keep it for as long as you live among us i believe it will for we have common cause against our enemy they have dug their claws deep into england eradicate them where they are strongest and the alliances you seek will be far easier to come by in london they now operate without restraint if you were to eradicate them the city would be in your debt i will talk with ranmi about your idea get her thoughts good yet before you do there is something else a gift i wish to share a gift i cannot show you here will you walk with me i will lead on i hear heaviness to your breathing hyphen does your wound still trouble you it does i'm afraid there is a pain in my chest for which i have no remedy rest easy though as long as your mind stays sharp you will recover of course though i am reluctant to displease my mentor you would risk your health and your life to these basis that i do not understand i should not expect you to when we first arrived i noticed a shadow of suspicion in your eyes a doubt a weariness is that a question no only an observation ah are you well enough to steer this boat i am i have no worry it has only prolonged stresses that exhaust me my energy runs low rather quickly and what is this gift you wish to give me it will not come from me it is a gift you must give yourself i'm all riddles what fun you are let me say it another way my gift is not for giving or taking it is a way of living still no clearer it is a thing better demonstrated than described then i will wait forgive my chest this gift we call a leap of faith it is one of our brotherhood's most sacred rights it is not a tool we use against our enemies but an act we embrace to strengthen our resolve like your meditation it centers our minds steadies our hands and purges fear from our hearts and more practically it aids our movements in flight or in stealth you call it a leap and we are climbing a rather steep hill there it is again the shadow of a doubt nearly there our destination is there i suspect you mean to throw me from this cliff is that it please tell me if i'm near the mark and spoil the surprise to perform the leap of faith you must give yourself over to something greater the gods yourself embrace the hope that death will not come before you are prepared to meet it believe this and you will fear nothing our deaths are prefigured weaved into the fabric of the world to fear this would be a waste of worry and tears good then your mind is already attuned to my lesson i will leap first on my word you must follow lean into your faith into your strength and take flight you want me to jump from here yes i would sooner grow wings and fly away thank you for the lesson but wait and watch high thump high them pig headed fool are you injured you see my faith grew stronger than my fear and that loam cushioned your fall avor i have not seen this side of you before do not feed your fear conquer it i've seen my death in a vision it was not here not today yeah a perfect fall and how did it feel you spoke through it was madness and vigor a hurting of fear a gift i give myself i see that now thank you for showing me the way of course and thank you avor for hearing me out you caught this leap of faith as sacred right do all hidden ones practice this same ritual as far as i know it is a right of initiation that dates back to just before the birth of the christian jesus are you hoping to initiate me i might try if i believed you would join but that is not my purpose in england bestem and i are hunting larger prey the order of ancients yes you remember the medallion you took from kyoto's body that is their symbol they are a plagues from this world like us they act in secret but their aim is to rule the world not free it from unnatural factors the desire to rule is not unique to this order siger and i want the same the land to call our own and the honor that comes with it do not compare yourself to such people the order has no honor no principles no humanity yet they sit on a great many of england's thrones if you seek to pacify england for the safety of your clan then it may be in my interest to give you aid i understand you desire alliances we seek to rid england of its deepening rot where these hopes meet our cause does too you may think this land ruled by harmless yarls and bumbling things yet look more closely and you will find a deeper threat the order's invisible hand touches all it shapes everything instilling its poison into every level of society from the loneliest fishmonger to the richest merchants from wealthy stains to useless kings the order has corrupted all bassam has given me one task here to locate and eliminate the order of ancients in england in whatever dark corners they reside if we work together towards this end it will benefit us both you will have greater influence over the kingdoms of england and you will have more medallions to count exactly you should begin in london i have credible reports that the order is working now to seize the city i will speak with randby about this and while you are there be on the lookout for our symbol centuries ago the hidden ones had bureaus built around england there were six i believe if you can find them search them well for documents bearing the same symbol it will greatly aid my studies i will thank you adam for all of this so so then be oh let's go no reason to sail here strike up a tube who will share a tail you may not know this but ragnar lothbrok once asked me to lead his early assault on england myself this would have been eight maybe ten years back it's hard to say the winters blow into one another like a great white fog but i remember as if it were yesterday ragnar appeared at my home unannounced naturally i welcomed him he had traveled a great distance only to see me so i poured him ale and fed him bread and listened as he talked he was feeling anxious about his journey leading so many men into such a great war it was a burden he could not handle it was then with tears wetting his lids that he said dog teach me the art of war lead us to england and to victory but i shook my head ragnar i told him i have two weddings i must attend soon for these surely i would help you ragnar bowed his head thank you dog he said though you will not be on my ship you will be present in spirit and that is enough  my wolves uh back to the ship scale power brand we mentioned this place the last known location of the summer army uh uh hail what has happened here who is asking avon of the raven clan i have heard the name you helped the sons of ragnar overthrow the mercy and king well matt did you and your men failed to take the village no no we had it for a time it was nothing but the cluster of water and dog huts when we came we made it lively grand bridge was a thriving hop of trade and song under the care of summa ayalaskuna but the saxons took it back they appeared within the city as if rising from the shadows and drove us out what about the city walls and your guards the walls were unbreached the guards unaware it was like they burst out of the center of the city itself setting aflame everything in their path shouting some nonsense about an ancient order of warriors by the time i saw the fires too many of us were killed or captured the retreat and we took refuge in the ruins but in the chaos we were separated she and the bulk of our forces fled northeast into the swamps i'd follow if we were fit to we need her iron fist i can find soma be ready when we return she'll be deep in the fog of the fan lands by now find her longship that's your best bet huh oh a great battle rage nearby old course we'll see what else lies within the fork someone cannot before you have the advantages um i should have a look around you have my true tanks dane markings this was a fine longship fit for chief it must be onto soma are you feeling all right take him to the shelter for warmth slap some moss in that gash and wrap it well echo look at me remember the boars you fell our first day in england hold his arms nine large and fat fed us for a week you'll be chasing more in a month my friend you come like a valkyrie out of the fog we have no dead to give you you must be soma let's talk elsewhere give them a chance to rest quite a hit you took how many were lost it's kind of you to ask but with so much blood in the water and death on the air i'd know your name and purpose first ava of the raven clan i came for you looking for a friend and ally i see i'm soma lord of grand fridge though it seems an order of lunatics wishes to strip me of that title the order of the ancients sounds right the saxon called wigmund is one of them he robbed me of my city forced us into these swamps i've rallied some of my soldiers but my three advices are missing if we hope to retake grantbridge i'll need them at my side tell me about them they are my best my inner circle galin leave we may as well be of the same blood if i can reunite them and we take your city can i call you a friend and ally if you can do all that you can call me whatever you want who is this wigman what does he want he's a flailing elderman under the old king a bitter man digging his fingernails into grant bridge just to say he can he's made many attempts to unseat me before this time he managed to trick what happened to grand bridge the elder man wigman ceased it from us i'm not sure how he managed but he will not keep it not for long he has supporters outside the city but this attack seemed to come from inside the walls from the heart of grand bridge let's find your advices agreed we'll look for signs of their longboats along the river and if we are swift we will find them before the wolves do the fog is more hindrance than hiding place now let's light the way back you
