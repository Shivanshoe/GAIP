helheim of all places you all right brother i will do what i must leave me be [Music] [Music] athena get out of my head [Music] so so wow brother right oh god [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] there's nowhere you can hide spartan put as much distance between you and the truth as you want it changes nothing pretend to be everything you are not teacher husband father but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape you cannot change you will always be a monster i know but i am your monster no longer all right brother let's see what those blades can do oh [Music] my yes those blades will serve quite well in hellhound now i believe i see a door to the realm between realms over there in your own front yard no less take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple then on to helheim yeah well i'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there anything you'd like to get off your chest brother i can assure you i'm unsurpassed in keeping confidences well you know where to find me for the record i've already guessed it yeah dead giveaway what hey you wreak your foreign magic sweet manas nethers what are those i've never seen the like that's got to be a family heirloom no nor will it ever be son my brother and me created me all near for the big idiot i know from quality and them them special hey where's the little turd he was full of needle no what happened acer no the fault is mine and my responsibility to make it right now we all got to take responsibility sometime well say what can i do to help i can do things when i should tag along no your work here is enough all right so where are you off to in such a hurry the realm of the dead helheim [ __ ] this is serious don't worry i'll be keeping my eye on [Music] [Music] uh now that freya has given you the travel room to helheim it should be unlocked on the table so hellheim and it's done so i'll be watching your back let me take this moment what you're about to do is absolutely insane not even odin can survive this cold is this the bridge freya spoke of no we're still in the realm travel bridge but after the bridge of the damned the dead use it to cross into their permanent home the city of helmheim the bridge keeper reminds admission he's the one we want just follow this bridge should lead us straight to him you know i'd really hope never to see this place again use the fire of your blades to burn away that hell's bramble blocking the path [Music] uh one of the many reasons we went back for those blades [Music] first yes oh this is all wrong only the newly dead should be here there's too many the gate must be closed and if the gates close then it's true hell's full up without the valkyrie to sort and kill them hell is overwhelmed what oh [Music] okay when we killed the reavers near my home they came here how did they return so quickly time doesn't move the same between all realms especially where the spirit world is concerned like the light of alpha the opposite in fact the lake of souls feels faster than alphein time but hell is much slower than midgard sorry i'm sure that's confusing if we will be back to my son all the sooner that is good ah aren't you a quick study [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes the warriors who die in glorious combat hell is for those who die in dishonor criminals i and those dead of disease mishap age it is dishonorable to grow old well never too late to go out fighting i suppose uh huh [Music] so will killing the bridge keeper help the dead leave midgard i don't expect it will though i don't suppose it will make things any worse either it'll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of helheim who'd be mad enough to go there the bridge of the damned and there's the keeper making sure the dead are really dead what is that he holds that totem contains a powerful source of magical energy the very power of hellheim itself now what you want is his heart just take it and we can leave oh start some trouble you can do that right cool ah uh [ __ ] huh oh uh i felt that one brother [Music] oh now the heart brother you'll have to get your hands dirty ugh [Music] uh [Music] um [Music] uh i have the heart i need nothing more you're set i'm not to linger here though [Music] kratos zeus my father your father was this well that explains a lot what is that place never go there understand how is he here that is not possible it's just an illusion hell's no one for torturing its inhabitants with their own past we should focus on getting back to your son huh yeah shh ain't supposed to be here it's cold real quick give me your blades why yeah i said i'd help you and i aim to come on [Music] all my equipment's in mid cars be right back yeah you don't suppose eat necklace do you yeah now they're ready for the winds of hell just target this magical goalie bit here with your blades and throw so you're welcome i sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain we have been away too long true hmm [Music] oh good sorry brother i'm still stuck in what i heard back there zeus was your father not now we should focus on getting out of hell and with that i cannot argue i'll just contemplate that little nugget in silence then [Applause] [Music] huh foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh hmm [Music] [Music] so let's go hmm [Music] [Applause] true hmm huh woof [Applause] uh wow you made it better get home to your boy already say hi to the pimple flap for me when he's better [Music] uh we shouldn't delay brother it's straight back to midgard with that heart father i finally understand i'm dangling from the hip of the bloody ghost of sparta do not call me that don't mistake me brother from what i have pantheon had it coming still a bit to take in i knew you hate gods but you really can't stay away from them can you you must say nothing to the boy he must never know all right respectfully boys he has to know he'll never be whole without the truth look i get it you hate the gods all gods there's no accident that includes yourself and it includes your boy you see that he feels that he can't help what he is can't begin to help it because you haven't even told him it's all connected will man him nothing very well [Music] [Music] from them winds of hell and made it so it ain't just one way now you can use it to travel to and from if i didn't breaks it then we can take it to freyja there's an idea brother be some kinks to sort out but you'll make it just well you gentlemen certainly know how to get around well this isn't right yeah but close enough he did say they were kinks we must hurry the heart you have it yes [Music] back of your hand [Music] he's too ill [Music] i can break the fever but to heal he must know the truth of what he is yes it is not so simple help me prop him up did i tell you that i have a son too it's been forever since i last saw him at his birth the runes foretold the needless death the babe in my arms was so small so helpless i knew right then i would do anything to protect him no matter the sacrifice of course everything i did i did for myself i let my needs my fears come before what he needed and i couldn't see his resentment until it was too late don't make the same mistake have faith in him i know the truth isn't simple but nothing is when it involves your child it is a curse the boy has been cursed don't leave without me i will not [Music] i'm better now i see that is he well enough to travel for now it won't happen again i promise you see that it does not freya i will not forget this thanks your father did the heavy lifting you should stay recover you have done enough you know my door is always open to you that's venom isn't it you figured that out did you well the window looks like by frost crystal and i know that's not what's on the other side of the wall and well it makes you sad you are wise for one so young yes this is a window to a home i left long ago but it is only a few the thing that happened to you in our thong you can't leave big can you a gift from my former husband upon our separation why would odin trap you in midgard petty cruelty would be reason enough for him but as with all his rash decisions he's driven by fear the van air were the greatest threat to the aesir until our marriage broke her to peace many of the vanier now think i betrayed them the fruits of my sacrifice to be hated by my own kind to trap me here is to ensure i can never make it right um someone was wondering why do you live under a turtle he was my first friend here in midgard he offered me shelter and in return i provide him with protection against the evils of the forest holden boar giant turtle you sure have some interesting friends now then before modi so rudely interrupted us we were just about to explore tears vault yes to find the black rune boy do you know the way from here oh i don't know sure you do lad we need a boat i don't know i guess we need a boat okay then [Applause] [Applause] huh uh uh uh a valkyrie we have to save her think before you act are we prepared to face such a powerful foe i'm ready if you are i see him here if i counts for anything [Music] right foreign [Music] [Applause] uh okay brother wow oh right [Music] thank you for releasing my physical form i have only gratitude why are you trapped i am uncertain my mind still fragmented the rockstar it is the last thing i remember the what valhalla awaits i must return [Music] [Music] it's a council chamber of sorts hidden away in midgard the valkyries would often need a place to confer outside of odin's crying eyes they thought themselves properly concealed but the all father sees all so the saying goes where is it we weren't far from it on our way to thumber's chisel the entrance is to the left of the two oarsmen statues you failed to mention this at the time didn't think we'd be hunting down valkyries at the time brother think we'll find out why the valkyries are like this that chamber held a special significance for them we'll find something there i'm certain of it foreign um i didn't think anything could get you all that help [Applause] i see the boat washed ashore someone did call a seven earlier get in i will pull you are quiet are you not better i guess i know you overheard my talk with freya you think you understand that you do not why do you say nothing said i was cursed you think i'm weak because i'm not like you i know i was never what you wanted but after all this i thought maybe things were different you do not know everything boy [Music] no but at least i know the truth now the truth the truth i'm a god boy from another land far from here when i came to these shores i chose to live as a man but the truth is i was born a god and so were you boy have you nothing to say um can i turn into an animal can you turn into an animal [Music] no no i do not think so oh my god mother knew she was a god too no she was mortal but she knew my true nature i'm a god why did you wait so long to tell me i had hoped to spare you being a god it can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy that is the curse what sorts of things can i do can i fly turn invisible i don't feel like god i do not know the reach of your godhood but over time you will learn you sure i can't turn into a wolf you are welcome to surprise me is this why i hear voices sometimes are you sure you've never heard any not as you do that's no surprise every god is unique so maybe i won't get strong like father but i'll have abilities on my own you already do lady your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young time alone will tell what else you'll become capable of so you knew all along i did lag but i've known more than my share of gods me too apparently i wonder who else knew i was a god raya for sure rock and cendrick they do not need to know balder does he know is that why he's after us do you know him from before the day of your mother's funeral was the first i ever saw balder that is the truth hey we don't have to go right back to chairs vault do we i mean we're god we can do whatever we want right what do you really feel like doing i will show you let's try this again without interruptions here we go again read it death itself i swallow to spring forth life tomorrow oh i like that one i wonder if i wrote it is that the answer there says earth swallows death brings forth life go yeah i wish i had known i was a god and alphon i wouldn't have felt so bad about killing somebody else well i'm not sure that's the lesson you've done nothing to regret the elves forced their affairs upon us no i get it now we had god things to do and they were on the way dragging us into their little problems again are we just leaving that there i mean just knowing we're gods makes me feel so much stronger maybe you feel a little too good right now with power comes a big choice lad you can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others like tyr did people really loved him huh i the god of war but one who fought for peace had a reputation for being heroic and lawful using his power and knowledge to stop wars rather than start them so there are good gods once in a moon it's been known to happen yes this one mentions places i've never heard of seems tyr really liked to travel dear believed the mind not might was key to preventing war and chaos and he also knew visiting other cultures when given perspective staying in one place could not while odin always hoarded knowledge guarding it jealously tyr was open and sharing with his landing and his wisdom for this mortals adored tyr showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over [Music] so whatever happened here odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule he suspected tyr of collaborating to aid the giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for the asia same thing he accused me of frankly though in tears case i believe he was right you think jira was opening the giants i do he felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by odin i suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks they're missing your name correct whatever happened to it i believe it could only have been done with tyr and the giants working together [Music] [Music] the stove that has to be naturally i didn't think it would be that easy no i was kind of hoping though so what now brother up there the winds of hell the ones of what oh we forgot to mention that when you were sick we went to hell height to get your cure you did terrible experience by the by your dad picked up a new trick though with a lot of help from drop rock we'll get back to this thing ah a skiing dew from my homeland used to have one of all one back in the day you should take it boy yes boy take it we might need to butter bread somewhere in our travels this is why no one likes you well that's unfriendly look small passages on either side perfect for the boy it's too small for father careful brother [Music] ugh look at that [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] what'd you find enough distraction do not forget why we are here okay [Music] that's my great desert land very far from here to god's love there oh my yes many many gods good or bad not as simple as that i'm afraid oh yes keep it up uh [Music] uh what did you see in that ball that set you up it is not important it seemed important to you it was a rash impulse you need not dwell on my failings wow that was almost an apology well i guess you do like to smash pottery enemies look i just want to know the truth okay i don't care if it hurts me or not i want to learn just cause you hate being a god doesn't mean i have to more small passages i know no i can't watch brother good luck go and i thought those saws were scary look it's the wolf giants it's golden hottie that's right the bringers of day and night ragnarok begins when they catch the sun and moon right did turn on him i don't know like them well enough to cover a massive wall in his vault with him though don't you enjoy it at all being a god on an adventure in some amazing place maybe mother wanted us to have a little fun everything we've seen and done maybe it was her gift i don't see another trap for the ah winds of hell maybe we can get up to one of those balconies for a better look job adress here experience what uh [Music] foreign [Music] yes one of these thought is faster than wind hmm perhaps this isn't about speed at all is that someplace else the winds can go you know for someone so loved dear sure was paranoid ah thanks to odin with good reason look there's the wind trap ah clever huh the room stop slower get out of here pull chains on the wall what there are three of us what do i do betray us focus you can do this please honey i don't know yet if i can drown okay think hodge is the silver they have to eat them these are out of order good boy so the moon goes on the left side on the right with mid guard in the middle but which bar do i pull midgard right left the right boy oh i can't turn i guess that's something [Music] boy you have to stop that chain i i do not know [Music] wait i know what to do it's not working [Music] a knife i know but it saved you that was cunning boy the raid's free i think we did it all right let's go see what tier's got for us no raised protection it rubbed off what should we do we keep going there it is we've got it boy on the day you were born i made two knives mixing metals from my home and from this land one for myself and when you were ready one for you today is that day [Music] so i'm a man like you no we are not men we are more than that the responsibility is far greater you must be better than me understand say it or you will be better the power of this weapon any weapon comes from here but only when tempered by this by the discipline the self-control of the one who wields it that is where the true strength of a warrior lies you must never forget them [Music] good then come [Music] on blank wait the roon did you see it yes are you certain i got it trust then me for the face [Music] up she was big but no match for us god i have beaten bigger [Music] puny troll yeah i'm turned around which way is the sandball back up huh oh we're so close to the end sit blooming wine the island of alumnus near the place of my birth to a journey's end really smells like rotten eggs is it still good possibly hmm ah [Music] father why did you leave your home and come here does it have to do with the other gods there it's just you hate the god so much but tear proves that gods can be good and you're good you only killed those deserving right [Music] yes ah but who's worthy enough to judge quiet head we are we know better ah sounding more like your da by the moment ready ready boom i think i'm gonna like being a god [Music] we go where we want we do what we want and now we're gonna go see the giants ah having learned that travel room to yottenheim we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak and put that magic chisel to good use nobody's getting in our way this time come on hey look who's back up and about didn't i tell you he'd be fine oh almost forgot brock this is our new friend amir we've met oh why don't you say so he knows why now i know why you know why wyatt no more of this know what sorry i brought it up can't you and cindy just patch things up whatever happened couldn't be all that bad your family now don't be lecturing me about family they ain't the one what forgot what her name stood for what we made the weapons we made were legendary across nine realms for more years than i can count you just don't throw that away on account of one bed one bad what you're one bad nothing ain't you got somewhere to be the work it is [Music] what next i got plans where were we on that other thing no i may have kept your secret too long but now you will keep our secret i'm behind you i'm not ready [Music] [Applause] uh oh i still can't read these oh why should we hide where we are secrets are on his way shouldn't we be open like here tyr kept secrets too for good reasons to protect people it is wiser to be discreet that doesn't mean you should lie to your friends or your family i'm sure cindy would understand and do the same lad don't fret so what excited to finally see the land of the giants yeah but also said the journey is almost over oh what if we get to jodenheim and there aren't any giants there either makes little difference to us fulfilling your mother's wish is what is important ah oh don't go anywhere be with you in two shakes father can i tell him no tell me what did you put this wheel in your mouth oh god i'll vomit i'm not kidding i'll throw up on it it is nothing a family matter oh oh i can tell you a thing or two about family matters oh let me guess your brother isn't as talented as you and his work is junk um those things are accurate your point it's all you ever talk about over and over do something about it or shut up i see yeah we're sick of hearing about little people's little problem um all right that hurt a little let's have a look at your gear then can't guarantee you'll like my work today you sure you wouldn't prefer brock help you instead i guess you don't need anything from me [Music] [Music] [Music] uh i thought that was gonna stop us okay broken again you know i'm starting to question cinder skill maybe brock was right all along [Music] hmm [Music] oh [Music] why did you speak to the dwarf like that aren't you sick of hearing about him and his brother of course but it serves nothing to make an enemy of him he should know the truth even if it hurts it was needless and unkind truth is more important than kindness your mother would disagree she wasn't a god good huh why not we're almost there you know i can handle it can you after the way you spoke of her i questioned that what that she wasn't a god she was better than a god and you shall not dishonor her fine care yourself [Music] [Music] cool [Music] uh [Music] it's another valkyrie we're gonna save her right if by safer you mean brutally rip her wings off and my vote is i enough both of you i will decide the best course of action prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] yes uh [Music] oh uh [Music] um oh freedom cursed no longer a joyous day indeed oh this one is louder than the last lady please tell us why were you in this physical form why fight us i do not know the soul of a valkyrie cannot remain pure in a physical body we belong in the spirit world which is where i now go [Music] goodbye [Music] foreign somebody made them this way who and why i i wouldn't want to speculate you know something ah mimia the smartest man alive i know many things third ah sigrun the queen of the valkyries she would have that power the last time i saw her she was corporeal herself she came to visit me long after i'd been imprisoned by odin why well we had history i guess you could say like romantic history a lot it makes me blush i think can i still blush first we hunt these creatures and now we chase your former lover we do not need this distraction it's more than a distraction father these are valkyries they're the ones who keep the dead from overrunning midgard then they are terrible at their job it's not their fault brother someone changed them kept them from their duty the queen i can't say for sure lag we should ask more of them if of course you don't mind that distraction oh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh um behind your brother [Music] i mean he knew all along that we were gods why come up with the story about odin trying to follow us to yodenheim before we get there isn't it a lot simpler if they want us dead because we're gods i suppose we can't rule it out but odin's ways are subtle and his purposes are oh [Applause] oh i suppose that's odin's doing you and mother always said all gods were evil but we're not peter wasn't bray and neither the acer gods that's who's evil and you know what odin's right we are a threat because we know what they are and we know we can beat them well not all of them not yet magni did his worst and he's dead they're no better than us and they're gonna be sorry they picked this fight thor blame me me for what you did to magnet my own father called me a cop [Music] looks like he did more than that move it world pick up where he left off i'll kill you no he's beaten not worth killing he should pay for what he said about mother i said no but we're gods we can do whatever we want [Laughter] that's what i said to your mother right before i gave it to her what are you doing this is a much better knife than mothers you killed against my wishes you lost control haven't you been teaching me to kill i've been teaching you to survive we are gods boy and that makes us a target from now until the end of days you are marked so i teach you to kill yes but in defense of yourself never has an indulgence nobody cared about him anyways what's the difference there are consequences to killing a god why how do you know how do you know watch your tone boy whatever [Music] you
