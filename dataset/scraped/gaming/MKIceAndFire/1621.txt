[Music] dad-dad [Music] piccolo you came I like to do a little image training every now and then to make sure I don't get too rusty time to see what I can do and you're just the guy to help me do that [Music] [Music] give me all you've got you're as strong as ever piccolo do you think this is some sort of give me all you got [Music] [Music] Wow warmed up enough right now then show me what you can really do [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] not much longer before this planet showers it would have been hours much sooner if you'd actually done your job rabbits oh sorry and that's why everyone calls you rat it's the right things will be different on the next planet mark my words if you screw up again I will kill him wait I just remembered something I think my little brother Kakarot was sent to a different planet I'll bet he's still there you have a brother I didn't think there are any Saiyans left besides us if he joins us the rest of the universe will be ours in no time the fact that he's your brother doesn't exactly fill me with confidence what planet was he sent to I think it's called earth [Music] but now that I think about it I haven't heard anything about him taking control of it I'm mad Kakarot what the hell is he doing [Music] a check of the sales dad-dad dad we better head home or mom's gonna be really mad at us sorry for getting a bit carried away Gohan I was fighting somebody super strong super strong yeah a guy going by the name of piccolo yeah well he used to be called Demon King Piccolo and he was real bad to the bone he's the strongest guy I've ever fought in my whole life I don't think anybody's gotten me more pumped up than him I want to fight him again so I'm hoping to get stronger and soon I'd be afraid to fight someone like that you know I bet you'd be just fine if you trained yourself up a bit I don't think mom would like that very much ah that's right I totally forgot that Chi Chi asked us to get some ingredients for her how could I not remember that ah I think what all did she need again oh I think she wanted some fish and apples dad oh yeah right let's just see if we can't find us some apples around this place okay I'll go look go Han sure is full of energy [Music] don't get too excited and trip over your own feet now where did that son of mine run off too steep to say he couldn't have gone that far let's try to find one more what do you say leave it to me hey it looks like you found an apple tree Gohan looks like he's having a blast hey now don't go wandering too far dad over here Wow Gohan you're a regular bloodhound oh yeah we've got plenty of apples now thanks for finding these Gohan I'm kind of tired now though I get it and I don't blame you hang in there I got an idea we'll catch some fish and then head straight home okay but first we need to find a spot to fish okay we don't walk too fast you got it try to keep up though the fishing spots right up ahead yeah huh what's wrong Gohan I'm tired I can't walk anymore look man you get tired pretty easy don't you I guess I can carry you if you want hey you perked right up are you trying to trick your old man you want spoiled kid you know that so what do you want to be when you grow up hmm I want to become a great scholar what you're a weird one aren't you well I definitely can't help you with your studies or anything like that but if you're ever looking to toughen up I'm your man nah fighting is too scary for me come to think of it this is your first time fishing isn't it yeah it is all right then let me show you who I used to do it back when I was your age it'll be fun I'm pretty sure there's a look this [Music] we should be able to catch something here all right let's get started but what are we gonna fish with we don't have any rods nobody said anything about a rod did they who needs one of those pesky things when you've got a tail like my tail I can use that to fish yep by dipping your tail in the water you can feel the fish moving around pretty neat huh it's really easy once you get the hang of it I mean I haven't done it in a while since I don't have a tail anymore but when I told my friend Paul about it she actually made me a makeshift tail to fish with can you believe it nice oh ok so what do you say let's catch us some fish all right this is great all right yeah Oh get a load of that he do got them dad yeah I bet chichi Oh flip when she sees this one man all this fishing is really working up an appetite you know what I mean let's eat some of these fish I mean we got plenty yeah I'm hungry too let's roast our catch over the fire what do you say I'm hungry for some grilled fish time to grill up some fish [Music] man I'm stuffed is there anything better than some fresh fish in your belly oh think ate too much though well if you want to be as big as your dad you're gonna have to eat a lot of this stuff right we had fun today dad you know I had fun today - thanks for your help I'll teach you how to fish next time so we can do it together okay I can't wait [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I bet you'd be pretty strong if you trained [Music] I don't think so [Music] oh yeah dad I meant to tell you I found this while you were fishing I don't really know what it is but here you can have it really thanks Gohan [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so should we head home now alright let's head home

best it really gets the blood pumping and the muscles moving right go on yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] later chichi we're off to see Master Roshi wait a second are you forgetting something Goku I thought you had something for Gohan oh yeah that's right oh what a neat little ball that little ball on top there it's a dragon ball I got it from my grandpa after he died but that's not all you got from him you are also named after him really oh my go on look so handsome it'll be like he's watching over you whenever you wear that hat so take real good care of it can't go on yeah I will thanks mom thanks dad all right we're leaving for real this time Goku don't let anything happen to our little Gohan and go hon be on your best behavior I will mom bye I want you both home by supper you got it [Music] you it said there are seven mystical orbs capable of granting any wish when brought together with them anything the heart desires can be attained whether unfathomable riches or absolute power these mysterious wish-granting orbs are known as the Dragon Balls and it's around these Dragon Balls that this extraordinary story unfolds with new challenges and adventures awaiting Goku and his friends at every turn Roshi like well he looks like a feeble old geezer but he's super strong really oh it's a real shame he's kind of a massive pervert yeah he was my rival at the time but now he's my best friend his Crillon strong just like you yeah seriously out of all the guys I know he's definitely up there there's also a woman I know named Bulma see she was looking for the Dragon Balls when she ran into me we ended up going on adventures together we hadn't done that I probably wouldn't have met Master Roshi and the others not too much longer until Master Roshi's place Goku Goku yo oh and who's this little guy meet my son yeah your son yeah wild huh nice to meet you oh nice to meet you too his name is Gohan Gohan oh so you named him after your grandpa huh yeah suits him don't you think [Music] [Music] Goku have you been training lately well not as much as I want to chichi gets pretty angry if I train too much you know what I'm saying right yeah I haven't trained myself either with piccolo taking care of things have been pretty quiet hey you two what are you talking about oh nothing really hmm I could have sworn you two are talking about how you've both been slacking off on your training yes yes there's no fooling you is there Master Roshi it would seem you've both forgotten that training is a daily activity not something you do only on special occasions you should be moving learning playing eating and resting every day that's the way of the turtle school I can't argue with you there now to make sure you two never forget your daily training I've got a little challenge for you come report back to me once you've finished your training yes sir master OC yes sir master OC now time to get back to my usual enjoyment [Music] [Music] [Music] yo [Music] yes [Music] Hey [Music] greetings Hey [Music] [Music] yes greetings yeah [Music] ah yeah [Music] all right what should I do now [Music] [Music] what [Music] Hey for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yo

all right [Music] so he's got your looks but does he have your power too I'm betting that he's pretty strong if I had to guess but I can't be sure since chichi won't let me train him to find out one way or the other [Music] hey dad what was that hmm not sure [Music] you [Applause] [Music] what is it then ain't no meteor [Music] [Music] [Applause] just as I thought the creatures on this planet are still alive Kakarot failed us who or what are you a power level of only five trash stay back [Music] is this the best this planet can muster well now here's the large power reading distance for h80 Kakarot [Music] huh what in the world could that have been I've never felt a power like this [Music] not sure what this is but a better check it out [Music] it doesn't feel cool [Music] what if it isn't him then who is it [Music] yes I'd better look for more [Music] where the hell could he be well now this could be fun this power it's unlike anything I've ever felt before well now this could be fun I'm ready whatever you are let's do this [Music] so that's all huh [Music] [Music] I'm ready whenever you are let's do this so that's all [Music] well now this could be fun I'll make quick work of

[Music] [Music] well now this could be fun I'll make quick work of you [Music] you could never beat me [Music] what [Music] well now this could be fun [Music]  so it wasn't Kakkar odds after all who the hell are you I don't have time to waste with you wait a minute this is Anna Megan isn't it what the hell is an Imagine doing on this planet if that's true then what are you even doing here you got a death wish [Music] you've got spunk I like that [Music] hmm a power level of 322 uh-huh you're definitely stronger than the others but you wouldn't even be a warm-up for me you're making a mistake in under estimating me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that all huh hit my turn now time to show you what real power looks like I'm getting another large power reading that's got to be Kakarot impossible who the hell is this guy and where is he going you [Applause] well if it isn't Kakarot you've grown you look just like her old man what tell me Kakarot what is this you were supposed to exterminate all life on this planet what have you been doing all this time who are you and who's Kakarot should I know who that is you've got to be kidding me you don't remember fine then allow me to refresh your memory you're not from this filthy planet you were born on planet Vegeta you're a member of the proud and mighty warrior race the Saiyans and that's not all I'm your older brother Raddatz they're lying that can't be true long ago you were sent to this pathetic planet to rid it of all life we say in search the universe for habitable planets and wipe out all who live there so that we can sell those planets to the highest bidder weak snot-nosed brats like you I'll sit to low level planets like this unfortunately it looks like this one's got a moon if this guy's telling the truth then these Saiyans are some real bad dudes wait what about the moon what does that have to do with anything don't play dumb with me so he say is release our true power whenever there's a full moon even chumps like you should know that I don't know what you're talking about you know I think Crillon is right you guys are the worst my name's son-goku and I'm from Earth take your lies and get out of here well I couldn't even if I wanted to because planet Vegeta was blown to smithereens by a meteor almost all of our brethren have been turned to space dust now stuff including me and you there are only four Saiyans left just the other day we found a planet that should fetch us a high price the three of us were going to have a hell of a time trying to overtake it and that's when I remembered you Kakarot the planet is as good as ours if you join us come on Kakarot think of the fun we'll have is it your Sayyad blood boiling with excitement just shut up if you think I'm joining you then you're dumber than you look fine be that way that little runt with the tail behind you is your kid right I guess I'll just take him instead huh come any closer and I'll knock you sky-high back off [Music] oh yeah we'll go ahead if you think you can it's not going anywhere with you [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd miss your tail a long time ago I think it's time it's time now three of us place of it just one month [Music] [Music] [Music] your kids in real trouble if this is the best you could do [Music] [Music] don't worry cat boys I'll make sure to take good care before if you want then you better do as your big brother says [Music] don't even think about trying to be [Music] calmer you still got that dragon radar oh I get it that decoration on Gohan's hat was a dragon ball all right I'm off it's now or never you're as good as dead on your own [Music] neither of us has what it takes to face him head-on least if we tried on our own but together if we were to team up we just might be able to take him down [Music] yeah you're probably right but can i really trust you what's your angle in all this don't get the wrong idea it isn't that I care in the slightest about your little kid or the earth that fool is the only thing standing between me and world domination the moment he and his cronies are out of the picture I finally rid myself of you then the world will be mine for the taking you're crazy if you think I'm about to let that happen but for now I guess we got a Joint Forces guess there's really no getting around that precise [Music] [Music] all right [Music] Hey [Music] huh [Music] [Music] give me a break [Music] thank you [Music] hey-ya finding us [Music] Earth's Dream Team to the rescue [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] his tails probably his weak point if we can squeeze his tail he should be vulnerable that's what happened whenever mine got grabbed oh he's supposed to grab his tail Hey Hey [Music] look the wheel spinning [Music] I'm ready whatever you are let's do this [Music] so that's all [Music] [Music] that village over there looks like it's got some shops yo well now yeah [Music] hmm [Music] excuse me [Music] yeah thank [Music] No [Music] hahaha all right can I count on you [Music] you think this shiny jewel would fetch a pretty zani [Music] yo [Music] all right hmm [Music] all right what's this [Music] I think he was digging for fossils in the rocky area to the north [Music] might cause some trouble lately best to deal with this mess pumped up and ready to go [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's all [Music] [Music] that stone seems pretty sturdy might cause some troubling best to deal with this now [Music] [Music] [Music] hey-ya [Music] [Music] [Music] gotcha thanks yeah yeah all right yes I better check the map [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right let's do this [Music] power [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right yep thanks [Music]

what's another reading and it's heading straight for me there's one no there's two with power levels 322 and 334 they've come so what brings you jump here isn't it obvious I'm here to get my son back where is he you're hiding him somewhere aren't you screaming was giving me a headache so I locked him up in there but forget about the right don't tell me you actually think you stand a chance against me you fool you're not even fit to call yourself a Saiyan prepare to die [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] even with your combined power you're still pathetic but considering you weren't smart enough to heed my warning and don't deserve to live gotta be kidding me you know what since you're going to die anyway I might as well tell you something that you sayings I mentioned earlier they're even more powerful than me if you've got a new attack hidden up your sleeve now's the time to use it Goku sorry I'm fresh out huh lucky for you I actually came up with a new technique while I was training really a plan it means you just to lie down and wait for the sweet release of death I'm just gonna need enough time to charge up the proper energy for it gonna need you to keep him busy while I deal with this got it I'll do what I can hope you're ready for this [Music] huh you just don't know when to quit hello what were you suscribe to decide who gets the diaper this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] his power it's 1330 he's focusing all of his power in his fingertips damage he's cut that much control over his energy good work Goku hold on to that tail and don't let go no matter what wait let me go listen to him Goku he's trying to trick you please please believe me brother I can't believe you fell for it you might actually be the dumbest guy I've ever met don't think I'm going to show you mercy just because you're my little brother yes yes that's what I like to hear soon [Music] don't get comfortable you're next damn if I try to hit him now he's just going to dodge it [Music] what is this kid [Applause] [Applause] [Music] impossible I can't be beaten by scum like this well you just were believed would just throw away his own life you idiot trust me Goku won't be dead for very long [Music] what didn't you know this planet is home to the Dragon Balls they grant wishes absolutely any wish imaginable even bringing someone back from the dead [Music] well my comrades will be happy to hear that everything you just said was transmitted to them on the other side of the universe once they've learned that I've died it will come here how long until this when really when you think of gasps I hear just one year from now damn it one year before even stronger warriors arrived you two have no hope of beating them and joy what little time you have left [Laughter] [Music] you [Music] hey I see that's pretty much it come on Goku hang in there it's not like you to give up so easily drilling it you know dying it's a lot worse and I thought it would be yeah yeah but don't you worry we're gonna bring you back really soon Goku what he's gone interesting I bet Connie has something to do with this Hey well I guess we can put our minds at ease if commies involved you guys need to get the dragonballs commie doesn't possess the power needed to bring someone back to life also go goose kid will be coming with me for the time being what you you're kidding right what are you gonna do with them with a little training in the right teacher that kid could be capable of serious power we're going to need all the power we can get before those two Saiyans show up in a year's time [Music] me training this little runt is our best shot to stand a chance once Guk is revived tell him go get his son back and in better shape than he left him meanwhile on a planet far far from Earth Raddatz bastard went got himself killed [Music] he always was an embarrassment still I must admit I'm very interested in these Dragon Balls so they're capable of granting any wish [Music] all right let's go we're gonna bring Raddatz back from the dead don't make me laugh we have no more use for that dead weight we could wish for eternal youth for immortality can you imagine it nothing could possibly stand in our way sounds good to me count me invigorated by the prospect of attaining immortality with the dragonballs the two sales made their way to earth you you [Music] and that is why I brought him here as he is to be trained further therefore if it is agreeable to you King Yemma I humbly ask that you allow him to meet with King Kai hmm I see so you intend to take this heaven bound soul and subject him to the gruelling 625,000 by a long snake way so he can meet King Kai indeed very well if you wish to see King Kai then I suggest you be on your way for however I should warn you that no one has ever ever made it successfully other than myself of course in over 100 million years must be one heck of a journey I better get started far away did a guy named Raddatz come through here yes we've got him marked down for the hell of course did he put up much of a fight he sure did he definitely didn't go quietly but I sorted him out whoa you must be one heck of a strong guy so you were sent along with him huh I am the great King Yemma I occupy a position above that of the Earth's guardian do you know what that means that means you're crazy strong right you don't seem to understand what I'm saying of course I'm strong but it's not just my strength that serves me in this position you need brains to do this kind of managerial work in a minute what work now then to help you better understand my work let's give you a little quiz well actually kind of in a hurry well then if that's going to be your attitude then I guess you don't need to see King Kai Oh what no way okay okay I'll take the quiz why didn't you say that from the beginning anyway let's begin I'll let you through if you can answer all of my questions correctly that's right he made a mess of enough planets to earn himself a place in hell in fact he's one of the biggest pains we've ever had to deal with right next question correct of course I am I am much more powerful isn't that right Tommy ah yes King Yemma you are more powerful right next question that's right no matter where they're from all who die come here like your brother he wasn't an Earthling next question not bad that's correct those pesky dragon balls are indeed how you do it now I hate those things it's like my job doesn't even matter who created those blasted balls anyway here to shed some light on that commie Oh genie Imam I whatever moving on [Music] sorry but that's incorrect huh what this is the fifth question right really one two three hmm of course it was I know I was just testing you and you passed the test well that was the true fifth question there's that trademark denial of his [Music] maybe I'll send you to hell when it's your time please forgive me your highness boy he's got one hell of a sense of hearing whoa you think you're some sort of funny bad hmm that's enough of all this I will allow you to see King Kai Wow really thanks a bunch mr. Yama don't tell me you've forgotten who you're talking to no no mister I'm King Yemma I haven't that's more like it if you're going to see King Kai's and go well this is where we part ways good luck Goku Thanks I'm not really sure what to expect but I'm pumped to meet this kink guy guy [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] time to wake up kid you slept long enough listen up time for a reality check your daddy is dead okay he sacrificed himself to kill the man who kidnapped you in case you forgot if his friends are vigilant and able to find the dragonballs they can bring him back however we've got other things to deal with though we were able to defeat Raddatz it sounds like we've got two of his buddies to worry about a year from now if that's really the case your father and I probably aren't going to be enough to take these guys down we need power your power you're going to have to learn to fight and defend the earth Gohan's crash course in survival I'm fighting quit your whining once I'm done whipping you into shape you'll be tough enough for anything got it so you're gonna train me okay I have to do you have to live out here on your own without distraction I'm giving you six months if you're able to survive for that long I'll teach you how to fight see ya [Music] [Music] [Music] Green [Music] [Applause] [Music] down little twerp didn't go and get himself killed already did he [Music] if the little brat dies here then that's all you'd ever amount to a little brat [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] energy from this thing is incredible the great Pecola reduced of this [Music] I'm gonna have to whip this spoiled ball [Music] [Music] yes [Music] I hope the weakling is prepared to die yeah [Music] what the hell are those things my kids probably got his hands full right now yes I'll have to take care of them myself [Music] more these things are there there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] trash like this is a waste of my time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and low on energy [Music] [Music] sir [Music] [Music] [Music] they're done now then tend to check on that little rugrat hopefully throwing him to the wolves toughen him up [Music] I'm hungry I'm so hungry little brat we still don't have what it takes to fight the Saiyans his latent power is our only shot fine just this once I'll throw them a bone looks like there's only apples to eat around here [Music] today I already searched this place someone's probably not enough [Music] the civil war that's giving me a real headache alright this is all these Giddings [Music] this kids proving to be a real pain in my neck you I hate this place I'm hungry I want to go home I found a pools huh Wow it's kind of bright for nighttime at least oh it's the moon whoa it's so big and round this is the first time I've seen a full moon what [Applause] [Music] so bring China kids out of his mind no use trying to reason with them over time my Tech's aren't doing anything [Music] what the hell's going on it's berserk there will be in the earth to protect if this keeps up we say is release a true power whenever there's a full moon even chumps like you should know that that's right before me [Music] who would have imagined a kid had such a transformation in him must be a saying blood looks like he needs a full moon and that tale of historians form better get rid of it now now that's taken care of here's some clothes and a sword I've got my own training to get to so you're on your own again if you can somehow manage to survive the next six months and you will have earned the honor of being trained by the great piccolo you're gonna wish you'd never been born when I'm done with you hope you're ready you [Music] I'm so hungry [Music] I'm gonna be a hungry later if I only eat fruit I could really go for some meat something smells good [Music] I really want some of mom's meat dumplings um excuse me

Yasuo be you know me and Goku real tight we go way back oh [Music] man must be pretty rough huh having piccolo on your back like that I know the feeling Bulma won't get off mine she kept going on and on about how you were kidnapped and needed help so anyway she wouldn't leave me alone about the old thing so that's why I'm out here so you know I kind of got lost looking all over the place for you I was starting to get worried I was just about ready to peace out head home so uh good thing you found me huh oh I bet you're having some trouble getting booed huh yeah well this meat here's mine so uh can't just give it to you instead I'll teach you how to hunt oh that's what you meant by help well yeah look little dude if I just swoop in and take you back Piccolo's couldn't kill me so anyway yeah

trees with brute onion mister Yahoo Ravi said I should approach deer from behind if I want to catch them here goes [Music] they run away if they see me and he just got by them from behind don't see me

something to eat but I really wish I could go home [Music] you [Music] what the no way the Saiyans are here yet but I'm sensing incredible power better go check it out Goku can't possibly be back already there's no sign of the Dragon Balls having been used yet [Music] I don't know who or what it is but if it's a threat I'll get rid of it I'm going to fight this might be a good opportunity to see how effective my trainings been no earthling should have this much power unless it's one of those freaks in the world tournament [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like someone wants to I'm ready whenever you are let's do this [Music] yourself you could never beat me [Music] Hey whoa piccolo hey you're looking stronger than usual yeah I trained it commies place so uh you want to see what I can do you don't look too confident I can tell this won't go well for you can you blame me I mean I was killed by a demon clan member once before you guys freaked me out pathetic guess I'll just have to

you're still the enemy I'll defeat you here and now if I must what you think you actually stand a chance against me I do I did train under commie huh is that so he instructed me to return to the surface and further polish my technique by sparring with an even stronger opponent and I can think of no better opponent than you let me show you how strong I have become sounds good to me I could use the entertainment I'll play along go on try to fight me using my true power [Music] [Music] I think you've had enough you're better than I thought at least you can dodge basic key blasts I guess that

something he said you're not like the old piccolo he said you don't seem like such a bad guy I think my dad's right even though my mom and Grandpa are still scared of you just shut your mouth and try to get some sleep I'm gonna put you through hell tomorrow okay stupid kid [Music] alright ready when you are King Kai now let's see you form a spirit bomb and use it to destroy this extra fast quick got it [Music] [Music] Wow well done Goku Thanks it wasn't easy it's like I keep soon the spirit bomb is formed by gathering energy from everything around you and concentrating it into a ball it's incredibly powerful screw it up and you'll blow the very planet you're trying to protect to pieces and that's why you should only use it as a last resort it only works for that matter just as I thought he very well might be able to go through the entire training regimen [Music] this isn't break time remember this you eat sleep fight that's your life now don't you dare forget it [Music] that's enough unless you want to die you have to get stronger stronger than me and stronger than the Saiyans it's just less complaining more fighting we'll eat for now but then it's back to business [Music] all I do is drain when I'm not eating or sleeping I'll die before I get very strong there's no way I'm gonna be as strong as my dad or mr. piccolo it's impossible wait how's my chance I can sneak home all right I think I'll go looking for something to eat mr. Piccolo's way stronger than me but keep up his training there's not gonna be much left of me I'm just gonna get in the way [Music] I think I can handle this [Music] you I wonder how mom's doing [Music] [Music] [Music] I think I can handle this someone's house [Music] [Music] [Music] I think I can handle this [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] do you I know you're go cos kid right uh yeah I'm go on are you a friend of my dad together oh you've heard about me from Goku no not a word well that's Goku for you but you must have heard about Yong Chun right nope nothing so what brings you here that's right I'm preparing a meal for Yong ha and this place has the best ingredients around so I'd better get back to work I have a few items to pick up sure all this talk of food is making me hungry I should get mom to fix me something a pork bun would sure hit the spot stop right there [Music] I can't believe someone that bad actually exists I might run into them again and when I do I'll be ready for them you think so I'm like dad am I really that strong but you didn't run away right everyone's working so hard Piccolo's one tough teacher but I am getting stronger maybe I can keep at this a little longer I'm gonna be strong like dad mr. piccolo so I can protect you and everyone else [Music] if it weren't for mr. piccolo I wouldn't be as strong as I am now if I keep up my training maybe I'll get even stronger all right better peace [Music] [Music] [Music] I hope piccolo won't be too mad at me [Music] I think I can handle this [Music] [Music] I think I can handle this Wow down is huge welcome [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] feel free to browse [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come back real soon [Music] [Music] welcome [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] you [Music] you
