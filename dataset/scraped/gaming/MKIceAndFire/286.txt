23 years ago the alien ceph invaded our world we stopped them i stopped them but the cell corporation seized the opportunity stepping into the power vacuum quickly growing in size and influence to the brink of world domination cell took us all by surprise even me they call me profit and i'm the only one who knows what's coming sell are not the real threat to our world the most powerful alien the alpha ceph still lives [Music] he showed me a glimpse of the future [Music] he knows what drives me what i believe that being a good soldier comes down to one thing to one single question what are you prepared to sacrifice remember me when they came to me with the nanosuit i sacrificed lawrence barnes the man i was to become prophet when my own flesh and blood held me back i sacrificed that too replaced it like a spare part victory costs every time you pay a little more [Music] i saw a glimpse of what's coming and there was nothing left of me to stop it [Music] when the greatest combat machine fails what do we do then what do i do [Music] lcs this is 103. be advised we picked up rebel movements through dome west 33rd sanitary probably nothing but stay frosty that son of a [ __ ] you got is hella dangerous over roger that 103 we gotta cover nothing getting on this boat tonight over [Music] [Music] romeo 1 romeo actual hardware extraction is a go bring it home [Music] [Music] [Music] you remember skinned us all you're the last one it's all about that suit now here take my back up dane three to come out romeo actual this is romeo one initiating burnout over copy that romeo one we've got to get you in there inside the dome there's a war starting the alpha surf no remember those guys who shot you for the k-box in siberia the guys who had you in lockdown for god knows how many years the guys who tore the nanosuit from my flesh the guys who were gonna do the same to you sell those guys oh forget it [Music] ai silencer on we're walking straight through the front door surprise is gonna be our only chance no one's crazy enough to give this a go let's do this quietly they've got qrf teams on standby they pulled everyone off leave for this guy do you have any idea who he is the guy in there is profit that's why they've locked everything down he's on his way to the skinning lab who'd be stupid enough to go after him [Music] area secure the guy some super soldier super soldiers [Music] hold up fantastic [Music] from our beginnings as a private military contractor to our current international role in wide scale governmental goal management energy generation and population pacification solutions cell has always believed that firm equals fair by monetizing advanced technologies retrieved in the aftermath of the seth conflict cell became financially empowered to reimagine the world's broken political and social systems in line with our own lofty principles and strict codes of conduct from here at cell head office your role within the company has been devised with total consideration and foolproof forward planning we do all the thinking so you don't have to do your job follow orders you're on the winning team vacation cell has romeo one moving the target over that was a bit messy maybe you need this a ball yeah makes you an invisible silent killing machine serious kitniss you like it no well that's cause you haven't heard the good part carbon lasers map that bow to your nanosuit it has enough kinetic energy to stop a rhino dead with interchangeable heads you can drop an explosive charge on any target and best of all you stay cloaked you like it now i'm coming around good now let's move out let's go don't from listen so stand down it's nothing romeo one we've breached foxtrot four burnout prepped and ready over critical threat sustained wind speeds exceeding operational limits nice one what's going on here up huh what's that surrounding targets [Music] security suite i did the business [Music] boston let's move roger so [Music] romeo 1 romeo 2 burnout is complete over [ __ ] we need to hurry up go on what the hell are we walking into this is sells home front they've got about one maybe two out of seven come off it mate the aliens are finished you should know that by now you listen to me you tell them i'm well aware of the risks involved in moving profit but my labs are out of test subjects he's the last one on the list so they'd better get him out here if they want my work to continue do they need reminding that the nano suit is still the only successful wet integration of set technology we have i expect to be sawing that suit off profit by friday or i'll be skinning you instead oh you've gotta be kidding me come on cycle let's move on show me your face just break that [ __ ] you cut me out my [ __ ] soap now show me your face cycle let's go i will find you i will [ __ ] find you you're awake when they cut you out you know a lot of the lads guys screaming their hearts gave up from the shop oh [ __ ] it come on let's go [Music] okay i'll give you cover let's link up on the far side terminate with extreme prejudices so [Music] huh what's that i'll take a look cover me [Music] hold up [Music] what's going on here oh [Music] what's going on here oh [ __ ] they're here a little bit harder [Music] stand down now or i will destroy coming over here hold i don't need a [ __ ] dive suit push forward and we'll link up further down okay right moving out [Music] listen investigating [Music] so moving to the next area psycho yeah copy that [Music] [Applause] but it's not too late there are still those of us who continue to fight for freedom democracy and justice [Applause] this is [ __ ] up we need more shooters there's nothing behind us this is very different than a bunch of insurgents [Music] i got it someone's hunting us with a bow um [Music] let's take it down okay move inside the site [Music] let's go once we get inside we'll rv with my people you have people now you know me i've always been a team player i'm not going anywhere until you give me some answers yeah i remember most of them are debt slaves cell loads are energy all of it you can't pay your bills you have to work it off course you never do that's the beauty of it you get stuck in that work away debt scheme for life there's no other choice well there is one you fight here let me show you what cell have been up to while you've been sleeping maybe you'll understand then [Applause] welcome to new york version 2.0 [Music] what have they done the city has an energy signature why is that it's cell they're channeling energy from alien technology running their entire global power grid of a single set machine inside this dome it can't be that simple it really is mate you kill the power you kill cell as simple as you like no the alpha showed me a vision we've been through this before there's got to be a connection somehow profit the aliens are gone you finish them off yourself just a few waves and strays left no there's something more if we can just find a hint somewhere here a clue listen while you were off hunting some super alien that didn't even exist cell were busy taking over the world we need you back in the here and now boss we need you to help us stop sell there's more than your revolution going on here i've seen this cell are toying with powers they can't begin to understand whatever they're doing it's going to bring about the end of the world we have to shut them down [ __ ] it right we do let's get moving [Music] hardware is intact initiating terminal velocity copy that romeo one you have cleared the perimeter the liberty dome is designed to contain a ceph threat you have the advantage cell units are organizing their response we estimate you have about uh 30 minutes the highlighted area is still a go cell ground activity is minimal here but the towers are still 100 functional stay safe and bring that hardware home romeo 1. [Music] [Music] that's claire new york's regional commander she's not a soldier we've lost most of our top brass but she's doing one hell of a job you have respectful command now well you know this one's different oh [ __ ] she made me swear not to tell a living soul well i guess technically i ain't really breaking the word right look at this straight from the skinning labs experimental nanotechnology immediately well i hope it's worth it here she is the liberty dome one big sweaty armpit nothing you notice inside that suit but it's hotter than a vindaloo in here lots changed this is how it all started people signed up we sell for cheap energy cell were generating power for free and nobody could compete with free before long they had a monopoly bills went up people had nothing left except their debt cell marched them out and into the volunteer camps nothing but slavery hold up minefield cells using intelligent munitions means they only blow up unauthorized like us use your suit to interface with the mines disable them [Music] [Music] [Music] that should be enough come on just an energy search energy source depleted [Music] heads on a swivel watch and shoot if we do have company let's make short work of them anyone dumb enough to stroll in here is asking to be killed be happy to oblige look over there what do we got an arrow cash secure the area this area ain't so secure [Applause] gone now scanning sector 1 delta 7. needle simple pretty [Music] keep low start [Music] you okay it's nothing there market there if that spots you you're [ __ ] back get back [Music] [Applause] whatever they found it's dead now how far to 34th street station a couple of clicks we'll have to get around the kill zone first [Music] no cell are closing in there's no time to go around the kill radius and rate of fire is within manageable parameters we can cut straight through this you hear that you bastard yeah i'll try you all on yeah are you insane those guns will rip you apart ah so now you get a picture they took my nanosuit prophet i'm human human you know how much i've sacrificed to stop the self how do i get that back [Music] crap so what's your plan support designate and execute targets until [Music] you do the fun stuff that's not the cycle i used to know things okay this is how it's gonna work i'll call out the locations as i see them like this one in sector one delta zero these are potential cash locations our primary target is tower 3 delta 3. as soon as you get the hardware we'll knock the bastard out cold sector 1 delta 3 looks good there sector one delta zero sector one delta two got and something of the tower i thought that would be [ __ ] obvious that's it recon what we have and let's move on to the next sector nothing here gosh it's a no-go [Music] we've got nothing prioritize sector 1 delta 6 strong contender [Music] magazines depleted weapon systems wow jesus but that is [ __ ] beautiful okay you got cells attention suggest we move out immediately immediately give me an update on your position let's link up advance and indicate those electric arrows you've got to light up a large area try them out in the later warning primary asset has been destroyed [Music] so [Music] heads up cell weapons drop near your location security lockdown in effect [Music] how the hell did you get this thing open use your security chip on the front panel i did that already you think i'm some kind of [ __ ] yep [Music] yes [Music] in position waiting on you level is now elevated is [Music] boy how'd you find that gun it's not important i hope you know what you'll mess it with come on we'll cut through the channels to the train yard [Applause] hang on i'm almost there you know it is important there was a lot of talk about you in the suit alien modifications those visions people aren't even sure what or who you are anymore what do you believe i'm here all right okay let's keep it quiet here we're getting close to cell patrols shhh keep it there for [ __ ] sake we need to go around [Music] sir stay frosty these [ __ ] took out one of our towers ain't nobody done that before current malfunction [Applause] me [Applause] oh i got you back give me cover [Applause] [Music] i guess they heard us [Music] what the [ __ ] [Music] is down [Music] it's down god damn it [ __ ] don't leave me like this sir i don't want to be alive for it do it do it gap in there check their black boxes find out how they died i'm going top side see what's going on move stand down did you hear that [Applause] [Music] vision psycho i've seen what's been attacking us yeah i know stalkers tell me about it this isn't going to plan like i said just waste some strays out of hiding because we blew up the cell's defense tower maybe you're right they're behaving like animals no hive intelligence so where's the alpha save it i'm boxed in by stalkers and cell cut through the engine shed and meet me topside there is now break do we have any updates on enemy movements over [ __ ] the updates situation is unchanged stalker activity increases rebel forces as indicated hpg profit moving through sex really good you hear that what the [ __ ] secure the area [Music] swing behind development target move up and find it can't hide forever dragon tornado surround them you're good to go check his last position they're behind you behind cask is bound [Applause] ah cycle something's disrupting my heart i'm gonna see if i can get a fix on it [Applause] [Music] oh treasure level respond immediately multiple casualties reported in sectors 2 delta 1 through 5. critical threat senators have presence detected in sectors two delta one all i've got is movement in the grass copy that headed your way to take some of the heat off [Music] [Music] i need a minute to figure out an x-fil plan romeo actual romeo one exit route bravo is a no-go please advice no alternative who the [ __ ] are you no no no i do not want to talk to you shut it get clear on the line improvise what the [ __ ] hell do you mean improvise where's your plan b okay so there's a channel you think you'll take us to broadstone and you'll sure [Music] choppers so potatoes [Music] activity detected in sector 2 delta 6. oh that's just [ __ ] brilliant typical hq [ __ ] i can't open up that tunnel yeah well i [ __ ] can come on critical threat insurgent activity continuing in sector 2 delta 6. give it a push cycle this train is full of highly explosive material yep oh yeah this is your plan come on yes come on i'm all right go [Music] [ __ ] psycho down well i don't know about you but i call that [ __ ] flawless [ __ ] sweetheart your number one soldier on the line open the window to the safe house eta 10 minutes romeo one romeo actual you will maintain radio protocol now bring that hardware home over and out let's go what a hard ass listen she's all right when you get to know her just don't mention the visions okay psycho why does she keep calling me hardware listen up as long as cell controls the power they control us enslave us sells golden goose rests at the zuckerman energy nexus near broad street station they call it systemx this remnant of ceph technology is contained within a single harvesting facility several hundred meters below street level nothing in cell's military industrial world is guarded as tightly as this if cell have an achilles heel this is it you all know we've taken heavy losses in the last few months an operational command has fallen to me our backs are against the wall and cell are all over us so it's now or never we take cell down today or we die trying welcome to our humble abode so they're always on our table we have to move around like nomads your mission has priority you will get relief [ __ ] all units outpost to rig to blow fall back to the green line stay mobile sweetheart hold on michael i'll be with you in a moment excel is hammering us with digital artillery our network is being torn apart get us back online now claire using reflectors to bounce the signal yeah i don't give a [ __ ] we need to get back online claire god michael what a day we lost some good people i was trying to contact jane when what the oh no no no claire this is profit my co look at the modifications michael is it seth cell is it even human have we been sacrificing good people for that that mutation look this is not just a suit michael claire five months now we've been here the balance of asymmetrical warfare favors us less every day this was meant to be our normandy but alas here we are in hiding we nibble here we nibble there but we can't tell the tide we can't make momentum we need a game changer major lawrence barnes the prophet at your service rash i remember you please recombinant dna human self synthetic incredible i can't get a read on you oh come now lawrence what did you expect i designed your suit my dear fellow of course it can't get a read on me claire's right you know about the risk so much power but volunteerful fractures tell me that my career briefly on our plans i'll brief him when we move out sir it's brilliant boss this will [ __ ] itself for good the situation is far worse than any of you can imagine i have visions glimpses we will take the fight to sell shut down that energy nexus and end all this or whatever they're doing will bring about the extinction of all life on this planet remember that you sound quite prophetic is that intentional it's very apropos now let's go save the species shall we rightly let's move out watch yourself you know i will let's go [Music] i told you not to say anything about the visions at least you get your gobshot about me you know romeo one your mic is stuck open oops this way there she feeding is into cell's high altitude defense system cells dividing their forces between the powerhouses it's your call how you want to do this and this cell's energy nexus system x we knock out the dam and sales core defenses are out cold they can't switch power from system x it's not on the same grid explain this to me why a dam when they have an infinite power source in system x redundancy or maybe there's something about system x that scares them look psycho how well do you know these people can we trust them what's what they're freaking out about my suit she hates suits don't know why i don't ask all i know it was her team that got me out of the skinning lab she saved my life stairs are blocked we'll have to get the lift working somehow [Music] [Music] no piss off [Music] okay that just leaves me okay romeo one this is romeo actual i'm assuming control i need a direct link to the nano suits visual output over roger that but only for as long as it's necessary radar shadow that means no guns on this one johnny you [ __ ] so stick to the plan don't [ __ ] around and cover each other any questions what's the meaning of life sergeant [ __ ] you gomez all right let's get out there and put a head on us stand down [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] tourism [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hbt's [Music] detected yes lock it down lock it down [Music] over [Music] so can't tell check it out you first [ __ ] romeo 1 fulton dam is fully automated but the generators have fail-safe overrides trigger the overrides and we shut off the power [Music] you hear that watch my back this all units get over here [Music] foreign he's hunting us trying to hide so listen classified as primary targeted oh uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] despite some major breakthroughs in power collection and wireless energy transfer the vast majority of set technology still remains inaccessible to us only the nanosuit program achieved a fully workable integration of technologies and that bastard rash obliterated so much of his research on the way out that we're practically back in the dark ages our work with existing nano suit material is promising but severely limited by supply but the rewards of success are almost unimaginable full integration would deliver the complete spectrum of alien technologies into the hands of cell for this knowledge any price is acceptable what now what's going on three no four sell qrf kill teams moving to your location and they've got attack helicopters in support whatever you're planning to do boss do it fast now day oh [Music] reinforcements warning perimeter okay we're in locate the overrides and shut this thing down damn it there's no time let's rough it up a little bit romeo one cell's power output is 65 and falling mission accomplished e e to delta now move it critical threat i've got something else in mind i think you're gonna like it huh [Music] romeo one we've gained a 60 minute window on the primary target you have multiple cell units moving on your position do not jeopardize the goddamn mission now [Music] so romeo one clear to proceed to the nexus i'm logging the hardware's explosive exfiltration as unpredictable and flat-out insane my name is profit you don't have a name people have names you have a call sign and a goddamn serial number and without me you don't have a goddamn chance so we both make the best of it i need a sit rep roger that cell's high altitude defense system is completely offline but it's not over in fact it's probably going to get worse cells in four retreat but they'll hold up at the nexus base so i'll probably try and turn this whole area into a kill zone watch out [Music] you
