what a joke the reconstruction's nearly finished and so is our contact if you don't hurry it looks like our contacts assailant stopped here but i can't see them nearby let's analyze the data to see if we can find out where they went in progress [Applause] our contacts assailants are switching vehicles to elude pursuers which is standard operating procedure for private military perks like albion not sirs what can i tell you they're mercenaries if you keep looking you might find out why they're interested in an srs whistleblower i've completed a thorough analysis of the vehicle and concluded it is a van oh come on now what else is there well i could also mention that the minute traces of sand in the tire tracks indicate that it's been on a construction site recently but you know me hate to sound like a smart ass i've been scanning nearby construction yards for albion activity and long story short some dozie has forgotten to turn off the security camera the makeshift torture room sure me officer and a lady [ __ ] [ __ ] oh it's not me i swear to god please please a champion while this man is being tortured bugly drop a pin on my mutts [Music] what in the blue place over there might as well give it up mate run a search on padding oh we are here to protect you you [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign calm down i'm with dead sake you called us of course you shouldn't have come here i don't know for sure i've portrayed them i just saved you [ __ ] no you've just damned us both look i'll upload the intelligence onto an anonymous ftp they'll explain everything how about you explain everything my name is richard malik i'm an intelligence analyst i believe zero day are rogue sirs officers who framed you for the bombings to cease power now they're murdering or blackmailing anyone who threatens them which now somehow includes me all right we'll have bagley check the intel don't make me regret this that i can't promise malik has made his way out and now i suggest you do the same um some people need to grow up i'm undecided on him as a man spy and all but we should check his information all right one second all right bagley check his intel then get everyone together for her briefing everest i'll go along with what the group decides but i don't like this we should walk out here you're just bloody wrong he needs a helping hand may i present the third option just use him an srs whistleblower even one you don't trust could still help us find the [ __ ] that blew up half of london and framed deadset for it you don't have to invite him to your birthday just use his information good idea all right huh i'm here are you ready to begin here's the gist malik's intelligence checks out a rogue faction of slrs officers framed deadset for the bombings to consolidate power over the government but now they've noticed that some people are standing up to the new order and they're blaming you i believe these are the people you call zero day i don't know their names but it's safe to assume they have a ring leader and in my experience overseas removing the leader right right knock off the boss and zero day or follow but why us why now two weeks ago a shell company connected with zero days operations imported 40 kilos of semtex from an old soviet block depot but it never left london which means zero day is planning a bombing that will make those earlier bombings look like a bonfire and i think i know why as we're all now painfully aware false flag attacks are a common propaganda tool for despots kill a load of people and the rest fall into line behind whoever says they won't let it happen again in this case zero day which means we both want to discover who's pulling zero day strings and stop them we need to get hold of the personnel dossiers of anyone connected with the earlier bombings in their cover-up then malachi can analyze their common connections and work out who's in charge of zero day and i'll be on the com to observe so if malik's right zero day are some kind of shadowy cabal of spies who blew up half the city to secretly take control of the government but now they're pissed off that someone's standing up to them so they're going to do it again that's awful i agree you think they'd come up with something besides another bombing bit of a double beat isn't it i think zero day's trying to teach us a lesson again because we're fighting back cut that victim blaming [ __ ] i'd rather get blown up a thousand times than lie down just so some wannabe tyrants can step on my face hello hello someone else slapped off work and now it's your turn okay cool what i needed mom [ __ ] i wish is this safe space [Music] begin searching drone performance search [Music] retrieval all right we're here you're stealing sirs personnel dossiers the organization is strictly compartmentalized so they aren't stored in one central location cool so we're spying on spies i love it wait so how are we going to do that sirs uses a super computer called filament to process information drawn from the ctos network it's like noodle if you could use it to search every document on every civilian government or commercial device everywhere in the united kingdom instantly [ __ ] me sideways you can be horrified if you want but it saved thousands of lives get access to a filament terminal and i'll provide you with the search terms what's happening here phenomenal peculiar nothing to report so far so i heard i refused huh [Music] ah foreign so this is filament impressive i can help you break in but we're going to leave a trail unless of course malik has an idea there i persuaded filament security to log that spiderbot's activity as system maintenance thanks how's suspiciously helpful of you it's not like the movies spies aren't the police i believe in working with the lesser evils like dedsec to protect society from the greater ones so why did zero day kill all my friends there are differing schools of thought [Music] you
