the wheel so it's working we got the oh there it goes again oh i see what we're doing it fits that's perfect hey wait for us i should hold it i don't have to leave i'm sure we can figure this out there we go do you think this goes all the way to the top we will see you soon enough something feels strange up there we're heading into danger do not concern yourself with what might be focus on what is and be vigilant yes sir not the top closer wait that one's not broken there's a note a giants prayer they're asking their ancestors to watch over them to guide them home boy wait i think i know how it works watch what did you write i asked them to watch your mother do you think they'll watch over us on the way to the top come boy it is a long way up stay back got it be careful around the giant's traps good thing too well good for me anyway oh come on that is not helping see you on the other side focus up boy oh oh another mining one may not be as long a way up as we thought still too heavy hey when we get to the summit how far do you think we'll be able to see the lake the world serpent our house we will see when we get there until then eyes open whoa betray us i'm fine just lost my balance for a moment you know for someone so strong you sure worry a lot it serves me well and how i keep us alive i guess not a terribly fun way to live though no match for us here we go how was that for fun i get it i should worry more is this where we get off no we are stuck how much farther do we have to go i do not know i think we'll get attacked again definitely oh boy yes now be ready yes oh hmm stuck again i know shouldn't we get moving they could be back any moment uh i think we're safe now it would seem father after we scatter mother's ashes what then what comes next nothing comes next we go home that's it the adventure is over for now but we will have much to do you were right earlier on the boat after cutting down the last tree you said it felt like something had changed and our home is no longer safe but it will be again and we must continue your training okay we're almost at the summit nothing's going to stop us calm yourself boy and stay behind me ready yourself boys what are you doing be ready hold on that was intense hold whoa who's that that looks like a root of the yggdrasil tree crystallized sap and there's power inside incredible i can't believe we fought a dragon i was aiming for his eyes but i kept losing my footing do you think this was their hunt did they move in after the giants left or are they why the giant slept boy the air grows thin here no more questions oh yes i see you hear that sounds like someone's screaming it's injury can you kill something that big if we can catch it off balance i can distract him what are you doing we have to help him break right find an angle wait for my mark thank you hey oakley over here oh uh oh so oh woof ah foreign boy are you okay yeah i have a plan be ready to lower the crane on my mark i do not care be ready ah now oh hmm wow we actually did it and you ah but but but nobody's killed a dragon for hundreds of years not since the grand calling of the worms and unless i'm mistaken you did all that for me you are mistaken the dragon was simply on our path nothing more you deny it all you want but you saved me and that deserves compensation what are these braided mistletoe arrows straighter than heimdall and perfectly weighted um thanks oh okay hold on ah ooh not that um have you seen my brother again yeah he said you lost your talent oh and that i'm selfish no i'm sure that i value a weapons look no over its purpose that i'm pretentious no and i'm tight fussy i know what he thinks but he can't hurt me any ah burn that i do not have time for this no no no no no wait wait wait wait wait i have a better idea what i just need a tooth from that dragon oh watch where you grab that oh never mind so unclean oh so so unclean oh oh the smell perfect that should do oh yeah i am not touching that just hold it out now run that along the string of your son's bow just humor me betrayus your bow two passes should do it ah gently now whoa oh sure now you're impressed um oh how do i explain this i've added a new vibrating pattern to the bow strings fiber aiming it at that hardened world tree sap will vibrate its patterns to fracture points oh i can see figured it out on your own then just never mind i wasn't just explaining the beautiful and complex artistry of my craft or anything no just anything to help you yep i'm feeling creative today i don't suppose keeping that clean that should tidy up your knapsack don't let the dragger get you oh very well to business it's a sad day for your enemies and what do you know i think that's a keeper you don't have to run off on my account where'd you learn how to do that sundry well after brock and i hearted ways i undertook some study in vanaheim truly mind expanding now and then i need new inspiration to grow creatively part of why we split up my brother and i he's stuck in his way so our work stagnated sure we mastered weapon making but then what change is a part of life if you can't adapt learn to thrive you'll be left in the dust and that's filthy okay until next time before you go see that you take special care near the peak i'm pretty sure odin is protecting something up there and you don't want to get on the acer's bad side who us where shall we begin i suppose you prefer my brother's work you're wrong of course ah oh so looks like it wasn't that long ago we were hunting deer now we fought dark elves trolls and ogres and a dragon i feel like we could be anything now we win because we are determined disciplined not because we feel ourselves superior sure i know it's just it feels good to be strong you know yes i know huh oh there we go want me to shatter it oh i'm gonna like this strange though that didn't completely blow up that crystal i shot it once it's going again huh food huh no i see improvements huh enemies ahead hello oh look there's a bridge over here we gotta find a way to lower that bridge that has to be the way out of here here boy another one this one's called emir mother tried to tell me this one but i think i'm so young are giants coming out of his armpits i think that might be odin stabbing him you found a seal i will never get out of chat yes yes betray us so so boy over here yes sir another marker it's getting colder we must be near the top not long now mom look the summit we're so close now your quiver strap broke when we fought the dragon it's all right i can hold it stop broken quiver will slow your draw pain we endure faulty weaponry we do not this will do for now good good go steady boy mind your footing focus up wow um ugh you hear those voices too right yes be silent oh hey that sounds like the same man who came to our house you said you killed it you've got company this time must be important with the sons of deen to grace me with her presence tell me you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy the tattooed man tracks show he now travels with a child where would they go next why would i know that you're the smartest man alive aren't you smarter than all the dead ones too you help me i help you tell me where they are and i'll talk to odin your father won't let me go balder and he won't let you kill me you have nothing to offer me so take your questions take your threats take these two worthless wankers and piss off when no one's looking we'll be back for your other eye don't you forget we're everywhere we really are aren't we ah the very topic of conversation a tattooed man traveling with a child boy check their path make sure we're all alone but we just saw them leave do as i say he doesn't know what you are and i would keep it that way who are you me i'm the greatest ambassador to thy gods the giants and all the creatures of the nine realms i know every corner of these lands every language spoken every war waged every deal struck they call me mimir smartest man alive and i have the answer to your every question why does the son of odin hunt us okay there are a few gaps in my knowledge but odin's had me in prison here for it 109 winters i'm a clever lad i can piece it together promise just given time nobody there just like i said the boy's mother is dead she wished she wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all arounds oh then you've come to the wrong place little brother the highest peak in all the realms is not here in midgard it's in your name realm of the giants no that could not be what she meant take a look this is the last known bridge to jotunheim in all the realms see that mountain looks like a giant finger scrape in the sky that's the highest peak in all the realms no here can we just take that bridge we have a bifrost when the giants destroyed all other british to their realm they locked this one up with a secret rune if it still exists only a giant would know it and all of them left midgard a long time ago true but today the winds of fate have picked up a strange vortex of coincidence it is there's only one person alive who can get you where you need to go and luckily for you my schedule's wide open we're going to yodenham right it's your best and only move from a tactical standpoint it's the one place the man who cannot be killed won't follow you what do we do yes first you need to cut off my head wait what odin made sure that no weapon not even thor's hammer could free my body for these bonds but fortunately you don't need my body the trick is we need to find someone who can reanimate my head using the old magic hold magic there's a witch of the woods she knows the old ways and she'll help she might do worth a child but if she fails he will be dead he tortures me you know every day brother wooden himself sees to it personally and believe me there is no end to his creativity every single day this this isn't living very well oh i can't watch this brother in case you can't resurrect me there's something you need no boy the longer you wait to tell him his true nature the more damage you do he will resent you and you may lose him forever there's much about me i would not have him know so you value your privacy more than your son i'm going to cut off your head now good enough hmm here now we're going to yonah we're going to find the long-lost realm of the giants that's that's inconvenient yeah that's just what i was going to say so do you remember the way to the witch's house yes the woods with the blood red leaves south of the lake i know just where to go i hope she made it back from alpha you can bring the mirror back you seem nice before you cut off his head i can't believe it was baldr that came to our house the acer gun balder and you fought him and won yes one of odin's sons thor's brother and now he's hunting us with his nephews why is this happening if we can raise the head you can ask him okay you know it's silly but i secretly hope we find a giant somewhere in that mountain i guess they really did leave midgard except for the serpent it may be the last of his kind are you the last of your kind too is that why you don't like to talk about my kind i mean your family before mother and i where you came from mother father now is not the time for that yes sir wow rock rock rock what i'm on a [ __ ] break don't hear me screeching at you whenever you're twiddling your shortened curlies leaving boy no pep well you already soiled my solitude so you may as well join me you're not hungry good it's not what i was offering saw your brother again congratulations and i'm sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again hmm let's see the damage little tank i wouldn't know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chuck he eating well enough i guess good all better now what the [ __ ] else you want huh times he gets so wrapped up in his work center he has a descents to sip us up and if he does remember good luck getting him to cook his own meat guess i got all the stomach in the family along with the smarts you miss him what that spit mister what do you know i just mean do you mind trying to concentrate here already on a break from my break come back soon with more crap you found boy what is the path back to the witch first we need to find a boat do you remember the way back to the witch from here that way behind the big statue of fort so what other stories have you got there was the story of the mother crab who scolded her son she told him he should walk forward in pride not sideways as he always did but she's a crab too he should save sure i'll look forward as soon as you show me how yes he did say that that was the story i got it huh the water dropped and the serpent rose right i knew that i know she's really powerful but you really think the witch can bring a head back to life she seems competent in her craft and we have nothing to lose if she can't bring it back to life can we keep the head no but you may feed it to the fish okay and now the door witch's turn must be standing up those guys were easy i bet this will lead out yep oh adress here oh boy it's another one of those maps oh bye oh yeah hey i think i see another one of those boys almost there it is it's another one of those samples bow huh hmm uh huh very smart hmm turn back ac yes the guys are welcome here oh there he is i hope he remembers us boy hmm this is good to know how's it going charlie is your witch friend here what is that name that's what he told me it was what it sounded like in my head anyway charlotte oh take that runner now enemies down can you read it sir death to the raven god lord of the hand ready yourself boy oh here boy i know those runes that's vendor wayne must be for that sand bowl down there what does it say falcon hawk and turtledove swim aloft and oceans above look huh petraeus to me okay i'm coming yes sir save their new things upon all the trust all right father she is here it's so good to see you again i knew you weren't dead hello oh can you bring a head back to life i'm not sure i understand what wait where did you get those the arrows give them to me now that you are a gift do what she says boy these arrows are dangerous they're wicked you find any more you destroy them understand do you understand say it i understand if i see them i'll destroy them it's all i ask forgive me please take my arrows in their place i have no need for them anymore now what's this about ahead do you have any idea who this is did you kill him at his request he claimed you could revive him me are you sure you heard him right please take him to the table pamela it's been a long time since i've practiced the old magic hold him there let's have a look well thankfully his head hasn't decayed much and his brain is still intact nice clean cut off his head of all people i sure hope you know what you're doing now hold his head under the water and don't let go i mean it that's enough oh it works let me see him my mirror you there yes good oh hello flair been a long time you look well what i did i did for them as far as i'm concerned death suits you better i'd borrow if i could your majesty forgive me had i known the witch in the woods was freya herself i never would have suggested this freya the goddess freya you didn't know either sorry when word gets out that my mirror is free the wrath of odin won't be far behind you are god leader of the van near once yes but no longer you do not think it's important to tell me are you really going to lecture me about that we are leaving boy now you're welcome why did you do that we cannot trust her because she's a god everybody taught you nothing boy but she's helped us a lot she lied some people value the privacy best not to judge brother when i require your council head i will ask fair enough get me to tears temple in the lake of the nine and i'll get you to jottenheim as promised we know the temple what's there only the last living giant in midgard better to tell us the way the world serpent wait do you know how to talk to him indeed he speaks an obscure tongue more ancient even than these mountains none are left in midgard who speak it except of course for me you do that's true you wouldn't know it to look at him but yourman gander is a sparkling conversationalist so my mirror why did freya spin your face no speak of balder he claims nothing harms him hi balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical boosting of a god everyone has a weakness not him i'm afraid baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical you just said that mimir did i what is the source of this power well as i recall it involved a spell my mirror parts of my brain must still be coming back to life just need a moment to finish waking up i hope he's not broken we jump really oh dear bad idea how do we speak to the serpent there's a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge take me to it finally that horn sure i'm open hey whatever helps right now about that other good good now put my lips to the horn why is he doing that gordon had that statue made in honor of thor and seeing as the world suffering absolutely abhors the fat dobber he was probably sick of looking at it but doesn't that hurt well he and thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them no they will anyway i guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet you want me to ask him no our only concern is your name all right wish me luck got it lads he remembers me he knows the pain of your loss he will help you making sure we're headed in the right direction listen closely now we need two things to get us into the land of the giants first we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to jottenheim second we need to carve that roon into the special gateway that one on the peak where we first met you correct except the giants in their infinite wisdom saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate luckily i know where it is and it's not far he looks kind of mad for a moment there now that he thought i said you were friends of odin you'll forgive me never spoken the ancient tongue sober wait look the water's dropped even further you can see more of the realm towers and statues i haven't seen new places to explore along the shore where is this chisel find me a boat and we'll go from there you
