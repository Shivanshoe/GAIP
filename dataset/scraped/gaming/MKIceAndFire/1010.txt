everyone here Jess we're gonna start protecting ourselves and fast get people looking for waves that apes can break into this town okay I'll get people to help but we have to take precautions all right Jess you got to get this town safe again now it could be all Walden I help you with that I thought you might have ideas that's hearin when the Apes finds it and they will find you they're gonna come after you so unless you got guns on all these walls and I do mean all these walls it's just a matter of time before they're in here okay but hang on we can't just hole up in here waiting we need to send out patrols he's right what are we supposed to do sit on the wall 24/7 guns pointed at nothing we send out patrols patrols but you must be a Ponder's securing militants a priority we take care of our people it's a good decision Jess you to thinking you'll stay got some good people in this town hate to see things go wrong yeah I think we will stay sure the meantime we'll go outside and check out ways them Apes could maybe get in here what can I do [Music] you [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh Toula ape not fight ape Hey Oh Oh Oh will Josh [Music] Rainie what's going on yes you've seen what those Apes can do I figure we need to use everything we got otherwise next time wait a second Rainey you're handing these out to the whole compound it's overkill better safe than dead especially if we go after them right where they live we're not going anywhere not for now this is war Jess we don't have a damn choice here let's kill them or they are gonna kill us no we do have a choice no one wants more bloodshed so we just sit back and we wait for them that your plan the Apes attacked us because we attacked them can't you see that I'll make the calls raining you just make sure you and your men are on board dear least carry a decent weapon all right for defense all right it's your call but just God if you're wrong and they come for us if I'm wrong then we'll fight them off and then we'll

before there now to kill apes lucky to showed up I talk a good story mark but the fact is the Apes are still out there and they can hit us at any time sooner or later we're gonna have to kill them not the ape hunters well it's still here counts for something I guess they're Drifters we have to make our own decisions I'm just saying look before he got sick dad used to make the tough calls around here and the town always followed him maybe people don't know if you can make those kind of decisions like with these Apes it turns into war what are you gonna do I'll do whatever I have to do to keep

girl apart seven years old she was spitting image of a mom hmm it was all my fault see we had an ape prisoner we were too damn soft on it does that ape knew that other apes were coming but wasn't talking it seems to me we're in a similar situation right now we need information so what's it gonna be come on Jess enough it can't talk Maria's right if this eight knows anything it's not talking you've got to stop this it's wrong and it's getting us nowhere four dead tonight Jess and you can't spell a damn drop I ate blood well it's Reeves that's enough you're going to kill him and what good
