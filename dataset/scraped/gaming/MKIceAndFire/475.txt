is king of dublin dublin is a viking city a war but in fact merchants and beggars come from all parts to parade in its muddy streets ought to think of bharath as king of the city it perhaps sounds grander than it is ireland has many many kings they litter the countryside and barrett's throne is not secure soon to be crowned high king of all ireland flan distrusts vikings though he needs them bharath will find a way as a boy he wasn't much of a fighter but somehow always came out all right i'm sure what you say is true certainly he is loved by his people foreign [Music] [Music] your crew can find lodging here come let us find bodies avor blood of my blood look at you you have on thrusters cheekbones and you the seven year old lives in you still it has been a long stretch since we

ireland you cannot appreciate irish air without enduring the stench of our dogs it is upon the strength of this court i plan to secure my kingship assad told me that your throne may not be entirely steady king flan needs some persuading his all dublin's vast trade web will bring wealth to all ireland if lawn can be made to see that my kingship and that of my children's children will be safe i

i do in the house of thor so long as a god has my back he has my altar i've built this city up from rubble 20 years ago us vikings were beat the irish took revenge and sacked dublin assad told norse founded it and i nursed it back to health when i became king i was king of a mud pit please there up ahead my home my only regret is that my mother and my wife aren't here to greet you they've gone on pilgrimage to the mountains just now the waters there improve mother's health i am left to discipline my wayward son and to host a banquet which should be already underway up buried for dia here we are please go enjoy yourself i must have a word with my son come meet him before the night's out hey you boris cousin it's a grand do isn't it hi enjoying yourself it's great crack it's a fine thing to celebrate future king six i'm curious how do you feel bharath has done as king oh he's done a lovely job he has likes to throw feasts invites us common folk more horse than king perhaps but he's a fine man and the city has never been busier can i ask what is your life like in this city well there's a fair among the work isn't there hauling crates shoveling muck i'm a tanner myself long days stripping hides and dousing them in cow piss you can probably smell the stench i can [Music] enjoy the feast friend you as well i was not sure if i would see you here why is that i thought you'd rather take stock if you're worse than placidly observe catawalling vikings and you you would rather spend time with this gossiping auntie i like to greet everyone at parties there is no shortage of amusements enjoy yourself [Music] i expect my son to act like the future king not roll in the muck so flan will take you on as his farting court jester think with your head and not your arse flan can assure my throne which will one day be yours that makes you the ass enough hey my son sigfrith i'm sorry i i must clear my head good to speak to the boy only [ __ ] birds mock their father under his own roof right because the cousin who just arrived has the authority over how i speak in my own home norway you'd be knocked to the ground by now come on then if you have any guts worth respecting fine welp you won't land a single punch i guess i owe you thanks for not beating me bloody i'm not here to quarrel with you siegfried da speaks so highly of you i wanted to see if you lived up to the stories does anyone [Music] you aren't happy with how your father rules da has the makings of a fine king but he chooses to play the anxious merchant instead a visit to norway might do a young wicking guy like you some good i'd love to go with da maybe the homeland would kindle his warrior spirit give dublin a fair and fearsome king i've lost track of your father any idea where he might be he wanted to clear his head that means he's visiting grandfather's grave da has a chat with him almost every day boris can commune with the dead no his conversations are all one-sided the grave sits at the top of the hill i'll find him thank you siegfried avor teach me how to hit like that sometimes made me be my eyes [Music] why so uneasy a king must forever be on guard when i'm upset or uncertain i come here to seek my father's spirit i didn't even ask after him somehow i knew he'd some years ago he was destined to die in battle and he did he sits without him now my family owes yours a solemn debt that winter your family came to stay with us i remember your birth screaming like a warrior the plague here no one would take us in no one but your mother and father i owe your family my life and what a life we had i found memories of you and i slipping out to hunt in dead of night stars in the sky moonlight on snow [Laughter] and that's how i got that scar i do feel bad about that what about the one on your cheek this a caution from the gods about my vanity come if we tell all our stories we'll be here a week do you see something my imagination drawn amok but let us away funny how just the slightest noise sets a fellow on edge why thor's hammer barith i could sleep a week not as proud as the old days there when we searched the night in hopes of catching a will of the wisp did we catch one i have a memory of catching one foreign die coward [Music] who were they my ascension to the throne has not been without contest the previous king's son thorstein is resentful you told me nothing of this you are my guest i'm not going to burden you with petty concerns petty concerns i now know why you've been anxious all evening i this worrying he's never been so bold before he sees you as a usurper to his throne perhaps but he doesn't seem to want to take it he contents himself by stealing and smuggling with his band of ruffians it's petty viking raiding but it puts me in a bad light with flan that's certain keep a sharp watch briggins rove the streets tonight you can be sure of me my king just getting to know people what you know i am always the last to leave a party what is wrong we were ambushed by thorstein's men rivals i was not made aware of small wonder king flan does not embrace you about it you cannot keep control of the vikings in your own city thorstein makes me look like more of an arse than i do on my own i see it is the high king's disfavor that makes this shameful my cousin i will take care of thorstein no i do not want to drag you into the sorry mess perhaps he'll accept silver to lie low for a week or two but then he'll be back and back again i can remove this blood once and for all avor this is not your fight for any and all of your god's sakes buddhist let avor help you as of this moment buddhist my arm is yours whatever is needed to bring flan smile upon you i will do evil i have never been so happy your family saved mine those years ago a fitting reply would be to secure your throne i will start with thorstein it happens that siegfried may know something he once ran with thorstein's gang sadly true seek him tomorrow in the marketplace after a night of carousing he likes to recuperate there we will begin to forge a bond with high king flan on rise of sun [Music] but it's would be at the marketplace i need to learn about thorstein oh

dublin father why choose weakness give every enemy a length of rope soon they will carry your noose peace flan sinner will soon rule all ireland flan sinner has the power to make or undo my kingship and that of my son he is the center of all but flan distrusts me he does not believe i'm truly christian by showing christian mercy i begin to change his mind you are more shrewd than i took you for cousin maybe thorstein's release is worth a kingdom but will mercy be enough that is why i must build trade flan will see that the strength of dublin sports is the strength of ireland show him the power of that trade cousin obtain some rare item from afar some spies or gem or weapon and gifted to him at the coronation it will represent dublin's reach and help secure my crown flan will hear of your christian mercy meantime i will speak to a sire about a gift meet me before the coronation we will go together [Music] um very handy avor welcome to my shop i came to ask a favor it is pleasant to strengthen friendships what do you seek wishes to show flam the value of duplin's trade could we obtain a gift from a distant land this is the very problem vexing me you see i have acquired land in wrathdown previously owned by thorstein in fact but the land has gone to thorn and dog smugglers as well once cleared its trading route will serve our hearts desire in this case my heart desires an exotic gift which would be a spice merchant i know covet spells of fine fur broth down has an abundance it is a perfect match spice is a gift fit for a king thank you sir it is north of here you go

flan's gift uh [Music] foreign bodies flan's gift is on its way to meath very good i i was just preparing to leave for the coronation though i now have a problem on my hands what is it flan's poetess kira she was here delivering a formal invitation and now i do not know where she's gone do you think she's in trouble no i think she is amusing herself somewhere likely perusing dublin's markets we need her the high poetess is an important member of the king's court there cannot be a coronation without one i will find her where should we meet by dublin's gates i will ready the horses [Music] [Music] let's see you old friend um [Music] [Music] he shall [Music] for the sake of our ears shut your mouth sure and you're an idiot you are all the same grab the [ __ ] fey won't you let a caged

because of these fists you live to sing another day who is this so true bodice i was beginning to worry what took there was trouble ah no need to be so tense shall we ride for tara we don't want to be late for the carnation after you i was surprised to meet a member of your family bodies avo tells me he's come from england yes evil is helping to establish trade in dublin secure valuable resources with faraway lands in time dublin will become the heart of ireland's trade one that each and every kingdom can benefit from that will no doubt please the future high king yes well above trade i am hoping flan can see dublin as a friend and ally you and many others relationship with violence would be one worth fostering it would be foolish of your king to ignore it it appears avoid is not abreast with our kingly history bodies we were hoping to have a meeting with flon my wish is to strengthen our ties can you see it done perhaps but we'll see how the evening goes uh [Music] quite the event spared no expense that much is clear ara my lady one of the priests has gone missing a violent mess is left of his tent i fear something terrible has happened missing are you sure could be nothing could mean danger where's flan he's not yet arrived that gives us some time get uh act as if nothing were missed about it and i will look into it where is this tent up the hill to the left be careful [Music] there was a fight here it is the eve of the coronation and already trouble brews keep your wets and stay close we do not know anything yet something dark happened here you must follow the bloody [Music] [Music] the blood leads off away from the main camp perhaps towards those tents [Music] the blood stops here where do these contracts lead this story is like to have a poor ending i fear so cousin on such a momentous day as well flan's coronation may not be as hoped so there caught up ahead looks like they hit a snag recognize him that is sennan the priest bastard stripped him of his clothes that camp up there what is it anak do is no camp though it appears someone has made it into one let's go what do you think the priest was kidnapped i took it close i believe whoever did this means to wet the priest was kidnapped i took it close i believe whoever did this means to wear them but disguise we'll soon find out in your worthless life let's search sent to kill floor the letter is unsigned an unknown enemy come we must bring news of this to kira i'm with you you handled yourself well lavor i have to say you really are no stranger to these sorts of encounters you did not do so bad yourself i we stopped the death of a king this day if only we knew who was behind it no idea who would go to such lengths you can take your pick of the northern e-nail kings though it is the kings of ulster who particularly disliked flan different king same story oh he is any story the priest is dead and so too are his killers bandits i found this it's an order to kill flan one of them was to disguise himself as a priest cut flan's throat during the coronation right under our noses why take the risk why not poison or striking at him in his sleep poison can fail to kill him in his sleep like spectacle but your point is sound the killer would not have made it out alive he was ready to die whoever plotted this his intent on seeing flan fall we need to warn him after the coronation i will not have this gnawing at him flan earned this he will enjoy it meet him afterward at his quarters enduro he will make time for you there now if you will take my excuses i need to tidy up come along avo the water was not that murky was it you don't know much about the role of a poor test do you ever enlighten me i will well what are you waiting for i asked to be excused that meant you as well i see other kings here new zealand's inauguration has reached far and wide come we should join them [Music] is that him flon yes what are they doing blessing him abbott owen is the highest ranking official among the christians his blessing asserts that flan is ready to fill the boots of his predecessor it is all done before the leah fall a sacred stone that is said to endow the rightful kings with long reigns does it work depends on what you consider long coronations alone where's the food you have not changed i'm here i may as well enjoy myself [Music] [Music] was [Music] [Music] m [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] from [Music] [Music] and with that flan's enemies multiply this warring of dynasties runs deep if he's a smart king we'll be eager for allies smarty is but also impassioned his plan to subdue the north is not driven by power so much as it is bloodlust back then all right from dublin kieran made it seem there was more to you and flan what am i missing a detail a large detail you see the northern king who crowned me at findlay he murdered flan's father and took his place as high king then as his custom he married flan's mother safe to say there's no love lost between you none teflon ed was a venomous snake and so too are the ones he favored winning his trust will be no simple task we just thwarted an attempt on his life that should at least perk his ears up let us hope i will leave immediately for turtle meet me there soon as you can [Music] the wow is awesome off we go sing us a song sail down sails some years ago i took the sea with a sword dancer called alien i know a crazed man about my age called broken we are taken to calling roku [Music] fearlessness the bass [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with blood [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's wrong with you uh um flawless inside relax your shoulders he has as much to gain from this as we do foreign [Music] [Music] uh baris we welcome you to doro it has been a long time thank you for meeting with me lord i trust our gift was well received exotic spices all of which are foreign to me i am impressed only a taste of things to come dublin will soon be known as the pillar of ireland's trade to a long life and prosperous rain my king search field you honor me you must be avar my gratitude for your selfless actions and what preceded my coronation lord seems my enemies could not wait for my reign to begin before trying to put an end to it an old tale between northern and southern e nail i'm afraid but it's one whose ending i will be the author of planning a war a high king should have control over his land and i shall if it takes a bloody war i must be prepared for it dublin's trade has plenty to offer and plenty of stout fighters a or included ready to fight alongside you i appreciate your desire to strengthen the ties between me than dublin not as much as i find myself in need of aid it appears you find yourself undermined by your own people what do you mean during the coronation a monastery was raided and a christian text was lost the book of kells dublin danes are to blame your support will be of great help let me be clear but this capriciousness will sooner harm me than help me i take it the book is important authored by monks from the monastery of iona some 80 years ago it was after the danes first reached our shores it was meant to preserve the christian faith in uncertain times today it is a symbol of that perseverance if i retrieve the book set straight the ones who did this would you welcome bardeth into your court it would help these danes you know where they are in a bog in inch row just north of here avor this is my responsibility remain here i'll see it done so this is my work but people have the silliest requests these days come back anytime my friend until soon [Music] these are the ones who stole the book of kels i should search their stashes for it this area is off limits [Music] [Music] uh this confirms florence information the book should be here somewhere [Music] uh go soon [Music] uh [Music] ah go up damn you [Music] stretch your wings soon sooner guide me uh okay wow what won't uh oh it seems you thought we told you to leave thorstein ah leave dublin uh correct me if i'm wrong but this is not dublin you did not understand you were not to be seen again oh come now how was i to know you would find your way out here why are you here looking for a book you stole you raided the monastery recently oh it was several monasteries actually these new friends of mine do not tire easily the book is important to the christians i need it back the christians see you are an irish lap dog i i do not have it are you upset please do not be upset you were upset though i am running out of reasons to let you live ah i know where it is boing tombs some strange folks offered me this hoard for it i could not resist could you see you understand we are very alike you and i i could just as well be your brother i do not kill me thorstein your blood is not worthy of my steel i could not agree more now vanish i mean it this time a third encounter you will not walk away from oh i am true with ireland my ankles ache for how i must dance around all these kings it offers nothing except for this i will just take this and this so uh chasing it [Music] you married the bloody eagle [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] hmm fine tunes austin set up to find the book of kills here locked i need to tread carefully these must be the people of both the books [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

you found it its popularity is ever increasing this is owen abbott varma the book is for him i remember from the coronation [Music] i pray you did not have to endure much to reclaim this a small prize to ensure the high king's patronage what's this lord you are chosen high king by god almighty these are pagans [Music] i mean no disrespect [Music] you have no say here this is between two kings i only mean to warn flan of the possible implications nothing more and i am well aware of them abbot i have spoken past what is right i will take my leave lord please excuse this clumsy intrusion no need i'm glad to see the book is back in good hands [Music] he's colorful i do not blame the abbot for raising alarm history dictates he has every reason to what is your report i have dealt with the leader in the bark you will have no more problems coming out of dublin then we shall turn our eyes to the problem at hand ulster is using his power to sway conor an allegiance that must be snuffed before it takes flame for that we need to gain support from the other kingdoms speak with kira she will guide you in this i shall return to dublin to gather men and resources for the march i welcome them when we are strong enough we will meet at knock free and devise a strategy you were gone sometime what happened the book was in the hands of a strange cult that procured it from thorstein i was weak to spare him my own son knew better chin up we have come into favor with the high king i will feel better that deflance trust in me is not shadowed by doubt back to dublin i go talk to kira we must gain favor with the other kings quickly [Music] [Music] you
