come how do you propose we find these arches do you think like tomorry we want to control movements in and out of he or she Springs where do we put arches that path behind then no poor cover no clear lines of sight you want to cover the largest territory with the fewest archers it would be smart to control the main entrance into town people already avoid the main road archers there would be wasted a handful of men could shut down the road to the coast yes I would want someone looking over the bridge into town so would I the road south runs along a high ridge perfect place to rain down arrows some way would agree there's hope for you let's go hunting [Music] looook I I studied poetry with you uncle Lord Shiva is focused on defeating the mongol khan and taking back our island he is a great

victory and lets her guard down then we strike sacrifice he or she Springs for Tomoya the sacrifice is worth it Tomoya would agree Sensei finds a guy she will attack from the north we should focus our efforts there scout elevated positions place arrows and listen did you hear that one arrow one death [Music] [Music] I wondered when Tom or his new friends with visits if the point was to kill us she would have sent more men or the point was not to kill but to delay he or she springs the attack is starting this way if I fall today promise me you'll keep hunting Tomoya I promise so say she knows you're my students your death will destroy my legacy your way of the bull will survive with me where wilt Amoy strike in the back town near the waterfalls the most vulnerable points if you get there

sight we will deal with them yes my Lords good sidelines over here the Mongo's won't be able to flank us we don't have much time what can we use to our advantage not many options you'll exploit the ones we have those barrels could do some damage dry grass lower the Mongols in will make sure you have flaming arrows bullets nests excellent distraction take these flaming arrows and try not to burn

he wasn't your student which is it I was young prideful callous you don't already learn from my example he led a rebellion to seize the Klan and lost but only after butchering Lord negaal was best men hironori didn't die fighting bandits that was a story to protect Nagar whose legacy there was no saving mine there's his teacher I could never be trusted again why I was granted the mercy to resign my position I convinced myself the way of the ball had to survive but the truth is I am a coward who should have ended it long ago you told somewhere all of this I wanted her to understand what it meant for me to teach again I liked everything else she turned it against me you'll never redeem you don't only now go and you won't change to more but today you save the people of he or she Springs with my

my lord what did you do nothing the Mongols have taken all our food rice millet fish anything they can lay hands on we're starving you say we this isn't your farm I have been thinking about what you said and I'm trying to help the farmers here where the Mongols kempt who knows they show up every few days and pick up the food and card it away I could ambush them it's not that simple they've taken hostages if we don't produce the food it's oh there must be a way to find them there is you won't like it I will decide that for myself come I'll show you they make us bundle the food and put it on the beach all of it from this farm the farm scavenging abandoned homes fishing and hunting just to fill the bellies of the enemy you could have run I've made my share of mistakes but I am trying to change food and drink for the Mongols but this socket barrel is empty your plan is to anger the Mongols more not exactly the barrel is a very roomy it could hold a heavily armed heroic someone what would fit better a flabby flexible sucker merchants the Mongols will take the barrel to the heart of their camp who could do more good there me or you I don't know why I keep letting you hide me inside things because it works this smells like your breath in here Kenzi ready my lord here they come would dig intelligent - yes yes all yours take think laughter Murray God no no no that's me cook

tried to kind of deal with the Mongols looks like I that was amazing Kenji you suck his swilling piece of monkey dung I'll handle this explain yourself I might have sold the Mongols food but given them straw and wood chips instead to make a profit to save the farmers food you didn't think the Mongols would notice not so quickly all of a sudden it was punishment hostages give us food or we kill you I was wrong to encourage you to make yourself useful what no no no you weren't wrong okay I can't do good I just need practice try not to practice when people's lives are at stake yes my lord
