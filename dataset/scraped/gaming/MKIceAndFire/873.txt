hope adds almost no time to your journey oh you rub that chip any harder it'll wear away to nothing how long have you been sober a few days shy of three months impressive i heard the first 90 days are

serious james worry too much about that kid i can't deal with this right now another surprise you can't deal with anything when would be the right time you're making a mountain out of a molehill getting yourself worked up for nothing for nothing single-handedly keeping our family together as far from nothing in my book i could use a little help maybe if we'd had kids of our own none of this would be happening that's a real low blow don't you get how tough you're not the only one feels pressure the factory situation is serious anne real serious not right now not tonight no way tanya's late she always is these days at least one of us is out having a give her a break it's him i'm worried about that guy's no good for her all that new age [ __ ] reminds me some creepy cult he came in last week we shot the breeze a little bit i like him that one's a classic legendary vinyl quit pawing at it hey bigfoot mind the goddamn vinyl will ya come on man take some time off from being a dick and give her a break okay mother superior why are you always sticking up for her anyway damn ice i'm going to start climbing through the window unless that door gets fixed how's things let me guess he's been pumping iron again they've been at each of his throats since dad got home what's it about this time he nearly fell through the front door some dad we got huh they're always fighting these days getting predictable like a record that keeps playing over and over dennis for the 10 millionth time will you shift that [ __ ] of yours up into the attic some respect this is a valuable rare and sought after collection i think she was a marine sergeant of past life he's being even more annoying than usual tonight a real jerk so what else is new hey dennis hey not now sis i'm busy hey quit acting crazy oh jesus you scared me sweetheart i heard you talking about me not now megan i'd like to have a bath in peace take a break from this mad house for a while maybe you should talk to mom and dad it's not a great idea for me to get involved you know what i'm like i just upset someone they sounded more serious than the usual [ __ ] they were talking about megan she's done something bad i can't say i'm surprised there is definitely something off with megan i don't get why everyone keeps picking on her okay mr shining knight in armor where's the little princess anyway probably better to leave megan alone as her big sister it is my sworn legal duty to check in on her right sure like you're the law around here she went upstairs i'll go find her back that went right between chambers legs it was about six inches off the ice and she was starting to go down right back to brian watson he pulls in his block by green on a big plane now comes boston here's a lead past edison stop you need to keep an eye on your little sister mom is real worried about her i can't imagine why growing up with such a great and supportive family you want to try raising a family like this the devil himself would struggle with you guys um so son of a [ __ ] clock wow wow megan is in even more trouble than i thought so perfect distraction from this madhouse anthony where the hell are you anthony where are you goddammit anthony i'm getting really pissed off anthony i swear if you don't answer me you could be right about my family i think so too tanya what's going on that little brat locked me out it's [ __ ] freezing i'll let you back in go easy on megan hold on [ __ ] megan you in there the kitchen's on fire are you [ __ ] serious megan where the hell is everybody anthony help anthony hey i'm here what the [ __ ] are you doing up there i got trapped in the attic get to the balcony anthony help hey john i can't breathe oh we have to get out now oh tanya hold on i gotta get megan out it ugh uh what have you done hello and welcome back i have a new story for you it's very different to the last disconcerting no i'm sure there's nothing to worry about this particular story isn't fully fleshed out it's only part written and the choices you make will complete it the fire no there was nothing you could have done about that what's happened has happened or has it anyway look to the future i say life's but a walking shadow eh you are about to enter a confusing perhaps disturbing world how disturbing might depend on what you choose to believe and how confusing on the path you choose to take there are an infinite number of directions in which one could travel we seldom have all the information that we'd like but we have to choose our path nonetheless and hope that we get the clarity and the outcomes that we want as in life your decisions will matter the choices you make will affect others you've seen how the story starts so much death how many more deaths is entirely up to you it depends on the decisions that you make what are you rational emotional do you trust your head or your heart there is no right answer sometimes one is best and sometimes the other my advice for what it's worth is to thine own self be true but i'm here simply to record what you do not to help you i'm not supposed to interfere you see not my place apparently but i am apparently allowed to share wise words from great storytellers that have gone before where i feel that that would be appropriate oh one final thing before i let you go there are pictures in little hope that will if found show you a vision of a possible future something that may or may not happen use them they might help you you have a funeral to attend off you go have fun i do enjoy a good funeral none of us here today can understand why this tragic accident happened but we can take comfort from the knowledge that the family are together for eternity in god's loving embrace uh ugh where the hell's daniel i can't find him i don't know instead of goofing around you want to lend a hand here how is he doing anyway it doesn't look that serious could be concussed okay professor or should i call you doctor now maybe the cops someone like that i already tried once but i'm on it hey andrew buddy how you doing where are we what happened yeah the bus crashed we're okay though just shaken up if you say so i don't remember being in any crash you're probably in shock maybe a mild concussion in there too give yourself some time stay here don't move [ __ ] thing useless piece of crap may as well be dead okay take it easy we'll figure out what to do ah [ __ ] where's my phone hey anyone up there hey daniel that you john good to hear you daniel taylor you okay i'm good we're fine too thanks for asking you okay down there i'm all right nothing i can't deal with hey john any idea what caused the crash not sure looked like the driver swerved to avoid something in the road he down there by the way nope no sign of him weird he isn't up here either can you get back up to us looks pretty steep i see a trail down here i could try great take the trail should take you to the road we can regroup there that's a plan see you soon oh hey taylor help me get andrew up on his feet will ya wait i don't remember anything who are you it's okay you're concussed i'm john you're a college professor we were taking a bus on a field trip but that didn't work out so well crash wasn't on the curriculum uh we'll find the others get some help think of it as a character building exercise teamwork at its finest i had this dream it was so real flames all around us it was grim that bang on the head must have been a beauty that trail the others are on will come out down the road we'll meet them there we should talk this through why leave the bus not like we have somewhere better to wait no we could be here all night our best move is to get to the others then head towards town see if we can find some help where's the driver shouldn't he be back by now the driver's done what we should be doing gone into town for help he could just as easily have banged his head and walked off the other way fine you can stay right here i'll go myself hey professor he is a professor right i'm still fuzzy can we stick together i don't want to wait on my own i guess he's right we should all stick together i got no signal either must be some kind of black spot or you didn't pay your last bill you get that during the crash guess so who crawled up the professor's ass i think you should show him a little more respect he thinks he's smarter than us but book smart is no good out here he's all up himself acting like the big man on campus you know this place little hope no i mean i don't think so you should both know little hope why should i have heard of this place seriously this place is steeped in history fascinating stuff how do you know all this stuff anyway i'm a professional academic i read books unlike some easy einstein i can match everything you got with just a smartphone why your phone isn't so smart without a signal good to see you too finally everything okay sure we took the scenic route you sure as hell took your own sweet time he's getting worried i bet you were this gate is chained we can't get through look around see if there's anything we can use to break it think this will do it ready i'll push hard from my side ready three two one push yeah that's what i'm talking about great job you two what's the plan now i already said i want to wait at the bus for help not head into town like john wants and we've already concluded this conversation not with everyone here we didn't we should vote on it no need for a vote decisions made just because you're a professor you don't get to call the shots we're all adults here some of us are more adult than others i'm sorry but we really don't have time to be arguing you'll stay here with me won't you uh looks like he ain't so keen after all if you got something to say to me spit it out john's right heading into town is our quickest way to find help satisfied sure whatever you say try to be civil costs nothing that's rich given how you bad mouth taylor on the way over what did you say about me you always get your boyfriend to stick up for you try doing it yourself sometime dear i'm not wasting another breath on you quit it will you the last thing we need is you causing trouble keep out of our business okay we are wasting valuable time here can we please just keep moving i'm still not sure heading into town is such a great idea i'm going to hang out by the bus while you all do whatever you have to you want to come along and wait with me okay i still think the smart move is for us all to stick together be glad we didn't stick together after we flagged down a car and come rescue your ass you get lost no we're back here this doesn't add up this is some very weird [ __ ] going on here spare us all first he loses his pride then he loses his way what are you trying to say that you've lost it it's not possible look i don't know what you're trying to prove here but we've got better things to do daniel watch out quit [ __ ] around and tell me what's going on here the two of us will go together this is getting ridiculous indulge me what what i walked away from you we're trapped here there's no way out i don't understand she's right we walk dead straight going away from you so how'd we end up back here okay let's try something we'll all go together we came from that direction we must be able to go back that way i want everyone to stay real close no stragglers you want to put us on a kid's line okay okay i'm coming i admit that is a little odd more than a little see what did i tell you it's just like i've been saying we are trapped we can't leave here no okay calm down breathe there's a rational explanation for what's happening maybe we all died in the crash yeah nice theory but i'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking last i checked you were schooling us on creative writing not metaphysics i know who i'd like to be kicking this is all down to you this pissy little field trip now we're stuck here in little no hope that is way out of line i had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash you can't put that on me are you for [ __ ] real watch your tone will you i am doing my best to understand this just like you and the rest of us i'm sorry i don't get what's happening to us i don't understand it's like you said we're trapped in a nightmare it's okay we're gonna be just fine we'll figure a way out of this together someone else thinks they can do a better job step right up maybe it isn't real we have to get out of here right i need to think straight football can everyone just shut up this isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here he's right bitching at each other isn't getting us anywhere we have to work together as a team thank you now let's be logical the fog is between us and the bus there is no fog between us and town so let's head that way i don't get how heading further away from the bus helps there is nothing on the bus we can use to get help in town there will be people a working phone something it pains me to admit but he's right there's nowhere else we can go except into that damn town sounds like a plan to me you leaving me where are you going come on let's go with them until we know what's up we should stick together how'd you get that bruise no biggie must have got it when the bus crashed why did you say we might all be dead you really think that's possible i saw some cable show about how your brain keeps going for a while after you you die forget about it what they said didn't really stack up i don't like the look of that place at all maybe they won't ask for id i'm not sure this is such a great idea we should check it out there could be a phone inside i'll go in and take a look around go ahead we'll be right behind you why aren't we going with those guys angela knows there's something between us that's obvious we're really going to get into this now like we've got no other bigger [ __ ] to deal with tonight this is a big deal for me anyhow i'm telling you angela is on to us she knows what did you two talk about she was digging around like she always does what exactly did you tell her back there relax i said nothing about us i'm not ready to go public about us yet i will be soon i promise anything i can do to help convince you i'm the right guy i need to know 100 i can rely on you that you'll never let me down we should catch up with the others we standing here all night or are we going inside uh hi there how you doing excuse me but we're uh looking for our bus driver what have you seen him yeah that's funny what is what's up with the fog outside it's pretty weird yeah sure is a thick one tonight so thick it's stopping us from leaving yeah yeah i know that feeling you mean you're sorry for busting in like this um bus we were on crashed a little way back up the road there we're still a little shaken up we're still a lot shaken up you certainly look shook up i'm vince i need a mirror maybe there's one here not covered in 20 years sounds like you could use a drink better not thanks i need to keep a clear head it's right there if you change your mind not for me why are you even here little hope sure isn't the town it used to be what are you doing in here alone i'm sure you have a good reason to be here right yeah i got my reasons for being here you wanted it not the sharing type do i look like i'm a big talker let's just leave him be but all kinds in his play what is this guy's problem there's definitely something off about him he's harmless just had one too many let's look around there must be something here that can help us see what you can dig up ah he's in a world of his own an old dart sport i was pretty good back in the day stay play a little no problem i'm gonna take a look around you need an umbilical cord for something funny at least i'm looking for a way out what are you just a quick throw and then we'll figure out how we're getting out of here try for a big double not my first time daniel shooting for double 20. okay so you can play a little still got it now for triple 20. well almost an olympic shot after the night we've had they don't play darts in the olympics that is one hell of a shot you did better than taylor let's get back to why we came in here this place has some great history yes hmm i vaguely remember what happened here all the factories closed down i can't believe it these guys could be relatives hey this way let's get out of here and you all hear that i definitely heard something did you hear that as well come on whatever it was came from outside i really think it's smart to go back outside there's nothing for us here we need to move on best of luck hope you found what you're looking for it's coming from the town did the old [ __ ] just lock us out he was weird that old guy sure was something off about him why come to creepy central just to get a top up what does that mean i have a bad feeling about this we'll figure it out the way this fog just appears it's not natural so what the hell is this thing looks like some kind of effigy a warning perhaps or some other spiritual significance whatever it is it gives me the creeps i don't know i'm kind of curious about it i've heard more than enough thank you are you the superstitious type i never believed in this kind of thing doesn't seem like you can say the same i'm not superstitious but stuff like what happened to us with the fog let's uh catch up with the rest i don't want to spend any more time with this disgusting thing can you two make an effort to keep up hey can you come over here what's wrong i just saw someone in the woods i can't see anyone i definitely saw someone 100 sorry i don't buy it nobody would be out here at this ungodly hour fine don't believe me you two we need to stick close what the hell did you hear that what on earth is that okay very good we're freaked who's there whoever you are this isn't funny at all john where are you daniel taylor come on john where are you this isn't funny hey wait for us what is that hey come and check this out what on earth is that not a clue for me what is your name sir um andrew and drew and your name lady who the hell are you why are you dressed like that i am called mary i fashioned her with my own hand she looks just like the one beside you would you kindly come play with me affection for you will be shaken looks when he learns of your infidelity with the devil come back here there's someone else out here by the fire what i i don't see any fire i saw them too are you okay how can you not have seen that i couldn't see anything through this impossible impenetrable fog well go ahead tell them what we saw a little girl appeared out of the fog and then just like that she was gone again what is going on maybe the fog has got you confused we're all stressed out stressed my ass i saw a girl dancing right here clear as day said her name was mary looked exactly like the girl in my dream but she talked in this really weird accent was that even american i'm not sure i couldn't place her accent either what have we gotten ourselves into this kid mary did she want to hurt you no i don't think she meant to hurt me now what seems our only option is the road into town you're kidding me got a better idea thought not well that escalated rather quickly everything that one does or doesn't do in one's life will catch up with one eventually don't you think don't look at me i can't help you remember we sometimes congratulate ourselves on waking from a troubled dream it may be so the moment after death on my travels over many years i've witnessed many things seen and heard many beliefs and there's usually some element of truth in each of them these unfortunate folks seem to be dealing with forces as yet unexplained i mean sinister movements in the forest spirits from the past a little girl who may be in trouble or maybe she simply is trouble anyway where are we angela isn't getting much title tattle out of taylor no kiss and tell what about john the figure of authority perhaps or perhaps he represents something else and then there's andrew somewhat confused i think a bump to the head can do that let me reassure you you helped make some decisions that will be valued later on and some that may turn out to be regrettable that fellow in the bar he was less than helpful more than a little rude if you ask me clearly something disturbing on his mind enough there's something not quite right in little hope and souls may be in peril off you go again see if you can lift the fog find the bus driver that little girl she sounded so strange i could barely understand her she sure sounded like she wasn't from anywhere around here i'm tempted to say she sounded more like she was from another time than another place you're right so so might get a better view from up there this how are you coping i don't know what do you think happened to us back there i feel like we're in danger there's something very off about this place yeah i hear you what is out there we will find a way out of here we have to i hope you're right appreciate you checking in with me could this have something to do with what we saw that would explain it she there's something up ahead which way can we move it amen to that look at that hey wait stop i'm just gonna say it this is exactly what goes down in horror movies what the hell do we do now i'll deal with this stay right here hold up i'll come with you hey youtube this is not good hey anyone there hello anyone get off me john what is it you want from me who are you what are you doing here these are most troubling times wait don't go stay away what the hell are you what do you want it's impossible a black tone full of riddles i will not succumb to a witch's spell please lord i beg you rid me of these apparitions who are you this can't be happening fix your gears elsewhere you are no husband of mine let's get into town it's not so far now and it's our best shot at getting help you guys okay i am very far from okay i am terrified and confused i just saw my own double in the fog what happened in there this woman came out of nowhere in the fog dressed like an extra from salem she was garbling something in an accent i didn't recognize and most disturbing of all she was the spitting image of me how is that even possible you're blowing this out of proportion angela i am all done here seems the fog won't let us go anywhere except into the center of town bog decides where we can and can't go [ __ ] that i'm trying another way don't you kids watch horror movies you never ever split up these movies are dumb and i'm going this way without you maybe splitting up isn't such a good idea taylor no way am i going down there i'm a john i'm with andrew the town isn't so far we all go in together not out granny no one asked you okay time out can we all just take a breath think about what our next move is we can check out more options if we split up i'll go with taylor it's not safe for you to be hanging around here on your own two teams are more likely to find a way out which is what we all want right i guess you're right if the fog lets you through and you find help send them into town to find us got a feeling we'll find help faster than the others as long as somebody does that's all that matters hold up you hear that thanks are we okay here we're good that noise was just the old guy from the bar on his bike stupid old drunk uh somewhere around here there must be an easier way back up to the road let's move out you got an explanation for what we saw nothing that makes sense i do know there were witch trials and little hope around the same time as salem what happened you can figure that out for yourself what the hell was that now what what's up you look worried are you okay yeah thanks i am more or less but something here just ah what we've been through and seen tonight is difficult to stomach we all have our own way of coping john here feels the urge to be our leader the alpha male whereas daniel and taylor feel an entirely different somewhat more animalistic urge are you saying what i think you're saying grow up a little andrew if you were stuck with taylor you would be no different we have bigger things to worry about we do i'm not sure we're really getting anywhere we should catch up with john are you okay feels like angela is constantly weighing me up and finding me lacking i feel responsible for everyone here you are all in my care how would you handle all this in my position i guess i'd try to stay positive do my best that's all anyone could do not sure my best is up to dealing with whatever is going on around us tonight what we saw back there you think that was really supernatural and sure starting to look that way creepy little girl in the fog then whatever the hell that was back at the intersection just because i can't explain what we saw doesn't mean we have to reach the most extreme conclusion that's kind of what happened in little hope during the witch trials they made bad decisions based on very little hard evidence what's happening now is nothing like what happened back then don't be so fast to dismiss what i'm telling you i don't like the sound of that it's nothing to worry about [ __ ] wait what is it what's wrong we saw something moving in there what exactly are you up to i'm just taking a look here isn't this breaking and entering i won't tell if you don't anyhow there's no one here okay yes you all done with poking around found this inside the hell are you doing with a gun i was heading under the floor you should have left it there guns are dangerous we're already in enough trouble i'm keeping it this is one crazy night we're having and who knows we could need this what we don't need is to get someone killed i'll be careful i promise men and guns make sure the damn thing stays in your pants i don't want to see it again what kind of place is this professor andrew here is packing what a gun are you crazy why didn't you make this such a big deal and rap me out to john i detest guns they are dangerous and unnecessary i'm disappointed you don't get that whatever if the gun makes you feel safe keep the damn thing i really don't care anymore this place is our best shot there must be a radio or a working phone inside maybe even our driver too look around for something we can break the glass with so give me that i'll smash the window no problem i can do this okay if you're sure anyone can do this not anyone putting a rock through a window at 10 paces anyone can make the shot if you're feeling under pressure let someone else do it i'm not feeling pressure just saying can you stop talking will you just get on with it the frame will have rotted away and the glass will fall out on its own before you two have finished don't strike we'll make a ballplayer out of you yet do you think a rookie could make a shot like that looks safe enough piece of cake you're up next you believe that woman really looked like angela i don't know what john saw and i don't intend on sticking around to find out what's that noise i'm sure it's nothing no surprise that didn't sell who'd want land in this godforsaken town i wonder what closed the school down forget about that even if you make it over there's no way i'm following i never did like school let's get out of here oh looks like there's no way through i might have made a bad call here don't stress it no one made us come this way we'll find another way so huh hey are you okay who are you what are you doing here something is real off about this whole thing this the same little kid angela and andrew saw before i have no clue whoa you can't be doing that what are you talking about get away or you will find me come on out mary i know very well you're in there please no let me go i will release you once i am sure you will not speak of our secret your childish games tire me you will respect me and you will say nothing no let go of her right now what spell have you cast i am frozen to my mouth nothing amy is the caster of spells she is the one in league with the devil i saw her in the forest together with her familiars i am innocent i will have the truth one way or another you come with me girl thank you kindly silent child can someone tell me what just happened those two kids have to be linked somehow no way that's a coincidence i i don't get it let's not hang around here it's time to go right with you i'm glad you're here both of us are getting out of here you'll see could mean someone's around maybe they can help let's head over let me help you i don't think this takes us out of this shitty town there's no road must lead somewhere though i'm not so sure there's barely even a path so yes place must have been a grocery store or something over here look at this back didn't work out too well let's just find another way what are you doing help me push this will you seriously there's no other way i've got no choice now what give me a leg up i'm going for the stairwell seriously you're going in there well do you have a better suggestion sure don't go into an old dark creepy ass building after the night we've had i'll be as fast as i can if you see anything weird just yell i'll come running okay will do be right back promise i need your phone what for flashlight it's dark in there please be quick throw it to me i'm in is it safe think so yes so you hello anyone there come on will you huh hello who's there hey can't get through this window is all boarded up how did you get here anyway went around the side threw a fence so i climbed into this haunted house for nothing the gap in the fence wasn't so big you would have got stuck how is it in there this place is creeping me out it's full of old ass useless [ __ ] head to the front i'll meet you there sure thing hold on i'll be right there oh come on we need a break here will you relax i'm coming angela how's how the back door is locked what troubles you tell me what is happening sooner will come for me calm yourself who is coming for you the talking about me there are accusations accusations of what sorts you talk that i'm in league with the devil that i'm guilty of witchcraft there's no sense in that it would say such a thing i cannot rightly say stay where you are fine just tell me what's happening how did i get here and where the [ __ ] is here you are privy to the rumors about my wife amy what i don't know you john open the door joseph this instant something ails you what it seemed changed even your retire just if this ends badly if you do not open up you will be in contempt of our warrant what plan do we have i will resolve this my word on it do not admit them reverend carver marshall i have here a legally written warrant for the arrest of amy my wife has done nothing wrong there is a witness to your wife speaking in tongues who accuses my wife mary the word of a child condemns my wife you will deliver yourself into the martial's hands for your own good then i must accompany her she will not leave my sight such action will not aid your wife's cause trust injustice do not fear i will find a way to resolve this so where the hell have you been you look freaked what's up you saw something else right this was different i think they could see and hear me it was hard to tell exactly they seemed really spooked you see anything else priest the one from the playground i don't know it didn't make much sense you're kidding me no he was real scared like he believed the devil was in little hope holy [ __ ] what in the hell are we mixed up in here we've really screwed up here instead of getting out of this awful place we're right back in the middle of town what do you think let's take a look around see what we can find there you go we'll be on our way from little hope while the others are still m.i.a in the woods ah this place is a real dump even for this [ __ ] town something up yeah there's something kind of familiar about this place you got a big-time criminal past we don't know about serial jaywalker these small town police stations all look the same there's got to be a phone in here someplace you're deluded if you think there's anything here place is dead just like the rest of little hope yes real nice keep looking [ __ ] thing i thought this was her way out there's got to be something we have a winner found a phone this could be our way out mine's dead [ __ ] whoa hey take it easy can you stop reacting to every setback like a child look here the cable is missing i there's got to be a cable here someplace don't give up i feel we're about to find something what is that what do you think answer it i can do this be careful don't stress it professor i should not be here this day as dundee and falsely accused what can you hear yeah she sounds real upset you have to calm whoever it is down you'll get nothing if they're hysterical can you tell me what you're upset about as i walked a man and a woman appeared at my front i had not seen them approach i reached out in fear i did not know them their closet manner of speaking we're not familiar to me help me out here what the hell is going on with you okay okay okay stay cool stay cool can you at least tell me where you are you have no authority over me come here girl i would speak with you you cannot talk of our secret eternal damnation awaits if you do we have an understanding do we not no evil words shall leave my lips should you breathe a word or the edge of a word about the other things then i will come to you in the black of some terrible night and bring a reckoning that will shoot you now reverend let us begin enough time has gone begging go be with your kin i beseech this court and good judge wyman do not be fooled by the protestations of the accused the devil is the master of deceit all his servants feign innocence they can do little else i solemnly swear before god i am innocent of all accusations against push now hear me what the hell should we do we need to stay quiet we just let this play out see what happens i mean no offense reverend cava i do not believe any of my neighbors those who know me best will speak out against me they know who i am that i side with the righteous i will not be caught in the web of your deception the devil hides himself where he has least experts is no devil's play thing reverend i beg the coach's forgiveness but i stand by my statement my wife amy is innocent i respectfully ask this good court to pay no mind to the words of a man whose very home is foul with the stench of brimstone i beg you good judge let us conclude our business here without further ado lest we afford the forces of darkness the opportunity to bend these proceedings to their will no mary mary my sister what ails you stay out of this what have you done to this child you have bound an innocent girl into a pact with the devil himself the poor creature seems possessed no doubt you're doing it's not true reverend why have you trained against me sir we will see the truth of it amy lay your hands on mary let us see what occurs if i am correct your touch will release her from this affliction it must be so if you were the one who bewitched her leave her alone who speaks who's there god preserve us this is too late they are here among us they are here among us what more proof is needed that the devil walks among us take heed and pray the devil is here in this very room protect yourselves seek out the lord what the hell was that [ __ ] was that for real didn't the witch trials happen centuries ago most of them over 300 years ago then how come we just saw one like i say i have no good explanation that little girl who had some kind of seizure what do you think was going on there i know that little girl she's the one me and angela saw back in the woods that woman my double what's she looking at if the trial goes against her the sentence for confirmed witches in little hope was always brutal violent death drowning hanging burning and let's hope she is or was found innocent accusations were often malicious made by someone with a grudge or by meddling liars like that little girl who took perverse pleasure in poisoning their own communities come on she's just some little kid who most likely doesn't get how big a deal the whole thing is she knows exactly how serious it is hey the woman on trial angela 2.0 she seemed like she saw us and so did some of the others you're right about that they definitely saw us a little kid just seeing us appear out of nowhere could easily believe that was witchcraft especially back then dream up all the excuses you want for that little kid i don't trust her one little bit we can't explain how we happen to see each other how do you expect some little girl from 300 years ago to wrap her head around it that woman my double was very distressed almost traumatized yeah it was tough to watch for sure i noticed something else weird her husband he looked a lot like you professor the two people with that little brat looked just like daniel and taylor what the hell does all this mean who's that hey professor you in there come on let's go hey taylor we're in here we can't open the damn doors we can't either they must be locked let's all try to force the handle in three two one taylor hey professor find anything that could get us out of here nothing that's going to help us much but i found this it's kind of neat i don't believe it i saw this exact keychain in my dream that's pretty weird it's more than weird it's significant i just don't know how still think splitting up was a smart move i would say i'm now more open to exploring other options i'm glad you two are finding this funny personally i think we're in deep [ __ ] here you know what happened to your devil right she was accused of witchcraft not just accused tried found guilty and condemned we need to know what that woman is facing what's going to happen to her next i like the idea but how would we even begin to find that out we've already been down those paths maybe the answer lies down the one path we haven't taken yet what the hell this is [ __ ] crazy we have no clue what we're getting ourselves into the trial the strange girl angela's double feels like it's all building towards something only question is are we headed someplace good or bad and bad is probably very very bad this fog is getting worse why would our bus be diverted this way makes no sense no surprise there maybe the fog was the reason for the diversion we were never meant to make it out of here i can't see for [ __ ] oh jesus water looks black i don't want to go anywhere near it okay who's first up huh professor you keep telling us you're in charge so okay sure thing is it safe to cross don't stress the professor and me will make sure you get across no problem right we'll we'll get you over for sure huh hey my god what do we do we can't stay here in this year of our lord 1692 we are here present to bear witness to adjust execution no amy is declared guilty of consorting with the devil and is to be drowned as a witch and sorceress let us pray in silence for our soul i've done no wrong i am no witch i do not deserve death i'll thank you i don't know how to help you tell me what i can do lisa you must help me you must the devil is in the wind seeking to help his own he would release her from the chains isaac let us conclude our business here swiftly the will of the court must be imposed before it's too late the devil fortifies her you must bind it tightly you cannot do this isaac i am fill send this switch back into the lap of a master lest he come for us all little hope is already lost shrouded in evil but knows you claim from witchcraft our outside demons we are poisoned from within you will not save yourself with riddles there is no riddle the devil takes many forms you know that better than any if little hope he has hid himself under a shroud of innocence taken the form of a child by accuser while mary still draws breath a little hope remains beyond salvation delish your evil reference see your very face isaac huh what did you see tell me i don't know how to tell you what i just saw your double was pushed into the river in chains she drowned all right i'll go first okay you two get on down here what the hell is that what is that thing [ __ ] don't leave me behind give me your hand here hold on hold on i'm coming back for you john hold on reach up and grab my hand jump up and grab onto me okay i trust you ah phew that was really quite close for angela she was almost lost to a fate worse than death not that there's anything particularly wrong with death well done not a soul lost so far things could have been quite different as the stakes seem to have been elevated that gun might prove to be a lifesaver don't you think the precise opposite the boys have some interesting theories maybe you're choosing to believe daniel's theory that they're already dead my dream was lengthened after life oh then began the tempest to myself i passed me thought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write off onto the kingdom of perpetual night it's possible i suppose maybe the bus driver can shed some light this must be very confusing for you right now doppelgangers witches ghosts death and demons what could possibly tie all of these souls together i dare say we'll find out hmm i have been granted permission to give you a single hint tempted okay then we will once again turn to the bard for some cryptic inspiration i met him once you know i meet everybody once act five scene one where cleomanese begs leontes to forgive himself for causing the death of hermione do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself go on then as terrifying as it might be you should get back to it wait what in the name of holy [ __ ] was that i've never seen anything like it it was like something from a nightmare did you see the way it looked the gaping mouth those dead soulless eyes whatever it was it's gone now i was nearly gone if that thing had caught me it was so close you've had the crap scared out of you we all have but at least we got the [ __ ] away from it we did thank god we're all okay right now we're safe that thing whatever the [ __ ] it was is still out there could be hunting us as we speak it was in chains just like the woman who went in the water i don't believe that's coincidence either of you see what happened to taylor and daniel they can't be far behind us let's just get out of here can we keep moving i don't feel safe here let's stay away from that bridge i'm all for putting as much distance between us and that hideous thing as we can pretty sure daniel and taylor would be thinking the same thing out of sight quick best to keep out of his way i reckon we should talk about what the woman said before they drowned her the little girl has to be stopped she was talking about stopping the witch trials right i'm not sure come on let's go i'll go in and take a look around how you doing i'm wondering if that thing could be coming after us don't think it's coming after us what makes you so sure you and me gotta stay real close now when you say close how close exactly this close a little closer a little bit more what's that noise didn't hear anything i don't like this i want to go another way don't think there is another way quite the tourist trail not a place i want to revisit hey over here you gotta check this out that thing could still be around here in the water no we left that thing way behind we must have oh [ __ ] you're going first right you a half what i do better if you lead i'm not crossing this crapped out bridge no way to find the others we got across we got no choice fine i'm heading across you can follow me if the bridge is still standing okay then so what the hell is that you see this let's get out of here daniel get your hands off it mary mary mary i am over this way mary the fountain of all evil is here what what evil you know what's going on here we sure as hell don't you scare us after death speak to me of death this day i have pulled my wife's body from a watery grave and buried her in the ground with my aunts all this because of her mary who in the hell are you why do you look just like john i have no answers for you perhaps i'm already under a witch's i found him how did you come by this fashioned with my own hand i'd take it to protect you suspicion and betrayal walks side by side in little up no one is safe please nothing no working phone anywhere okay so it looks like we really are trapped here still no sign of him nope not yet i just hope they're both okay i figured we'd have found the bus driver by now i wonder where he's at why can't you leave us alone i think she wants us to go after her you want to follow her she could be leading us into danger even a trap the two girls we've seen one is from the past this one is from here and now maybe the girl we're seeing here is somehow a mirror image of the girl from the 17th century don't you want to wait for daniel and taylor if they were coming this way they'd be here by now stay loose who knows what's up ahead hey wait for us ugh disgusting guys you there ugh it's not stopping oh please god ah uh wow angela [ __ ] no what did she do to deserve that it's just you and me now until taylor and daniel get to us hey there's something blocking the door give me a hand will ya huh this place is a museum of some kind she in there this doesn't feel right stay focused we're not having a rerun of what just happened to angela you sure about that i'll do whatever it takes to keep us both safe once we're out of here we'll hook up with the others that's if they're still alive why is this kid out here on her own it's strange maybe she's linked to mary somehow gotta be though how and why i'm not sure of yet um so um hey take a look at this seen this before where on the road outside that shitty little bar we stopped at angela me saw it laying there picked it up right before that kid mary scared us for the first time interesting you think she maybe led us here wanted us to see this let's take a proper look what the hell professor there are many many stories about how spirits can attach themselves to objects sure in movies take it easy will you what if mary's spirit is somehow attached to this thing we burn it and this could all end right here look at it another way maybe by burning her precious things it's just gonna piss the kid off you might be right yes this is what the truth is so real people right now right and this kid mary who snitched on everyone that's got to be the girl we're seeing we can get out this way where'd that little girl get to she let us in here and then disappeared maybe that was her plan all along lead us to the puppet job done i'm not sure about that almost out of juice no signal out here anyway you hear that maybe hurt something not sure what guys professor that you in there can we just get out of here where the hell are the others probably as lost as us you think they're looking for us could be angela's got no interest in finding me that's for sure she's got a mean streak all right but she's got some heart you sure about that yeah i've known her for a long time longer than any of you all right 10 bucks says no one's home i'm not touching that still first place we've seen in a while find a way in like you found a way into that store you a burglar in your spare time no but i wasn't a past life not getting through this way hey taylor check this out check what out don't think anyone's visited for a long time oh yeah and that's ten bucks you want me don't owe you squat i never took the bet fair enough it's loose i can jimmy this open no problem we can have a big power but who goes in first but we both know what's gonna happen right sure thing easy now tough guy don't beat up the scary doll funny get your ass in here come on this way these things look so real they're freaking me out what's up i just i just saw something where the hell are you going you sure this is a good move nope oh where are you taylor taylor you okay what's going on god come on god what happened i heard voices i saw my [ __ ] self looking back at me dressed all weird speaking funny i mean what the [ __ ] well you go walking around on your own like that and [ __ ] happens off daniel i thought you had my back this is so [ __ ] up this woman the one who looked like me they just dragged her out like some kind of criminal i mean [ __ ] let's get out of here i hear that i found a knife maybe it was a knife once when dinosaurs roamed the earth think we should bring it along here you take it uh why it's obvious dummy self-defense you take it you know just in case come on this way out oh hello things becoming any clearer for you that thing whatever it is just keeps coming for angela unrelenting i do hope she's okay another instrument of death added to the group's collection good work let me help you out give you one little hint well then how can i put this we each have our own demons they are hours and hours alone and they are often born out of regret i'll leave you now with some wise words from a great irish playwright i once met in paris i believe never judge anyone shortly every saint has a past and every sinner has a future she's just a child let's speak again later looks like we've locked out here back on the road the professor and the others can't be far hope you're right we've been [ __ ] out of luck so far tonight the woman who looks like me what did she do to be taken like that not a great omen for sure but nothing's gonna happen to you i'll make sure that even the writers here don't have happy endings sure looks that way what i saw back there was unreal i get that but but [ __ ] this whole night has been messed up since we crashed thanks for having my back this here we go we're the first tourists this place has seen for a long long time why would anyone come here anyway this place is a real ghost town so where the hell is that coming from i don't know yes get over here this isn't possible i know those markings this is my old tire swing look here see hey hey it's okay it's okay it's not okay you don't get it see these stars i painted them onto this tire with my dad when i was 10 years old you sure hell yes i'm sure this is my tire swing how come it's out here campy just looks the same it's just a coincidence can you listen to what i'm saying here this town knows me hey hey look at me look at me we're getting through this okay together this is not my doing you must help me i beg you please help me before it is too late push now woman only the almighty can forgive your sin that is your only hope of salvation listen to me i have committed no sin the puppet i am condemned for is a child's play thing nothing more i swear the sickness you brought into our midst must be purged to free all of us and you from evil you must burn i thank you stop do not who has been led astray by the devil and do with it as you will oh the woman we just saw it was me that means i'm next nothing bad is going to happen to you i'll make sure that thanks i'm glad you're here let's keep on going to the church that's likely where the rest are yeah sure i guess my feels like we're being followed we are being followed hey get the [ __ ] out of here back the [ __ ] off will you oh oh crap what the [ __ ] is that move run ugh uh ugh ugh keep moving go you hear that is that taylor taylor is that you back there get to the church run hey one of those [ __ ] things is after get inside go come on move it hey run get inside what the hell are you doing hey are you crazy you're trying to get yourself killed get in here hey where's angela she didn't make it nothing we could do you kidding me no and we have to keep that thing outside or we'll be joining her [ __ ] look for ways in and out of here close them all off [ __ ] come on we need a barricade here hey hey why the hell is that old fool still out there looks like he's following us whatever he's up to we can't trust i know you're inside what in god's name is he up to he's gonna lead that thing straight to us he doesn't get how much trouble we're in here get out here and look me in the eye don't even think about going outside you [ __ ] you you take a goddamn shot at me quit hiding in there we have to get rid of him we're in deep [ __ ] if that thing hears us get away from here go you're you're in real danger i know from you you'll regret it big time if you don't leave right now get out here and face me like a man you chicken [ __ ] listen you need to go before something very bad happens you're threatening me you got no balls man you'll never be anything good job that thing's out there it's doing with us why are these things whatever the hell they are coming after us i wish i knew maybe then we'd know how to stop them professor andrew it's me i'm next the priest reverend whatever made accusations against my double sounded serious another trial not this time it sure looked like it was heading that way and the girl mary yeah she was there all right we secure in here you find any other ways in sorry professor i didn't check that thing is still out there look over there we have to follow her whoever she is she's tied up in everything that's happened here what if you're right what then if we can stop her it could prevent any more harm happening to our doubles okay guard the door in case that thing comes back right hey kid you out here it pains me to say these words but your punishment today will protect us all keep our town safe can you spare him i beg you this is hard for you child but one day you will understand and you will thank me go from this place mary you please cannot reach him my fate is not a memory you should carry who will be my keeper if you are gone judge wyman has instructed abraham he will be your keeper a decision not all are in agreement with every man will face his day of judgment yours is today look child see who you would have me spare see he is no longer of this earth only the damned and the devil can resist in this way he was right here i was holding him he was right there nothing i could do the i've seen myself get killed club would like to welcome its newest member say hi to daniel everyone seriously that's some real cold-blooded [ __ ] taylor lighten up will you we're going crazy here not doing any harm now we know the pattern angela was killed after seeing her double executed taylor had a narrow escape from that thing you see your double get it and you're next that's real reassuring thanks for sharing isn't it better to know what's gonna happen to you there it is that's what's been after us we can't let it trap us up here what do we do now with that thing outside quiet it's out there listen it's out there for now what if it decides to come in after us maybe we're okay if we stay inside the church because because it's holy ground a church maybe it can't come in really it's a [ __ ] vampire now i'm just saying this is a solid building he's right we're safer in here we're staying put that thing is hunting me just like before it wants me you don't get what we're dealing with that thing out there is something [ __ ] else we gotta get away from it right she's right we need to split we stay here and it's snack time for that thing whatever we do we stick together remember what happened to angela okay let's do this we're going out the back amen to that what the hell is that another good reason to split let's go maybe those things have gone looks clear stay close go get out of sight wow uh huh where are you taylor come on talk to us we got to do something now hold on we need to become [ __ ] calm taylor's in trouble daniel taylor is that you i can't see [ __ ] is that you i'm over here uh uh am i happy to see you guys i thought i'd lost you we're still in big trouble here i need a break we got to keep moving can't stop no wait he needs a break forget those things are coming after us not you we can't hang around i keep telling you stick together and we'll be fine fine like angela right all right what's our next move i'm not sure we should rest here for a while you asleep that's impressive i wish no way i could get any shut-eye after what went down tonight would love to though i'm beat any ideas how we getting out of here listen it's clear now there's no help available we're on our own sure seems that way our best shot maybe our only shot is to stop that girl mary getting to mary stopping her might help sure okay but what about the other kid the one that keeps running from us mary and her are connected somehow i'm sure of it maybe the other girl is trying to lead us somewhere where i don't know maybe to a place we can stop all this everything feels out of control i don't think there's anything we can do at this point mary's the key to everything that's happened the trials the executions sure but how are we supposed to stop her not even sure she's real too late for us to do anything now fat it this is over mary may look like a kid but she's the embodiment of evil we have to stop her it's not that simple and like you said she's just a kid we can't listen to me we see her again we do whatever is necessary what's that shh hell no that thing is back to finish me off didn't you learn anything from almost killing that old man put it away that old bastard isn't out here this is something else point that goddamn thing at someone else will you angela my god never thought i'd see you again i i was sure you you were gone we thought you know we're all glad you made it stop it you're gonna make me blush but thank you no one messes with you for sure you are one tough lady so the whole crew is back together you rounded everyone up good job not quite they found us right now our priority is getting you safe let's go we've come across more of those things since you left us the thing that chased after me was horrendous now you're telling me there's more of them what in god's name are they you okay without your glasses i most certainly am there is plenty here i don't want to see you lost your glasses but not your sense of humor good you hear that i heard it sounded close too just gotta keep moving let me help you down hold up andrew wait professor angela you there daniel taylor guys where the hell are you get the [ __ ] out of me hold on taylor i gotta help ah taylor we're over here oh we got out of there in one piece i'll never know hold the celebrations we're still cornered in [ __ ] central and the [ __ ] mutants are still out there we gotta keep moving we have to go right now it is conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles then free is yours it cannot be taken from you not by angels or by demons heaven or hell perhaps you've started to realize something that everything and everyone may not be quite what they appear to be three executions three tormented beings and so far your students have all avoided damnation eternal suffering any thoughts on what might be around the corner hidden by the fog something wicked this way comes keep a lookout for the girl we have to stop her pretty sure she'll be back real soon this may sound crazy but what if saving our doubles from execution is how we save ourselves i was only hunted after my double was killed is anything here not falling apart fireflies that's what's causing the glow looks kind of beautiful don't you think kind of weird looking no this cannot be my own eyes deceive me my apologies for the lateness of the hour but i must speak with you what ails you my friend it is mary i am troubled by her by the part she has played in these trials those trials trouble us all there is more to this i saw her smile as her own sister was executed she took pleasure from it are you certain i am but now that she speaks of guilt and remorse it is hard not to believe her keep away from her abraham no god can come from being with that child too late with her brother and sister gone mary now lives under my roof your charity places you in grave danger what do you advise tell the court you suspect she toys with us all but you saw a delight in her own sister's death i implore you i am torn mary seems full of remote suspicions to yourself and it's our community which will suffer none of us is safe from a wild imaginance very well if the court will listen i will speak i am bewitched you're not bewitched how else can your presence be explained i can't explain this but you're not she has conjured you to defend her to press me into silence only the devil could create a demon who saw resembles me i'm not a demon but we do look alike which i agree is pretty damn weird what do you want from me i wanna know what you're gonna say to the court about mary i was decided to speak to the cause now i am not so sure i know how this must look but you have to speak out tell everyone what the girl did like your friend is telling you too the devil has sent you to tempt me i must not succumb little hope is no longer the town i knew strange and disturbing events have become commonplace you whatever you are are but one of these revealing the truth about mary may save my friend but it does not sit easily with me that in doing so i condemn a child putting it all on a kid isn't right the priest is the one driving this whole thing that's way off we got to stop the kid no other way to do this reverend carver is a man guided by god no one can doubt that bad move there man standing up for the kid is probably gonna do us all in i hope you're wrong for all our sakes what happened you get a chance to confront mary no we never even saw her [ __ ] we met up with andrew's double abraham he was thinking about testifying against mary but good boy andrew talked him out of it that was a smart move are you [ __ ] kidding me we are seeing glimpses of what happened here hundreds how you doing not great demons from the past don't know how much more of this [ __ ] i can take one thing i didn't see coming i feel like one of the team makes no sense i'm good with that at all never happens to me yeah i hear that learned a few things about myself tonight shayna had to be from witches and ghosts we could have used one of those uh what do you call it a paladin a holy warrior holy [ __ ] i never had you down as a game geek there's a lot more about me you don't know i'm full of surprises you'll see we need to get moving [ __ ] this place in this stupid ass crash that got us here oh taylor where are you taylor taylor that you hold on to me whatever happens do not let go don't let go i'm not letting go uh ugh we gotta move okay what the [ __ ] is that thing let's check that out it'll get us out of these damn woods and we can talk on the way what happened back there with that thing no idea it's a real [ __ ] storm what do you think seemed like you wanted to haul my ass off into the woods can't even think about what might have happened to me is the tide beginning to turn in our favor whatever we saw back there or thought we saw we're still in grave danger the only way out of this freaking nightmare is to stop mary stop her lying you had a chance to get mary exposed for what she is a liar and a faker put her in the dark for a change why didn't you take it we don't know for sure that stopping mary will help us out it's just a theory it may only be a theory but right now it's all we've got this is a one-shot deal we get it wrong and there's no replay it's game over so i'm up for doing whatever it takes come on let's take a look so no way in like the rest of this [ __ ] town check this out hey they're coming you can't keep running i'll make sure they'll find you that guy's a menace i don't think he gets how bad a mess we're in come on inside well no one's been here for a long time now is my time to speak before the judge i am filled with dread i cannot know how my testimony will be received the devil has blinded so many to what is real and what is not nothing good will come of this his words will seek to twist the truth allow me to judge what is true abraham and jules if her allies in this deception unless we forget you condemned joseph to death only yesterday or do you now question that decision i've heard nothing today to sway my conviction joseph consorted with the same malicious force as his wife for this the court thanks reverend carver who faced the devil's wrath to present the evidence it is only my duty judge however this court is duty-bound by law to seek out the truth we must therefore examine these claims made by abraham against mary if i may speak briefly judge wyman time is short reverend be indeed brief mary has shown great fortitude to speak out against the evil here many would have lacked her courage yet her reward for exposing this brooding covered in our midst is to be besmirched courage is not in question it is our intent we must be certain of her accuser is the very man entrusted to care for this innocent child plain to see he is not fit for such a task and i would ask the court to have mary placed elsewhere who would you have be a new ward reverend i am prepared to take responsibility for the child if the court agrees first the court must hear what abraham has to say no decision can be made on the child until then abraham what am i to do some would have me speak out against mary but could a child truly be capable of such evil this is tough i get that would be for anyone mary he's just a kid tell the court what you have come here to say speak up boy out with it mary has spoken of evil spirits devilry and witchcraft things many cannot believe could exist here i'm not here for history and hearsay get to the point boy mary is tormented the apparitions she has seen they have plagued her stolen her innocence some suggest she is in league with these creatures but no one can be certain myself least of all can any of us truly know a child's mind you claim i lack the ability to see the truth i beg forgiveness i would never suggest such a thing my time is not for wasting you and the priest have hurt me enough for one day i have more to say i have already given you enough time furthermore mary is to be placed into the care of reverend carver now stand down tell me everything did you see andrew's double again he told the judge that mary did nothing wrong like she's the victim here oh that's bad very very bad [ __ ] so what happens now i'm

this isn't right no way i assure all gathered here today that our town will be free of the devil's grasp together by god's grace little hope will prevail my word on it this court is hastily convened but with good reason if we are to finally rid ourselves of the evil which has infested little or then we must act today i accuse you mary of witchcraft what say you reverend the evidence as discovered through my investigation is beyond question mary uses her poppet as a familiar to summon and serve the devil we have been deceived by a child by her guys of innocence this puppet was mistakenly used to denounce tabitha but it has always belonged to mary and mary alone she allowed her own kin to be executed as she watched in silence that is not so liar now this tits child this creature of satan has the marrow to accuse me a man of god of wrongdoing this is crazy these people have lost it it was never my intention to bring up to this town or its people can you not help me what can i do if i could do something to stop this i would but now in her hour of greatest need this child at the damned pleads once more for the devil's help i beg the court's indulgence please guide me at this time this is your council we have to stop this the only madness is right here in this court carver he's the evil one we have been swayed by malice the truth hidden from us but not by mary reverend carver is the one urging us to believe in the devil he's silent this is all you'll not deceive us any longer your true purpose is plain to see i will see this town purged of all evil he knows what he's talking about carver is the guilty one here what must i do to bring little hawk back into the light i fear the reverend and what he's capable of you have to stop carver it's him don't you get it he's condemning mary to take the heat off himself i know what must be done here be still what is the meaning of this outrage what i have just learned sickens me to my core there are serious questions which must be asked of you how can a man of god conduct himself in such a way mary your suffering is at an end you are free to leave full mislead by a child do you not see what she is the truth stares at you from the depths of hell yet you see nothing the devil's daughter has deceived you all not me i see her i see her satan's heart you will heavily be your cries i was one of the first to follow to your spell now all of little hope is mesmerized by you i've not the words without you i will be dead you saved me i shall remember you all my dears but i didn't save you you pulled one out there man nailed the priest got the kid off the hook good job we should go tell me what happened you see the girl mary we're all done good to go all thanks to my man andrew here uh huh huh oh oh oh oh ugh hey i'm talking to you hey you should have stayed away never come back here i'll never forget or forgive you for what you did i don't want any trouble okay we're going and we're not coming back the only place you should be heading is hell you goddamn murdering son of a [ __ ] that's him what look out that son of a [ __ ] has a gun what the hell is this about you seem a little confused no please wait you don't understand we're diverting all traffic through a little hope you're okay buddy you seem a little confused yeah i'm fine i just want to get these folks where they need to be i doubt a short delay will trouble him too much can everyone just shut up this isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here hi there how you doing excuse me but we're uh looking for our bus driver what have you seen him yeah that's funny sounds like you could use a drink better not thanks hey you [ __ ] you you take a goddamn shot of me quit hiding in there get away from here go you're you're in real danger i know from you you regret it big time if you don't leave right now get out here and face me like a man you chicken [ __ ] it's okay i'm gonna be just fine that's it game over you're done for now at least you could always try again see if you can get a different result that's the problem with demons if you don't lay them to rest they will haunt you forever not a bad effort some found redemption some didn't all you're doing and you eventually found him the bus driver maybe he can now put the past behind him until we meet again maybe in the arabian desert maybe somewhere else but we will meet again at least one more time you believe in god absolutely not we'll start believing we are under attack by i don't know what you wouldn't believe me even if i tried help i don't believe it and i was there they say the souls of the dead went deep on the ground to the house of ashes where they lived on dust plagued by the demons of the underworld you
