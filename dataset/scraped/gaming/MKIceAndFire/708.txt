big bath we like it so much maybe we should just hijack the train let the basilisk go on its way yeah then just drive this beast of the 101 there him back saul would be on board with that are we ready okay the militech convoy will be traveling from night city to the base where they're due to meet the buyer we will stop it at the railroad crossing all we have to do is shove this beauty in its way v any questions plan to move this thing how exactly it's old tech carol will have to hack it then i'll somehow have to finagle authorization from the control tower to move it towel looks inactive to me too yeah we'll see to that you and pan am just get the authorization code okay let's get to work uh read the opening line you know you're in for a lovely thousand page ride i mean just listen when augustus came out on the porch the blue pigs were eating a rattlesnake not a very big one did you learn the whole thing by heart nope just the first sentence but i liked all that stuff with the carrots too any of this goes south you know pan am will be the one to pay do you see us hanging around to dry do you see saul letting us off the hook while pan am takes the fall for everything i'm starting to like this kid ted he thinks he cares about pan am more than the girl's own family you didn't take her side last time when she left the clan why because last time pan am was acting a damn fool you thinking she learned something she's smarter yes she left learned a few things managed on her own a new win to come back people like that are worth a lot more than those who plant their asses in one spot and do as they're told well hello there have you come to make yourself useful nope just uh here to talk you don't really know why you're here do you pan am asked me for help she came back to the fold sweet talked mitch and the rest over to her side but still she calls you interesting isn't it need a hand of course but in your shoes i would look for another way in first even if we pull it off saul will be pissed i can see his face already remember when we first met you almost had a pound in your pants at the thought of falling foul saul i don't recall leaving pan am high and dry though now you're gonna stick it to him plain something change uh-huh i realize pan am is right how's it going over here fantastic we have everything hooked up and nothing works uh it works though not reliably v could you scan it because i am not open to the prospect of taking it all apart again capacitor is damaged third from the right indeed hold on let me swap it out time to try it again hey it works thanks fee my that was quick the stairs it is let's set mitch and bob are already connected got a little help from yours truly i've always been fond of trains and the stations where so many tracks converge junctions yes those when you see them from above you feel free like you can set off in a thousand journeys all at once perhaps more simply hopefully okay here we are carol what are we looking for would you help me look sure thing nothing here nothing here okay it must be here somewhere v look thoroughly please some sort of stone age control panel let's find the cards first not here well well well got something good job carol we have a card what now you have to put it in the reader wealthy the card in the reader here goes nothing it worked come look little engine that could v i wanted to speak with you what did you want to talk about i know this may sound foolish because i asked you to help me but why are you doing this because it's important to you but is that all i i'm sorry that sounded worse than i intended listen v i i'm sorry i'm not very good at this speaking of my feelings and so forth and i would not want to cut this up so far so good champ because i've kept my mouth shut up to now the thing is i usually act before i think uh-huh noticed i know but i also need impulses to act upon when i do something spontaneously i feel i'm being honest yet with you i prefer to play it safe why is it any different with me because i truly care this time yet i fear all doers say something foolish and be left alone in the desert i would rather keep you close if only as a friend try following the impulse next time okay well in any case you've been warned all right let's rejoin the others convoy got eyes ah [ __ ] carol checks their communication channels from time to time everything is proceeding as planned for now so see everything's under control the convoy is already heading our way you worried about saul with quite some time left till dusk the car could use another once more stars have emerged we've got a few hours till dawn you're acting spooked as if you're the first person ever to stand up to saul save your breath i don't need to be consoled was it someone i know new scorpion it came home from the war head full of new ideas and a host of new contacts he tried to get saul to lead us in joining snake nation it would make us stronger he said i don't think he peeped a word of it to me what did saul do saul dressed the guy down head to toe for messing with the family hell he didn't send him on any jobs for a year gee really consoling thanks you said yourself you didn't need any how to raise a glass to scorpion don't talk about the war much what's there to say they just packed you into a panzer down in mexico and said full speed ahead soldier and it was weeks talking either to yourself or the onboard ai drinking i died like water because your geiger wouldn't shut up i'm sprouting a rash on my ass just thinking about sitting in that boiling hot coffin uh-huh but you all can't wait to pack your asses into the basilisk huh that's different completely different you'll see once you're on board i'm gonna try and get some sleep okay it'll be quite some time before the convoy comes through i'm kind of cold out here not true but this is nice catch some [ __ ] with me i'll just lie here a while by your side gazing at the stars is that another area of your expertise you got maps of the heavens in your library too of course that's the big dipper and do you see the small flickering start on the right ah yeah you do oh dear that means there's a major leak good night okay here they come is everyone ready let's ride fee all right she's moving get her up to speed they're going faster than we thought i don't know if we can catch them on top of one of the cars it'll speed you up wait no coming in falling take out that couple we're getting close surround them as soon as they're cut off probably jammed again okay trucks are all yours boys move that ass teddy boys hurry up back up all right the train's leaving okay let's go ready to roll [ __ ] it worked it did just as i said it would how's it going therapy did you have fun sure did just be happy you won't be around to put the hunger junk together the real fun is just starting from mitch and teddy so okay i just lost the militech channel the suits finally realized someone was listening and changed the codes perfect timing if you ask me i can talk to him if you want no thank you i'll take care of this myself so it begins what's the meaning of this exactly what you see the basilisk all i see is two trucks with giant militech logos on them [ __ ] pan am you can see them from miles away you think we don't have problems enough on our hands the raffins could rear their heads at any moment and now we have militech to worry about too stop it [ __ ] just shut up already do you want to serve corporations forever fine go right ahead in that case we'll leave the basilisk as a souvenir of what this family used to be well you know what maybe next time we're attacked we'll be able to fight back as soon as i'm done with biotechnica we call a family meeting to discuss this discuss you until that time i want these trucks out of my sight and the basilisk can we put it together do what you want just get out of my sight bob mitch you two take the trucks around back we need to unload sure but then what do we do with them oh i've got an idea you got quite a pair of lungs there thanks i believe the last time i pulled something like that i was 10 years old seem to still be in fine working order everything okay yes of course though the great train robbery bit of this was much more enjoyable you need me again all you got to do is call v i am sure i will so you'd better expect that call be waiting take care so the basilisk it's ready would you like to drive it sure be there soon [ __ ] me it is awesome so i hear all ready to go hey v no not yet carol still needs to check if militech left any ice in the systems corporates haven't shown up in person to report the loss no i think we managed to keep him off our scent we left the trucks with the big corpo logos down by the raffin camp which was almost as much fun as leaving a bag of flaming dog [ __ ] on their doorstep [ __ ] made it look like it just came back from a corporal war tour nice touch everything's fine clean as a whistle and saul what about him nothing for now we're staying out of each other's hair so he's not planning a family council of course he is he just wants to keep me in the dark a while longer i always wanted to take one of these suckers for a spin which is exactly how all those naive gonks landed at the front didn't even need to be recruited they just showed you the tech go on hop in everything is set hey jude what's up ah you know family you i got good days got bad days same as ever you uh call just to see how i'm doing or not just got a favor to ask you ask away it's never boring with you interesting people aren't easily bored no chance in your company but now that we've blown each other what's up you're on a need to know basis so this particular mission don't require you to have no gun just a wetsuit gotta say i am intrigued why the wetsuit can't back out now just gonna have to use your imagination you really know how to reel me in don't you ain't seen nothing yet all right then count me in but i gotta warn you i look great in a wetsuit damn out past rancho coronado know it sure what about it little uh abandoned bungalow lakeside meet me there at sundown okay um is this a date you're not my type homes just show up i'll see you there all right let's fire her up hold on to your head damn it got a bad feeling about this everything is dandy give me a moment oh yes it's not the latest model but mitch and bob did what they could what do you think nice and cozy in here you steer directly from your seat all you have to do is jack in what no knobs buttons blinky doodads no none the impulse runs directly to your cerebral cortex in a sense the basilisk becomes an extension of your body it's like a mystical oneness ever piloted anything like this no why don't you trust me can i still get out no then i trust you if it's so mystical and [ __ ] why the co-pilot extra support i'll tell you once we're a bit further from camp we'll practice okay if you want full functionality in an engagement you need a second person to handle sensory overloading one pilot steers the other handles the gun it's oddly pleasant you'll see okay this will do fine a dry run first i'll disconnect for now doesn't need two pilots you won't be steering and firing are you ready pam is this uh it has designed neural synchronization doesn't happen at the snap of one's fingers it'll be over soon there see okay just don't understand where you meant warm up don't worry i'm not gonna watch just put it through a few turns now take her along the line of turbines when i say so swerve right or left before the last of them all right left very good for going right yes that's the way to do it right excellent now let's do some shooting stop and i'll activate the system what's on the menu don't get excited the basilisk is a cargo ship by design but it should still be a good time all right blast those wrecks good okay practice is over v do you remember what i said about impulses well watch out now what's happening hi jackson our nervous systems are now linked right basilisk pilots working in harmony that why i'm feeling everything doubled it's sensory feedback our systems are intertwined would you like to try it out okay i could go for that can i feel that honestly yeah no idea how people can focus in combat it's probably not always this intense how about this wow oh [ __ ] they found us we have to get back to camp they're rapping whole group of them ready for a fight they're here take them out then and make yourself useful we'll go straight we have to help the family we're almost okay it's everything congratulations all of us each on his or her own mustang first and foremost of what's good for the family come on salt if i have to leave the clan please just say so spare me another speech of yours at the very least i'm afraid you'll have to sit through a few more because from this day forward you will lead this family by my side i will what i wish to do this properly but fine have it your way i was wrong you were right that's the truth may it never happen again but i i i made a mess of so many things you said i know but i changed my mind you risked everything for this family not even knowing whether you'd be welcomed the next day okay okay well i many things will have to change yes and to start with we need to leave this place quickly we can't wait for militech to find us of course i will prepare our route congratulations terrible choice i voted nate thank you thanks i need to cool down i think will you come with me an interesting day i feel as if i barely evaded a rapidly approaching train it's pretty close i don't know if i could have done it without you hey come on no i'm serious we all so you can count on me all the counters good to know beer lemonade beer me to happy endings i hope you don't regret what happened i regret one thing only but we had so little time yes i'll have to do something about that um you know this join us the office formerly responsible for implant certification will shutter its doors next tuesday the administrators of implant authorization are now the manufacturers guided by the standards they themselves it's really not that simple you either want to or not what's so complicated that's the problem what i want right now doesn't mean a thing all right v i shouldn't draw bombs like that on you right now i just thought uh forget about it i'll think it all over i promise you
