try to do better this time [Music] heartwarming reunion if we do this you work for me not Prescott got it you're the boss motor pool come on let's find some more gears all there's a ghost town now so our recruiting options are thin our best bet for gears is echo 5 a mop-up unit stationed nearby let's pay him a visit [Music] I'm gonna need to come and do this whole platoon for our little grub hunt that won't go down easy don't you worry been working on my recruiting pitch yeah that's what I'm afraid of [Music] up ahead over here okay cupcakes listen up everybody in one piece we're looking for echo 5 that's us sir Grubbs just ambushed our unit half a click of the row came out of nowhere all right you're with us now let's go find your people I'm sure as hell hope there's a squad left to recruit [Music] no one's left let's check out the ambush site see if there's any sign of those gears keep it up that's all of them now first the bunker what happened here on this who comes wiping out the mop up crews in motion he didn't kill all drag marks you're sure they're alive dead bodies don't kick if those gears are lucky dad cops should pick him up [Music] and there they are let's go [Music] we've got a fix on the prisoners the grubs took my bet the sick bastards are processing those gears in torture pods we've got to work fast then once we pull up those grubs are going to start the kill timer clock ticking on our people just us two full squad would only slow us down free those prisoners welcome back soldier now grab a weapon still got a fight ahead of us not a problem second friendly secure all units back to the APC move [Music] let's make it happen standing by well good news this your safe the bad news you're the last of echo five now come on we got a big mission ahead and a lot of manpower left to find [Music] we might have stumbled onto a fix for our personnel shortage tat comm just picked up a distress call in the industrial district whoever it is we've got to help them and who knows maybe they can help us too Oh [Music] [Music] civvies run-ins all they're good for she shoots better than you okay protect that truck don't know how long the armour on their rigs gonna hold so hustle up there gotta give him a fighting chance the way they turn tail think a hiding chance it's all they're up for noted SID now move ready for that all you got solid work location secure now let's make sure everybody's on one peer attitude we're not done here with them no and you know why perfect hey there looks like we came just in time listen fascist your hammer strike took everything from us don't you come here looking for things so here's what I see guts but not discipline if we hadn't picked up your distress call you would have been overrun we can help each other join us all right here's what I see a bunch of lost fascists so desperate for warm bodies they want to conscription you're hurting that crazy locust bukhan what do you know about him enough places he goes show me maybe for the right price but a start is busted so unless one of your goons as a mechanic we're not going anywhere I think I know a guy if we want our convoy ready to fight we need fresh supplies dig in near the crate and load up the cargo we need [Music] we don't secure those supplies grab your destroyer let's move [Music] okay ma'am is fixed so deal's a deal let's take a little trip to the packing district place is always swarmed with uh Kahn's goons you want to see what he's up to that's the first place to look the warehouse up ahead I saw Luke on lurking there about a week ago some kind of [ __ ] let's knock on his door then what's up well we didn't find who car [Music] Michaela's next lead looks solid we're seeing heavy locust activity in the city of Claybourne just like she said hookans there be ready for anything [Music] there's a lot of grubs down there well good means he's close my boo Khan's pets [Music] all right listen up that bridge is our way in Noe holes and they can't flank us and what about that well at least we'll hear it coming [Music] time to get to work the grubs have this bridge good and infested we'll have to fight our way across what else is new hard probably find a new Khan once we're there what the ruck is we're gonna make you may just find us first great oh let's see where we're at still no sign of them I think our little friend is getting closer bukhan [Music] you gotta isolate him no wait don't wait useless human fear coming that Li fan you're saying Deadeye Rockets incoming okay out of the strike zone the emotion tanks on his back we destroy them he goes down he's gonna try to shield him so we need shooters on both sides these broom ops get feisty buckle up people good we take out his guns it's one less thing to worry about waiting orders first tank destroyed keep hammering him [Music] [Music] headed out gotta reload ready ideas we felt that one sucking tech destroy [Music] [Music] shot men reloading [Music] need a name check here [Music] I'm reloading stay sharp brew backed up in the flask Oh go [Music] on my way a be reported in waiting orders [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] damn it out ready yes it's late I just saw who can get his head blown off and stand right back up what else aren't you telling me your orders are to kill him not write his biography the cup would be here before where we're keeping secrets got good people killed and some secrets also keep people alive so you're all wondering why we pulled away from the fight hmm frankly we're not ready for it that bru Mach was just the start our enemies got a whole grubs ooh [ __ ] no one's even seen yet right now all we have is grit which is why your on-the-job training starts today look I don't like it any more than you do but if there's one thing that the cog is good at it's making soldiers you know that so we learn what we need and then we kick Oh Khan's ass back underground I'll be overseeing a group today major Redfern will take you through your paces later lucky me now let's go squash some grubs [Music] civilians and cog rookies and vets our little army has plenty of friction if we're gonna take out who Khan we've got to learn to work together that starts here [Music] missions all about teamwork dig in near both crates and load the supplies we need to upgrade our army remember we don't work together we die supply target reach solid teamwork people to supply us the much-needed upgrades prepare for evac listen up das preaches teamwork but I've got a different gospel sink-or-swim if you can't pull weight don't expect pity because the grubs won't give you any now it's proving time trial-by-fire it is if we're gonna tangle a food con we need better armor and weapons grab the gear and watch out for those nemesis bombs you got it let's make it happen uh-huh affirmative acknowledged decent work you got a long damn way to go load up that gear let's roll [Music] eyes open feet apart elbow in gotta say they're starting to look like gears yeah if we put a little spine in them what the hell did you do three of my people just deserted no maybe a little too much spineless will form search parties go after them Michaela they're not just your people anymore [Music] look I don't like doing things the cog way either but not even SIDS as harsh as a grub torture pod the locust took our Runaways captive nearby let's bring him home [Music] damn just two pots we're all to take our third dessert or somewhere else killed timers on so hustle if we're slow my people die come on let's get back and hey we'll make this convoy trust me now let's hope Gate can still save your friend [Music] while we've been hunting runaways ooh Kahn's been staking us out grubs hiding emulsion tanks to hit us with another brew mark I'd bet we're gonna wreck his stash and buy Gabe time to save the last deserter time to put a crimp in new guns brew mock plans find his emulsion tanks and make them go boom move out let's do it going now Oh here the bet emulsion wasn't for a broom on that be to come let's head back we've got a fix on our last runaway and it might pay off bigger than we thought intel says they're part of a locust Cargo shipment break them out and look for anything we can use against oak on [Music] grubs have two prisoners on sight one of ours and one who's about to get lucky crack those torsion pods fast and watch for clues move out nice work business secure jackpot same kind of canister Yukon hopped out of just before he turned super grub grab one didn't think we'd give up on you did you now shake off the dust we're fighting our way out we've got our people in one hell of a leap in that canister everybody head for the APC guess I should thank you for running if we can find out what's in this canister we might just learn the key to beating who con [Music] Buchan needs these canisters so we need to know why our best bet for answers is to check out the source but stay sharp if this place is on new Khan's radar it'll be crawling with grubs gonna guess that doesn't say free kittens warning rust lung quarantine zone rust lung Wow duquan care about rust long think we're about to find out sign says the medical archives are up in the atrium let's check it out odds are that's where we'll find our Intel and a whole damn grub convention by the sound of it places on Dupont radar it'll be crawling with grubs sign says the medical archives are up in the atrium let's check it out odds are that's where we'll find our Intel and a whole damn grub strongbox spotted in the medical archives let's get a closer look [Music] paydirt research files and a fresh cannister we can examine it all back at the convoy move out okay birds got more grubs jamming up our exit path puck through [Music] let's kick some ass okay here we got our Intel but who can't raising the stakes with those amped up drones at the time we figured out SOP ice [Music] so what is it it's an immune system booster experimental crippling side effects and it only works on rust LOM Roslyn so you cons dine of rust lung how is that even possible okay this is all I get damn it we need to catch him yeah and now we have our bait with who Khan's healing trick we can't kill him head-on we've got to trap him instead our targets an old UI our medical truck once we secure it we'll make you calm think he's hit the canister jackpot intel says our vehicles up ahead just got to lock it down for the recovery crew killing time moving can let these grubs teluk on what we're up to take them down you hear that no survivors spins are drying up solid job [Music] now let's move out of the recovery [Music] okay traps set now we've just got to wait and hope that uh Khan says desperate for those canisters as I think he is okay let's do this control this is alpha two go ahead alpha two no use to us alpha to leave it and move on control out you're sure you come the Stinson on comms oh I'm positive [Music] Oh

explain to me what the [ __ ] that was you owe me an answer I don't owe you [ __ ] I trust you have better news this time yes we had bukhan and then your man tried to escape with him and where is major Redburn now detained unfortunate but if cornered you can once you can do it again as for major red burn the penalty for treason is death I leave the method to you get any answers from your tyrant buddy just more questions that's god damn usual what did you want with who Khan you want to eat more shovel talk fine rot in there then should have shot you when I had the chance had enough alone time because hookans still out there and we've only got one lead left you're backstabbin ass know what you're no better than Prescott I'm protecting you god damnit really cuz I thought you were protecting your old pal Oh Kahn if I tell you the truth there's no going back long time ago I got posted to a genetics lab they were supposed to be Kieran Russell um it went sideways instead of going after a cure the doctors made monsters convinced chairman Monroe the things had military potential but they were feral mindless except one bukhan one chairman caused this mess another covers it up I wanted to parade bukhan through the Capitol it's proof that we need real military leadership to win this war not manicured politicians but for now anyone who knows the truth is at risk including you - so you're saying the cob created the locust sounds about right no that's that's insane tell you what I stashed some files at the outpost and Winlock go see for yourself if this is another lie Oh believe me motor pool I wish it were [Music] Syd wants us to believe the cog cooked up its own worst enemy if I'm gonna buy that I need hard proof let's see if these files of his are real or if they're one more tall tale well Winlock that SID but no although Oh busted and sketchy is here okay missions a grab-and-go if Sid wasn't bullshitting his files to be in the storehouse that's one hell of an eighth Naomi understood let's see what they got ah here we go again [Music] New Hope initiative Chairman's eyes only this is the file alright let's head back so we can get a closer look Oh rubs the one to move oh okay load up Gabe you need to read this [Music] Oh [Music] interesting reading what are you gonna do rattle the skeletons in the closet [Applause] something to report yes new hope excuse me new hope Sid's rambling on about it that name mean anything to you I'm afraid not what are your current coordinates asked you to deal with major red burns I haven't I'm Sonya Raven to arrest him and bring your reinforcements well it's about goddamn time coordinates sent dispatching the Raven now and yes this has been a difficult mission draw [Music] why the hell did you tell him where we are he's going to send some kill squad let's go can send whoever he wants by the time they land on that mountaintop we'll be gone oh you're sneakier than you look no more [ __ ] [ __ ] get everyone ready to head don't say I didn't warn you well Prescott thinks we're dead good one less distraction while we get back to the mission killing Oh Khan oh really and how are we gonna do that miss healing I can turn it off you're telling us this now well yeah wasn't trying to kill him before spill it hookans turbocharging is healing right well a new hope the docs had a dirty trick called cytostatic gasps completely jams up the healing process I know how to make it and you can weaponize it you trust this mustache with legs after what he pulled you got a better plan bukhan dies . you want to throw a truth parade in ephyra do it on your own time you know we're never going back to a fara pull any [ __ ] no more warning shots okay let's get to work these super grubs are bad news iffucan builds thousands of them March is on a fira easy to fix Diaz wanna stop an army [ __ ] just blow up the [ __ ] factory it's done you're welcome oh that's left now used to find out where guns hiding listen what I did before well it was a it was a bad call I just wanted payback for all the [ __ ] the Cod made me do I put you all in danger [Music] I'm just trying to make that right careful stare at that any harder you'll set it on fire don't bother hasn't moved in two hours I think I got it these are all the places who Khan's attacked what's the pattern we've covered this it's random where he's hit is random what about where he hasn't Zenit province we've been through it pristine medical facilities they should have what who Khan wants but he isn't touching up it's the one place he doesn't want to leave footprints cuz he makes big it'll take some looking he's there I know it so much for bukhan keeping a low profile in zenok intel just came in on a hidden torture camp we're gonna free his prisoners and see if we can't sniff out his base girl knows something she's about as chatty as a brick wall let me talk to her mind if I join you it's your camp can't imagine what you've been through save the pity for someone who wants it look you want to leave no one's stopping you hmm if not talk to us what happened to you we were living in some old lab my father's a scientist or was a few weeks ago I went out for supplies when I came back that thing was there setting up shop bukhan I don't know why he didn't just kill me but what he did to my father that'll stay with me until the day I die I'm sorry that information isn't a gift you're gonna help me kill who can help you kill him [Music] what's your name my name is you're gonna help me kill Luca I think I can make that happen awfully long name though there anything I can call you for short Rana [Music] guess he likes your motor pool she knows where he is it's time we ended this I told you once that we weren't ready for this fight said all we had was grit well we got a hell of a lot more than that now but this won't be easy because it's not enough just to kill UConn if we let the locals keep churning out these juiced up grubs everyone's at risk not just us that means we've got a crush to cod and his whole nasty-ass operation the plans simple first we knock down who comes front door battle on retail and give us time to make a special delivery while we take you calm down you'll buy us time now let's get this done never did you come see what my newest creation thinks of your little well he looks friendly [Music] their quickness darling masterpiece [Music] [Music] stay alert don't trust anything until you see you con dead [Music] damnit [Music] [Music] wait got a whole box of these cytostatic guy's a drunk of torture eyes you're a lot of moves new hope never left you did it see I missed you too [ __ ] you think you why but your suffering is only beginning humanity is weak and soft my creatures my perfect creations will outlive you they'll outlive your ass that's for sure that's that then so what's next moustache man you headed off to spill some cog dirt been thinking on that maybe some secrets are better left buried I say we leave Prescott to his world and get busy building our own [Music] right off into the sunset then not quite who cons monsters are still out there I've got some new mission plans we can go over tonight Sirena this is how fresh to celebrate planning [ __ ] something of yours my mother's I never knew her thank you do we burn this place down already it's almost my nap time
