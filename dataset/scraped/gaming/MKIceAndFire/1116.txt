can't believe you had the strength to reprogram that robot well the newer models still attacked you though they must be operating under a different protocol this Mike probably had something to do with that kept enough robots under his command keep control of the situation not sure if anyone's controlling this situation where's Mike now he disappeared after he sent out the Esso to the snake robot to kill you Pinkus Oscorp is reevaluating his job performance you think we can try and hack through the computer system and shut down the rest of the robots Alistair Smythe designed the codes himself not likely but you'd say something like that well get some rest we'll be out of here soon okay a little heads up one web-slinging indoors is a little different than outdoors so hold on tight and we'll be
