sonic I know it may be out of your way but please get over to HQ and tell us what you know thank you we really appreciate the assistance good luck [Music] [Music] I've been waiting for you this way please thank you for your help today please make yourself available if another incident arises farewell to you and please take care your that hero we encountered before yeah we've been running into each other a lot lately oh hey we just passed the hero certification exam and also finish the introductory seminar huh as of today Janice and I are bona fide heroes I will take my leave of you here master right see ya you had known to Oh looks like we're headed in the same direction shall we get a move on [Music] well if it isn't the association's newest eager beaver's in this business there's a thing called rookie crusher a lot of us heroes hate to be out ranked so we crush the newbies early on like this time for part three of the seminar who are you again it's time to do this for dinner now you stand among the ranks of the straw [Music] dad home [Music] hey what are you writing over there my diary I am recording the details of your lessons and training regimen crap he's raising the bar again I can't think of even one single thing I can actually teach the guy I feel bad I'm scamming him or something come on think just make something up like techniques are a spiritual theory clap and blinking there's nothing else I actually do straight the truth is all I've got I know jenos won't be satisfied with that by the way at the seminar they said if you are a Class C hero and you have no hero activity for a week your name will be removed from the hero registry will you be alright master they really said that yes with Class C being the largest category and the bar being so low those who cannot be used or constantly weeded out but I was watching TV and there wasn't anything going on the news only reports major incidents large-scale events such as natural disasters terrorism and dangerous monsters you may not be aware of it because you have only confronted powerful monsters and evil armies that no one else could handle but Class C Heroes primarily take care of purse snatchers robberies and random attacks it is quite difficult for a Class C hero to survive without actively looking for cases to resolve I hear many of them get discouraged and changed careers like a salesman offering his ware store to door nothing will come your way without doing the proper legwork this is no time to be reading manga we are going no you stay here if I'm with a class s hero the class C like me won't get any credit I'm sorry but you can't come along on this one jenos but as your disciple jenos from the beginning my intense desire to be hero was what drove me to strength training that's how I made it this far for you perhaps things will change if you aim higher as a hero and you set a new goal frankly speaking you're a cyborg so training your body won't do a change in mindset may lead you to greater strength so in other words it's not about having raw power or technique it's about training your mind to do that you must first fight your way through the professional hero industry jenos aim to break into the top ten of the class s heroes I believe that should be your goal for now oh man I'm just making all this crap up as I go but I can't stop now I understand I will do as you say he bought it awesome I believe in you jenos good luck in your training [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it it's the devious effect get out of the way incinerate target eliminate that was tougher than I thought Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] you'll regret under estimating us here ow apologies for contacting you out of the blue but the situation is critical we've received civilian reports about a suspicious figure who has taken two rampaging about town unfortunately we can determine neither his location nor identity go to town get to sleuthing and find out where the criminal is you are the only one that we have for the job good luck [Music] [Music] hey you're a hero aren't you the one that's been making waves recently I'm a fan of yours so what's going on today have I seen anyone suspicious hmm now that you mention it some maniacs been running around town since a few days back causing all sorts of trouble he'll never forget that expression he was totally off his rocker any other characteristics well he was a tight get up some kind of hero seat mania phrase that's all I remember oh yeah he was at it again today I think he sprinted off in that direction why not go see if you can find him [Music] [Music] huh what do you want oh wait I know you here oh right I absolutely love your work so what can I do you for have I seen a suspicious person in tights you ask good

the strength to rule the entire surface all alone you should have lived quietly with your brethren at the bottom of the sea for oh then I suppose you must die that's my line I would have let you live only show me the respect I do I'm no hero but I going to be [Music] your attacks don't hurt even a little he's faster bigger and stronger even so late morning exploding shark wait [ __ ] damn my

did fine nice fight anyway now I'm gonna pound this SI freak or whatever it's called I heard that cue ball ready to join your mangled friend each and every one of you silly and me bags will die grizzly now you stand among the ranks of the strong [Music] what did you see that that was amazing who is that guy that was what just happened I don't believe it he did it we're saved think I floored him with one hit one punch just one punch we're saved how did he do that the other heroes barely scratched it is he really classy he's so strong we're still alive hey you alright I'm still breathing but maybe that monster wasn't really that strong after all bought it made all those heroes that just means those heroes were wimps huh maybe well I suppose the monster didn't look all that tough when he killed it after all a Class C hero took it out with a single punch the heroes who got stomped must really suck they may call themselves Class A or Class S or whatever but their titles don't mean a thing hey cut it out will ya they risk their lives for us risk their lives anyone can do that but to be a hero you gotta actually be monsters a boatload of heroes were seriously injured this time that monster tore through them could you really rely on the next time we need their help sure we survived so it worked out in the end but it's annoying when wimpy heroes who are really just average joes show up and try to save you I wish to just stop if they're gonna call themselves heroes they better actually help us maybe it's time to shut up ah why are you getting mad at me our money is what funds the hero Association right as long as we're paying for it they better protect us that's their job the fact of the matter is that bald guy pretty much took care of it all by himself so all the other heroes died for nothing I said shut up anyone could come up with a way to buy a little time in the end the other heroes didn't do anything heroic good day we were all saved okay just leave it at that yeah exactly true the other heroes didn't do much I mean maybe they didn't do anything at all but you don't have to add insult to injury today's my lucky day good for me the other heroes wore the monster down so beating that gross sea thing was child's play I barely did a thing and now I get all the credit awesome good thing I was late right hey all of you get out there and spread the word I'm the one who finished the monster off this guy right here doesn't matter how got it and I'll beat the snot out anyone who says it's only cuz I got here late you hear me huh what's he talking about so the monster had been softened up I mean that's what he says but the other heroes may have worn it down they were fighting pretty hard but still one punch how do you win with one punch wait a second oh that's Saitama he's the hero from city see that everyone calls a cheat I'm sure of it I knew I'd seen him before what a cheat well no one's sure about that yet hey I heard of him too he appeared out of nowhere and climbed the ranks super fast sounds fishy he just swooped in at the end but his rank will go up anyway but still one punch that's crazy the other heroes were getting pummeled like that new guy Jennison Moomin right leads Class C and then this guy he just comes swooping in and grabs all that glory seriously that's just low he might not be a cheap ever consider that hey you guys look after the Fallen Heroes okay I need them alive they died on me how am I gonna cash in on their work yeah geez maybe he is a cheat man that's not fair exactly compared to him the other heroes really are heroic they're amazing where would we be now if the other heroes hadn't fought yeah these heroes deserve our heartfelt thanks [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one one what Ben who is that old shredder [Music] over here tink Tupper rep is at stake [Music]

understood you come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the situation is critical a gargantuan spacecraft has appeared and laid the city to waste we need you to infiltrate the enemy spacecraft once there you'll have to lay the groundwork for our offensive needless to say that this mission is extremely dangerous land defense requires most of our resources you're the only hero we
