[Music] we have a look at the attached and go to the giving address there you will take a car from sergey karasinski your job is delivered to the tiger cross the car only i mean not sergey everything understood i hope so police experts have confirmed the identified virus can lead to cyberware failure and in extreme cases even death in response to increased gang activity the mayor's office has raised the public threat level i do not understand does arasaka not have enough of its own people look around sir things are heating up in the city suits no one sparks all it takes for japan town to go up in flames riots are always best put down by folks not spoiling your brand name ah you are here there's no time to waste me why what are we doing here you shall learn soon i acquired some information of my own do you know for most wish to honor arasaka with the parade his murderer the irony makes me sick what's in it for your nobu doesn't seem like the kind who care to honor tradition that is so japanese heritage is one element yorinobu will also put on a display of power the floors are sure to be beautiful but the wise and i will see in them a hidden message to his force what message would that be i am here watch your backs how over subtlety is he still don't see how this gets us anywhere i have had an idea look to the sky the dash floats will pass precisely this way if i could just get onto the hana gosam as a float i could speak with her in private get there how why jump of course expectations way too high goro couldn't pull that off even if you still had your fancy implants i have thought of a solution while you are occupied with your shady dealings i learned more about the floats they are all kept in one place arasaka industrial park it is there that they prepare them we need only to break into the compound find the right float and inject a virus into its system you will then be able to disable any security before i sneak inside lots of ways to skin this particular cat you know i'm gonna need i know what you need it is taking care of i have an infected shard it was not cheap but the man who sold it to me granted it will work would you get this short across the canal kabuki might actually be half decent soft then and if it isn't got a few tricks up my sleeve too this is good to know let us move on to take control of the float is one thing but not all the security concerns me the snipers especially i will be an easy target but i may have an answer oh god as i mentioned the cd camera if we gain access to them we will see exactly where the snipers are you can deal with them as i advance i think i see where this is going got me doing all the dirty work do you wish to trade the places what exactly would you say to her hello my name is v hanako sama knows me only i can do this and now what would you say to a small test we must try the shard the camera control room is in front of us you must get inside and infect the network that is all uh-huh and in the meantime you'll do what crack open a can of suds i will not touch alcohol at work i will watch your back now get to it okay [ __ ] worked and done systems ours the shot works good the easy work we have done to break into arasaka industrial park will not be such a bed of roses but before we discuss that sid i have not eaten since yesterday give me the best on the menu i highly recommend the yakitori today anything that isn't local please until tomorrow i can't believe i'm saying this but this soccer scum might actually prove useful he's a well-trained dog needs orders that's all and when he outlives his purpose we'll flatline him where's that come from ever seen him in action no just know the way he walks look in his eye we'll come back to this later what is this hey yakitori okay i have laid the plan one we break into arasaka industrial park one and a half we have kanakosama's float two during the parade with my help you eliminate any snipers three i get onto the float though i convince hanakosama of the truth we've got five oda zeros us and pisses on our corpses we'll never be less than a foot away from hanukkah although not there raised his hand against me what about me that is a different matter i would advise you to watch your distance well sounds like a suicide run but don't dumb a [ __ ] than this so things are even more stupid than stealing from arasaka none dumber yet no set the bar pretty high with that one now we part reconnaissance is required what are you doing don't let him off his leash let him stray even a couple of feet you can say goodbye to his [ __ ] honor go with him stranger in a strange land i'm going with you true and you with your hands skilled mind of a thief agreed this we will do together [Music] cook louder louder he eliminated the last obstacle between himself and the complete power they surrendered it before you're in opposite fire to it from the inside all of this began with him the factions power struggles all of this the factions inside our osaka what are they there are three for stability the old order they are united behind hanako the liberal wing hato support michigan saburo's grand daughter i know a little about her and then there is taka richard starks who support not to mention even small affections tell me about him some other time where's your nobu's rebellious street come from no one knows this perhaps i shall ask in person [Music] please why'd saburo tolerate it all can't get my head around it get the sun on a short leash arasaka was a strong and disciplined man the strongest man i have ever known and yet at a critical moment he showed a weakness for your noble for his daughter when you're in a form his band of hounds declared war on his own family could have crushed him with one word yet he did not for he did not wish his daughter to suffer when you're in a return his tail between his legs she persuaded her father to give him a second chance do you understand anakosama saved urine from the consequences of his deeds wait think she's complicit in saburo's murder i think we are all to blame we allowed ourselves to be tricked but we will correct this soon will you join me sure why not let us go from here i hope you enjoyed it please come again so dustin plastic come i have found a good place to observe we must just climb up here [Music] now this way fortune smiles to us it seems no one is here today remember to take certified i would call this a beautiful view of the city if if if there was anything to admire hate night city that much perhaps i am simply homesick as you say now you must look for vulnerabilities weaknesses while i try to think of a diversion arasaka cannot discover our intentions a bit of sabotage it's just what we need to divert their attentions you will have the best of you on the left i will try here this old scope should be good for something shall we begin oh can you run and grab the pizza take out the food no just know if i had time and ingredients i would prepare some onigiri with cod or i will grill the salmon [Music] no even better with umeboshi plants um favorite appetizer simple tasty and filling i found him chewing once dried on his face it was a protein bar with a protein bar get out of here like a true soldier okay enough well we'll both grow hungry let's do this got eyes on the com system it's a lot of guards i could use comms for a diversion [Music] footbridge but it's guarded we will use it to enter if there's no other way antenna security hub's liable to be in that building perfect for sabotage transformer by the wall see it we should use it to step up this is not bad [Music] camouflage turrets by the gate a last result i do not wish to die there looks like a service tunnel by the road there it could lead to the warehouses armored door seal tight [Music] pipes see him we could use them to get [Music] inside trucks drive up regularly are we to hijack one i think i've seen everything we have what we came for so we going in it is what you said before entering competitions i wish to be certain we have not overlooked anything we should wait and observe if nothing out of the ordinary happens then yes we're going in sounds sensible better get comfy [Music] [Music] do you see it that cat fine looking feline thought they'd all disappeared from the city it is the first animal i see in night city except cockroaches of course first it was birds then dogs cats actually put up a fight longest perhaps it is a back eagle that can echo what's that it is a cat's spirit it brings misfortune can restore the dead back to life believing ghosts the relic let you talk to the dead does it not i believe we are past belief my grandmother knew many many stories about chits where'd you grow up anyway i am from the slums of chiva 11 once when i was desperate to live there i [Music] bad memories washed away by time i long only for the simple days of childhood [Music] childhood memories let's see hopping buildings running away from badges iron taste of blood from a split lip i remember the chemical stench of the canal where we boys washed our shirts corporate transporters sometimes passed through our slum arasaka selecting children but only the clean ones transporters you say 11 has the most murders in all japan it probably still has let me guess so they could turn them into corvo soldiers exactly when they chose me i felt i had won the lottery in the army i was given everything i lacked before disciplining regular meals and when i proved i was gifted an education so how's a corporal rookie go from cleaning latrines to being suburu arasaka's bodyguard the highest grace of the academy serves in the special forces and arasaka sama's unmatched eye for talent you're not saying saburo fell for you at first sight to make the right decisions with imperfect knowledge that is how you become the world's most powerful man 100 candidates standing at attention and arasaka looked into each of our souls and chose the one who [Music] all he had to do in return was kill soboro's enemies i sense that you judge me and yet you have no right to unlike you and your friend mr wells i was not arrogant i did not take the easy path saying you got no dirt on your hands there are no clean hands but it is important how they become dirty so spill how'd you sully yours arasaka gave me what no one else could values i could honor live for this was most important you dirty your hands for money i in the name of principles [Music] wasn't judging you and true you opposed the corporations their order their word in a mindless way yet you offer no wealthy alternative take a look around it's here your corporate world is glorious splendor you show me filthy streets as if no other world exists as if nothing else is possible what of the millions who work for arasaka and receive stability save shiva 11 slum rats they're there scraping scraps out of scoptines corpse decided that too [Music] we cannot fix everything at once you already forget what happened to tom's diner people hate corpse more than anything can't blame him either got some regrets but clapping from arasaka ain't one of them sometimes i wish to become a nomad to leave this world forget everything never too late to change what is your expression one cannot teach an old dog new tricks do you know what i think what's that that day incompete we both have lost someone important and we are not at peace with this so we seek conflict argue eagerly finally starting to make some sense it is the duty of the living to atone for the dead hanako shall aid us in our mission or she'll make sure we die for good the baccaneco gets sick of us looks like it will find its own way as will we [Music] i think it is time to do something you do not look so bad you know make sure so i'll be in touch the divergent reaction that is [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] um [Music] um go i don't know please please let me hmm i'm in good now try to enter the warehouse i will draw their attention away rather clever that's why i'm here very well i have reached the world i'll be in their communication systems uh you are an easy target when you step out ah even i see you now okay i'm in find the largest float they are controlled from inside that tech it could be an ordinary terminal gotcha how's things that you're in good i reached the control room and make a terrible mess very well i am ready when you finish i'll make the system sick uh okay float starts to do with as we please you can fly to tokyo if you want i just may do that good work now it is my turn can you see there were kills even the roof is slowly me the roof that is your will there are buildings around smaller ones use them to come down uh [ __ ] worked excellent luck b okay what now now we retreat into the shadows and arm ourselves with patience i will contact you before the parade until then try not to get into any more trouble as if i wasn't in enough already [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] so [Music] is well this is the place [Music] foreign hey v how you holding up being better i know probably not hard to tell nice ride brand new nope not in a chatty mood i see not really sorry so what happened needed someone to talk to uh-huh first take a look hello my name is arif iqbal and this is wns more

he suffered autopsy reports revealed the teenager was given dangerously high levels of hormones anabolic steroids and stimulants possessions and genetic material of seven other missing teens were also found in the car belonging to one anthony harris unfortunately their fates remain unknown although the criminal widely known as peter pan survives the gunshot he has not regained consciousness making interrogation impossible please stay tuned to wns this uh peter pan you know case you were looking for him never heard of him didn't cross my desk what's the problem if they caught the guy my nephew randy disappeared not long past and what you just saw the kid was wearing randy's shoes ah jesus randy's disappearance you know anything else my sister and i don't get along that well i don't know much just wish i could have been there for her when she needed it most and what they figured you'd get emotional and kept you off the case more like a restraining order won't let me anywhere near it gonogl took the lead on it lazy-ass gunk and so far he ain't accomplished [ __ ] no way i'd let this lie i know and that's why i'm asking for your help so what do we need to do can't interrogate the guy because he's a veg but he can view his dreams i'm sorry dreams you heard me come on i'll explain on the way an experimental procedure but it's already yielding results they record dreams that can be played back as bds you got access to these dreams not yet but they keep them in the lab okay got an appointment not exactly well going together but uh not through the main entrance oh we're gonna break the law we'll find a different way in and then hustle out quick never actually been here so i'll need your help thank you great what now we find our entrance they have an audit today it should how'd you know about the audit i did my homework know where they're keeping the bd likely the room where they edit the autistic kids dreams should be labeled as anthony harris a few of these rooms we probably don't have to bother with locked can't get in nothing here no sign of nvds they definitely don't store any bds in this area keep looking you keep that's a brain dance editing terminal you familiar a little no hey river i think i got it found something not yet anthony harris let's try these drawers takes half decent they got budget savvy management someone wants to be a cop when they grow up bill graham no anthony harris say river why not just have a janitor crack a door for you can't risk getting scolded for sniffing around somebody else's face yo what are you doing here you got kicked off the force just suspended actually what does she mean by that he hasn't told you yeah and please listen to me aren't you in enough trouble already harris kidnapped my nephew i'm sorry really

is a bastard barely no river we just work together do not believe any prophecy makes good tip thanks but we're wasting time paris's dream beatty where is it he isn't dreaming what why a bullet damaged his cerebral cortex we get only dissonant urges pieces i'd like to try audio visual stimulation but he isn't on the spectrum a favorite song or movie helps you reach the kids it might be worth a try i am aware of the similarity hypothalamus stimulation and hormone production but harris is not a child i have never tried the procedure on an adult any reason you haven't because unlike river i went to med school and studied neuroscience and not by reading about it over someone's shoulder on the metro let's try it we don't even know his preferences i'll find something i mean you're willing to try just go i'll open the front door for you let's ride v i know exactly where to start [Music] you
