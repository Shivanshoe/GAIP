[Music] mortal kombat has always been and always will be for millennia the forces of good and evil have been blocked in eternal battle over the control of earthrealm some seek to use the tournament to destroy all that is good others seek vengeance power or eternal life time after time each individual threat has been vanquished an earth realm has enjoyed relative peace for many years but there is concern that earth is once again in peril and this time the threat of evil has two faces it is now known that the sorcerer has escaped from the nether realm since his escape quan chi has unlocked the secret of the ancient room stone discovered the ancient undefeatable army of the long forgotten dragon king and most disturbing of all formed an alliance with one of our deadliest enemies shangsong with their combined strength they plotted to overpower the only two beings who could prevent their total domination of the two realms the first was the emperor of outworld xiao khan in a false show of allegiance they sprung their attack they then traveled to earthrealm by way of a mystical portal known only as sorcerers and deities there they confronted earth's mightiest warrior and champion of mortal combat liu lukang it has been shang tsung's desire to consume the soul of earth realm's greatest warriors with quan chi's assistance he achieved this goal [Music] is dead [Music] [Music] they have since returned to outworld and are using the souls of conquered warriors to resurrect the dragon king's undefeatable army should they succeed they will have the means to conquer outworld and eventually earth they will be unstoppable i can no longer stand idly by and watch this evil consume the world i have relinquished my status as elder god to return to earth and lead you all to battle against our old adversaries we must act now we must stop this deadly alliance [Music] the elder gods demanded a safeguard be put in place to avoid total destruction one that would make use of the combatants insatiable bloodlust like moths to flame they would be drawn to battle uh at the apex of destruction alliances will be broken and old hatreds will be revived hmm at last it has come to this final battle armageddon has begun in an outer chamber of the dragon king's throne room irma did battle with luke hangs enslaved comrades burma was more than a match for the five warriors but their defeat was not his objective lukang materialized and one by one freed their souls while ermac occupied the rest eventually all five were awakened from their enchantment and freed from onaga's control ermack was pleased that his warriors skills could for once bring about a noble outcome he sensed however that an ominous force still shaped the destiny of the realms it was everywhere he could feel its influence on onaga though the dragon king was oblivious to its manipulation time was running out ermack feared the celebration of this latest victory would be short-lived oh naga seemed invincible the races of outworld were in disagreement over how to deal with this threat and baraka's hordes were sweeping the land o raicho had almost given up hope when he was visited by the spirit of his greatest student liu kang their roles now reversed liu kang gave boricho the inspiration necessary to continue the fight origin's soul was invigorated he met with outworld's many leaders to forge a temporary truce kitana gave him command of what remained of her army and he led them to battle against baraka's mutant foot soldiers the new army of outworld crushed the tarkata vermin and baraka himself was bested by boricho's attack the victory inspired the people of outworld to rise up against the dragon king blue kang's friends had been freed onaga had been defeated and the realms were secure once more but there was one battle that remained kang's body had been used by some unknown force as a tool of destruction it had left death in its wake and needed to be stopped the chaos would end in earth realm the fight raged with neither combatant able to best the other when a jolt of energy crackled through them both liu kang's nerves blazed like fire and he felt a rush of air filled his lungs for the first time since his death he was liu kang once more protector of earth realm champion of mortal combat you
