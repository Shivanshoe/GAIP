no matter what i did [Music] dad's laundry i always set it here when it was done so he could find it [Music] i tried so hard to keep my promise to her [Music] mom and dad had this tv before they had either of us gabe had barely used this backpack in weeks nobody could get him to go to school the killer mistress tabs in this book weren't even close to right gabe loved son of lead back when it was an indie it was too gory for me at least i managed to hold on to you shushu cleaning dad's ashtray was not my favorite job in the world mom's old sewing kit don't think i've ever even tasted a butter cookie it was full of greeting cards mom kept every single one we ever got thanks for trying lucky cat my job was to sort them in order of how close we were to a collections notice i wanted to be a werewolf that halloween couldn't afford the costume i can't believe they were ever this happy i didn't even know what cps was just that i was afraid of them almost empty almost two cups water for one cup rice set timer for 30 minutes do your history homework serve almost empty [Music] almost always we never really touched these after mom died she was such a good cook gabe used to steal dad's beer all the time it was like the one thing they didn't fight about when wasn't this place falling apart [Music] where you going are you gonna tell her or is that my job keep your voice down fine i'll do it alex dad lost his job again so we're broke again don't talk to me that way despite what you may believe you do not know everything you think what i laid myself off it's okay we'll figure it out i could um i don't know dad but what are we supposed to do now we gotta eat we can sell some records or or what about my guitar we can sell that alex what is it gonna take to get you to stop defending him your mother could see you now i don't want to hear about my babe i'm so tired of you using her as an excuse to be a piece of [ __ ] don't [ __ ] touch me piece of [ __ ] damn it alex i'm okay it's okay it was an accident alexa i i i didn't dad dad it's okay really i'm not hurt i can't do this dad someone will come that woman from cps someone dad i'm sorry huh uh hey can i ask you a question which orphanage is this the one in grant park kind of thought it'd be nicer i can't do this okay i i can't you need to no you need to be honest about what you see i was i have and now i'm done almost but not yet you were 12 i am 16. i steal a car and end up in juvie gabe come on then you're 13 14 15. orphanages group homes musty rooms in the strange houses of foster parents by the time you're 17 you've seen them all somewhere along the line you start to feel things your own emotions don't belong to you you have nothing no one you are alone i don't want this alex play your part play my part i used to write one every day stupid why you clearly missed him and i thought he missed me hence stupid how are you holding up shoe can't believe how long you've had that thing that thing was my only friend after you left guess i missed a few days we weren't allowed to bring glass into the dorms so we had to drink from this thing like hamsters in a cage except if you give a hamster a glass they don't toss it at the other hamster's heads pretty sure it's locked must be after curfew we're not going anywhere god they put me on so many meds did any of them ever work some of them helped a little none of them fixed me in their defense mutant empathy isn't exactly in the dsm they used to say this place wasn't a prison well maybe they were trying to keep you safe guess so whatever the reason the end result was prison bars i took a fork in here one time and hid it under my mattress just cause [ __ ] you they should have stenciled the same thing on all of us do you really feel like you were their property we didn't belong to anyone else did we i remember the kid who put this here sadie sally um something with an s you were friends at first right way at first then i freaked out on her and she was done with me just like everyone else everyone had one good outfit we wore them to meet the parents did it help kind of think you already know the answer to that question well there are my strings where's my guitar i don't understand why can't i have my guitar we've been over this alex your guitar stays in the rec room you can play it during free time that's [ __ ] i don't need it in the [ __ ] rec room i need it when i'm stuck in the [ __ ] dorms alex that's enough maybe we'll just take away your guitar privileges entirely if that's what you prefer you can't do that so uh she's been through so much i just don't know if we're prepared for a troubled girl it says here she's sensitive what does that mean i wonder why she's never found a home before i'm sure she's the sweet girl but she's not for us she's awfully old isn't she this is the kid that's been in all those fights right i want to help i i really do she's just something broken wrong with her i'm sorry why you need to see it see what then nobody picked me nobody picked you nobody picked you nobody wanted you mom died dad left i bailed you couldn't keep us together it was my job to keep it you were 11 years old you were 11 years old you were a kid alex let it go people leave life gets hard sometimes it's a big [ __ ] sandwich make it better be angry at dad miss mom hell be angry at me but don't give up no one gets to tell you what you're worth and no one can take your life away fight i'm not sure i you have a gift it's something you don't even understand you can change the world make it better now get up what get up and fight oh ugh uh ah i've got to find a way out of here mine's growing into mines just like judd said i'm gonna choose not to read anything into this i could almost laugh if it wouldn't hurt so much how long has this stuff been down here oh no no no no no come on [Music] i can do this huh okay that's something [Music] that aura is the only lead i've got so all right boys getting close held average for life huh dig so deep we see where the devil sleeps god damn right this is it this is what typhon tried to bury a lot of runoff moisture in this soil jed we gotta call it this dick is [ __ ] nothing's [ __ ] jet we got no pumps running no my teams have never quitted dick this deep before we finish the job steady goes steady was move come on clear the tunnel who's on radio chad [ __ ] chad we gotta move now there's still men back there they'll drown yeah and so will we if we don't get the [ __ ] out make the call jed god damn it god damn it everyone let's go now [Music] smells like fireworks must be where typhon blew the charges [Music] dad [Music] so [Music] dad come back get you instead of a [ __ ] jen you gotta stop man [ __ ] you chad come back it's over jen he's not coming back i'm sorry i'm so sorry uh so so and during my time here i've come to realize what makes haven so special it's a flower shop run by multiple generations a bar owner who greets every customer by name it's a spring festival tradition going back a hundred years history loyalty pride these values which define haven are the same values that typhon was built on and that is why our partnership has been so successful it's been my privilege to renew typhon's commitment to haven we believe in this community and we're tremendously excited for its future you diane i think i speak for all of us when i say we're eager to make this official so time to vote folks and then lunch [Music] [Music] alex oh my god i'm fine you are not fine we have to get you to a doctor what happened to you i found out something you need to hear i'm sorry [Music] but alex you're hurt [Music] do you need help we can call in typhon's been lying to all of you and so has jed lucan alex what's going on [ __ ] you what the hell happened i was down in the mine last night i saw what typhon's been hiding for 12 years jed lucan isn't a hero that whole story is a lie jed caused the accident and then he abandoned seven of his men he let them drown to save himself there were pictures of me and gabe down there in the dirt because one of those miners was my father [Music] typhon wanted to keep this covered up in case it jeopardized the vote [Music] at that company is scared to death all they do is protect themselves so they decided to bury the evidence and nothing was going to stop that blast not even the fact that there were four people up in the mountains that's how gabe was killed jed knew all along he covered up the truth about the past about gabe and when i found out as you can see [Music] he tried to kill me too [Music] [Music] why aren't any of you saying anything we don't want to embarrass you alex try me these accusations are well they're insane and trying to go into the mine was obviously a very dangerous very illegal thing to do but we all sympathize with your situation you've been through so much your brother was your only family wasn't he i can only imagine how much you want an explanation for his loss something to give you comfort and make your life seem less unfair you know there's proof of the cover-up you had pike arrest me to suppress the evidence officer pike arrested you for stealing items from my purse perhaps you were looking for evidence and i found it which is why you and jed tried to threaten me into silence dad do you have any idea what alex is talking about no i don't i've tried to be there for alex since gabe died i thought i don't know i hoped i could be something of a father figure to her all i can guess is sometimes when we're hurting the people we lash out at are the ones who are trying to help you tried to kill me how can you stand there and say these things alex you're a monster please i know this is hard to accept you all trust him i did too but i'm telling the truth i believe you of course i do i would like to speak this young lady came to haven as a stranger but over the last few weeks she's become one of us now her story certainly seems unlikely if not impossible but she deserves at least an investigation of her claims we ought to take her seriously ducky you're being unhelpful alex sweetheart you know our mind can play tricks on us none of it is your fault so hard to admit you need help but it's always better in the end we're all worried about you let us help you charlotte no leave me alone i don't want any more of this they killed gabe what are you trying to do take down typhon that won't bring him back all i know is everything falls to [ __ ] when you're involved there's something wrong with you alex and now there's something wrong with me i can't help you i'm sorry don't worry alex i got this oh for [ __ ] sake i have a usb stick full of recordings yes we went through this yesterday your superiors closed the case none of us have time for conspiracies yeah they're trying to weasel your way out of things again huh i know your game i know don't test me jason you know what i'm not scared of you anymore and not you not typhin all right that's enough deputy pike do you have some kind of personal issue with me like hell i do jason well given that your judgment in this matter is emotionally compromised you should probably remove yourself from cut the crap if you think you could shut me up it concerns me that a voting member who believes my dad is not a murderer were you afraid we couldn't get typhon is that why you need someone else to blame i thought we were in this together for gabe and me i thought you cared about me ryan no i'm not gonna let you do that to me anymore ryan what the hell i know he's your dad but look at her why would she lie about this it's going too far alex almost died it's not true [ __ ] you ryan after everything seriously [ __ ] you stop [Music] [Music] i know why you tried to kill me it's not what you tell yourself that you thought it was best for haven this was never about haven at all was it this was about you [Music] i know it's easier not having to think about the men you buried you want to look away and pretend the people you hurt aren't people but i won't let you my father worked for you his name was john [Music] the world never gave him anything for free he fought just to stay alive he fought for us maybe he was finally winning [Music] but you killed him [Music] and then gabe my big brother [Music] he was building a family here doing it his own way figuring it out as he went along he was so nervous about it and so excited and he brought me here to be part of that family but he died because of you and then there's me for so many years i just wanted to survive to get through even changed me i started to think about the future [Music] i want to belong somewhere i want to know that there's a place and a group of people who wouldn't be the same without me i was starting to feel that here and you tried to murder me you would have ended my life just so you wouldn't have to face the truth [Music] you've forgotten it haven't you you've plastered over it with another story you tell yourself you're a hero a strong leader sometimes that means making hard choices decisions that could lead to people dying a few men could handle that haven's lucky to have you [Music] but that's the lie [Music] if you scrape it away what do we see [Music] eleven years ago you led a group of men to their deaths and then you gave your soul to typhon you let them tell you how awful it would be for your wife and son to find out you let them tell you that haven was more important than the men who died when it really mattered who you were and what you stood for you let typhan decide for you i can feel you trying to pull away don't the truth hurts sometimes it's so awful you think you're gonna break but when you come out the other side and you're whole and free and still alive then you'll finally know how strong you really are [Music] i see the truth about you you hate yourself you hate what you did in the past you hate what you've done to keep it secret and the more you deny that hatred the worse it grows i know who you are i've seen the worst parts of you [Music] and i condemn you [Music] [Music] uh [Music] dreams [Music] and the news is still coming in on the type and mining scandal that has rocked the western slope town of haven springs where a council meeting was the scene for shocking revelations local bar owner and council president jed lucan admitted in a tearful confession to covering up the deaths of seven typhon employees as their manager 12 years ago a recent cover-up which involved a clandestine and unpermitted explosion to ford inspections caused the death of haven local gabe chen last month mr lucan is currently in police custody awaiting arraignment we will have plenty more about this developing story including the resignation of typhon ceo the market impact and what it all means for your drive time commute coming right yeah the silence is worse i need to get some air [Music] i bet steph wishes she could reward that but it's pretty funny i'm so sorry i worried you all it never ends the phrase recent events is doing some work in this post i've got some continued support for you do i need a charlotte harmon portrait i kind of think i need a charlotte harmon portrait after summoning all my strength and willpower i'm now ready to move from the bed to the rooftop they say i was powered by adrenaline that whole morning now i'm mostly powered by extra strength advil and these i felt very close to ducky after our dance i guess he felt the same way i know now that my inaction in the face of injustice was itself a terrible wrong and i know that i will never be able to undo the tremendous pain and loss i caused i do not ask for forgiveness the only person who could give that to me is is gone thank you there are no victories at the end of this just more painful truths i'll never understand exactly what happened to me down there but i'll always be grateful couldn't bring himself to get rid of it [Music] you ever swing a pic before mr chen john and now but i i'm a hard worker and i learn fast and i don't mind long hours you don't have somebody waiting on you at home no sir well john guess you're a hell diver now still looking out for me huh pike nothing like being called delusional by someone you trusted that one really hurt must be rare that a local paper gets to break out the really big headline see this is why i try to only read the art sections was charlotte's response all my fault or would she have turned on me no matter what i haven't spoken to ryan since the vote what am i even supposed to say to him i love this guitar but if it starts asking me riddles again i'm throwing it out the window i've been playing a lot the last two days trying to think things through but i realize it's actually the opposite when i'm playing is the only time i get to not think not think about jed or gabe or being betrayed and wanting to forgive but not knowing if i can most of all what i don't think about is me because i've never been good at that and suddenly it's the only question that's left so i just keep playing i want to go outside without seeing anyone that's why god created rooftops maybe i do deserve some dollar sign justice but i'd much rather be able to move on with my life the larp was two days ago that doesn't seem possible i'm so sorry i know what you said the truth about my dad i i couldn't accept it maybe i wasn't strong enough can you ever forgive me i don't know after everything we went through you weren't there when i needed you how can i ever trust you again but i want to try it just might take time i can live with that so what's next for alex chen i guess i'm asking because i'm in i mean whether it's here or anywhere else if you want me i'm there you would really leave haven sure what's left for me here anyway unless you were staying i'm not used to getting to decide what i want i guess i'd better think about it i guess so you know where to find me all right just tell me what my future what to do the night of the spring fest ryan made a strong case for why i should stay in haven the idea of making this place my home it seemed nice of course that was before all the [ __ ] went down come on you're the know-it-all so tell me actually i do know what you should do you should stay in haven you really think so of course you finally have a home a job people who actually like you why would you give that up that's true then again maybe leaving would be better what you're young you suddenly have a little money friends and don't you think it's time to give this music thing a real shot no you should definitely leave oh [ __ ] off stop it gabe i don't need the mysterious spirit [ __ ] right now i just need i just need my big brother i'm sorry i know but here's something it's three hours from now a bus pulls away you're not on it ryan approves life goes on you go back to work you settle into into a routine and one day with almost no warning steph up in bolt's town it hurts but she does offer you a going-away present her job you take it all those years of being a music snob finally pay off and little by little time does its thing the apartment starts to feel less like a museum and more like a home lots of jad of typhon even of me begin to fade into the background the rooftop is your stage you perform every week to a small but adoring group of fans maybe while you play you wonder what could have been performing for more people in more cities sharing your music with the world or maybe you never think about that much at all you don't know exactly when it happens but one day you look around and find that you have transformed this place just as much as it has transformed you and the most extraordinary thing of all is just how normal it feels you don't question it you don't doubt it i wonder what might have been it's your life the life you fought so hard to have and for the first time in a long time you just live thank you don't mention it you really think i'll transform haven of course you already have with your gift your music just by being you but alex that doesn't mean you have to stay you have the potential to do that anywhere you go where am i supposed to go i don't have any other home that is true but you didn't have any home before coming here and look what happened the truth is there's no telling what that version of your future might be the only promise is the adventure so what do you think [Music] i know what i want foreign so and during my time here i've come to realize what makes havens so special it's a flower shop run by multiple generations a bar owner who greets every customer by name it's a spring festival tradition going back a hundred years history loyalty pride these values which define haven are the same values that typhon was built on and that is why our partnership has been so successful it's been my

[ __ ] went down come on you're the know-it-all so tell me actually i do know what you should do you should stay in haven of course you're right i've never had a home before friends a job a place to live why would i give that up now then again maybe leaving would be better what you're young you suddenly have a little money friends and don't you think it's time to give this music thing a real shot no you should definitely leave oh [ __ ] off stop it gabe i don't need the mysterious spirit [ __ ] right now i just need i just need my big brother i'm sorry i know but here's something it's three hours from now a bus pulls away you're not on it ryan approves life goes on you go back to work you settle into a routine in one day with almost no warning steph up in bolt's town it hurts but she

transform haven of course you already have with your gift your music just by being you but alex that doesn't mean you have to stay you have the potential to do that anywhere you go do what exactly

version of your future might be the only promise is the adventure so what do you think [Music] i know what i want um [Music] okay [Applause] hello everyone i'm alex chen [Music] you
