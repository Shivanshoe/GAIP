hey lloyd you managed to get i'm working on it [Music] good call i might want to read that contract before going on the hunt [Music] uh is holding up [Music] a lot of ancient wrecks out here [Music] atomic if i override it i can get data on the surrounding area oh wow [Music] uh there wow [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] that'll keep me on my feet [Music] [Applause] [Music] are you okay stop right there where's the tall knight that's sending the signal to my stash looks like a satellite dish if i can climb it should be able to reach that tallneck easily enough uh [Music] huh what is that a power generator [Music] this must have generated power at some point instead now has to be way up this thing [Music] [Music] can't climb any higher [Music] we can figure out a way to turn the power back on you might be able to move things around [Music] huh a power cell disconnected from the main power line this should get that generator below the dish going [Music] there's the generator bet this power saw can get it running power's back i should check that console see what this thing does is still not high enough [Music] this actually worked i should be able to get to that tallneck now just gotta find the right spot looks like i might need to glide onto the tallneck just gotta time it right is this easy but there we go time to override the big guy [Music] it's all right i'm almost done there we go tall next to map data to other machines and now it's mine [Music] old satellite dishes so foreign let's unlock the rebels looks like they've set up camp close to baron light i should see what they're up to they've got riders patrolling the area better be careful [Music] do some training intruder yeah get over there and help we've gotta help them still a little sweat now [Music] i'll start there she thinks she can hide [Music] [Music] i bet i can oh that wall there maybe find a way into the camp amy [Music] now [Music] [Music] i'm ready for you [Music] prisoner closer him i think [Music] this isn't a battle worthy ah [Music] [Music] let's get to the dropper oh going in [Music] throwing fun give them support [Music] there's no sign of her here i think one of these structures is a command center [Music] ah [Music] loyal to knox hear me i was told the soldier from this camp goaded one of the sons of prometheus into an altercation you would do well to remember that our allies are responsible for providing the machines that we shall ride to glory the next true who interferes with them will be eviscerated and left in the desert for carry on there will be no second warning [Music] yeah that should prevent your people from butting heads with mine you have my thanks regala they are packed lead to victory so regal is not working alone these sons of prometheus gave her the ability to override machines they've been accumulating blaze and from what i saw out there enough to blow up something big huh yep she was just here i don't understand [Music] hey i'm here to help you follow my lead you got it huh the map of the daunt tracking movement in and out of barren light with emphasis on the fort's weak points they're gonna blow up barren light make a hole big enough to fit an entire army so regala plans on invading the sundance at least when she gets an army big enough to do it good thing i blew up all that blaze i doubt the rebels will stick around now or i could take them out myself either way main threat's been dealt with so [Music] hmm pretty sure that's the passage lawrence contract mentioned i should make sure i have my facts straight give the contract a quick read shell walkers use this passage regularly and laryn wants their plating i just need to wait them out at his camp it might be a good idea to place some traps on the road first catch the convoy by surprise this should help convoy it's here [Music] lauren's contract said they'd set up traps along the passage might as well use them [Music] if i find the right cauldron could learn how to override this machine there's only one shellwalker with him [Music] ugh turner oh relief i should salvage what i can and leave the planing for laryn's crew yes [Music] huh huntress you're back i took down that shellwalker for you vonda rendor we got a pickup for our contract here's your payment this will definitely help me make some great armor but well i realized an armor made out of shell walker platings good but with just a few minor additions it could be so much better if you'd be willing to take on a few more contracts what do you say what else do you need for your armor alarm antennas strong supple i could use them to make my armor more flexible we picked out a herd of scroungers already i'll uh read through the contract see what i can do best of luck tell me more about these contracts of yours i was thinking scrapper jaws are powerful i could use them to strengthen my armor crew spotted a pack of them not far from here primed for salvage i guess i can give the contract a look fantastic food okay oh [Music] so hmm yes that looks like the coordinates silence gave me to match that wreckage did he install hades on another titan hold on to this for later so that's oh [Music] wow this is it location of the coordinates i scan from this fire a workshop underneath a dead horse titan just the kind of place silence would slink away to but what was he doing here that device is blinking i guess silence wants me to check it out [Music] eloy consider this message a beacon to help guide you out of the fog of ignorance using explosives i've detached the processing orb from the titan overhead a perfect cage for our mutual friend he is in order to render it cooperative tell her what we discussed about the mysterious signal that gave you life [Music] perhaps you need a reminder that you have failed so you see it gaia can be safely rebooted as for a way to find a backup well you'll need to trot along after me to find out he thinks he's got it all figured out bastard i guess there's only one way to find out where he moved the orb might be worth looking around more first poor haters so cramped in there no room to think you can't even speak now the processing of a titan on the other hand well you're used to that but once i load you on that you'll be so much more comfortable until interrogations begin anyway [Music] ugh some kind of log most of it's redacted it looks like silence put a lot of work into forcing hades to talk yep well i better see where this trail leads i don't think there's anything i can do about this now some kind of red crystal i can get it for my stash later so here i am following along after silence like a fool after he tricked me by rigging his lance to steal hades a crazy ai that wants to kill everything he couldn't just let me do the same thing and destroy it and now i'm gonna have to put up with more of a self-righteous things easier so so so with ah uh [Music] a gemstone it's green like blaze but it's hard and shiny i wonder if merchants would be interested silence must be pretty confident he's found a backup of gaia but how every place i've checked every lead they've all been dead ends all backups purged [Music] so what did hades tell him uh can't get rid of the vines now yet anyway so foreign okay huh that did nothing the merchant didn't expect to see anyone else out here it might be him oh there what's anora doing this far west ah no matter no matter i can get you stocked up for the wild [Music] [Music] have fun with that [Music] [Music] [Music] exploring college might teach me how to overwrite these things [Music] [Music] not my chance [Music] [Music] this will be a mustache when i need it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] looks like the trail goes into the hillside ruin okay let's see where this goes i guess silence used that machine to haul his prize that must be the orb silence stuck hades in from that door looks like a pharaoh facility or a zero dawn come on hades you still in there [Music] hades [Music] is that you system threat detected you don't look so good you are [Music] yes permanently this time even like this you're a threat to gaia once i resurrect her so you have not yet secured dire back up then gaia is dead earth despite malfunctions i have one silence asked you where to find a backup of gaia [Music] right because that would have been easy what did silence do to you hades it's like you've been hollowed out silence [Music] and what did you tell him [Music] you don't remember any of it what like me beating you at the spire okay that's not going anywhere do you know where silence went no he departed 12.8 days ago perhaps [Music] data error behavior prediction structures disintegrated so you don't know anything more than i do great do you know why silence dragged you to these ruins silence obviously but why what was this place location is disintegrating but you i guess i'll find out when i go inside when the mysterious signal transformed you it made gaia's other subordinate functions conscious too you escaped when gaia destroyed herself but so did they where did they go [Music] disintegrated bunch of crazed ais scattered who knows where doing who knows what hephaestus kills thousands every year with the combat machines it keeps making and you nearly end of the world seven more functions out there cooking up trouble it's not a happy thought you are unhappy good anyone ever tell you you've got a great personality hades sarcasm detected yeah didn't think so silence questioned you about the mysterious signal the one that woke you gave you consciousness who sent it transplanted by masters and who are they masters walk me to destroy earthly [Music] disintegrated enough it's time to finish this does still think she can restore gaia save life on earth yeah alloy doesn't [Music] what would you know hades twice you tried to destroy life on earth and twice you failed the only extinction you ever brought about is your own and there's no tricked out lance to save you this time [Music] you remember this yes [Music] centuries ago it's what you were designed to do [Music] there won't need to be i'm saving this one [Music] [Music] extinction protocol [Music] aloy i see you've dealt with hades yeah think maybe you can stay dead this time it will you can trust trust yes trust as in since i did what you could never do and extracted all of haiti's priceless knowledge you can trust that i was willing to actually let you destroy it this time so back to holograms instead of face to face what afraid i'd stab you or something there's a reason i'm using the same spyware i see so all those times i called you could have just answered but i guess you just prefer to go on spying all this time my world stopped revolving around you months ago hey i've had work to do countless hours of research as demanding and time intensive as it has been critical to the fate of this planet right of course you're just trying to save the world too that's right the difference of course is that unlike you i've produced results did you find a backup of gaia or not well yes i believe i did where voila why do you think i summoned you here behind that gene locked hatched like the ruins of the ancient facility where the hades extinction protocol was perfected a testing process that ran hundreds of trials each of them using a backup of gaia hades told you this it took some convincing but yes so are you ready to go get what you've been searching for for the last six months or are you just going to stand today with your mouth open you mentioned you've been busy exceptionally busy but not so busy you couldn't teach to knock the rebels to override machines ride them as mounts hey the only issue you should be concerned about is obtaining a guy backup perhaps if you focused more you might actually see results that's not exactly a denial silence take it any way you want just to confirm haiti said that there are backups of gaia in there yes or will anyway thousand years ago backups that didn't get purged when ted farah wiped every copy of apollo correct according to hades this facility could not be accessed by remote signal not even ted farrow could touch the debtor here backups data complete guy and her subordinate functions everything needed to reboot the system restore control over the terraforming system save life on earth and there so haiti said [Music] so what are you waiting for did hades reveal the source of the mysterious signal the one that woke it tried to destroy life on earth yes it did care to share in due time first things first eloy last i checked you still had a super intelligent ai named gaia to reboot yeah the same gaia who had to destroy herself 20 years ago because of the signal it stopped being transmitted years ago it's no longer a threat what if it repeats it won't even if it did well the details are complicated but the signal required hades to take effect delete hades from any backup you reboot and guy is safe now stop wasting time go get a backup all right i'll search the facility for a gaia backup but just to be clear silence if this ends up being another one of your tricks you're literally the only person who can open it how could i sit a trap inside trick me again silence and our next conversation will be face to face though you won't have much to say on account of my spear being buried in your throat thanks to me everything you desired everything you've been fumbling about unable to achieve for six months is now within your grasp now i know you didn't learn much about manners growing up on your outcast but in a situation like this you say thank you and i say you're welcome [Music] please step inside please stand inside please step inside are you kidding me i think we're in luck and look the door is completely messed up obviously but despite the malfunction you can still get through if you'll be patient for a while longer see those crystals there the azram call them fire gleam they're combustible not nearly powerful enough to blast through a door like that but maybe just enough to jolt it open a bit more exactly it will only work with an igniter i'm sending you the schematics now to build it you'll need some machine parts and the oil from a kindle wheat plant that only grows underwater but you should be able to find some of the nearby lake the parts are more complicated you'll need got it looks like i already have everything i need for the igniter now i just need to build this thing there's a workbench near the entrance to the facility from your time tinkering with hades tinkering more like extracting invaluable data there should be able to use this to blow up that fire gleam now indeed a useful combination it's how i detached the processing world from the horse in the first place great i'd step back finally i think i'm in then by all means proceed now that i have this igniter i could blow up that fire gleam that i've seen before focus on the task handy this whole place is flooded and there's another gene lock door on the other side that's where any gaia backups would have been stored i have to find a way to get over there well this is familiar making my way through ancient crumbling ruins while you spy on me through my focus stop waxing nostalgic and concentrate on finding a backup hmm my polecaster might come in handy here huh door's locked there's some kind of device next to it that did it uh hmm let's be calling something what was this room for looks like there is another console that needs power this console shut down huh ugh uh huh uh elizabeth and travis tate oh boy i tell you liz what i just done gonna make you love me i just imagine them far zenith rap scallions opening this fake guy that we made for him and i thought what this really needs is a signature this isn't a prank travis i know i know all i did was just script a couple of avatars a little you little me to deliver our message of doom real personal lag would you just send it as soon as it's done compiling then you and me should celebrate i brought party fixins pizza rolls absinthes a couple of hacky sacks i'm heading back to bryce as soon as this is done color me confounded liz how is it that someone like you paragon damn near saint he loved this world so damn much but no one eat it i mean have you ever even had a friend compile complete data logic bombs off here it comes far z-nuts just keeping the best of what you do travis always admire you from afar liz it's where my mom was grave yeah she was religious travis was wrong elizabeth was trying to make sure life had a future she cared about everyone i'm not so sure the exceptional walk a path of solitude elon zeal and i are well aware of oh what do we have here [Music] uh there's another panel up there that i should be able to pull open i'll have to climb higher to reach it don't think my pool caster can latch onto from here i'm gonna have to jump i can't make that jump but if i glide [Music] i don't think i'm gonna get to the door from here there's more of the facility over there i better take a look [Music] careful what's in here there's another locked door what's that console next to it balls dude how loud is it out there outside the noise dampening field 150 decibels well i guess we got privacy what's the hap trap you me go back a ways but i never saw you cheat no one why start with farzini i was going to tell you about it they get a copy of gaia i get a spot on the odyssey but but i told them i said make it two spots because i'm bringing my friend trav gosh hank sounds like the dampening field done slipped you all right no i'm cool okay got a personal field right here see now i know your ears ain't working so well just now but see that text transcribing every word i say good while i dial the music out there up to 170 decibels how about you type in that transmit code there you go and that's all of it cool thank you hank we're done security hank shaw is ready for collection no he's still breathing might want to bring a spatula though looks like this is connected to the door it needs a code to open find this in my stash later data here from travis tate this place turned out a lot of malware before zero dawn took over and one of them has a number maybe i should check my data points there we go [Music] ah [Music] the deal's off tilde zero dawn got its ectogenic chambers far zenith needs the apollo database there's no reason this incident you tried to steal gaia i had nothing to do with it and you punished those responsible your logic bomb has them scrambling to restore vital systems i'm really supposed to believe that you knew nothing about this please liz humanity's chances are slim as is you may not approve of our plan but what if we're the only ones to survive don't you want us to have apollo to remember our common past our mistakes i'm begging you fine you'll get your copy of apollo thank you let's speak again before die tilde [Music] there's the door getting close huh huh [Music] i oh uh [Music] [Music] okay so much for the flooded maze i made it that thing is huge it looks like the power's off except for that console it's damp in here too i hope the water hasn't corroded anything i need a backup start looking genetic profile confirmed greetings dr sobek do you wish to activate recluse spider i do activating okay that doesn't sound good it appears to be unstable and very heavy be careful at least i've got power and there's data here looks like this recluse spider thing is a testing apparatus for gaia and hades i'd better take a look at that excess panel yes get to it okay i think those circular pods are repositories one loaded with hades backups the other with gaia what are you waiting for it is down but the guy repository stuck so unstick it i need to detach the cable from the arms coupling well now that it's down i should be able to access that pod that can't be right gaia was a vast super intelligence he barely expected us [Music] with which to form a heuristic matrix so it's useless i'm afraid so without something [Music] for what nothing maybe saving the world is too big a task for any one person wait wait wait it's useless without sub functions but there are some functions out there the original ones scattered to the winds one guy blew herself up they could be anywhere you can't find them in time even if you did the mysterious signal mutated them just like hades you'll have no idea a good one if it works it is you found maneuver but it won't connect it's close mountains west of plainton close enough for me to go get it i was hoping to find all the subfunctions but one's enough to get started right it is recover minerva one could use it to launch a guy's heuristic matrix when she's conscious she helps me find the other sub-functions i go gather [Music] still think i can't save the world on my own um yes well above that alert intruders event hey i need you to listen closely these intruders want the same thing you do diet reborn it's why they're here friends of yours no they don't know me the data pulse i transmitted indicated that a gaia backup could be recovered here was anonymous now they're very powerful but they won't harm you not when they see who you are what you are a clone of elizabeth sobeck a genetic key with which they can reboot guy and rebuild the system they need it i warned you silence for once a lawyer submit to the inevitable open the hatch first i rebuild gaia save life on earth then i track you down and end yours i'm trying to help you here try spying on me with that there no focus spyware free okay think i think i think [Music] i don't care how powerful they are the only thing that can open that hatch is me the question is can i find another way out there's a current in the water not much but maybe it's a way out genetic profile confirmed entry authorized dr sobak please step inside hmm looks promising beta do we have it fantastic did the pulse originate here something wrong inspectors beta well any idea what the hell a clone of elizabeth sobek is doing here maybe gaia made one when it destroyed itself a hail mary to repair the system um don't like the sound of that now don't like it don't want it but the effect nope one's enough trouble eric yeah care to do a little downsizing hmm sure what if she sent the pulse then that was foolish of her but we got what we came for so let's put it to use [Music] i snap a lot of necks in vr but that certain tremor as life fades from the eyes oh no hollow quite gets it keep flapping your mouth it makes a nice target you actually think that primitive crap you got there can hurt me this is gonna be fun you don't know what the hollows i'm not hurting him i need a way out of here bring the whole processor down [Music] i gotta use that console to make it trap that's not gonna help you girl this kills all mine another one's out what are you up to there we go come on shoot at me not that rigged you got spunk girl reckon that thing ain't gonna help girl come on come at me cut the main stem i need to shoot the couplings holding up the steps but all good things must come to an end isn't that right i need to cut them all looks like there's two more couplings on the stem fight me not that young machine one more if that thing comes down it's only gonna kill you because i'm letting you have all the fun [Music] god dammit [Music] what was that me killing what you wanted dead what the hell did you think the platform collapsed body went with it right and since when don't you get what you want huh specters search i gotta find a way out of here there's a current there might be a way under this [Music] might be might be a way under this [Music] uh know how to get out of here dammit wow [Music] looks like some kind of power room a current sleep here promising so uh perfect [Music] i found [Music] it's okay i'm here i've got it [Music] hey easy easy there hey hey hey hey it's right here and the way you were clutching it when i found you in knew it was important where are we an outpost of the utaru tribe not far from where you fell how long two days there's no time i found something [Music] in the mountains yeah i kept watering it while i carried you look anyway whatever it is that you found you're in no shape i will crawl if i have to okay fine but before you do that there's someone you should talk to an uttaru named zou she told me there's been trouble in those mountains a cave spitting out deadly machines can't be a coincidence right why do we need her let's head for the cave it's in uttaru territory her territory she can help us we'll see fine let's go see this marvelous so then wither roots rot in snow still the seed rises as certain as stones so she should be in bed aloy doesn't really do you're so right [Music] we're all said i should talk to you about the machines in the mountains west of plain song i am a grave singer my place is here we can talk once you've healed what's wrong with it her her name is rey not it she's one of our land gods and she's dying but not just dying she's suffering her condition is not your concern so if anyone can help it's alloy may i am [Music] so what i'm about to do might look bad but it will help spear [Music] ugh i still need to talk of course but this way [Music] [Applause] the mountains west of plain song no trouble out there the otaru have trouble everywhere our fields blighted our settlements abandoned but the cave in the mountains is the worst of it it is a sacred place far another of our land gods went inside weeks ago but she hasn't emerged killer machines pour out instead threatening to overwhelm us it's never happened before wouldn't be your first sacred cave [Music] thanks for taking us in varl's the one that carried you across the wilds i doubt anyone else here would have let us in or stayed by my side to make sure alloy was comfortable we were lucky to find you i could say the same thing sounds like you two have been spending a lot of time together i wish it hadn't taken an injury to make that happen i hope you feel better and soon you said the tribe has trouble with its fields and settlements yes whereas once the land gods harvested endless bounty from the fields now they sow a poisonous blight war brews among the tanakh so their rebels prowl our outskirts and the machines grow ever more aggressive hemming us in forcing us to desert distant villages now they're even coming out of our sacred cave many in the tribe fear our days are dwindling i wish i could tell you it was better everywhere else not that we're going to lose hope ray and other machines like her you call them gods land gods yes for generations they provided for us seeding and harvesting the fields of plain song food for all a miracle of endless bounty a form run by machines more than a farm a blessed land providing sustenance for my people until that arrangement so what happened to the land gods after the derangement they've altered year by year once they were peaceful now they turn on us when we approach even attack us they'd always enrich the soil but for several seasons they've glutted it endlessly with mulch the fields have turned fetid a blight that keeps spreading even beyond our lands we used to have food for all now we we barely have enough to feed our children must be over fertilization spread by spores maybe i don't know that's not even the end of it each land god used to visit the sacred cave once a year but no longer without the rituals of renewal they've fallen apart like ray [Music] they're dying and my tribe with them so the cave is sacred because machines like ray and the one you call far go inside yes before the derangement each land god left the fields and made a pilgrimage to the cave always in the same order doe first then rey then me and so on spattered with soil from their laborers each reappeared two days later shining anew without so much as a scratch all soil and ornaments of worship washed away the tribe celebrated each return as one of the eight hollowed festivals of our calendar but the derangement changed the cycle yes or so we thought over time the land gods stopped the ritual becoming crazed and brittle [Music] but three weeks ago fought trudged inside the entire tribe lifted their voices in song praying that the cycle had begun again va has not emerged what has our machines built to kill are machines being made inside like in a cauldron sounds like it with the way these land gods come and go it's not like anything i've seen before you called yourself a grave singer what does that mean to all living things an end must come it is my task to ease the passage i try to bring comfort and sing of the renewal that death sews the way for but i [Music] never thought i would have to sing for one of our land gods [Music] i don't even know if ray hurt me what you did soothed her more than i ever could it's not your fault so without the second sight there's nothing more you could have done [Music] i need to get into their cave what no one does that well it's time to make an exception it belongs to the land gods buxom there is something inside there something that could solve problems all over the world storms the derangement maybe even your broken land gods what could possibly do all that a spirit yeah something like that i could journey back to plain song assemble the chorus tell how you soothed rey ask their permission to go inside great i'll get my thanks she needs rest you don't have to tell me i'm fine [Music] assembling the chorus will take time heal first then join me fine bed rest i got it she does not need you to help her heal you could come with me to plain some lend your voice to mine as i try to persuade the chorus it might help her cause i'd like to but i'm afraid she might run off really very well later then so wait it's not uh that i don't want to go with you it's just [Music] is that what you were trying to say um [Music] yes then i look forward to more conversation uh [Music] yeah me too you're supposed to be resting you should go with her i'll get better on my own you're trying to get rid of me so you can [Music] no no this time i'll meet up with you and playing song when i'm ready you sure about this yes go get out of here okay so wait [Music] [Music] who are they [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] okay all held up [Music] you
