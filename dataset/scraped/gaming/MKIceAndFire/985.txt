[Music] once upon a time in a deep and ancient forest there lived a pair of crafty goblins the crafty goblins did everything together until one day when darkness overwhelmed the big wooden house in which they lived [Music] blamed for the darkness brother goblin was forced to leave the forest while his sister had to stay behind ten years later they were finally reunited and together they decided to confront the darkness in the big wooden house [Music] though they sought the help of their friends in the forest they found that no one wanted to delve into the long gone past [Music] this is how the goblins found themselves alone in the woods trying to discover why darkness had submerged the big wooden house [Music] foreign [Music] tomorrow we should play compass and north star in the woods be sure to wear your hat then you be sure to wear your hat [Laughter] all right who wants ice cream eat up without a word she went out and buried the tiara in the ground beneath the sapling and as the final scoop of dirt fell the tiara felt truly gone and with it the final link to her old self she could only go forward and find a new place for herself in this world where she was no longer truly a princess and a tiara and a beautiful gown but a wand woman alone in a deep and ancient wood and that was how the princess lost her most precious treasure and her title i don't like that story there were no goblins and it was depressing we won't read it again i love you mom not me just kidding love you mom i love you too sleep well and dream my doves [Music] ollie ollie what a waste allison ollie

sandwiches i'm sorry sir we are all out of pickles today could i interest you in a ketchup only sandwich looks like there's still a bottle back here ew says the guy who used to eat peanut butter with ranch so good what to do with this maybe someone would be willing to refinish it i guess it's finally time to take these pictures down yeah still deciding what to do with them i mean most of them are pretty happy memories i guess you look cute here that's not me i mean it is but but you remember how i'd spend hours in front of the mirror just gathering all my hair behind my head sure dressed like this with the long hair it was like no one could really see me you know i was the invisible boy damn didn't think a picture could throw me like this anymore has therapy helped at all oh yeah definitely my therapist really heard me when i said i was a guy and she helped me get ready for the reactions i'd get you know it's dealing with other people that's been way harder than figuring myself out at the end of the day being able to look in the mirror and see tyler that's made the biggest difference which is why i'm scheduling my top surgery as soon as we sell this house no more putting a binder on every morning god that sounds [ __ ] amazing yeah totally just so you know i'll be there to help out when you do whatever you need thanks all right what's your verdict ronan you know what i'll keep a few to remind us how far we've come oh man i love this one why do i look so pissed i remember loving this maybe because marianne was sticking a camera in your face ugh gross stain is gross ugh what happened some unfortunate spillage that brought about the end of indoor tea parties i hid the stain with my toys forgetting that they would eventually be picked up brilliant move ronin well i seem to recall a time you stole an egg put it on the couch and sat on it because you wanted a pet chicken we don't talk about that uh-huh well at least i didn't leave a stain come on honey smile like alison hold up your fish it's not my fish anymore allison stole it [Music] my sister the fish thief you were just being bratty was i though yes all i did was help clean it when we were out on the porch eddie had to force you to share that's a nice face i wonder if my horse figurine is still in there you're what now you know my blue toy horse with the kind of melted face the one you stole from me what that never happened yeah it did i want it at that little halloween carnival they had at the school every year you grabbed it and hid it in the pot then when i tried to get it back you said there was a snake inside too whoa whoa whoa hold on i think i remember the snake part but you didn't win that horse i did and you were crying because you hadn't won anything so i gave it to you that makes no sense why would you hide it if you gave it to me because kids are kids steady now take your time he's not gonna jump up and do the cha-cha what about me i want to clean the fish too it's not even your fish you didn't catch anything ugh only because you wouldn't stop talking and scared all the fish away keep your eyes on what you're doing [Music] allison when we're done with

they're just leftovers from the restaurant what about volcano she needs to eat her lunch too oh quite right love she can have my corn here you go little one you must be hungry too tessa really did keep us all fed she always tried to take care of everyone still does i guess ooh i could turn this thing into a terrarium what's this doing down here is that gum uh i guess that was probably me the big frog is an effervescent creature who tries to be kind but is also a tireless gossip the ice king punished her once by telling her his deepest secret if she ever tells anyone she'll lose her voice forever allison i asked you to clean up the coffee table three times already oops i forgot and what do you know more stuff this ever stop feeling so weird so are you gonna come back down to help me or

be here soon is anyone hungry no i'm okay thank you god he scared me to death when you fell out of that tree i cried most of the way to tessa's house it was kind of exciting going to the hospital but the part after that with marianne that was less fun i remember the look that tessa gave her when she finally came home if looks could kill right yeah and marianne was a mess so long trusty bunk beds so hey did you finish packing upstairs nope there's way too much junk to sort through we don't really want to keep anything in here right what about that dresser if you want your towels to rot go for it maybe someone could clean it up it's well made your call keeping it thanks for clearing out those cabinets not my pleasure say ah i remember cutting off shaving cream beards with these oh yeah oh

owner's problem well you gonna clean off the coffee table now really it's gonna leave a stain on the wood all right i'll clean it up thanks while you do that i'll check out the furniture i'm guessing you want to keep the coffee table if there's anything you want speak now i'm not really planning on bringing furniture to denali and if i need a base in juneau you'll have all the furniture i need how very non-committal of you all right i'll keep it i really like that armchair maybe sit in it for a few minutes and see if you get used to the mold smell first on second thought never mind another one for the landfill and finally i hate to say it but the couches get a one-way ticket to the dump no protest here i think i have permanent knee damage from a decade of bumping into the corner of those damn things well then that's it for the living room you are relieved from your duties [Music] are you gonna keep doing that yes you are hey allison come take a break with me starting the fire again yeah i'm gonna boil some water you want something to drink you rather have instant coffee or instant coffee hmm nah sorry i'm more of a tea person get it t as in um how long have you been waiting to make that joke longer than i'm willing to admit i am so glad eddie came through on the caffeine shh did you hear that the ice king is sending us a warning for your punishment said the ice king you shall be banished from the forest and if you dare come back before the new moon you shall feel my anger in your gut hear it in the wind do you think the ice king would really react that way he may be intimidating but he's always fair and never mean oh yeah you're right maybe he tells the goblins to help the people they hurt instead great idea sweetie why don't we think about it at dinner i'll put everything away for safe keeping while you go wash your hands can you put them in the binder so they don't get stained i still think my dark and twisty version was better we put so many hours into that book yeah our binder was full of extra drawings and incomplete stories think they're all still in the kitchen drawer we should go take a look come check this out allison's first drafts right because i didn't contribute at all come on i know you did i can't believe she capped all these you'd think putting them on the fridge for a couple of weeks would have been enough you know how we thought of ourselves as the goblins did you ever get the sense that maybe marianne was the princess in the stories uh yeah she called her bedroom the princess's sanctum and she was all alone in the woods in this house until we showed up she was alone but with a few friends who helped her along the way what are you doing research so if marianne was the princess then who were all the rest and here we go oh come on humor me [Music] hmm pelican she was the most generous one yeah but there was always a catch [Music] poor moose really didn't do him justice hmm justice kind of ironic huh considering he was the lawful good one too bad the law isn't really just [Music] the bear was the most helpful one he was always around stalking her what no i mean he was kind of always there lurking [Music] you go here [Music] hmm this one this time i've got it we'll see how do you like them apples i mean yeah sure maybe what about these guys i don't see them being real-life people or this one the specific human attributes you have assigned to these forest animals are truly thought-provoking indubitably yep totally marianne why a princess though why not a queen she hated authority yeah she'd have been a terrible ruler you better hurry or the mad hunter will catch us we need to hide this way what's what's going on i i don't know is he here is he really here i'm scared yeah go back to the forest [Music] i forgot about that we've been pretending he was there and then suddenly he was that was the only time that happened right allison wait it felt way too real it was us pushing our imagination way too far great sam kanski grand master of bad timing we're not done with this conversation morning sam ahoy goblins i ran into chief brown who said you were starting to clean up on the house this morning so uh i kind of figured you might need some supplies that's thank you that was very thoughtful so listen i uh i wanted to apologize for scaring you yesterday you didn't your shotgun did yeah uh well yeah anyway i also came by to say i fired up the google and i uh did some reading i didn't know the difference between all those words i mean i you know never been much of a reader but i think

dry anyways let me find that dark key wait wait sam you have more of our keys yeah the one for the barns called a railroad key see it's got this special tip that you can fascinating i'll take that off your hands now well i uh figured i might still need to do some maintenance so uh nope we're good thank you fair warning the door's a bit temperamental haven't you been taking care of this place you didn't oil the doors what you think i just hang out here all day or something here son give me a try i've got okay when you twist it as far as you can to the left give it a nice little joke damn it no [ __ ] well at least the door is open now yeah uh well it's easy enough to fix now that fuse box oh no no no you and you are going to clean up your mess i'll take care of the fuse box but i didn't do it i'm not asking go on all right fuses go into plugs should be easy enough all right let's take a look look at what the whole jam needs to be replaced man just need to send that part down you could refinish the whole thing but that's a lot of work for an old door pass me that handle yeah sure thank you oh [ __ ] oh what happened you okay yeah it's just uh just a bum knee i uh wrecked it playing ball ball football in college high school best damn fullback around well until well i got hurt yeah that's right let's try this one brown must be the latch no [ __ ] it's covered in rust nothing a little salt and lime can't fix salt and lime it's a door latch not a bottle of cheap tequila sure could go for a margarita right about now a margarita really hey sometimes old sam likes to feel fancy here hold this i want to get a look at the spindle shouldn't we get this cleaned up before we put it back together i just want to check something hey uh you two got any uh bear insurance what for you and your gun are always around oh not always and you can't fend off a bear with smart ass remarks you know we're not getting a gun sam ah there's mold everywhere well don't stick your nose in there like it's a goddamn bouquet mildew is always a problem with these doors they're on the north side so no sunlight sounds like the builder really screwed that up huh hey now watch yourself we just need to clean it with turpentine right and borax probably ought to blow dry it too i usually air out the barn much as i can and oil in the spring linseed hell no that stuff's a hatchery for mold teak is what you want see that little silver bit it needs to be forced back onto the brass bit that's probably what was jamming in the first place probably so you got a good head for this stuff yeah well you're not the only person who used to fix stuff around here yep pretty much took an army to keep this place standing seems good [Music] you damn fool everything okay you uh you two look like you got this all in hand so um bye what was that about what are we gonna do with this wreck take it apart and sell the scrap it's been rotting in here for a decade i don't think there's anything salvageable i'll be the judge of that huh look at this i think this is where she made all our toys toilet paper tubes rope cardboard i wonder what she planned to make that maybe a car ooh or a tank she was so crafty and she could draw and write and take pictures she could have been an artist instead of just locking herself up out here preda rep what's that ew what do not spill it on your shoes i sense a story well if by story you mean using it at fireweed to get rid of some rats and then spilling it on my only pair of shoes then yes hey it was not funny sure thing b-boy hey there little buddy are you cooing at a spider it'd better be a tiny one don't listen to the mean lady you're an eight-legged beauty oh man i'm gonna put together the sweetest toolbox ever i wonder why sam got so upset oh he probably forgot he was all out of bourbon well something about it really got to him i don't think any of us are exactly happy to see that gun rack remind me to take it down later huh look at this housing i think this is where she made all our toys what did you find do you know who that is uh yeah that's carol eddie's mom i've seen other pictures of her but never this one man look at brown and marianne she looks really happy can i careful the glass is broken are you okay it stings let's go see mom but she'll get mad we weren't even supposed to be here [Music] come on it's gonna get infected [Music] i don't want to she said not to disturb her in any where are you going things were different when she was around we were family eddie how could you do this to me shhh look i had to make that call [Music] what were they talking about i can't figure out what's going on i don't know but i remember that whatever eddie had to do whatever that call was about it was tearing him up tearing him up he was being a total cop and marianne got pissed and threw him out here i'm gonna show you what i remember there by the house [Music] i had to make that call i was just following the law oh yeah and this little visit right here what would the law say about this huh look i didn't have to come out here but i did you're a goddamn hypocrite get out of here mary anne i said get out out what she didn't throw the picture at him you sure about that he was being a complete dick how can you be sure we were eavesdropping we could barely see a thing what do you think happened then [Music] look i had to make that call i was following procedure what i'm legally required to do then why are you here pretty sure this isn't procedure i wanted you to hear it from me please leave mary ann i'm sorry please just go how do we keep remembering the same thing so differently it was a long time ago and well memory is a tricky thing wait when did that happen i'm not sure i think it was the exact same day she attacked you that's what i thought but uncle eddie said he hadn't seen marianne for weeks yeah that was [ __ ] and what was all that about following the law what was he doing here exactly he must have had his reasons for not telling us look i know he took care of you but that doesn't make him incapable of lying i can't see him being that cold with mary ann even if he was being a cop i mean i can but who knows i guess memory is a tricky thing huh [Music] get out goddamn hypocrite get out of here [Music] you're a goddamn hypocrite get out of here get off my property right now [Music] so we agree brown came out here and bullied marianne the same day she attacked us and then lied about it now what we go and get a straight answer from him right now yes i'll go get my car keys but what would these mountains of trash do without us [ __ ] the trash man i can't believe brown lied i mean i may not be the guy's biggest fan but he's always talking about the truth and the law and [ __ ] do you have to be so happy about it what i know you've been waiting for something like this something that proves eddie's an [ __ ] but gloating about it is really not cool it's tina yeah just a sec i'm parking the car guess i'll just go stretch my legs then no just give me a second okay tina what's going on hi han i've got someone who is super interested in seeing the house oh that's amazing uh when they're just in the area for a couple of days so they'd like to come by day after tomorrow oh uh i'm not sure it'll be ready hon this guy is very motivated but i know he's looking at other properties it's not like you've had people breaking down the door i appreciate that but we've kind of got a lot going on over here did i mention it would be an all-cash offer it's it's not the right time a cash offer alison i'm sorry but it'll be a total mess i don't want to waste anyone's time okay well you tell me when you're ready huh well i think i just made tina's shitlist dee and i did that trail a couple years ago we drank ice cold beers when we reached the summit whose votes are you looking to win out here tom the bears looks like you found a nice spot we've been here before right so tina tina west our realtor oh that tina what'd she need she had someone who wanted to see the house but he could only come by day after tomorrow and you told her no yeah we need more time than that to get things cleaned up and you know thanks but what if it's the only call we get and i guess we just scrolled and lose our minds in that [ __ ] house sounds like a plan [Music] so before tina called we were talking yeah i'm not happy your foster father [ __ ] up oh yeah because you sure sounded like paid information about marianne i know you just don't have to rub it in i get it you're always gonna side with him over me come on that's not fair then why do you keep doing it this town these people they're just memories to you but it's my home tyler my friends my family and as much as i want answers i'd rather not lay waste in my entire life to get them i didn't come here to ruin your life alison i just want some answers i know that's why we're doing all this right uncle eddie warned me about this but i didn't listen oh yeah what did uncle eddie have to say [Music] just that we've led pretty different lives we might not really see eye to eye like we used to ah i see chief brown said you shouldn't trust me so you don't got it [Music] oh come on i didn't say that is that really what you think i don't know it's just that ever since i got back i felt like i was crashing your party well that's all in your head ty i'm not sure what else to say hey you feeling this you north star okay now you're the star and i'm the compass okay and don't cheat i know you were sending me fake hints last time i did not yes you did okay okay i won't do it again [Music] you were always accusing me of because you totally did it was a cool game guessing where you were just by feeling what you felt one else could play it with us that was the beauty of it for real you never wanted any other friends no not really i mean we had each other that was enough for me so not too disappointed i turned down our chance to be billionaires nah all that money would have made me soft and i've spent way too many years polishing my edgy side you were right to call me out earlier i was being a jerk about eddie i'm all for enjoying the wins as they come but maybe not at the expense of my father figure i'll try my best remember that time both the bridges collapsed yeah it was a week before they got the roads reopened and sam had to bring us supplies with his boat felt like our house was on a deserted island way colder hey look what i found aha i knew it was still here i knew we'd been here before we claimed it as part of the ronin kingdom and it still is all it needs is a little update what are you doing uh what i wanted to do back then but i didn't have the guts there looking better already you're right way better [Music] so what's the plan we go inside and calmly ask eddie why he was there that day all right let's try to let him get his side of the story out okay uh-huh oh yeah i understand mr barrel i'll be sure to let him know yes i have it all written down have a good day mr brown morning missy how do you get stuck working reception rose called in sick this morning i'm

and i've got the wildlife [Music] it opens up to a staircase on the side of the building but it'll definitely be locked from the inside if one of us were to create a diversion the other could slip upstairs and open the door and since you're the troublemaker i nominate you as the one to make a scene wait really got a better idea aren't cops like trained to notice suspicious behavior i'm not exactly an amazing actor figure out something simple and commit i have faith in you [Music] [Music] so guess i probably can't trip the circuit breaker but i could turn the lights off just go improvise oh oops tyler [Music] all right i'm in position what now turn right when you exit the station and follow the side of the building the staircase will be right there [Music] there's winter hair okay by

night here come on i said don't [ __ ] touch me go on and consider yourselves lucky your family you want to talk about family eddie i guess family calls social services when you're having a hard time huh and then breaks the law to gloat that you're gonna lose your [ __ ] kids it's your fault she lost it eddie you and tessa and everyone else in this goddamn town okay let's talk the winter before your mother's death was hard delos crossing was snowed in for months [Music] most roads were closed and plain supplies were scarce everyone was struggling especially marianne yeah she was always just scraping by that winter left nothing to scrape up even if locals had found time to help her um i'm not sure your mother would have accepted [Music] so she was struggling through the snowstorm of the century and you reported her to social services tessa came to me and reported potential child neglect as a sworn officer i am required by federal law to report the allegation to ocs a snake pretending to care to be her friend just to stab her in the back when she was down tessa helped out your family for years i'm convinced her concern was real course you would just following the law then right is that why you came over that day before she died you felt shitty didn't you that's why you broke procedure i had to warner that it was happening and that it wasn't looking good an assessment worker had been assigned and started doing background checks what else was i supposed to do i thought always telling each other the truth was our number one rule still is little moose and yet you still lied i didn't want you to putting yourselves through unnecessary hurt but you're adults and that was your choice to make um i'm truly sorry thank you uncle [Music] what it's [ __ ] he didn't forget to water your goddamn plants he lied you know what never mind eddie you keep trying to point your finger at tessa but you have to take responsibility for your part in our mother's death [Music] i've asked myself over and over for the past 10 years what i could have done different i know i made a big mistake with you two here and you've got every right to be angry being a father well it's a pretty tough job i've tried my best and i'd like to try my best with you too tyler if you want it i'm open to getting there but it's gonna take some time before we're a big happy family i respect that it's hard work rebuilding trust but you've got a place here whenever you need it [Music] group hug uh no absolutely not [Music] all right i'm really gonna have to kick you out now no rest for the wicket huh oh yeah i'm as wicked as it gets we'll see you both later [Music] well that went better than i was afraid it would you two on your way out yeah we've got stuff to do you ready allison yep let's roll on well don't be a stranger tyler sure see you around see you later allison what you feel like [ __ ] how can you tell because i feel like [ __ ] what are we gonna do about tessa nothing look we're not gonna do anything that's enough tyler talk to tessa why what are you looking for what are you expecting her to say i thought she loved us really chief brown is it true is she oh my god children i tessa tessa you need to leave come on kids everything is going to be all right okay you're going to be okay i promise go home you can't be here right now oh god oh god [Laughter] [Music] where is everybody tess has got to be around somewhere i think i'm hearing something well at least we know the entire world didn't vanish but given who is here we can't count out the rapture quite yet i need to take a breather i'm gonna do a bit of shopping you look for tessa okay on it take a leak just as i was finishing up though i see a big old bull moose staring me down so what do i do then i grab my odd six from the trunk and set my sights and you shot it yes sir wait you said you were near crystal this is closed up that way yeah hey man when the lord opens that kind of door you walk right through yeah that's not exactly illegal hmm i got a bull moose in my truck and a bolt tag in my pocket who's gonna know the difference doesn't make it right oh no i didn't realize i was talking to my damn boy scout oh man i haven't had this cereal in forever you two just can't stay away huh unfortunately we're looking for tessa again she took off about half an hour ago sorry is tom busy he's been in the office all morning so who knows but it's tom so it's probably safe to interrupt him do you know if tessa's gonna be back soon i don't know if she's even coming back no one tells me anything doing some shopping just looking for the woman who runs the place the shopkeeper's wife can't say i've seen her around i i heard you were shooting moose outside your permit area not really any of your business now is it come on i'm not gonna report you but it's a shitty thing to do i think it's time to finish up your shopping and move on brother yeah i'll do that i thought you were working at the diner today no i switched just because i wanted to get some sleep but it turns out i was also scheduled to work at the store today michael michael how do you always end up double booked because i'm too much of a badass to read a schedule you're gonna work yourself to death you know yeah well i can't really turn the money down a security deposit is gonna be a [ __ ] i have no idea how i'm gonna get my half together selling blood's a thing right you worried about the house a little and i had to turn down an appointment with the only interested buyer we've gotten well girl you're lucky i'm picking up the extra shifts then come in what do you mean we've got enough signatures it should have at least been enough to stall construction while we figure out our next move well why don't we schedule a meeting with the alaska wildlife foundation try to get their support look harold i have to go we can pick this up at the meeting i should be on my way over soon hey i hope this isn't a bad time but is tessa around today she had to step out for a family matter this wouldn't be something i could help with would it yeah maybe actually uh we were over at the police station and we took a look at marianne's case file okay tessa reported marianne to social services did you know vaguely but i didn't get involved i i didn't think i really had anything to add you never thought to mention it well now i'm not sure how a thing like that would have come up and i didn't want to rub salt in any wounds huh how about when we were in the store yesterday asking about it point blank that was between you and tessa i try to stay out of other people's affairs why did tessa come to the police station that night she was looking for you too to make sure you were okay when she heard what happened she was a mess how exactly did she hear about it so fast can't remember who called but you know how it is no news travels faster than a secret everyone knew five minutes after brown was on his way out okay thank you look i'm sorry if you felt resistance from people around here to put it mildly alison you know this better than anybody but your mother's death left a scar on this community now i won't claim we went through anything close to what you did but it was a cruel reminder of the limits of trust well if we want to get past the limits of trust we all need to face what happened which means being completely honest about it we all want to find peace kids it's just harder for some people to talk about the past now you let me know if you have any other questions okay hey yes you said i should remind you not to be late for your meeting so don't be late ah yep yep i'll be on my way in a minute uh so kids was there uh anything else you two wanted to talk to me about did you ever hear any rumors about our mother like who our father might have been um not exactly a rumor monger your mother was close to a few men but whether they were your father i couldn't say but look i oh gosh uh i'm sorry i really have to go uh michael could you finish up the storage room and then just close up yes your thing boss man see you later you two want to help a brother out spend the afternoon here working for free why not we came here to talk to tessa and she's not here uh she she's at the cemetery uh visiting her parents oh hey tell you what why don't you guys help me close the store and then we can drive over together i've been meaning to pay my uncle a visit can't we just wait for her to come back here i i'm not really excited about going there allison we don't have to visit her grave i'm gonna start working in the storage room tyler join me when you're done sure thing just give me a sec where'd that question about our father come from i've just been thinking about who he might be and if he knows anything that could help us figure this [ __ ] out why he wasn't a part of our lives besides marianne always said we never had a father well her name might have been mary but i don't think she was a likely candidate for immaculate conception right i already counted there but i just need you to double check a few things it's not complicated i've got this in the back oh yeah these are just that good huh i'm clowning i don't even know where to begin what do i do yeah let's start with an easy one all right go to the back of the room and uh tell me how many cans of molto bene brand tomato sauce we have left aye [Music] why are you laughing i i was just remembering the time allison and i opened up a bag of flour and threw it at each other's faces we called it a summer snow fight we made a gigantic mess marianne was pissed i wonder what's in that box you know when you think about it glass is really just tortured sand have you been huh the spray paint tyler [Music] i wonder what's in that box hold on let me count this uh i'm seeing 16 cans of tomato sauce that many you sure you only counted the tomato cans ah [ __ ] i got cocky it's actually 14. look i'll let that one slide just because it's you let's say you do on the next one i need you to count the bottles of bleach for me and where are they at exactly i thought you add this in the bag okay i'll give you a hint tessa puts the heavy stuff near the door on the bottom shelves all right i think i can work with that i don't need any of this [Music] six all right not bad tyler not bad careful they might give me your job oh you can have it uh what's next come here and help me with this what's up i need your opinion on this masterpiece is that supposed to be me yeah come on look at the hair nailed it right the proportions are way off i wish my arms were that big uh self-deprecating much your arms look good to me thanks i've been trying to hit the gym more but weightlifting is the worst uh amen you should give dancing a try let's work out there is and well there's always someone out there who needs a partner so this is what you're up to always out there doing your work what can i say i'm a multitasker hey multitasker i think you made a mistake here total amount should be 36. oh how dare you sir what i just don't want you to get in trouble yeah you're right you know i'm off my game today all right anything else you wanted me to check yep one last thing and then we should be free from this purgatory hit me can you count how many plushies we have in that box over there that box over there uh are you gonna make me beg for specifics tempting but no see that bible study poster on the wall over there that's where you should be looking ah you're too kind is that a picture of a priest with little hearts yeah that's the hot priest who hosts bible study with tessa and for the record that was allison's doing she had a crush on him for ages but he is very very hot [ __ ] yeah i remember him from when we were kids that's father batista yeah he's got that silver fox thing going on now see yeah yep i see it is that the mangy muskrat the mangy muskrat is a lazy cowardly creature who spends most of his time lying around in the sun cleaning his coat so uh you've got about 11 left in that box did i get it wrong michael ah hey sorry it was just too tempting lesson number one in the ancient art of inventory never let your guard down you have no idea what you just started first one with three confirmed hits wins [Music] cool [Music] damn overshot it oh come on is that all you got ronan just you wait i've got a strategy oh yeah we'll see boom [Music] so is this a typical workday for you nah i usually don't have such a good looking company back here [Music] i'm gonna tell allison you said that she's usually stuck in the office besides your sister while a hottie isn't my type [Music] damn overshot it [Music] hey is it cool that we're throwing these toys around aren't you guys gonna like sell them nah supplier made a typo one becky can't sell any of them cool no harm no foul then boom one more hit and you're out prepare to feel my wrath oh god you're corny [Music] yo we better wrap this up soon [Music] is that all you got [Music] boom oh man you're good i told you not to doubt the golden arm well i'll never make that mistake again okay i need to finish this inventory thing real quick your sister's probably done already here let's hit the bitch's grotto the what fancy name for the couch where allison and i sit during breaks ah all right cool let me see what you've done with the place oh you see that container that's for you huh it's the trout i caught yesterday at the buzzard hole grilled it up with my world-renowned marinade oh wow uh thank you world-renowned marinade huh what's in it a magician never reveals his secrets i'm surprised tessa let you hang this up yeah she hates it but as long as i don't promote my lifestyle in front of the customers she doesn't say anything man must be exhausting to spend your days educating these people here's the thing i don't opening the minds of this town will be a full-time [ __ ] job and emotional labor pays [ __ ] hey i hope this isn't too personal wait you ever been with anyone in dallas crossing i dated a guy in high school for a minute but we had to keep it quiet i've been with a few other people but that shit's tricky out here and what about you you ever been with a guy i mean assuming you're into guys which i guess i kind of did i'm still figuring my [ __ ] out i'm not sure if i've made to be with anyone you know yeah of course and don't ever feel like you have to rush into anything yeah i don't but thank you do you ever get lonely in delos crossing yeah sometimes so i'm always in juno working with the jce meeting new people i gotta make my [ __ ] happen for me because no one else will right i feel you anyway and i'm done i got to tell you it's so weird to finally meet the other ronin you mean the og ronin i was born first you know is that so that allison said she was well our mother never actually told us but it was me so why is it so weird to meet me because i just heard allison tell your story so many times she told me everything about you fireweed your transition i hope that's okay by the way yeah it's fine she asked me first yeah figures that lady is thorough and she loves you like crazy i know so yeah you were probably the first person to know about it other than allison i'm glad you trusted me and it's great to finally get to know you in the flesh you're pretty all right [Music] you're not too bad yourself i try not to be especially around guys i'm trying to impress so i wasn't blowing smoke when i said you should move to juno with us i know i i've got a community there it could be yours too fitting in there's a concept you have no idea how life-saving a chosen family can be they pulled me out of the dark more times than i can count i hear you hey can i ask you a question of course shoot why do you care so much if i move to juno look like i said i i want to get to know you because i'm just that fascinating huh [Music] honestly yeah you might be one of a kind tyler ronan uh thank you for that but i think you might be looking for something i'm not right now oh [ __ ] did i make this awkward no no you didn't don't worry i'm just all over the place right now of course yeah i get it sorry about that it's really fun i i appreciate the compliment though oh hey i've been standing at that counter for an hour waiting for you two dum-dums to come back are you guys ready to go i think we've done about as much damage as we can back here yeah let's go here we are thanks for letting me hit you right over no problem you sure we can't drive you back nah you like stretching my legs it isn't far but anyway can't put the wind in a bottle all right tessa should be at her parents grave not far from the entrance look for a big crooked tree you can't miss it i'm gonna go check in with my uncle good luck for real you look pretty spooked i've never been a big fan of cemeteries especially after you know i promise after this we can chill at the house cool so did you ever come back keep it down better much why do people always feel like they have to whisper in cemeteries i don't know probably just a mirror neuron thing oh what okay monkey do yeah anyway have you been back here at all since the funeral no i've never had a reason to thankfully [Music] mom why do we always come here does it bother you no it's just weird because we don't know any of these people i mean except eddie's mom it never hurts to say hello because they're very lonely that's right sweetie and sometimes even if you can't see them they stay with you in here always here mom always she loved us a lot but sometimes it was like loving us hurt her do you think she was just really scared of losing us maybe yeah but i don't know i mean most parents are scared of losing their kids well here's the crooked tree but no tessa let's check around for her parents grave just to make sure this is the right spot you think it's possible michael remembered it ron well i've done inventory with him before so yes wait is this the one we called the big crookedy the exact one why didn't we call it gnarls branch total missed opportunity because we weren't hip to basketball back then or ceelo green yeah i remember it going all the way to the clouds everything does when you're four feet tall guess again de leon that's the one don't tell me we missed her [Music] hello mr eagle kids it's time you really have to go eddie you can hold my hand if you want i can walk fine on my own it'll be quick okay then we'll get something to eat the day the funeral i barely remember that's probably for the best i don't think either of us are exactly eager to relive what went on behind that gate so i know i said we didn't have to visit her grave but it feels like the right thing to do yeah exactly do you remember where she is no i mean for what it's worth i remember staring at the water during the funeral allison please i'm not going allison come back well yeah and he hoped that this would be easier than last time totally gone at least this time no one's sending me away i'm holding you to that afterwards you and i had a moment over there by the totem right i wonder if we could see that doesn't hurt to check yeah that's where i went when i ran off [Music] i won't let them take you away i'm gonna tell them the truth you swore alison i'm gonna be okay please don't worry about me i know i'm supposed to get over this brown thing but i really wish you'd been able to come visit that much yeah me too but look i didn't make any promises that day you did watch they all think you killed her it's not fair i'll be okay you have to take care of yourself now see it's possible but i don't think so well i know so thinking about it got me through the rest of the day but i'm gonna come see you every week and we'll talk with our i'll be back soon all right promise we'll be okay you'll see kids about to start i'm sorry it took me so long to come back i got so caught up in everything that you really don't have to explain i understand what you are going through now are you ever gonna let me finish my sentences maybe someday but not today you think snowball still lives in there snowy owls only tend to live about 10 years oh rest in peace snowball ty this is it yeah god i think i need a second i'm gonna have a look around okay i'll be right back yeah all good i still haven't found it sorry all i remember is a bird jumping around on a stump during the funeral no dice not hers where is she [Music] allison is that her what the hell was going on with you what broke why didn't you say anything who were your goblins you didn't have to do it all alone [Music] tessa kids i [Music] i i wasn't expecting to see what are you what are you doing here what are you doing here feeling a little guilty maybe [Music] when we pass on our graves are all anyone has to remember us by letting hers just fall apart would be cruel i'm not a cruel person cruel enough to call social services on her mother i i wanted to protect you marianne was getting worse all the time i was afraid that if things kept going the way they were then one day we were going to end up dead look i'm sorry i didn't tell you the whole story back in the store but i didn't want you to enough with the excuses what the hell happened to her why'd you turn your back on us your mom was always just barely getting by and over the years she burned a lot of goodwill it got so bad no one was willing to hire her and the stress of that well it took its toll i tried to help but she pushed me away she pushed us all away in the end she isolated herself from everyone she was alone and out of options she had us until you threatened to have us taken away i couldn't let her drag you down with her she had you stealing for god's sake your mother never wanted to be a part of this community she always thought she was better than the rest of us a spoiled little girl playing fairy princess in the woods if she just settled down with someone instead of running around with married manuel just ask sam kansky how much better that would have been for everyone wait what oh god what happened between them i i wasn't thinking please just forget i said anything tessa all i know is whatever went on laura left sam over it but i shouldn't have said anything about that i promised i wouldn't i'm sorry kids typical running away when things get tough i don't buy that mary ann pushed you away you turned your back on her and now you're making excuses like always you destroyed our family you don't even have the decency to admit it i know i've made mistakes all i can do now is say that i'm sorry if i could give you back your mother i would i don't deserve your forgiveness especially yours tyler but if there's a place for me in your lives i'd like to be there i have to know something first are you good with who i am you went through a very challenging time and anyone could come out on the other side confused there's help available out there if you'll take it keep your help so that's it then we're done because i believe something different than you no it's because you don't believe in me i see then i guess there's nothing more to say you two really are her children hey i know that was hard but you did the right thing come on that was something huh yeah it was well if you feel like saying i told you so now is the time everyone in our lives back then none of them really gave a [ __ ] about us sorry i i didn't mean it's okay i mean we had to force the truth out of eddie too but at least he took care of us i get now why you're so pumped to go to juno you know a part of me really thought i'd come here and everything would be exactly the same tyler not a bad view right yeah i get now why they put cemeteries in nice spots takes a little bit of this thing off listen i know this has been hard i'm really grateful you saw it through with me fireweed was great but there was no one really there for me like that you know you're the only one hey brothers and sisters right but it's been way more brothers than sisters lately which is why i'm trying to say thank you you really don't have to you saved my life allison only for you to end up locked up in fireweed for the rest of your childhood wait are you still blaming yourself for that don't it was my choice it's just i stole your life tyler and then i totally wasted it that's not true you're on your way to denali michael's gonna be a famous chef and and what am i doing nothing you were just dealing with what happened the way that you needed to alright as soon as we figure this [ __ ] out we're gonna sell the house and you're gonna go to juno you're gonna kick ass you make it sound so easy no we never had a shot at easy but we always pull through right yeah you're right hey wherever ranger tyler ends up next he better come down from the hills to visit us city folk every now and then here for sure anyway it's not gonna be for a while we've got time oh yeah of course [Music] we do so i guess we know the story now huh marianne was done with delos delos was done with her maybe she was too proud but she worked so hard for so long and when she reached the end of her rope no one was there to help her not even tessa ready when she heard social services was coming she she gave up but killed her kids really i don't know it still feels like there's something missing right [Music] you're never gonna understand what was going through her mind i bet even she didn't [Music] it's probably always gonna feel that way [Music] oh i'm gonna fall asleep the second i hit the couch you better rally we still have to do some cleaning before bed do we have to hey whoever packs the most gets the big couch tonight [ __ ] alison i'll get the fire extinguisher tyler tyler are you all right ah allison barne stay there i got it what happened there there was a guy he smashed me in the face with the door what guy what did he look like i'm not sure i couldn't see straight and he was all in black god why would someone try to burn down our barn i don't know but i'm going to find out so did eddie teach you how to put out a fire nope i taught myself did he really have to smash everything i might have found something he went looking under the rug this gas can was already here this morning he didn't bring it with him is that a box under the barn yeah what the hell i think this is where the fire started so he was trying to burn whatever's inside we should check it out i'm gonna need to remove a few more planks to get to it hmm where could we possibly find a tool to do that these planks look newer than the rest that corner used to be all dirt for chickens she was always saying how she was gonna make this place a real homestead little house on the tundra god he really turned this place upside down at least you were spared [Music] the moon hag is an old and powerful witch she lures her innocent victims deep beneath the ice and traps them there forever [ __ ] even dumped the drawers i guess we know how he made the hole let's step back i'll be fine well i only know one person who'd bother to decorate a storage box like this marianne let's open it what's that there some kind of carving not sure what it is though three digits any ideas um marianne was never really a numbers kind of person i think we just need to break the lock there must be something in here we can use to get it open preferably without destroying the box hey doesn't that carving look like the secret keeper from the book of goblins that's it look it's the same symbol the secret keeper well let's see if we can find any numbers that did it [ __ ] that's rough this this guy tried to push marianne to get an abortion even though she wanted to keep us guessing she didn't know how much of an ass he'd turn out to be that's everything what the hell so mary ann hid a box under the barn box full of letters from our deadbeat dad he turned the whole place upside down and didn't take anything all he wanted was that box and he was willing to burn down the barn to get rid of what was inside you know what it all means right yep that guy had an affair with marianne and he just tried to torch the evidence he must have heard we were clearing out the house he was worried we'd find it you know i i can't shake the feeling i've seen him here before [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] i don't know about you but i haven't forgotten anything about that night i would have said the same thing but something felt different i need to see the rest but you know what happens down there that's the thing i'm not sure i do all right let's go some kind of work boot maybe fishing boots this is where i tripped the mad hunter [Music] wait there was someone here that night in the woods no it was just ice i saw who the hell did i actually see damn he ran straight for it no stops no turns he was on a mission is there someone over there mad hunter what no that that was the mad hunter what what are you talking about that night i thought i saw the mad hunter in the woods but i guess it was just some [ __ ] some [ __ ] who just [ __ ] stood there and watched while our mother chased me with a shotgun do you think it was the same guy maybe i mean it had to be him right they were wearing the same fishing gear yeah unless everyone who wants to mess with us is coordinating outfits and wait he was here once before wasn't he a few days before marianne died maybe hold on do you feel that trail ends here it looks like he jumped into the gully hey are there footsteps on the other side yeah that must be where he climbed out well he's long gone tyler not there our mother fought with someone on the dock about us we need to know if it was the same guy but what if it's not that memory what if it's i can't go through that again we have to take that chance but do we really i mean someone just tried to burn our barn down yeah and that means we've got to be close to something i'm not going on that dock [Music] after what i did for you you're really gonna say no to this no but i just can't keep doing this every time we think we understand something new pops up this might be our only shot to figure out who our father is who gives a [ __ ] about that [ __ ] i have a father and i almost lost him because you won't stop don't blame me because chief brown [ __ ] mary anne over we need to know the truth what if i don't want to know the truth huh did you ever consider that no you just push and push and you have to take responsibility for your part in marianne's death [Music] what how can you say that to me i didn't but i i did right earlier to eddie but i swear i didn't just say that to you so we can't even trust our own voices now god i don't know allison [Music] i'll do it let's go you can do it [Music] [Applause] ouch watch it you're stepping on my foot can you hear what
