[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] disengaging initiating artillery thrusters man we are twenty seconds atmosphere breach [Music] signal [Music] has landed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] almost looks like home that's worries me well boss you're ready got my truck i want snipers at three and six multiple defense lines and an operating base established within the hour move goodman a word you know the stakes of this mission flores is already half dismantled our engine's on its way down to power a city of half a million now if these outrider bozos had paid it you report to me first sir i'm only here to answer proper procedures we're not on earth shira there is no proper procedure listen up outriders i know what you're all thinking there's no going home and no one has a clue what's waiting for us out there but the eca pencil heads can't greenlight this land until we find their missing probes so let's do our job hq our systems are all functioning [Music] i'm gonna scout ahead on foot need to stretch my damn legs i'll take point don't need to see it get eaten on day one relax outrider you don't owe me anything i wouldn't be here without you i'd be buried in the ashes back home all right let's move out stay sharp watch our sixes will you smell that air i can't even process breathing air that doesn't smell like a burnt carburetor i didn't want the air back on earth it's houston trust me you'll get used to fresh air too truth is none of us should have even gotten that first survivor's guilt you think any one of us isn't feeling it it's not just that if the keral's engine hadn't exploded back on earth and killed most of the real outriders with it there would be a bunch of mercenaries down here in their place i hired you because you don't let anything get in your way we'll make camp here outrider set a beacon flag let hq know the area's secure all right people we got jobs to do cuthbert skarstead set up a perimeter i want fortifications going up within the hour jacob you're field testing the munitions goodman get your scanner up and running so we can find those damn probes hey no matter what happens out here i need my best gun on this in case things go south can i depend on you just tell me what to do get our weapons haven't been fired in nearly a century why don't you head over to yakov and get your gear checked and then be prepared to move out as soon as those probes are located any questions no word from earth i assume it's really gone she went dark 15 years into our journey more or less as predicted aca's confirmed no communication since [ __ ] you know i uh grew up a slumdog fighting for scraps lost everyone really long before the end doomsday just wasn't a thing i worried about hell i was never going to live past 20 anyway somehow i was one of the ones who made it don't even know what i'm supposed to be doing here [Music] these things go right time's coming you're gonna have to leave all that behind this is a new beginning you could have a family here build a cabin roll and get fat that's not me know my way around bullets not [Music] but you're one of the chosen few you get to build the future don't waste it did any more of your people make it off earth cap my brother almost but no they got him in cryo as we evacuated l.a hoping we could stop the bleeding ah he was too far gone ah [ __ ] sorry to hear that i haven't had the time to think about it what about sarah she's good right yeah my sarah's up there they don't wake her group for another six months but i can wait i'm uh i didn't have a chance to tell you this and all the madness but my little girl's pregnant that's how i got her the seat two for one special huh that's why i've been in such a good mood since they unfroze your ass don't push it out right yes sir granddad sir i'll go find jakob's shooting range good we're on standby for those probes so stay on alert yes maybe i'm overthinking this but if something goes wrong if [ __ ] hits the fan people are gonna start pointing fingers so we make sure they don't point at the outriders once we find those probes the landing can go ahead from there on the buck stops with the eca there's still a whole lot that can go wrong before then what's on your mind boss i know that look you get that last day got really hairy i wasn't sure if any of us were going to make it we cut it pretty close you can't stop thinking about it either i know it's insane that was 80 years ago yeah it feels like days my knuckles are still sore my ears still ringing from all the gunfire i mean there was thousands of them all climbing over each other slaughtering everyone in their way tried to pull down the launch tower to bash in the doors of her shuttles i've been in a lot of war zones but that was [ __ ] anarchy look it was either us getting off the planet with them we just did what we had to do we do what we have to do we look out for each other hell we better other than the cap and cuthbert you're the only person left alive i know i'm the only person left alive worth knowing i'm glad you made it on board what do you make of this place jacob it's perfect beautiful how long you want to bet before we bury it all under concrete and plastic oh come on you can't still be that cynical just look at this valley i don't know maybe we all just got too much riding on this we already have one dead planet in the rear view if we screw this one up do it maybe we won't sure maybe this is really it maybe we can finally stop sleeping with our guns under our pillow stop worrying about food every goddamn day believe me boss i want this to work you have no idea mods people don't change still got your money on black the house always wins time to test my gear up for some target practice bush let's get started fancy stuff yeah a new toy you're the first one to test it out boss uh i think you could take on a sink i ever imagine how glad i have to be on your side now give that sidearm a try eh nice haven't lost your touch all right you can stop showing off feels pretty good doesn't it yep still got it outrider check on our eca rep see if shear is found in your probes yet hey did you see a transcript got leaked of the speech maxwell's preparing some half-assed praise for the outriders and then a lot of talk about how we need to assimilate with the general population what we're supposed to do after this landing's [Music] oh my gosh this is stunning i wish you could have seen this there hey you're shira right i'm sorry can you believe this landscape it's so beautiful now if only we had an internet to post those to scientific record besides we'll have the internet up and running in the first six months the entire thing was backed up i'm just pulling your legs shira any luck with the probe the scan's still running i don't know what else i can do it's just how can the probe signals have simply vanished yeah they said it was some kind of interference or something not from space maybe but not from down here still seems initial reading to the right of breathing yes but before the eca can authorize half a million more people coming here we need the probes data to know we can support them and if we can't let's see see his plan b do you have any questions i got answers to how's this colonization gonna work you're in the planning rooms right yes we've already started disassembling the engine we need to bring that down first the nuclear core should give us enough power to get the colony up and running and when do the civilian pods start coming down within a few weeks if all goes well first just enough people and resources to get our infrastructure running you know water food and shelter then we'll keep working folks from cryo a few thousand at a time no more than we can feed until before you know it you'll be standing in the middle of a city meanwhile the florist stays up there the ship was built in orbit it was never meant to land we'll have to keep it in our skies until we're capable of space flight again one day maybe all right tell me the truth you think the eca's thought this whole plan through well my father was part of the team that designed the plan my entire life he helped prepare for this day the greatest undertaking of human history oh so that's how you got on the ship huh daddy smoothed your way no i studied engineering spent years in orbit designed structure drilling rivets into the hole i helped build that ship so you earned your way on good for you it was my father does not like the way you thought he gave up his place for me he stayed behind [ __ ] i'm uh sorry you would have been in all of this place but in the end it's just me it's strange not knowing anyone here when this is over come hang out with us we're not such a bad bunch i might take you up on that hey is that supposed to blink that way oh oh oh that's a probe tanner i think you got a signal it's close excellent workout rider now go locate the damn thing so we can land this beauty copy that hey it's an historic moment we should document it for the scientific record um rewarding heads up i got movement nine o'clock something big oh you're the steelers guard the perimeter hold your fire until we know what we're dealing with oh i got eyes on some kind of hyena cow things yeah i'm seeing you ask they're me i bet it can be domesticated performing i bet they make some fat juicy steaks uh one of those cow things is sunning itself right on my path hey maybe he can get close enough to get a dna sample not exactly our priority but if i can get close without spooking it i'll try ah scared it off but i've secured the objective fantastic got some kind of storm brewing yeah valve a probe looks like it landed pretty hard but the data seems intact copy that transmitting to hq now good work outrider hold on picking up the second signal but something's weird about this one weird the [ __ ] is rising and falling it's supposed to be a steady tone outrider alpha the hq hold off on calling in that green light we got another probe out here to analyze negative alpha your job is done maxwell listen to me we can't afford to make mistakes give us time any more time and we lose our orbital window with the data i'm calling it in you want to keep searching don't blame me if you find trouble over and out all right now riders rendezvous back with a convoy let's go find that straight hey guthner any updates the probe signal is mostly noise but i've tracked its source there hope you all brought your galoshes jacob same [ __ ] different planet [Music] [Music] piece of [ __ ] electronics are freezing up trucks are down we continue on foot soldier your primary focus is here understand we keep moving eyes up [Music] choke on your own spit dude it's nothing i'm good [Music] back to the ship elect the medics stay back tanner got eyes on the probe i got movement heading in dca hq we've encountered a potential biological hazard requesting quarantine procedure at base damn it tanner i told you both to go mess up this operation it's my name on the line where this landing and you have no authority over me maxwell [ __ ] unit 2 stay at your position we are heading your way prepare the bed tent in case we need to hey boss we lost you getting her straight probe no skarstead he looks like [ __ ] any idea what this black gunk is some kind of sacrifices play captain got attacked by one of those cow things something drove it crazy i had to put it down keep an eye out copy that out ryder now move your ass and find that probe tender i found it good work get the drive to get the hell out wait hold on this thing's just in relay mode tanner the signal isn't coming from the probe it's coming from outside our search zone somewhere else on the planet that's impossible there is nobody else secure the hard drive we'll analyze that signal back at base copy oh damn it something's frying it tanner give us the frequency uh carrier frequency is nine seven point tanner do copy tanner tanner i'm seeing some really strange [ __ ] down here what the [ __ ] everyone storm is this yes just run hmm come on [Music] oh [Music] um get on got heavy casualties possible contamination i think foreign maxwell what the [ __ ] is all this what does it look like sergeant major sir we have to follow quarantine procedure and hold the landing whatever the original reports about this planet they were wrong there's some kind of anomaly if we land now everyone will die there's no holding the landing it's too late for that there's nowhere else to go we need medics feed to them hurry no stop they're contaminated we contain them that's an order you always were an [ __ ] look around you we got men and women that needed medical attention now get your asses in gear and do the right thing i'm gonna have to no contain this now burn the [ __ ] bodies i'm going after maxwell i gotcha all right sure right after you call up your goddamn goons major the entire colonization is present [Music] push [Music] [Music] maxwell set up a block game he's gonna burn everything down so to tell the story his way how the outriders [ __ ] everything up kill the traitors don't let them near do the right thing pull it in postpone the [ __ ] landing [Music] hey you can you help me with the wounded we have to get them to matlab over here come on move your asses [Music] they're almost what are you doing i'm putting you back into cryo until mad lab can save your [ __ ] life don't be ridiculous i'm done for pep talks aren't really my thing [Music] when is something truly over was it when your people left earth behind was it when you watched the first spaceship crash and burn was it when you saw your fellow outriders crumble at your feet was it watching yourself die but enoch isn't done with you yet outrider like i always say it ain't over till it's over you what year are you from here what year what is this your pod where were the uplink notes come on doc we need to go they're coming wait we can't just leave them here these are outright they're not why we're here i'm sorry [Music] come uncuff me and find out the anomaly is coming let's see how fast you can run the romance land like the others when we get to no man's land we gotta stick together if we want to survive survive what getting our asses fried by the big storm hey i told you to shut the hell up we're here come on come back go back what the hell is happening here it's got an altar to carry our guys apart you need to get out of here you think the elders care about a storm [ __ ] [ __ ] take the back way through the frame and we're not gonna make it let's just talk about here and probably captain of the show are you out of your gun your man was how long how long has it been what this this war how [ __ ] long who knows that before i was born that's [ __ ] impossible come on open the goddamn gate and move poke tight almost there almost where where are you taking us i'm not supposed the hell is the matter with you you just wake up with something oh i just well let me get you up real quick that paradise you outriders promised us guess what we've got instead goddamn indian storms no shelter no food just kick to the curb like exiles while your eca pals got fat in their bunker oh [ __ ] it wasn't like that we lost electronics we could have left you all to rot in your cryopods how many times did i tell you to shut up it's over welcome to the valley of death [ __ ] you people are insane all this is time to walk no man's land [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me [Music] [ __ ] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] i just gotta get across this hell hole the [ __ ] happening i don't belong on this side wonder oh [ __ ] who the hell are you people guess it shoot first questions later [Music] oh [Music] [ __ ] are they running for me all right i could get used to this oh so so so this these flares this storm i've seen this before the forest when we landed this can't be real [Music] [Music] [Music] altered i could smell the storm in your blood your stink of enoch your kinder abominations exile who the hell are you out rider impossible such untapped power such confusion you want answers whatever you were before you're something new now a second life don't waste it who was that lord seth he's he's altered i think he's a little man a little man altered what the [ __ ] does that mean you you don't know what you are where'd you steal that uniform didn't it's mine yeah if he's really an outrider the new fight's on the wrong side altered what are you talking about yeah the grand marshal she'll explain come where is she there what is that go go go do whatever you have to do lieutenant shira you're alive i'm sorry to disappoint you you came from their side you got any intel for us are you [ __ ] kidding me look i got a war to win so either you help me or you get back into cryo hold on i'm just woking up the mud and [ __ ] i've been asleep for god knows how many years 31 years so for 31 years i've been seeing people fight and die while you were getting comfy and crying so excuse me for not throwing you a little welcome party what happened to you the anomaly that's what happened you mean that storm we told them not to land anything more advanced than a grease engine that fried all our data wiped out we couldn't grow crops or make medicine so we ended up in the same place as when we left earth just killing each other over the little we have left why didn't you go somewhere else the outriders could have the outriders are dead what and the anomaly keeps us in this [ __ ] valley we can't go anywhere else you don't get it do you you think you're dreaming this is real believe me it's [ __ ] real so whether you like it or not you're stuck here in the mud and [ __ ] like the rest of us you should have never woken up i didn't miss out on all this we were too late well get him back well it may be our side but that's not our turf ma'am i'm not losing people over yaku yaku he's still alive not too much longer it seems then i'll go find them ma'am never mind i've got it covered so jacob's in trouble and i need to go save his ass at least some things never change um hey shira i'm geared up and tracking down yakub now who the hell are these [ __ ] there are thugs drug runners and child slavers they call themselves the hounds and believe me no one's gonna miss them if you put a few dozen body bags why the hell haven't you done something about them already honestly because their black market keeps our soldiers happy and at least they're not eating their own [ __ ] kids like the insurgents we're fighting out there yeah i met a few of them not so friendly ain't nothing free altered [Music] he cheated he cheated hey can you hook me up come on i'm sweating here i'll even share it with you oh my beard one wouldn't have any powder to share starting to get shakes it ain't fair move along nothing to see here so what did the old guy do pissed off the boss big time those guys close to the grand marshal too which is why the boss promised us double the pain still gonna be a big risk need to get it over we'll rough them up just a little bit more [Music] i'm looking for jakob dabrovsky go away listen [ __ ] you got a gun pointed right at you [Music] what the hell is going on out there so you're on my way now where's jacob [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] nice eyes hey whoa oh sorry guys i thought this was the bathroom you okay i had it under control been a while no i know you then i thought you were dead you'll soon be dead if you don't get your ass to shears right now all right come meet me there when you're ready shira i got yak about in one piece he's on his way to you that old trunk just refuses to die well you should come join us we have some catching up to do [Music] hit me apart oh after we capture the bunker we need to prepare for a counter offensive even assuming minimal taxes no because he won't because he can do what the [ __ ] he wants hey never been so happy to see a familiar face you have an age today you got old my friend the hallway that was seth what was he doing here ignoring our pleas for help i thought it was on your side yes he's not on anyone's side the insurgents have altered their walking nightmares where lucky seth shows up to fight them back sometimes but only if it fits whatever the hell game he's playing hey dammit you have no idea how bad it is outrider we thought we escaped the apocalypse we thought we could start over again here but we were wrong i was wrong do you know why i'm in charge because i'm the only officer left alive the insurgents at our door they're feral sadistic they have us around it we're low on food and bullets and if those freaks don't kill us this planet will welcome back the black fungus in the forest never found a cure the mountains are filled with abominations and the anomaly storms get bigger every year we don't have much time left if we don't find a way out of this valley if we don't find a miracle this last shred of humanity is over shira would you look at that i can do things now i don't understand but maybe there's a reason yes you are i guess i know why i saved your damn life all those years ago i'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind i'm not complaining still i don't get in the day we landed that storm and tore cuspard apart but not me why why was i altered who the hell knows when those storms hit some get ripped inside out some turn pink polka dot and a few come back [ __ ] immortal nothing about the anomaly makes sense it disrupts the laws of nature it mutates whatever it touches early on the eca's best scientists tried to understand the storms to tame them none survived i guess you got lucky boss or maybe not all i care about is that you are on our side our only supply line is blocked by an altar that our weapons cannot touch out by the old solar array seth had no interest in helping us but now you're here hell why not maybe i can buy humanity another day lieutenant what the hell was that the whole front line just collapsed like an earthquake all right i i think we lost our whole first line of defenses on my way go go go [Music] hey in case i don't get another chance i i tried to find you but it all went to [ __ ] we had to run for our lives i just forget it i'm alive i should have been dead ten times over if not for tanner if not for shira i'm the one with dudes to pay now jacob awesome i missed you it's good to have you back now go beat that altered ass for us so we can get back in this goddamn fight outlier be careful out there it's bad i'll see what i can do shira i still got about 30 years of questions to catch up on so if you make it back in one piece come and ask me but i don't promise i'll have all the [Music] answers hey man why can't we just get the altar to go at him any altered that fight with us i deserve i swear substance you can do it what you see is what you get i guarantee at least one will strike your fancy come see what wonders i have for sale another time mister i'm having one shitty day ah little wind blows for us all come how about a little hot tea not much of an inventory don't mind all these crap i keep all the good stuff should have paid old man you're altered i didn't know i think i care he was about to show me the good stuff just acting on orders whose orders parker uh he runs the hounds gang he's trying to take out all the vendors in rift town it won't work for him first [ __ ] day [Music] what the hell happened the insurgents dug underneath my troops move the whole goddamn front to hell if you can't open the supply line we're done for grand marshals got us patrolling the damn town how long do you think down to the bottom you screwed this one up big time back on earth will be down here somewhere way down looks like the scumbag who killed chang was telling the truth about the hounds [Applause] so what's up so [ __ ] off you can't take her back who the girl this isn't a rescue you barker do i know you mr chang sends his regard oh come on it's right in the middle of my line you are taking too long get all the way here thanks for the rescue anyway again really wasn't here for you did you say mr chang is he all right [ __ ] like it's not bad enough having insurgents trying to drag us all to hell we got to have these low-life gangsters on our streets picking us off from the inside yeah i know the game really hasn't changed a whole lot hey you did a good thing got a bad guy off the street and i'm walking home without a scratch i'm eva by the way got a stall near chang's place you should all come see me there sometime uh [Music] [Music] this barker was a piece of work head out even the hounds will miss him [Music] [Music] watch where you're going friend this is the last place you want to be stepping grand marshals got us patrolling the damn town thanks again for getting the guy who killed poor mr chang well well i was hoping i'd see you around these parts again well you just made a lousy day 2.5 better besides with mr chan gone i still need a vendor well anything you see happy to give you a better discount good to see you again you'll be pleased to know the hounds are still scared shitless to come around here [Music] please we just got to keep following orders the old solar tower but it's a mess out there everything's upside down yeah i noticed don't worry i'm carving my way through it so thank you [Applause] everyone get ready okay except uh major deja vu in this place reminds me of that mission in damascus when we rescue those diplomats i had to save your ass from that machete wielding mob more like the time i had to save your sorry ass from that redneck mob those missions felt like we were fighting for a reason but this [ __ ] it's never been worth fighting for so what's it all about just trying to live another day boss we're barely holding on it sounds like i chose a good day to wake up then hmm jacob i'm seeing a lot of dead people they look like they've been sauteed [ __ ] be careful jacob i've reached the solar tower i'm going in what are you seeing in there some kind of weird electrical sparks flying everywhere means you're getting close this altered did i not mention he's a goddamn electro freak you mean he lights up light bulbs more like flash frying everything for a mile look i know you've always been able to handle yourself but this son of a [ __ ] is on a whole other level as of recently so am i hmm how fun so do not disappoint so so [Music] and so outrider you've had your first kill we also do not die so easily do we come we must speak they asked you to help them to fight the altar down there why didn't you that pathetic monstrosity was a distraction people are dying because of him without the supply route open they all die these feeble creatures slaughtering each other over scraps you waste your gifts running errands for them trying to win their meaningless endless war you must realize you're not like them anymore also why i should play being a god like you for go beyond the frontier these people need their gods only one like you could lead them to a future why not you they call him moloch i fight another war far above this petty squalor my war is with the worst of our kind this one is too powerful he will destroy us all unless i hunt him down but this is not your fight you ought to be the shepherd find a way for them out of this slaughter outrider so sure it's done your supply line's open i'm heading home i can't believe it outright or what you just did i've lost a hundred men trying don't thank me yet you still got a war to win i'm not sure anyone's winning this goddamn war but there's something even more important you might be able to do come see me in my bunker [Music] i deserve i don't believe you they do peck yeah good i'm sure the signal in the forest you remember it yeah like it was yesterday you still have its frequency don't you you mean this frequency gorf you got the winning lotto numbers tattooed on your ass cheek too still don't believe me oh i hate when you play that i told you so that signal is still playing like a distant echo it's digital which means it must be coming from a place where there is no anomaly the problem is we've never been able to locate its source because we've never had the right frequency until you showed up so now listen close you need to bring those precise numbers to dr abraham zahidi one of our last scientists [ __ ] he's been deep in the enemy territory for weeks now five rations says zahidi's dead we don't know that you i've seen you before it was in the med lab you woke me out of cryo guess life's real funny that way meet jane sniper first class she almost died trying to save his life she'll guide you wait shira when we landed that signal was or any idea who or what is sending it do yourself a favor don't ask that question whatever's out there they don't want to be found and whoever goes looking for that [ __ ] signal ends up dead but it's the only chance we've got and if anyone can get their life it's all of you cheera come on jacob sorry i left you to die in that med lab hey no worries didn't really have a choice i'd have done the same spread the word whoever finds mccain gets a week home from the front two weeks if they find him alive [Music] you
