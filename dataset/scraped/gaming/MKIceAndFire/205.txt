the realms are in constant flux they shift and change like an endless dream shel khan's defeat should have marked our victory against a threatened merge of earth realm and outworld instead it heralded a new struggle for independence shinnok will be displeased by your inability to take earth hold your tongue sorcerer raiden your invasion of earthrealm violated the rules of mortal kombat shall khan your tar cotton has been routed by the forces of light even now your allies desert you quantity traitor what have you done earth realm will never succumb to the forces of darkness quan shi now you will face the judgment of the elder gods [Music] nice move liu kang it was really your move i merely redirected your own power against you and i could sense your chi i knew you were there i should never underestimate the combat skill of the white lotus i am surprised to see you so soon after shao khan's defeat i've taken leave from the odynion resistance to solve a troubling puzzle many of our forces have disappeared vanished without a trace we cannot sustain these losses and still hope to reclaim adenia many white lotus have also disappeared by the gods who do you think is responsible shao khan was defeated quan chi is rumored to be imprisoned by the elder gods only two factions remain that are bold enough to fill the void left behind precisely we need to know for certain if they're responsible they're from your realm which is why i need your help you'll need more than just my help contact sonja blade she has a better understanding of the black dragon than i i will search for sub-zero snow out of place this time of year if my hunch is correct katana have you contacted sonia blade yes it seems she has been on kano's trail for the past week i'm not surprised she will contact you later i am returning to our world have you found sub-zero not yet but i feel i'm getting close closer than you think round one flight fight [Music] [Music] is this the way of the so-called forces of light exterminate your enemies it was you who attacked me ninja many of our warriors have disappeared and now i have found their assassin i didn't kill any linkway i heard your communication you and your special forces dogs were about we're investigating the disappearance of our comrades as well it seems we have a common enemy sub-zero the question is are you willing to work together to uncover the truth how do i know i can trust you because i'm about to save your life scorpion go now we will meet again later you allowed sub-zero to escape now you will suffer my wrath round one fight [Music] wins flawless victory round two flight [Music] huh [Music] ugh what happened i feel so strange i have seen this trick before your illusion does not fool me shang tsung round one fight round two fight woof uh strange if this was shang tsung he would have reverted back to his normal state his aura it feels strange foreign i must take him to my masters they will be able to attune to his qi and discover his origin [Music] masters masters where are they why don't they answer because they no longer draw breath shang tsung and soon neither will you round one flight huh round two fight [Music] flawless victory may the elder gods bind you in another realm for your treachery sorcerer this is liu kang sonia here have you found kano i almost caught up with him but he disappeared i did get close enough to tag him i've been trying to initiate a techno portal to his current location but i can't stabilize it how goes your search for sub-zero the lin kuei are not behind this they are suffering losses as well i think there is a new threat i fought a warrior something resembling a red devil with a bolt of lightning on his chest at first i thought it was shang tsung transforming his appearance i have ruled out that possibility this is a different warrior altogether i clearly sense an abnormality in his qi [Music] the energy that courses through all things in the universe this aura is unlike anything i have seen before i will try to attune to it attune to his don't do anything crazy i will be fine you may be the champion of mortal kombat but you are not invincible [Music] luke hang come in luke hang something must have gone wrong katana this is sonya blade please respond katana here something happened to luke hang he may need help my techno portals are unstable and i can't risk ending up in the middle of nowhere can you portal to him unfortunately no there is a crisis here in outworld that demands my full attention i do not have time to explain understood i'll have to go there myself i will join you when i can sonia out if the portal was working properly i could get to liu kang immediately but the destination is too erratic i can't risk emerging in the wrong place or worse bringing something here it's a little late to be worrying about that who are you i'm catwoman and i really need to be getting back to gotham city so if you could just maybe security breach portal room initiate immediate lockdown you aren't going anywhere not tonight honey i have a headache all right then no one cages this kitty round one fight fight oh security will take care of you i've got to get to liu kang no sign of liu kang or anyone for that matter i've got a bad feeling about this sonia here sorry she calls herself catwoman i'll question her later she's not a priority right now something's come up what's wrong i need help locating liu kang follow my signal and rendezvous with me as soon as baraka sonja just get here as soon as you can sonia out church won't save you this time round one fight [Music] yeah fight [Music] i don't know what barack is doing in earth realm but it's suspicious if a new invasion is coming raiden must be informed raiden where are you there may be another invasion of earth realm xiao khan may be returning raiden can you hear me raiden with a lightning bolt on his chest this must be the warrior luke kang fought who are you i am captain marvel captain why are you here oh confused don't understand the rage the round rage flight round two uh [Music] oh now maybe i can get some answers out of you cap what happened my ring's not working right but i got here as soon as i could green lantern beware the rage [Music] the rage i take it he means you what did you do to cap the same thing i'm going to do to you round one fight [Music] round two flight [Music] flawless victory thanks for the save whoever she is she was ready to finish me you look bad but whatever is going on is affecting us all come on i'll take you to the un space station so batman and wonder woman can have a look at you sonia what happened what are you doing in raiden sky temple when i lost contact with you i was about to hey what's wrong [Music] i finally found you what are you talking about this time you won't get away fight round one fight [Music] oh max [Music] gotcha [Music] wins explain yourselves i don't know what happened she just attacked me i i saw you as the enemy i thought you were a threat i can't explain it i'm sorry jax it's all right you seem to have snapped out of it she was most likely influenced by the same forces that have affected liu kang liu kang what happened to you i was captured by the invaders fortunately raiden rescued me he was being held aboard that vessel i came here to find you raiden and was attacked by two warriors they retreated to that space station i do not know from where these invaders come or who leads them but it is clear that earthrealm faces a grave new challenge our world is merging with another i can feel it but xiao khan was destroyed we stopped him from merging earth realm without world the emperor may still live and these new warriors may be his reinforcements then let's do something about it so yeah let's get back to the base we can mount a counter attack from there when i got to the wuxi academy you were already gone i did find some guy dressed in red tights though i had a medevac to the infirmary then i followed your signal to raiden's temple you got to stop running off like that sonya we're a team you can't take on the bad guys alone i know i'll work on it go get yourself patched up meantime i'll prep the portal for a jump to that space station we'll take him by surprise sounds like a plan but i have to warn you the portal has been less than cooperative lately nothing i can't handle she's right log shows the portal was having a hard time focusing probably a side effect of the two universes merging the ethereal matrix seems to be more stable now just a few adjustments and we should be back in business there that's more like it impressive what the hell allow me to introduce myself lex luthor perhaps you've heard of me or a little company i run called lexcorp this area requires top clearance and i don't remember inviting you to the party my technicians at lexcorp picked up a massive signal emanating from this space indicating highly advanced technology i'm the hands-on managerial type so i came to see for myself and i must say i am impressed a teleportation device maybe you and i should do business it's a portal as for doing business maybe it's time i gave you a demonstration of my impressive technology i'd prefer a handshake but if you insist round one flight oh alex luther wins round two um round three fights uh what happened they found our base somehow he breached our defenses who's he called himself lex luthor he runs some company acts like he's gonna take over the world looks like you put a stop to that only one way to be sure let's take out that space station sonia sonia you copy we've apparently been sent to different locations on the station i think the portal still needs some work we'll need to regroup stay where you are i'll try to hold on someone's coming we've set up a temporary holding facility as requested wonder woman it should hold captain marvel until he's recovered my thanks if this earth merge continues everyone's powers may be affected i'll be joining you shortly with our newest guest affirmative are there any special security measures [Music] well now this just got a whole lot more interesting round one flight [Music] uh two fight sonia area secure what's your situation i'm fine we need to locate the main command center to this station's capabilities right stay where you are i'll follow your signal and come to you you're not going anywhere what's up zero i take it you two know each other is jax a formidable warrior as you will soon discover well warrior i don't know what your universe is doing to mine or what you're doing to this station but true warriors don't use guns and if it's a fight you want you'll soon be joining your friend in a cell round one fight [Music] round two flight [Music] [Music] [Music] sonia you'll never guess who i bumped into sub-zero what's he doing up here obviously i'm a captive it would appear that we are now allies appearances can be deceiving true but you would be a fool to refuse my help what do you think sonja should we trust him better the devil you know than the w don't all right then sub-zero tell us what you know only that these warriors are unlike anything i have encountered i don't know yet who commands them any ideas the most logical assumption would be that shao khan has returned to finish what he started with this new army now i need to find someone a sorcerer who may have answers sorcerer i don't like the sound of that like it or not we need him whether his threat of invasion he usually knows something about it [Music] uh [Music] the lin quay are not welcome here rayden i come seeking assistance assistance for what end your kind has challenged me before i'm not my brother but you are still in quay fight round one fight [Music] wins flawless victory round two fight [Music] wins truly you are more powerful than your sibling but the corruption of the lin quay remains within you and for that reason i linguay also have reason to be concerned about this new crisis indeed the linquay act solely in their own self-interest regardless of the impact on earth realm why then should i give you the location of quan chi for the same reason you helped my brother to protect earth realm that rock formation in the distance it was not here before the invaders came but through it i've gained insight [Music] earth realm is merging with another world powers are shifting rebalancing i have felt the effects in shel khan's defeat and they have grown ever stronger quan chi foresaw the intrusion from the other world and that their champion would pose the dire threat and the lin kuei sent you to eliminate this champion yes much like this rock formation the warrior's fortress appeared near the lindquai temple i wore him down and sealed him in ice you did not wear him down his power was siphoned away redistributed to others i must find quan chi to demand he reveal all that he knows very well sub-zero i will show you the way search for scorpion and you will find quan chi but be forewarned betray my trust at your own peril scorpion was here i can sense the nether but he must have vanished from this spot well isn't this interesting a masked man in gotham and from the look of you i'd say you're no hero you do not look so innocent yourself name's deathstroke sub-zero so who are you hunting or are you just looking for a fight it is none of your concern fair enough but i've been around this world and i've never heard of a sub-zero i'm not from your world then you're in enemy territory and i assume you are the enemy smart boy one flight [Applause] fight oh yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] scorpions trail is weak but i can still track it this way this is where scorpion first entered the mortal realm what was he doing here what is this place it's the batcave ah [Music] [Music] your world is invading mine affecting everything and everyone in it don't think you'll take me so easily then i will do it the hard way round one fight [Music] [Music] [Music] round two flight oh get over here there were rumors that the elder gods had punished you i see the rumors were true i won't be bound here for long i believe you know my enforcer you share a violent history from what i understand you will pay for the murder of my family and clan that was not me who else could it be scorpion finish him fight round one fight [Music] [Music] round two fights zero failures [Music] [Laughter] the elder gods underestimate me you're free the realms have become unstable our world is colliding with another the merging fueled by combat the intense battle between such bitter enemies caused a rift powerful enough to shatter my bonds you used us i'm a sorcerer the world as we know it is in peril none will survive regardless of allegiance return to your thunder god tell him if he wishes to save his precious earth realm you will have to ally himself with devils search their cities find the princess she has seen our enemy great gag the princess where is she princess didn't i kill the last guy that called me that he should have known i'm the only joker around here oops where did that come from you will pay for that with your life round one flight [Music] round two fight [Applause] come here scorpion wins [Music] hello joker looks like you could use some help i already have a few recruits how'd you like to join us diana you have returned not for long batman has requested my presence earth is being split just as the mascara has by forces we don't yet understand i've returned to ready the amazons for war great hera who are you what business do you have on themyscira i am scorpion i seek the princess i am princess of earth you may speak to me scorpion batman told me of your battle you are not the princess i seek you may not roam this island at will even though you are an invader i promise you if you come with me you will not be harmed you cannot harm me but i will show you the meaning of pain round one fight [Music] [Music] scorpion wins round two flight [Music] the princess is not here she is near you need some help stranger the princess if you know where she is you will deliver her to me you're not from this universe all the same i'd encourage you to get to safety for your own well-being you'd better come with me magic sorcery surrender the princess or die round one fight [Music] fight test your bite scorpion wins [Music] [Music] you will come with me i should have known dark khan would send another assassin i have seen your master witness the destruction i will not let him take earth realm as well round one flight [Music] round two fight [Music] get over here well done scorpion but she has gotten too close to the enemy rage has all but consumed her i can control her for now will you do with her kill her she may have lost her mind but she still has her uses i will not leave her to you yet baraka [Music] one of the enemies near draw him to the nether realm where he will be weak kill him when you have finished with your prey meet me at raiden sky temple the time has come for old rivalries to be put aside then you helped him escape it was not intentional i swear to you you have betrayed my trust he did you a service katana you dare to come here sorcerer not to fight i assure you then for what purpose by now i am sure you are aware of the merging its effects are far reaching even the nether realm is vulnerable i care not for the wasteland you call home katana you believe that you are in control that your allies are enough to stave off the coming destruction think again thunder god [Music] katana i will destroy you all this is your doing sorcerer it is no spell of mine she is a harbinger of things to come it will only get worse what is this i've used the last of my power to purge her of the rage i am at your mercy raiden why would you do this to win your trust what is it that we face perhaps she can show you at first i thought it was the emperor but it is someone much more powerful dark con the portal raiden disrupted did not destroy the emperor it created a monster dark khan's energy is slowly grinding the two universes together agitating us until we become enraged and fight combat releases the rage hastening the merging then dark khan must be stopped not yet we must first eliminate his forces but to do so will require the unthinkable bitter rivals must fight as one to focus the rage against our enemies so it shall be we will seek out dark khan's forces hunt them down in pairs liu kang you must fight alongside shang's soul i will do as you ask braden this could prove interesting shang and i have just arrived at the fortress no sign of the you can chat with your woman later we have a job to do people to kill your forces got the better of me before my powers may not be at full force but as you can see i have friends the warrior sub-zero warned us about let us finish what he could not fight round one fight [Music] flies flawless victory at least they were more of a challenge than your masters do not test me shang tsung i should have killed you at the academy stopped you shang tsung your treachery ends here round one fight i'm sorry [Music] [Music] round two fight god [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how how can this be you are more powerful than before i was weakened when last we fought but energies are in constant flux as a result of the merging now i am revitalized surging with power i could finish you right now you wanna finish you got it leave him he is defeated now you face a more deadly adversary round one flight uh fight [Music] you defeated him you defended me it was not something which i enjoyed i owe you my gratitude save your pathetic graciousness were it not for dark khan i would kill you now our objective is complete we must return to the others we couldn't stop them either they overpowered us how could this be it was a skinny one dressed in purple with green hair stronger than you'd think i have fought him before jester with a twisted face a clown you are defeated by a clown it may be as you said chiang sang energy shifting causing imbalances i don't need you to make excuses for me and i don't need your approval kano calm down you don't want to do this you think you could have handled him you can't even handle me we shall see round one fight flawless victory round two flights as much as i would love to see you two kill each other there are bigger issues to deal with agreed sonia here this is jax i'm at the base i have some bad news they were at the base a guy in an exosuit dropped me then they used our techno portal i think they're headed to outworld then that is where we must go we all know what is at stake if we fail none of us will survive then we shall go to outworld [Music] it is worse than when i left this is what will become of the realms if we do not stop dark khan over there khan's forces their commander approaches i will speak with him but be ready to fight [Music] i'm superman we need to know your intentions i am raiden god of thunder with me are the mightiest warriors in all the realms [Music] we have come to challenge you in mortal combat you will be defeated don't be so sure raiden if you want a fight you'll find my friends and i are up to the challenge ah luke what's wrong i can sense something something big it's here.com you seek to destroy me your aggression the rage flowing through them raiden and his allies battled the invaders with a diabolical elation but as the dust settled it was clear that neither side had won the few comrades still standing tried to free themselves of the bloodlust dark khan is heading to that fortress we should follow him an obvious course of action but having been suggested by you shang i must consider that you are leading us into a trap you have good reason to doubt me long have i fought against you but this time i swear we fight together no you are in league with dark khan you lured us to our doom if we are to perish then so shall you sorcerer round one fight round two fight [Music] [Music] this is the end shang tsung i will finish you raiden stop shang tsung is not the enemy this time step aside liu kang no i will not let you kill him then you have turned your back on earth realm broken your vow and betrayed me fight round one flight [Music] ah round two fight fatality what have i done you have wasted precious time we must destroy dark khan take the battle to his fortress you are right but this fight is mine alone it was my lightning blast that created dark khan do not be a fool you heard what quan chi said we must fight together no the rage will only turn us against each other i will face him alone [Music] the time has come to correct my mistake [Music] you you're not going to stop me superman raiden the rest of your forces were defeated so were yours nobody won here then it is between us now that's fine with me round one fight wow test your might fight [Music] uh outstanding such ferocity the hatred the anger your combat hastens emerging no dark god i won't let you destroy the earth [Music] you don't fight for him neither do you seems we have a common enemy and a common goal on your feet this battle is not yet over you will fight don't give in to the rage raiden it can be overcome focus we must focus what are you doing if we fight together we can channel his own energy against him sounds like a plan race each other it makes no difference you will fight round one fight round two uh raiden wins superman he's gone shao khan's throne room the realms have been restored who are you i am god's side i am if you are anything like shal khan you will find no refuge here your fate will be decided by the elder gods [Applause] [Music] [Music] metropolis a shining example of human achievement this is where we made our final stand against darkseid and his army of parademons born in the fire pits of a distant world called apocalypse but what seemed like victory was only the beginning it's over darkseid don't be so sure kryptonian took you long enough luther you threatened the safety of earth for your own personal gain you allied yourself with darkseid i was only trying to ensure humanity's survival in the event that you and the other so-called heroes failed [Music] darkseid's activated another dimensional boom tube he's going to escape [Music] this isn't over superman don't be so [Music] tool sure destabilizing the boom tool [Music] i'm amazed you didn't kill us save it luther

been defeated by superman though the invasion is in fact over the looting continues deathstroke how's it going yeah it's been a while i got all the money for you no no no please well i got the money

able to transport you give me a minute something about him isn't making sense i could buy that scorpion came from apocalypse but this man is different according to you flash had the same kind of psychotic condition i'm not sure but we may be witnessing the beginning of another invasion i'll leave the detective work to you i'm going to look for superman computer run the blood sample from luke hang against the known alien blood types we have in the database no matches to blood type i need to know if we should expect any more visitors let me guess you're from the same place as liu kang and

two fight [Music] yes batman wins uh [Music] it's worse than i suspected much worse it seems this is happening across the globe with strange structures and artifacts appearing but the question still

something i don't know the invasion has reached the miskira do you need help no i'll contact you when it's over wonder woman out leave this island at once or pay with your lives i am princess diana emissary of themyscira you are not welcome here surrender and you will be given safe passage back to your world aryan fool i am shang tsum and this is my island fight round one fight yes drive to flight [Music] uh [Music] wonder woman to batman the invaders have retreated into the jungle i have more bad news earth is in the process of merging with another planet by the gods our world and the alien world occupy the same time and space as fragments separated only by large large yellow energy risks i've seen them we need superman but no one knows where he is i'll search metropolis darkseid's invasion ravaged metropolis it's not like superman too great hera are you all right let me help you it can't be we routed his invasion he was destroyed who darkseid i saw him more powerful than ever torn his realm asunder am i too late has he already brought the apocalypse to this world wonder woman to you in orbital space station i need a med unit at my location we have another victim of the invasion please come with me you're safe now we i have been followed who are you no one will hurt you my name is wonder woman i am not so easily fooled assassin of outworld your master has sent you to finish me but this battle will be your last fight round one fight [Music] aah round two fight [Music] test your fight [Music] wow [Music] please wait wonder woman this is batman superman's not in metropolis the fortress of solitude has been breached that's impossible superman may be in serious trouble and without him so is earth i'm on my way [Music] what have you done another one juan chi was right who are you i am sub-zero surrender and no harm will come to you the lin kuei do not know the meaning of surrender fight round one flight my god round two fight [Music] cal what happened are you all right something's wrong my powers have been fluctuating ever since the battle with darkseid i came back to the fortress to try to discover what was wrong and sub-zero attacked what's happening to me it must have a basis in magic luckily i'm not susceptible to magic so he got what he deserved bruce believes he's part of an invasion force heroes all over the world are disappearing including the flash and our planet is merging with another possibly apocalypse apocalypse then dark side is back i have to get back to metropolis i'll rendezvous with you at the u.n space station sub-zero who is behind this invasion you are the invaders wonder woman this is in chaos i'll be there as soon as i can you'll be coming with me cap stop pal what have you done the rage will consume us all not if i can help it round one fight round two flight [Music] the rage it burns inside me i need you to be calm tell me what you did to green lantern why did you attack him ah i don't know the ethereal forces are all unbalanced shifting i reach out to the gods and don't recognize what i see the rage you have to help me you should have finished him your world must be different than ours here we don't kill our friends wonder woman to batman i found superman but we have a new problem we've lost green lantern the ring brought me to the home world of the guardians of the universe but why two universes are colliding your fellow lanterns are elsewhere doing what they can to combat the crisis that would explain captain marvel's attack whatever's happening on earth must be affecting him more directly than the rest of us i have to get back to earth yes you do lex luthor and catwoman how lex and i were held captive in the invaders underground base their security was more pathetic than the gotham city museum we escaped using their portal technology i calibrated it to transport us to metropolis but there was obviously a malfunction we ended up here now i know i need to get back to earth if he's involved things can't be good typical you're no better than superman the universe is falling apart and the so-called heroes focus on the little picture all that power in his ring have you ever noticed how he uses it big hammers trains and idiotic animals what's the matter with you lex his eyes just like captain marvel you lack imagination green lantern you always have someone like me should have that ring over my dead body lex just the way i like it round one fight [Music] oh [Music] round two fight this is a foolish waste of valuable time the merging of worlds is contaminating the galaxy infecting your very substance with rage for the moment we can control it here on or but if unchecked it will spread across the universes then we'll stop it if it continues to progress at this rate energies throughout will be redistributed and corrupted no lanterns ring will be unaffected or remain intact nor will any other being in the galaxy escape neither universe will survive why is this happening we are uncertain of the cause but we believe this anomaly originated on earth at the moment of darkseid's defeat you know anything about that lex it is highly unlikely that lex luthor is capable of influencing devastation on such a cosmic scale you on earth must work together to locate the source of the disruption and destroy it before the merge is complete looks like we have no choice don't worry handsome we won't bite much earth sector 2814 is under your protection we cannot spare any of the lantern corps to help charge your ring and return quickly there is not much time that's more like it so what's it going to be hero do we work together or do i have to save the world in spite of you remember i don't trust you luther the feeling is mutual that's the you in communicator i have to leave you here if i were you catwoman i wouldn't turn my back on him i can take care of myself idiot home sweet home or at least it used to be before dark side got to it you brought it on yourself lex from what i hear you helped darkseid i never take sides i chose the lesser of two evils the worst superman would do is hand me over to the authorities darkseid on the other hand would destroy everything it wasn't much of a choice seems like we don't have one now either so what's the plan simple we find a way to turn this situation to our advantage wonder woman this is

intermingle his existence will turn this world into a nexus of evil if the connection between the universes is not severed and darkseid freed the rage will reach out and devour us all you must gather an army of both dark and light and find a champion who has defeated darkseid in the past then we must find superman superman doesn't respond to my hails wonder woman says his powers have been affected as badly as mine by this alien world if not worse but he's the champion earth needs and now you have suffered the same fate this place such evil flattery will get you nowhere this pathetic creature
