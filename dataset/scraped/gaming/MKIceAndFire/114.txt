uh hmm you made it welcome to the hunting grounds my name is avina i'm the caretaker of the grounds i make sure they're kept fit for training against machines whether they be used by our soldiers or our uttaru neighbors same as the karjathan ah yes we've heard those cows claim the idea of hunting grounds as their own but our soldiers have been training in places like this since before the clan wars i'm willing to bet our trials are beyond anything the carter would dare face a skilled hunter like you might actually find them challenging rewarding too win our trials and you'll earn stripes that in turn will garner you some medals remnants of our victory against the carja during the red raids you can take medals to the arena at the grove our capital its keepers will let you exchange them for the finest weapons and gear our tribe has to offer i'll keep that in mind i should probably also mention our carver they make pieces for a popular game of ours watching the machines at the grounds gives them inspiration you mean strike you know of it that maybe you should check out their wares carvers almost always have extra pieces to trade for the right resources i should get going then i have other grounds to inspect but rest assured they will be open to you walk with the ten are these your hunting grounds they are try a challenge and we'll see if you live up to your reputation just slide down a rope to start i look forward to seeing you compete [Music] huh [Music] so huh [Music] up [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh so i can grab this from my stash later what huh i see you live up to the stories outlander [Music] g down with the ropes and we'll begin the trial [Applause] ammo could help here [Music] [Music] [Music] tunnels this is for you go down the rope and i'll start timing the trial calling oh to get the parts i need up stuff for the stash [Music] you've got you should be proud of yourself the grounds will be dull without you [Music] good machine is mine oh don't let things around oh [Laughter] save those smiles for your families the tanakh understand only strength and ours was a poor display at best they will be back you the one who actually won this fight for us a word i want everyone fortifying the past ah you're a warrior scene green is early spring there are children playing with sticks it's all i can do to keep them alive it'll only get harder so far the rebels have sent mere scouts but it won't be long until they return for an all-out assault and if they bring machines with them we'll need a lot more than eager hearts to win you seem to know a lot about tanaka's tactics back when the tanakh clans pushed back the carjarders i joined the fight that's a knock taught you how to fight more than that they taught me how to work with metal i'm probably the only lutaro who can never thought i'd be using what i learned then to fight against them now we may speak freely here so what's the plan the plan was making new weapons for my so-called fighters i send my best climber vos up the drum route to get the materials we need wide mods leave metal pods we use for crafting at summit but the derangement has made them as dangerous as the climb to reach them boss has yet to return we have defenses to set up and we are running out of time if the savior of meridian is willing to lend us her strength a little longer i believe you can get us what we need you know who i am red hair bow fights better than ten warriors put together you're well known and so is your little disagreement with the chorus can't plan somehow plain zone has abandoned all settlements this far out then why not just leave they're clearly outnumbered and under-equipped we could leave head to safety have you ever seen a flower so small and white when it falls it looks like snow and spring my daughter called them winter song she carried their seeds to the day she drew her last breath now those seats grow in the grove at the heart of river hem planted by my own hands as do the ones of every brother and sister taken from us during the red raids we i will not abandon them you know i knew the warrior who led the bravest of my tribe against the carja but the zoo that came back from the route spends too much time dwelling on things that just had to be done i'm not one for regrets i'm sorry about your daughter the raids took her from me i found my peace in every corner that fell beneath my spear now all i have left of her is planted in the grove here no tanakh will force me out do all utaru carry seeds with them we are given our pouches soon after we're born when we die the seeds are buried a reminder that our deaths bring new life it is how we remain one with the rhythm of the world what makes the path up to the drum route so dangerous it's a cave of sunken passages and gaping caverns that only the very skilled can navigate it serves as a safe haven for my people but machines have patrolled its deepest passageways ever since the derangement even so river hem and the grove live off its waters we are connected to it as much as we are to the seeds growing behind you i don't think i caught your name q i am the metal weaver of river hem but all you really need to know about me is that i plan to keep my people alive thanks to you we might actually have a chance at that tell me more about these metal pots they are tricky to collect the wide mars sow them one must be quick enough to gather them before the soil and water take them but their metal is among the sturdiest i've ever weaved without them our chances of survival are slim oh there's no convincing you to leave i guess we're making some weapons you have my thanks there's no time to waste follow me this way with those paws and a whole lot of luck we just might get out of this alive let's hope these sprouts can hold their ground against a squad of machines i can only cover so much ground in my joints on what they used to be look to me like they chose to stay here as much as you did it'll be the fight of their lives that's for sure almost there this is the best we can do to hide those who cannot fight but if we fall the tanakh will find them sooner than later we're here this is it do you have any questions i'm ready good luck come see me at the forge when you're done almost over guess i better start finding my way up to the top oh i need to find a way up there [Music] huh i don't think i'm getting anywhere through here there doesn't seem to be an easy way to climb in this cave but if there's tunnels up here there might be some underwater maybe they can leave me some place through these caves wow i should take a seat pouch to cue right now [Music] oh let's find a way up these caves [Music] yes [Music] [Music] here i come [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] huh oh [Music] so [Music] up [Music] almost there made it time to find those white malls this will be in my stash when i need it there they are those pods they're rejecting they must be the ones q needs looks like i can just pick them up once they fall to the ground if i'm quiet enough i can get them without the machines ever knowing i'm here so i don't think i can override you unless there are more cauldrons out there [Music] fires wasted on my machine [Music] [Music] [Music] got it [Music] ugh thank you [Music] so hey shocked and locked there we go that should do it better get back to cue with these i got what you needed not a moment too soon did you find voss i brought his seed pouch back i pray it'll be the last i bury but now i need to get the weapons ready let's hope it'll be enough it'll have to be [Music] [Music] everyone stay behind cover until i give the signal up close it is dead loose come on foreign let's see how you like this is our home riverhead will not go protect the seeds of the bullets guess these young ones knew how to aim after all even so we owe you this victory huntress it wasn't my strategy or craft that got us here q i just brought in some parts even so i want you to have this it did good by my people it'll do good by you he'll take good care of it be safe out there another day careful outlander these fields are roth with flight the first bloom of the winter song i can feel the heaviness of my ears fade away just by looking at them they're beautiful it was good to see the young ones fight for this place i'll be damned if those sprouts didn't hold their own strong as the roots of a proud tree just don't tell them i said that your secret's safe now i better make sure our newly victorious warriors don't injure themselves while celebrating a stack of sand is darker than you is this a training pit it is sounds like you've been to one of the other clan's capitals i'm leerake i run this training pit for the desert clan only a few outlanders have ever made it out this far west but from what i've heard you're a pretty good fighter anyway if you've been to another clan's training pit then you must know the drill same rules apply here you can train or take on a challenge only your spear and a practice bow are allowed in the pit complete all of my challenges and you can spar with me and when i beat you i'll earn a mark if and yes a token of victory to present to the enduring who is this enduring exactly all i've heard is that they're the best trainer amongst the tanakh earn three marks then you'll see oh just as you can combine single attacks you can also chain combinations try it with this one here's something different i want you to practice using aerial slash to chain into an aerial shot [Applause] i don't have enough charger [Applause] all right i yield [Applause] that was a good fight pretty sure i'll have a bruise to remember it by here a mark as promised thanks one down i guess go to the training pits in the bulwark and thorn marsh earn their marks then you can challenge the enduring few have ever done so but i think you might have a shot and if you want to train more or take on another challenge let me know the pit will always welcome you that's enough practice for now strike true is the [Music] tossed it 10. have you heard from up north from bleeding mark i'm guessing that's the place one of the deserts villages they send their yield of ash blood so the bereca over there could mark the skin of our soldiers but it's been a long time since the last supply run too long if you think something happened to them can't you send someone to go check word up to me but the capital is already dealing with machines storms and strict water rations no one can be spared you mentioned the village up north sends some supplies to the capitol ash blood it's a crimson stone that we grind into powder for our ink bleeding mark has the largest supply our soldiers there gather and deliver it to us in exchange for their water rations die for water everyone in the clan depends on the wound in the sand for their water capital and outlying village alike but the last delivery of ash blood was weeks ago our supply is running low so must be their water my face people strike fear in your enemies take a look if i'm out that way i can look in on the village find out what's the delay you have my thanks head north to a ruin where the desert meets the mountains that's bleeding mark ask for kentuck or nitika there they'll know what's going on [Music] my blade fights with you attacking the grove regala is a traitor this wing's holding up the screenshot might trade for something good oh before i can override them [Music] oh oh oh [Music] uh oh ah [Music] [Applause] uh stash this away for later this must be the village zoko was talking about looks like the whole place flooded maybe from a recent storm i wonder if anyone made it out best check around the shore can anyone hear us where are you we're trapped in this tower flood blocked the way we came in there's a ladder at the top but we can't reach it okay i'll find a way to get to you i need to get to the ladder at the top of the building maybe there's a way to cross over from the broken one next to it i can get it from my stash later there's the ladder on the other building i can make that jump it looks like it's stuck maybe i can use my weight to make it drop no that was our only way out everyone okay you're not one of us sorry yes we took shelter in here when a mudslide swept through the village but debris blocked the passage we came in through that ladder was our only way out but we couldn't reach it from here don't worry he'll find us another way out of here do you know what happened to the others before we ran in here i thought i saw a few of our comrades climbing up a watchtower on the north side near the grotto i'll look into it can you make it to the shore from here if you find us a way out we'll make it okay sit tight for now huh i should do it okay you should have a way out thanks we'll head to the shore in a moment okay better find this watchtower on the north end there are more survivors i'm not overlooked must be where netika is uh is he all right uh he will be there but what about the others let me worry about that rest now i'm netika you're a long way from the east outlander you're in a tikka so this must be bleeding mark what's left of it how do you know this place the anchor's apprentice and scalding spear told me to find you he was worried something happened to your supply caravan well as you can see we have more important problems than delivering ash blood what happened here the last storm caused a deluge that brought down half of the mountain the mudslide barreled right through the village i hear we have you to thank for getting these soldiers to safety but there are others still missing and i need to keep watch here then i'll take another look around if i find anyone else i'll send them your way much appreciated and if you see an older soldier grim faced goes by kentuck tell him tell him i'm here just need a rib from that fang horde [Applause] uh hold on i'll figure something out i need to find a way for the knox to get down from the cliff that big crane could help if i can get it into the right position i could make a bridge for them i was blocking the base of the crane maybe i can clear it if i pull that beam out i must be stuck on something else underwater maybe my focus can help me search [Applause] [Music] okay crane's in place so there's something laying the arm down i've got to get out of the water to get a better look at it pulling it this way it's not working i don't think i can pull the beam from here i have to get up higher there we go oh damn it i'm stuck on something i better clean up and take a look if i detach those cables the arms should drop the rest of the this thing's way to drop watch out we're clear [Music] blood of the ten how'd you manage to do that i don't know how you did it but thanks for the rescue is everyone okay his legs snapped against some debris as we were making a run for it but he'll live how'd you get stuck up here a mudslide tore through the village in the last storm this ledge was just above the flood when we got to it about a time everything calmed down the water had receded leaving us stranded and we couldn't leave a fellow soldier behind can you make it to the shore from here the teak is there tending to the wounded netika thank the team we'll head for her location she'll know what we should do next if you're looking for survivors i thought i heard shouting on the north end by the grotto you might want to check there thanks i'll look into it do i have any fire ammo on me maybe he's with the other survivors what huh oh crush them with the boulders shoot the support beam those boulders break the support beam crush the machines yep i got your attention now oh there should be safer to not know we're coming down it's always good to have extra [Music] is everyone okay better now without snapmalls prowling around you sure know how to fight have you seen kentuck netika asked me to keep an eye out for him last i saw him was before the mudslide hit okay head for the shore on the other side of the village natik is there with the other survivors will do thanks again um washed off some of the sweat rest now aloy thanks to you these soldiers are safe but where's ken talk i didn't see anyone who matched his description do you know where he was when the storm hit i was the last one to see him just before i told him i wanted to leave this place to pledge my blade to the chief's guard but he refused to discharge me from the squad all tonight are stubborn fighters but ken talk is more so than most so i walked out i was coming back from the opposite ridge when i saw the mudslide you were coming back to make amends i must find him if anyone can survive such a storm it's him you said kentuck is your squad leader i've trained under him ever since i was assigned to a squad he's tough as a shell snapper unforgiving as the desert but my blade is quicker deadlier because of him and he taught me to fight for duty not just glory to serve something greater than yourself yes and yet he wants me to be tethered to this place rather than fulfilling a greater purpose with the chief's card you said you wanted to pledge your blade to the chief's guard is that what the marshals are no the marshals travel the breadth of the clan lands enacting chief hikaru's will the guard remains at the grove to defend it and the chief but like the marshals only a handful are chosen for such an honor so why did ken talk not want you to go he claimed that the greater honor was to serve my squad and clan but all we do here is gather supplies for ink how can that compare to guarding the grove the chief himself so a mudslide did all this must have been quite a storm we've had more and more of them over the last few years torrential rain lightning strikes winds that rattle the metal towers but this last one was the worst yet this area used to be as arid as the rest of the desert the storms have changed all that but for all this water we still rely on the capital for our supply why is that this water is poisoned by ash blood undrinkable as machine oil the inker's apprentice and scalding spear mentioned you exchange ash blood for water it's the way of the desert where other villages hunt for food or machine parts to trade with a capital we collect rocks important rocks the clan relies on ash blood to mark their skin how can they record their glories without her supply i can take another look around the village where did you last see latika i'm here where's kentuck did he make it we're going to find him he saved me pushed me out of the way as everything collapsed but then the flood took him towards the gouge the gouge it's an ancient passage at least deep underground come i'll show you natika we need orders we're exposed out here only half of us can hold a blade if machines come what do you want us to do go the gouge is in the hillside northwest of here i'll catch up when i can what are we going to do now let's get a couple soldiers posted as lookouts to start understood uh there must be the gouge looks like an old mine there's a lot of debris blocking the entrance maybe kentuck got swept in there during the flood i'm gonna have to clear it to get inside time to head in okay let's see where this leads huh take it easy you must be kentucky oh that was an outlander know my name nitika sent me to find you the soldier you saved told us you were swept away by the mudslide so he made it good and natica she came back yeah she was on her way back to talk to you when the mudslide happened she's looking after the survivors now it was my mistake to deny her discharge a soldier is supposed to sacrifice for the good of the tribe looking back now she was right i didn't want to let her go the chief's guard will gain an invaluable soldier at least after all this i won't be in the way anymore i can tell you no fatal wound when you see one my service to my clan is done so leave me no you're not going to die down here there has to be a way to get you out nurse i tried to climb out it's no use the walls are too slick water's coming in from the surface i'm not from where i came in there must be another source and if i find it and open it up you might not be able to move kentuck but i think there might be a way to move you hey hey i need you to stay awake i'm gonna take a look around you're just like natika relentless as a fire claw and you should be used to it just sit tight i'm going to get you out of here that waterfall must be coming from somewhere i need to get higher up to figure out where it's coming from uh oh [Music] there must be another source huh there's some metal in that wall across the way i'd be able to pull some of it out there huh okay the waterfall i saw down below should be coming in from somewhere around here gotta find its source uh pack's full but my stash has room what eh [Music] water's coming in from there [Music] what did you do i found us a way out almost there hey stay with me tell me you tell her yourself she said you're a stubborn fighter so keep fighting [Music] oh he wanted me to tell you the blade answers only to the hand that commands it he would say that every time we sparred sometimes as an insult other times as a compliment but i guess he was right it was always my choice to stay or go i'm sorry you didn't get to make amends so am i what will he do now i'm not sure bleeding mark has a chance to recover and once that's done i could join the chief's guard but i have to lay him to rest first with full soldiers honors halo wait you saved my comrades somehow drained the entire village i want you to have this thanks and good luck whatever you decide so that's a lot of green shine whoever made camp here must have found a large deposit my focus might show me more so if you want to do it this must be the ruins of las vegas oh so this that's true i might be able to find a way down through one of these structures hmm drone must be part of cyclops if i can get its data i can reconnect it with the dome back at the base that's how to get up there that water's pouring out of that building poseidon's doing i better check it out camping here like there's something behind that tarpon [Laughter] oh i was at him i was so close to drowning maybe not not to the embers moreland it's over well not for me it's not then you're going to die alone because we're not sticking around to fish out the corpse we're through and so the visionary's fate hung in the balance would he choose life or succumb to deadly delusion hello so there's an ancient city under the sand but it's flooded suddenly a norris spearmaiden appeared yeah okay um well you're not typical delvers that's for sure what's this i i call it a diving bubble this is the mark one the mark ii was better but uh it got stuck halfway down air tube snags you went down in that yeah i hardly expect a lay person to understand because that's pretty smart uh i'm sorry may i remind you you got stuck inside and nearly drowned it'd have to be portable though machine kneecap maybe well you'd need a filter synthetic membrane would do it with a hose to a compressed air capsule hammer and tongue what is this what is happening here get over here she's a stranger you got a name hey boy moreland not a stranger anymore you're a damn fold come on i got the original schematics over here oh um hold on just a couple of questions first fair enough partner partner [Music] don't mind him [Music] you
