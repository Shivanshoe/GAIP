systems go general four come on baby show us what you got three what the hell what in the blue blazes is that one no wait stop the countdown [Music] ah uh incompetent fool i should never have sent you what's shakin pox you look a little what's the word constipated let's just say i hope you turn out to be less of an evolutionary dead end than your predecessor you lost me shall i tell you a secret few of our people know this but the dna patterns in our cloning banks are becoming more and more degraded with each new clone that's bad right only if we want to retain our immortality through cloning of course it's bad i sent crypto 136 in search of a planet we visited many eons ago a planet seated with pure furon dna but i lost contact let me get this straight you sent me him crypto136 to a hostile planet and he's disappeared maybe captured maybe even being tortured as we speak well i wouldn't jump to any conclusion i bet you wouldn't let me tell you something pox you're a smart cookie but there's a time for thought and there's a time for action and this is one of those times which the second one perhaps you're right one three seven course i'm right you kidding me a cryptosporidium

empire your benevolent masters welcome you at this time we wish to abduct you for the purpose of scientific research the procedure will be protracted and invasive do you have any objections [Applause] earth creature i am addressing you respond or be vaporized i don't care how many stomachs you have i don't have time for this we furons have evolved the astounding power of psychokinesis crypto target

green not gray don't be a stiff you know what it means absolutely what it means the paper's got it right for once get on the horn to silhouette we've got the worst case scenario big heads we're actually on to something i don't believe it believe it roswell was only the beginning the invasion is on [Music] now then i know what you're thinking what can i a lowly novice do to help bring about the destruction of earth and the inevitable reign of the furon empire well i'll tell you it was in the earliest days of the empire we realized our species was doomed eons of waging war on inferior races with unregulated atomic weaponry had mutated our genes we could not propagate due to our complete and utter lack of genitalia fortunately a furon ship happened upon earth on its way back from destroying the martians human society was young and nubile sailors on a foreign planet letting off steam one thing led to another long story short every human being alive today has buried deep in his genetic code a strand of furon dna over the eons we've learned to clone ourselves but with each iteration the information degrades and the results are increasingly unpredictable the furon genes and humanities dna are ancient uncorrupted they represent the future of the furon race if only we can get at them welcome to my little laboratory you may not have known this but i flatter myself to be something of an inventor in my spare time i've been developing some truly impressive weapon and ability upgrades i'd be happy to share them with you if you've got something for me in trade say some of that delicious dna you've [Music] collected okay nice [Music] [Music] crypto i see a horde of humans up ahead congregating at some sort of holy ground here's the plan i want you to enter the fair find a malleable human and lead it back to your ship for questioning get the picture crypto that human is aware of your presence the more people become aware of you the more chance that those human policemen and the military will come to investigate you and take you down don't forget to disguise yourself crypto you're not exactly inconspicuous you know now that you're sufficiently disguised continue using the cortex scan to maintain the illusion you wouldn't want to lose concentration while surrounded by enemies [Music] every time i go in that barn all i can think what i need is a farm hands union let's see brando make a movie about that i wonder what's for dinner oh yeah beef again i want a salad is that so wrong i love a man in uniform oh wait i am a man in uniform now if i can just find a cowboy an indian and a construction worker i could form that singing group down at the village what would we call ourselves the city people the village folks or something what we need is the dumbest weakest wheeled most malleable human we can find admittedly the competition will be fierce you just have to scan them all man oh man she might be the dumbest miss rockwell ever and check out them cantaloupes god i love america this human seems to be on to something will wonders never cease keep scanning the humans nixon is there anything he can't do that huffman should step aside for tricky dick i want to marry miss rockwell but instead i gotta sit here hour after hour day after day watching this dying wheel go up and down round and round over and over again until somebody dies hell of a metaphor yes yes like proteins from the primordial ooze a pattern is emerging scan some more human minds crypto yeah yeah yeah town's doing great business is booming hope is on the way yadda

soup i want roast chicken chicken of the sea or was it by the sea all right crypto i've analyzed all the thoughts you've collected and i think i've isolated the perfect subject for you to probe and vaporize no abduct and bring back to the mothership my ways more fun abduct not vaporize okay but humanity ain't gonna annihilate itself all i'm saying can i finish can i stop you as i was saying the newly crowned miss rockwell looks like a prime candidate for testing she's envied and desired by other humans she's highly persuadable best of all she apparently has a brain the size of a peanut hypnotize her and send her back to your ship for collection implant a command on a puny human brain bend its will to hours i want to thank all the little people but there's no time gotta go what is it it must have been my imagination i guess it worked nothing boy i must really be losing it [Music] which way is the exit gosh uncle stanley sure didn't seem like himself this morning enjoy the bear oh

mutated [Music] species healthy green glow those human fools clearly they've genetically altered these pathetic gas bags and turned them into radioactive exploding zombie cows show them the folly of their mad science so yourself me you can't do this [Music] good work crypto space invaders run for your lives the town's alpha male 1 where did he come from never mind that you must stop him before he publicly reveals your existence go to this town hall and take the alpha male's place to address the pea-brained masses [Music] i know i could crochet a portrait of president huffman i bet he'd be tickled pink by that a restricted area crypto the charming security of this town hall won't let you in without a jacket use hollow bob to keep standards up will [Music] you crypto the gathering is

device up the poor things crap trapped and after all that i didn't even get to see miss rockwell she just walked right on by with her crocs laid out flat in circles like a fourth of july pinwheel i told edgar there goes our savings no new shoes for the twins and i guess darlene's just gonna have to live another year with that overbite greetings fellow human agricultural engineers there is nothing going on here everything is normal carry on with your pathetic human lives that is all now what just a cotton-picking minute mr mayor i've lived in this town all my life and i voted for you twice in the last election now i'm entitled to a gall darn answer if there ain't nothing going on here how come all my cows is glowing like lightning bugs what you say to that whippersnapper i don't know why but it isn't from the death ray of a flying saucer i can tell you that you want to know what's been going on around here i'll tell you what's been going on around here communism that's what

yeah that's right give it up let's hear it for me suckers [Music] good night and have a pleasure tomorrow [Music] [Applause] what a bunch of losers minds like mud this planet is easy pickings crypto did you hear what that human said during your speech must have missed it busy digging on the love focus there's another human hive nearby you must discover its location and make your way there we've got more humans to control [Music] did you want a saucer upgrade or something a little more personal here we are crypto sunny santa modesta first up i want you to find the alpha male of this town perhaps we can gain an insight into the way this wrapped human social hierarchy functions crypto the first thing you should do is take a human disguise in this mission it's vital you remain completely incognito if your true form is seen by anyone the mission will fail [Music] creatures scan any humans you find they might be able to tell you where the alpha male is located [Music] maybe i'll get lucky at the pool party meet some sexy single ladies get a little action good thing i wore my date night jockeys what a great guy he must really love pool parties [Music] what a great guy he must really love pool parties must keep smiling only three blocks till home and mother's little helper if only there was some way to electronically facilitate the private viewing of illicit photography like some sort of computing device for the screen uh it'll never happen the sexiest word in the english language tupperware oh there seems to be a human social ritual in progress perhaps you can discover what's going on by scanning them better move before that mayor gets any closer little lech thinks he can grab anything that tickles his fancy [Music] what a great guy he must really love pool parties that mayor sure is one heck of a public speaker shame about his short-term memory just keeps saying the same stuff over and over again [Music] hold on your hats boys i'm going commando just because a couple of slack-jawed yokels have been drinking too much rockwell moonshine i'm supposed to hand over my civic authority i paid good money for this office this is my town those feds better

and the tape in the briefcase all queued up subliminal tv messages what'll majestic think of next search me you know what a rhetorical question is not a clue come on those black suits again what's a majestic i'm not certain but it gives me an idea crypto wait let me grab something to write with if our plan is to succeed simply reading human minds will be insufficient we must control them to ease the harvesting of their brain stems grease the wheels so to speak sounds like a gas how do we do it i believe your eben garbed friends have provided us direction keep up with the black sedan you're being outrun by a vehicle that can't even fly communists we're under attack little green men the men in black are getting away good lord it's an alien if you don't head for the tv station and cut them off there scanning the documents now crypto this looks diabolical the briefcase contains a reel of magnetic tape and orders to commence an experiment in apparently a human scientist is waiting at the tv station for these orders [Music] he's an expert on the human brain his name is sleepy ernst i want you to go to the tv station and [Music] scan [Music] [Music] oh on your knees count [Music] [Music] the human mind can be controlled by televised propaganda and then i'll start my own cable news network haha there's a heck of those majestic agents america ain't gonna brainwash itself we cannot allow the human race to be sleepy ernst's experimental guinea pigs they should be our guinea pigs destroy sleepy ernst crypto stop that narcoleptic this is some sort of psychokinetic phenomenon i am sure of him crypto majestic intended to broadcast mind control signals to control their own people by transmitting signals from this station they hope to make the human population paranoid and aggressive well more paranoid and aggressive [Music] i suggest we beat majestic at their own devious little game we'll broadcast our own very special episode a mind control transmission from the mother ship a few minor adjustments to those rooftop antennae should make them furon ready i'm all right crypto here's the plan we're going to use this television thingy ourselves to subjugate humanity to the indomitable will of the furon empire if you can bend the antennae in the direction of the mothership they'll be in the perfect position to receive my furon mind control transmissions that's the good news [Music] the bad news is for complex and highly technical reasons you have only a few minutes if you cannot align the antennae very bad things will happen let's not speak of it again can't i watch the news in peace was kind of making sense but no i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america how can i love lucy when she's off the [Music] air darn rabbit ears how will i know if the exact value of an all-expenses-paid cuban vacation is lower or higher than 93-49 yeah [Music] you're almost done crypto oh i'm in all of your serious cerebral variety

wait crypto this signal is too strong humans are weak their minds can take that kind of amplitude [Music] disgusting crypto crypto where did you go snack time [Music] so what would you like to upgrade you little ball of unbridled aggression [Music] [Music] i want you to collect any brain stems that may have survived while you're collecting the overloaded brain stems take a moment and extract some fresh brain stems from living humans would you crypto i'm granting you a license for a new weapon the anal probe now portable for more efficient brainstem collection with the multifunctional anal probe attract and collect any extracted brain stems floating about from a safe distance but remember no unlicensed uses read the warning labels good work crypto you just collected an overloaded brain stem only 11 more to go well i know it sounds like a lot but i think it's quite an achievable goal excellent i believe that's all the fresh brain stems i'll be needing at the moment nice you have the right little green restart the cops your weapons [Music] say your prayers come back [Music] attention attention please step away from the payment [Music] move over uh [Music] it was done [Music] did you want a saucer upgrade or something a little more personal [Music] well thank you you're going to investigate the activities of the human scientists i want to establish the connection with the majestic [Music] that special seasoning has succeeded beyond my violence dreams these people are now rabid paranoids wounds incredibly hostile to anyone who's different and as an unexpected side benefit 78 of them are now registering republican crypto there's a frozen treats vehicle on its way here but my analysis shows it's carrying warm blooded humans no no don't shoot this is highly suspicious wait and scan whomever comes out first i know i'm not supposed to eat from the diner or i'll turn into a mindless paranoid drone but that rhubarb pie is calling my name hungry [Music] more non-threatening vehicles full of scientists instead of ice cream scan the scientists once they step foot outside don't they live in their labs the two sexiest words in the english language stocks and bonds ever since i was a small boy in stuttgart i dreamed of drugging the food supply of an entire population now it's my job god i love america the psychotropic compounds inside scheissen turned our lab rats into a pack of paranoid junkies clearly the scientists are responsible for carrying out majestic's population control scheme normally i'd ask you to destroy the scientists but we have a bigger problem using the food outlets to distribute their population control drugs and it seems to be working if every human in this country turns paranoid in hostile it will make life for us very difficult replenish your salsa sheets by training any human being [Music] little [Music] they just took the diner too we gotta set up a line and hold them here well i don't know about you but i'm not sitting around here waiting to get abducted keep your panties on mary i just got a word over the radio there's an army convoy right outside this town with tanks thank god thank majestic silhouette got the army to do something all right for once take some cars and go get em try and stop me if the scientists escape with the formula our whole operation is at risk destroy those vehicles before they leave the peninsula [Music] destroy those incoming missiles crypto don't let that cold chamber on wheels escape destroy it or the scientists destroy our plans for destruction don't let them escape well one thing for certain majestic are far more dangerous to our mission than i am really really dark brown and gave him what do you say [Music] i think you're going to have to land your saucer and capture the atrial foot how does he look like that in those [Music] shoes [Music] what [Music] i have activated hypnoblast follow now you can telepathically turn the humans into mindless [Music] minions [Music] we're under attack [Music] wonder what i'd look like in some other color i hear brown is the new black [Music] what did the other guys notice ah who cares lace feels so comfortable under this suit ah go to hell clattu you think i'm scared of a three-foot space hamster i think you should be now we can do this easy or we can do it hard your choice what do you know about a down furon scout ship oh what sorry lemmy put it in baby talk a flying saucer crashed somewhere or uh captured i don't know what you're talking about of course not what do you know about majestic i know we're gonna kick your little green ass all the way back to mars i'm not these weapons where are you making them how many agents does majestic have how many other towns are you in son of a don't get mad get sadistic i think this calls for the jumbo [Music] probe [Music] ah [Music] then give daddy what he needs [Music] mind control air experiment rockwell movies furon dna area 42 ah prepare to return to the mothership crypto we're going back to rockwell for the last time in a second hold still monkey boy let me choose [Music] [Music] step right up weapons abilities saucers upgrades are us

need to be in santa modesto yesterday don't break for yellow read me loud and clear [Music] sounded like secret agent man was taking orders from the one in goggles want me to blow em up thank you crypto but i have a better idea see the plaza over there by the big screen the humans drive their carbon combustion transports in and then view projected images for the purpose of entertainment makes perfect sense i suggest we beat majestic at their own devious little game ah leave my butt anybody getting flashbacks to boot camp you little freak stop it excellent i've prepared a special film that i'm sure the audience will love be a good boy and pick it up i'm on it [Music] so now sit back and enjoy the following educational presentations [Music] there's nothing you can do to me [Music] only
