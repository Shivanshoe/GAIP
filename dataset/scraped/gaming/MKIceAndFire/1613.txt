damn it i still don't have enough energy i need more to beat fool boom i can no longer stand idly by let this continue the great mr satan world's martial arts champion will put you in your place yeah that's the stuff it's the same this isn't real but man i nailed it i know it's a dream but it sure doesn't feel like one hmm [Music] what in the world is going on the larger majin buu developed a strong friendship with mr satan [Music] that boom must have objected to harming mr satan and prevented the attack [Music] that explains why he spit him out then but to be honest losing that satan fellow in this fight wouldn't really change things indeed [Music] i hate you you bully satan [Music] now's your chance what well do you have enough energy now or what [Music] no no no come on no i'm actually losing power [Music] no way you complete idiot you were supposed to restore your energy not revert back to normal man this sucks this was a lot easier back when i was dead guess it's safe to say super saiyan 3 really drains all your strength when you're alive [Music] it looks like we're completely screwed there's nothing else i can do here supreme kais dende you can see what's going on here can't you can you hear me if you can then answer me already [Music] for what's that now oh yes we can hear you good i need you to go to the new planet namek immediately and gather the dragon balls uh oh but but why do you quit just stammering and just do it we don't have much time [Music] okay [Music] vegeta what are you up to it's a little early for us to use the dragon balls kakarot how many times have you saved earth and its people ah why are you asking me that oh quite a few times i guess [Music] i think it's about time the people of earth save themselves for once [Music] we've been waiting for you today huh oh my you grace us with your presence supreme kai everyone we are fully aware of the situation come let us hurry thank you vegeta we've collected all seven of the dragon balls just like you asked good now hurry up and summon the namekian dragon i've got two wishes for you to make first ask to have the earth return to the way it was [Music] then asked to bring back everybody that's died since the day of the world tournament excluding of course anyone that's evil [Music] those are the two wishes should i make the wishes now what about the third wish the third wish doesn't matter you've got to hurry vegeta about that second wish it'd probably be easier to just bring back everyone killed by boo don't you think if we ask for that bobbity and deborah will be brought back too plus all the people i killed at the world tournament arena wouldn't be brought back oh oh yeah man you really thought this through [Music] we have a problem i just remembered that barunga can only bring back one person from the dead at a time [Music] that is no longer a concern after the incident with frieza i took the liberty of powering up peroga's wiscratic abilities really so we could bring back as many people as we want never mind everything's okay good now make the wishes takarapatopa peroga pupiritoparo [Music] now state your wishes i shall grant any three wishes that you desire paprunga paprito a faraway planet called earth was recently destroyed please bring it back okay consider it dog [Music] your first wish has been granted now then state your second wish uh um how should i phrase this people um please bring back all those killed after the wizard bobbity arrived on no earth accept anyone evil [Music] understood however it will take some time that there's a lot of people to revive right what what's wrong ten day have you made the wishes yet hey now quit your yammering would you this perunga fellow is doing what he can thank you for your patience your second wish has been granted vegeta we did it everyone should be back now look your halo's gone vegeta you're alive now that's great i guess that means you're not a bad guy after all [Music] what the wait a sec wasn't i killed by boo huh what's going on [Music] huh oh i think i get it now you're thinking of having gohan and go tanks join us in the fight no you're going to prepare that attack of yours the spirit bomb a spirit bomb really you're kidding me right who's totally not gonna let me gather energy little by little from people on earth didn't i tell you that the people of earth need to save themselves for once it's not going to be little by little they're going to give every ounce of energy they've got hey supreme kai listen up get me in touch with the people of earth right away leave that to me that's my specialty who's that i know that voice it's king kai bingo you know vegeta i'm quite touched you thought of my technique now then speak not just the earth

bring you all back to life everything should be back to the way it was before and no this is not some kind of dream you're having as i speak right at this very second there's a warrior here fighting majin buu on your behalf [Music] but the truth of the matter is he's run out of energy and can't fight anymore that's why we need your help raise your hands into the air we're going to use your energy
