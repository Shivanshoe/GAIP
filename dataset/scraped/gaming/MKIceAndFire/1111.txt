sir good to hear you're in fine fettle again miss Potts Thanks Friday take care the gunsmith Tony what were you thinking - Tony's are better than one you really should have gotten a second opinion on that yeah well my second opinion was undergoing a brain scan at the time speaking of which I should rest be safe and don't let your worst half torture Friday folks you've got it straight from Morgan Stark Stark Industries has never been stronger yeah Tony Shanghai office headquarters was destroyed but it was insured and nothing was lost that can't be rebuilt sure some people will say my show is a bit one-sided which is why I've agreed to talk to a noted naysayer Daario Agger CEO of Roxxon Energy and frequent critic of Tony Dario what have you got to say oh not much just that if your cousin had stayed in weapons development maybe his Shanghai Tower would have been better protected funny how clean energy can stop a swarm of combat drones well hell Iron Man can and did yes after the tower was destroyed why aren't there a fleet of Iron Men protecting every stark facility because your cousin is an egomaniac who wants to be a special snowflake and doesn't want any competition he's a huge liability for the company's shareholders do you own Starks talk Morgan you should join up with me mounted takeover I'll make you VP after the merger really the thing is I lost my stock in a poker game so I I mean never I would never turn against my family good day sir I said good day what is up with Sunday Friday Oh totally and she is great by the way sweet love the accent what's your point she's not like ass boss let's face it she can't build big guns if she could you wouldn't have called me out of retirement I should be your on board a high well Friday is excellent in the field obviously obvious I mean totally I'm just saying you know think about it boss just show me what you made sure step right up what's all this know your enemy so what you always told me boss this station allows you to look up information on drones we've encountered on the battlefields grab a drone icon pull it out of the virtual workstation of you inspects rotate the 3d mod or read up on the drone statistics and the windows to your left and right when you're done feel free to pull out another drone hologram or put this one back in the table this place stays online 24/7 so drop by anytime you're feeling thirsty for knowledge I'll continue to update the database as we encounter more enemy drones impressive stuff it's why you made me boss ghost really went all in my little drones hardlight custom firmware Shiba getting new names and I respect an artist I have shut down a lot of these ghost calls this a phazon your garden-variety Wraith fathom she's got a theme that zips ahead and Pelt you with rare shot you're repulsors chill my popcorn you got this hey Friday so download ghosts drone names from the research station for your battlefield reports she resurrected them they're hers now do whatever boss but under her coat of paint the chassis still says Stark I designed these for shield jet aerial support they attached to the wing underside before splitting off like Remora on the shark except these were more our killers too shame these Neversoft field use shut us down right when I perfected the recipe well the circumstances suck but hey now you can see what you missed [Music] ghost calls this one the skull the way it charges she definitely wants to bash in mind if fires have hard light shields when it's ready to bounce so you know watch out for that those calls are old hover tanks grave runners gotta say I admire the heart light shields and the heavy anti-air payload those are definitely more missiles than our designs carried probably double standard magazines they'd explode from friction unless you use thermal microfilaments you should have had hunted her for R&D boss yeah well right now she's the one hunting heads ghost that's an extra love into customizing she even tricked out the hover mechanism made it more nimble if she likes to tread lightly a guy with no kids you've got a lot of dad jokes VIP security drones were all the rage in our weapons making heyday I wanted him to seek a neutralize threats but you made him reactive there's security the bear sleeps until it's poet but I'm telling you boss the best defense is a good offense these stole the showroom floor back in a day sleek sports cars of UAVs only its branding when you got style [Music] ghost calls this a grim grim sums up my chances of avoiding them they come out of nowhere use your ears let's stay on your toes when you hear them clicking it's game time why didn't you tell me sir about phony Tony there's no record of him in my database well he was sort of a silent partner a silent partner yeah with all due respect sir I must ask do you trust him he's on a short leash of course no you're right have a look at this sir tell me you found ghosts location still working on it sir but I've programmed additional functionality into this globe to better prepare us for her next move select a location to proceed selecting locations will display a list of relevant missions including ones you've completed nice work Friday I've also programmed several flight courses that should help us test your armors capabilities Friday are you afraid of being outdone by gunsmith hardly sir in stark contrast to his offerings mine are about saving a life namely yours these courses will help to improve your defensive capabilities I've designed flight challenges for Malibu Shanghai as well as a virtual reality course based on an old decommissioned Starck facility flying in VR think it'll work let's find out sir [Music] [Music] okay this works for this challenge I've simulated a former Stark Industries weapons silo I remember this place initiating flight test make us proud sir [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's all coming together [Music] [Music] [Music] we preached keep [Music] nothing too [Music] [Music] [Music] nice job once more [Music] welcome home sir see me when you can what is this another attack thankfully no it's the location of the Helicarrier arrest eeeh director fury would like a word with you Nick wants to see me why does it feel like I'm being haunted the principal's office shield was monitoring the events in Shanghai I believe they have Intel to share I knew Nick would have a good take on our ghost problem shields the best Intelligence Agency on earth and probably off it too but I also knew he'd have questions even after all these years questions about I acquit the weapons vis considering what I was up against the answer felt obvious greetings Ironman almost didn't recognize you in that cool new armor you this hanger wasn't designed for an electron now looks like she'll decided to go with the lowest bidder on this one nice to see they upgraded to my mark 5 turbine engines they've added enhanced shock mounts as well you make me so proud stark resilient clasp repulsor engines twice the horsepower at a quarter the weight [Music] [Music] equipment elevators same ones I installed in avengers headquarters this ship was my last big number before I quit strange to feel proud of what I'll never do again making weapons was misspent talent true just wish Nick would quit asking me for this is resti a tower hailing iron man hail right

moment maybe a quick look around no maybe about it maintenance Bay can I get a number five no tomato don't know who you are but the call box is not a toy really sir [Music] eyes on your screen you look like an obsessed fan sorry I've never what seen a superhero in real life I just I didn't think he'd be so shiny you think they heard me this is shield of course they heard you dispatch you

stalks old girlfriends I thought it's cuz shields gonna arrest you no one appreciates the classics care for a game hey Nick I think I'm already in one you're definitely being played hard light makes these old drones of yours extra hard to kill to me with shield had something like that imagine the possibilities maybe the ghost will sell it to you we don't buy tech from terrorists suppose we could pirate it that would justify the eyepatch why'd you stop selling weapons to me you guys kept firing him at the wrong people firing him at the wrong Tony I got it we're doing just fine that flip bone says otherwise this isn't our smart ass belongs to your opponent what did we recovered it from the rubble of one of your buildings in London I saw one like in Shanghai shield was hoping to scrub some good Intel for its bricked or even turn on Friday still handling analytics she was I called up some extra help reason give that to maybe they'll have better look after you you know what a ghosties in chess a threat more in the mind of the player than on the board aren't your judgment distracts you from what the end shoot it down like a ghost destroyed moment you tell me who wins this game of chicken her drone or Michael a tough call considering I'm in a boat [Music] give me a head count is everyone sickness she's putting us in a cage brothel the Jets Tony guess I don't need to tell you
