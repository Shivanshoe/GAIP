once upon a time in a deep and ancient forest crafty goblins face the truth about the darkness in the big wooden house it had come for the wise princess driving her mad and causing her to attack them when they started asking questions about the princess and the darkness the goblins realized that no one else in the forest wanted to know the truth so they dug and searched and asked hurtful questions learning more about the wise princess than they had ever hoped to [Music] but the search took its toll the darkness was proving too much for sister goblin and yet brother goblin kept diving deeper and deeper until sister goblin finally said enough and that was how the goblins found themselves separated again hurt and confused with so many unanswered questions and too many open wounds alison wake up [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you killed me [Music] foreign [Music] uh [Music] she could only go forward and find a new place for herself in this world where she was no longer truly a princess and a tiara and a beautiful gown but a wand woman alone in a deep and ancient wood [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] you killed me you killed me he's right time to get my [ __ ] together never could bring myself to send these whenever i tried to tell him how much i missed him it felt unfair i guess i'll have to start fresh with these in juno i could use a michael pep talk i never imagined uncle eddie was hiding so many things from me i could do my laundry ugh maybe later good to know i look just as bad as i feel there's not enough concealer in the world to erase the night i had wish i could just book a one-way ticket to the other side of the world how did we go from being so alike to total opposites i gotta think about something else now would be a good time to stop smoking and maybe do a detox for 12. [Music] i miss the slopes the days have gotten so short it's gonna be a long winter eddie looks so young here what i should probably eat something god i feel so weak eddie looked pretty concerned when i came home last night i should have talked to him about what happened but what the hell was i supposed to say i'm glad he never pushed me to change my last name still can't believe eddie never told me he was paying for fireweed that was a good memory even though tyler couldn't come eddie must have been back and forth to juno all the time to these shows before he got stuck here taking care of me don't think eddie's worn this since that terrible blind date two years ago hmm i don't think i know any claire's in delos crossing but i shouldn't be snooping in here i haven't heard him play in a while it just sits there collecting dust a secret keeper in her secret keep maybe there's something in the book of goblins that'll help me figure this out this is personal i haven't heard him play in a while it just sits there collecting dust a secret keeper in her secret keep looks like this is coin operated so something's not right what is this [Music] i always loved this one he doesn't like this kind of attention but he really does so much for the community i need to get all that paperwork together maybe that'll help me focus and clear my head i wish eddie's mom could have taught me how to do this i wish you could just change your mood as easily as a record maybe if i make something for d it'll help calm me down i should have let myself enjoy these trips more here's the file just need my id and pay stubs okay allison how could you do this to me [ __ ] i've got to think about something else focus id and pay stubs hasn't really sunk in yet that tessa sacked me god i needed that money i so don't want to go back to the station not after yesterday must be great to feel like you belong somewhere anywhere ah here's my id this place was never much more than a bachelor pad huh

yourself just grab your pay stubs so you can get the hell out of here what if i just packed a bag and left never looked back i wonder if i'll ever hear from tina again god the world feels so [ __ ] small right now i've got to find a way to get out of my head marianne what's going on with you lately if you need help [Music] come on alison don't start [Music] a secret keeper and her secret keep no way it worked the secret keeper is a traveling woman who buys and sells secrets she stores all these secrets in the clouds because nobody ever looks up when they're searching for hidden things i wish you could just change your mood as easily as a record alison please it's a it's nothing this is nothing i don't feel like listening to anything right now i wish i thought shooting some hoops would help me forget all this i wonder what michael would think about all this would he even get it you swore alison okay focus i'm still missing some things i wish you could just change your mood as easily as a record the paperwork's not down there so many months of snow boots ahead allison help allison please matt hunter i told him i wanted to stop messing with those memories but he wouldn't listen the paperwork's not down there i wish eddie's mom could have taught me how to do this [Music] what's wrong with me [Music] brother sister we look out for each other that's what you said but you don't mean

things to do before i can leave but i'll be there all right hon see you soon get it together alison come on grab the file get dressed and head out or it'd be nice to make a gift for dee god my hands are still shaking i was not in the right headspace to make something last night i should try it again i've got enough time to carve something for dee eddie can't cope with getting rid of any of carol's stuff you should have taken care of yourself first marianne we deserved that this is a totally different life i've been pretty grinchy about christmas since i came here eddie tries so hard tyler and i should bike around the lake when we patch things up i miss you pop eddie's been too busy to fish lately i know he's missing it morning hey allie hey hi guys what are you doing here i uh brought you stuff from the office you're a good worker i think tessa will come around when she's had a chance to clear her head that's nice tom thanks i'm gonna head on inside freezing my butt off out here okay thanks is tyler not around today no he's uh busy out at the old house i see it must be hard to sell the place you grew up in so many memories right oh it's okay we'll get over it i really hope so so tessa told me a little bit about what happened at the cemetery if you're going to lecture me save it she had it coming she went behind marian's back and almost got us killed what she did had terrible consequences but i promise you she was trying to help besides you two didn't say anything she wasn't already thinking she spent years blaming herself well she wasn't the only one involved there was a lot of blame to go around i'm glad you're able to see that it seems like your brother well he's not nearly so forgiving is he he has been pretty harsh especially on eddie but we both got tired of people lying to us for our own good yes of course totally reasonable though i am sorry you're the one taking all the repercussions i heard about the fight with your uncle i really hope your brother appreciates your sacrifices he will i i mean he does i'm sorry but i'm pretty beat oh of course i'll let you rest tell michael there's no need to hurry back okay thanks for stopping by tom bye now take care sorry for abandoning you out there pro tip avoid catching a ride with tom at all cost did he talk about the new spicy chocolate bars yup and exactly what they do to his digestion what's up with him not sure i've ever seen him so eager to help tess has been venting non-stop about your fight he probably needed an excuse to take a break plus a door-to-door is part of campaigning right yeah i guess help yourself to some waffles if you want that's eddie's way of saying i'm worried about you no that's cute but i had a ridiculously huge breakfast so i'm good i don't know about you but i just really need to get out of delos crossing well we're on our way soon right right i don't know i i've just got this feeling it's gonna fall through and and i'm gonna be stuck here forever that's not happening we've got a plan i'm glad you're here michael thanks for coming of course when i heard what happened i knew the bitch's grotto had to go mobile i guess i've got plenty of time to binge the last season of witches of eldum now that i'm unemployed wait to see how they did mabel you're gonna rage quit just like i did i don't know i've got a lot of free time ahead of me alison what's going on tyler and i had a fight last night i was so excited to have him back but what if 10 years was too much and we're too different i don't think so you just need to get to know each other again start with the small [ __ ] figure out what each other's favorite foods are you know and then build up to the big stuff yeah that that makes sense the last few days have been a lot and it's totally okay to be overwhelmed you're gonna figure it all out families are [ __ ] up they're basically fuck-up factories you're right i just need to relax so maybe this will cheer you up i think i found the perfect place check it out it's pretty cool right deposit's a bit high but it's got two large bedrooms and a view of the channel honey you're really going to give up our home to live in this ugly box oh god allison allison look at me you okay i'm just um i need to i just need to sit down it's okay i got you what's going on god everything my anxiety's through the roof i can't eat anything without getting sick and i've been seeing things memories of marianne and me and tyler when we were kids and eddie and [Music] it used to just be stuff i'm pretty sure really happened but [Music] now i see them everywhere shouting every shitty thought i've ever had about myself i don't know how much more of it i can take that's intense i'm sorry has anything like this happened to you before [Music]

i'm ready to face him if you want i could go out there see how he's feeling and if he's ready to talk what do you think yeah maybe that could work i hope he'll talk to you though he's never been the best at opening up to new people you sure yeah of course i don't mind trying if it might patch things up between you two oh [ __ ] i'm gonna be late for my lunch with dee i still need to change and

got so much weight on your shoulders with tyler coming back and your big move you know maybe it's time to ease off some of this some of this other stuff that's clearly stressing you out if you mean marianne i can't i owe it to tyler to see it through do you i don't know why you've always blamed yourself for that it wasn't your fault that's not true uncle i was there i you were 11 years old there was nothing you could do you can't go on letting it haunt you every waking moment look you're not your mother okay what do you mean [Music] i mean something happened to her something bad i don't know what it was but it never left her you can't make that same mistake you've got to tell those ghosts to move on uncle it was me i was the one who had the scissors what what what are you saying she she was threatening tyler [Music] so i stabbed her i killed her i killed my mother [Music] but tyler confessed he he went to fireweed we lied we lied to everyone [Music] oh how how could you let him take the blame it was a mistake i know but we were in shock tyler wanted to take the blame and i let him [Music] we should have told the truth it must have really hurt keeping that aside all these years they pretty much just bottled it up and now it's all i can think about [Music] everywhere i look she's there i can't take it anymore it's not easy to admit something like that it takes a lot of courage allison [Music] i should have seen it so sorry none of this was fair to you too [Music] thank you uncle how are you feeling now any better [Music] relieved actually and really tired ah i was remembering something earlier i don't know if it even really happened the day tyler left for fireweed did sam come by with some of our stuff hmm yeah yeah that's right he did how close were he and marianne i i don't know exactly but he cared about her a lot hurt her death really shook him up he was over at our house a lot fixing things chasing off animals i know you didn't turn up anything about who our biological father was but did you ever think it might have been sam well your mom and him were close so that's a possibility but i never found any proof no i should go talk to him are

man so about last night i don't know what allison said but from my side well i thought we were on the same page but it turns out we weren't hey so don't tell her i told you but last week your sister was almost unbearable she was jumping up and down with excitement at you coming back really you better believe it look the last time you saw each other you were kids just because things have changed doesn't mean you can't work it out i know it's probably my fault i really pushed her last night i just don't get why she always has to run away from everything you blame her avoiding the problem doesn't make it go away she's so fixated on selling the house it's like she's trying to bury the past all of it even the good parts look i'm not picking sides here okay but she's been murder house girl ever since it happened now she's got a chance to put it behind her and start fresh [ __ ] i'd be pretty eager too i guess i didn't really think about that i've been so focused on my own [ __ ] it's been hard you know figuring out how to live out here you mean outside of fireweed yeah when i first got there all i could think about was getting out it felt like a cage but after a while it started to feel more like a shell i figured out who i was in there but now i've gotta work out how to be that person out here well if it makes you feel any better none of us really know what we're doing like [ __ ] may look bleak now but your sister is never gonna give up on you and you can lean on me too if you want just be careful okay got a bad left shoulder i'll keep it in mind thanks for listening don't mention it don't you say anything i got easy oh whoa bam three out of three well played i got nothing that was clean i'm a little disappointed can i ask you something kind of weird and maybe hard to answer weird and kind of hard to answer my jam what's up how'd you know you were ready to trust anyone enough to put yourself out there okay yeah that that is the hard question told you there's not really two ways about it you got to be willing to take a hit look i stopped listening to the entire indie folk genre just because i was dumped at a show once but i put myself back out there just like everyone who's ever gotten their heart stomped on because when you meet someone who really sees you you don't have to pretend anymore [Music] but it's pretty risky right i mean yeah but you only get so much time so when i see a chance i take it even if he might shoot me down have to be kind of dumb to shoot you down wouldn't he well now i'm not judging anyone but i am you know kind of a catch was that a pun some people are worth making puns for don't you think [Music] i think we're in total agreement here yeah yeah i get this feeling like i could say or do anything with you and it'd be cool i feel safe you are because your sister would kill me if i did you dirty uh yeah she would so doesn't look like you're catching anything with that you want me to show you how it's done go for it hey you're missing the show [Music] [Music] so [Music] you okay [Music] so uh yeah yes one way to put it hey ali i think i'll just show myself out okay uh call me later you know i will sorry for interrupting no it's totally fine we're done anyway catch anything mostly ice but yeah tyler i'm sorry for freaking out yesterday all of this has just been really hard on me don't apologize i was being an [ __ ] we should have never pushed you that hard come here god why did i miss you so much it's only been a day i've been told i have that effect on people you dumb dumb okay so i need to show you something what you're kind of weirding me out can we sit down for a second so what is it i was just at sam's he's not our father how do you know i asked him point blank i'm not surprised burning down the barn didn't really seem like a sam move yeah i guess it was silly to suspect him in the first place he'd never hurt mary ann's kids there's something else look at this this was taken in 1992 when marianne first moved to delos crossing see that ladder sam told me the barn has a loft he helped her build it apparently she never told anyone about it and it's still there as far as he knows yeah what do you think should we give it a shot we've come this far and a hidden loft that's got secret [ __ ] written all over it let's go uh what a mess that's not gonna help us get this house sold yeah we got our deadbeat dead thank for that so obviously the ladder's gone but what about that handle is it still here somewhere what do you think is up there i don't know i'm trying not to speculate my brain was going to some real dark places don't worry whatever's up there i'll protect you we'll see how chivalrous you feel when you've got bats in that perfectly quaffed hair the handle should be behind this ah there it is it's opening up the secret keeper always did store all the best secrets in the clouds yup come on let's find a way to climb up there can you see anything nope [Music] nada [Music] here found a switch holy [ __ ] well that shaved a few years off my life wow [Music] it's her story look she left us something it's got a combination lock with letters do you think she hid the code somewhere in all this knowing mary anne probably well you want to do this yeah let's start here recognize this yeah it's from the story where the goblins trick the mad hunter it looks like it but it's different right can you check the book [Music] okay spot the differences [Music] it moves oh some of these parts are buttons wait huh no goblins actually i'm not sure the princess is running away from the mad hunter who was sent by the gold lady according to the story do you think the gold lady could have been marianne's mom i mean she always used to say she moved to the end of the world to get away from her family huh yeah you're right she ran away just like the princess is here it's not the same title so i guess that counts as a difference huh a pink flower was that never mind that's nothing the mad hunter still has two hands here so this was either before the gold lady cut off his other one or after he earned it back which either makes it before most of the stories or after yeah at some point when she was running away from whatever the hell the mad hunter meant to marianne figured anything out yet no still figuring it out why do you think she added that castle in the background see the color of the flag it could be her mother that's it whoa what's in there pictures letters have you ever seen any of these all the pictures of marianne i've ever seen were the ones hanging on the walls oh poor thing why would she keep an old drawing of a pet in here the gold lady that was definitely her mom so did marianne grow up kinda rich maybe would have been nice to have some of that the gold lady is the wise princess's cruel mother who sent the mad hunter to drive the girl back to the palace wow i don't think i've ever seen a picture of her that young i think that's her mom in the background could this guy have been any more cryptic did you know she studied engineering no but it looks like she changed her major to visual arts i don't think she actually got it changed the paper's not signed and it's all wrinkled like someone tried to throw it away you think the guy with her is brent from the letter i would guess so oh or thing i can't believe she was a ballet dancer marianne and a good one too god that's so not her tyler see that little light i think we need to solve this one next there's the gold lady again she's all over the board there was a figure of her in that stash by the mad hunter painting right oh yeah so maybe all of this is related to what we found in there so marianne's mom forced her to do all this that checks out she looks like she's in pain and the gold lady is watching her so closely hey i can move the piece next to the gold lady all these pictures they look like images from marianne's life before delos don't they well some of them do anyway maybe that's it then we need to figure out which ones are real is the gold lady setting the animals free judging from the broomstick i'd say she's getting rid of them not setting them free the princess dancing playing violin spinning wool i guess this is stuff she did for fun notice how unhappy she looks in all these pictures i don't think she was having any fun the wise princess looks like she's trying to run away and she's being watched by the gold lady hmm huh what's the gold lady doing whispering something into someone's ear behind the princess's back it seems like the gold lady's kind of stabbing the princess in the back and all these right is that it it's opening what's in there this time wow she worked for a watchmaker in juneau before she moved to delos no wonder she was so handy wow she oh so that's how she found the house is that carol yeah and sam look at him he's so young and happy salmonberry park huh is that some kind of commune looks like it so weird to imagine her living in a community like that with you know other people the weirdest part is how they all seem to love her where was prom queen marianne when the whole town was turning on us her father what the hell marianne was pregnant in 1992 before she even got here before us do we have a long-lost sibling out there somewhere it's possible but she could have given it up or miscarried who knows yeah you're right [Music] do you think we could track down her father you mean the grandfather she never told us about i don't think i want to you're not at all excited about having more family you saw the letter i don't think we want any part of that fine let's keep digging why are these pictures from the book of goblins here i don't know we'll get to those later let's finish this one okay why don't we solve this one first what's this hmm some sort of map what's that plant thing on top oh those are definitely salmonberry flowers hey that degree in outdoor studies is paying off this looks like a dinner party with the old bear and the very old beaver some sort of clock this is the princess's house that's the gold lady thing it seems like it's not doing anything maybe it's broken back in your pond big frog we'll let the mangy muskrat have his rock back the ice king goes in the forest obviously there you go stalwart moose [Music] gold lady sees locked up in her castle here the secret keeper hiding secrets in the clouds moon hacks got to be imprisoned in her lake the mad hunter always on the princess's trail [Music] that's the pious pelican spot crafty goblins go here what's that plant thing on top oh those are some sort of clock this looks like a dinner party with the old this is the princesses come on this is the princess's house this looks like a dinner party with the old bear and the very old beaver yes what's in there another letter the princess's laws is this from the book of goblins not that i know of well sure looks like it could be and that was how the princess lost her most precious treasure and her title that was the story she read us that night god that makes sense now yeah she got pregnant and she ran away to start a new life and then she made her way to delos crossing where she was finally happy but then the baby died i can't even imagine how she must have felt she left everything behind built a whole new life for him and then he was just gone i guess having us helps her move on but when it looked like we were going to be taken away she snapped she just couldn't lose any more children it really wasn't anything we did i don't know what i'm supposed to do with all this i don't either but all i wanted was to understand what happened to her and now i do yeah but we still haven't seen what's in that chest okay so how do we open it the princess lost her most precious treasure that's why it all happened i still can't wrap my head around it all right should be easy enough why don't we just break this open there's a crowbar right downstairs what no you don't want to try and figure out what all this means i'm so done with her riddles yes wow did it just get darker in here a baby blanket ollie she she noticed i was her son why does she have a photo of that tree locked in here is that leo ronan why didn't she tell us about him why didn't she tell us any of this i mean it's [ __ ] terrible that's why ally did we do the right thing opening this we did it's better we know what happened even even if it's hard and there's one more thing we need to see are you sure yes [Music] come on let's go to the dock it's time to finish this the crafty goblins loot that's from the princess and the two thieves i drew the original and i distinctly remember drawing that cake which is arguably the best part of that illustration all right picasso then you probably remember what the goblins stole in that story huh maybe they took some of the princess's fruit i'm pretty sure they stole some eggs did they steal candy actually i'm not sure some flour for the cake make maybe wait what if they took some spoons that's it i always wondered where that drawing went she said it was her favorite and then one day just disappeared hey now that we're done with the important stuff maybe we can take a crack at these the very old beavers repair list that's the story where the princess's house gets damaged by a storm and the animals help her fix it yeah what did they do to fix it again huh she fixed the roof shingles she slapped the post with maybe not wait she fixed the blanks though all right damn that must have been rough on eddie yeah he um he doesn't really like to talk about her the crafty goblins good deeds of course the goblins had to help out the creatures of the forest to pay off their debt to the pelican well what did they do no i don't really remember they gave the stalwart moose a good scratch on the back he broke open the beehive for the bear they hugged the princess when she was crying nailed it our lives would have been so different if their friendship hadn't gone to [ __ ] the old bears gifts for the princess some roses maybe or not the old bear's gifts for the princess i'm totally blanking on that story what did he give her again why don't we open up the book and check some honey actually i'm not sure some roses maybe wait huh fresh-caught salmon actually i'm not sure huh fresh-cut salmon a newly bloomed a handful of right berries nice man he had it bad just couldn't let go you really want to go you sure we've seen everything either way i'm ready for this to be over me too what are we waiting for i want to know who is here that night [Music] let's try and remember who marianne was arguing with [Music] [Applause] [Music] almost [Music] tom tom vecchi is our father of course it had to be him tessa knew didn't she yeah she she must have that's what she didn't want to tell us god marianne and tom i know what should we do now yeah call him out here and make him tell us what was going on and if he won't we know his secret he will tom it's allison we need to talk we know it was you [Music] let me take the lead on this i know him better sure whatever as long as we get answers [Music] kids listen you're our father yes you knew how bad it got out here how little we had why didn't you help marianne mean all the money she wanted we didn't have anything to spare well that winter was rough on everyone and you would have starved out here if not for all the free food we gave you don't act like you had anything to do with that that was all tessa that's a cruel presumption young man [Music] maybe it was tess's idea initially but i supported it and your mother was happy to live off our handouts [Music] you were here that night you saw marianne and tyler why didn't you help i know it wasn't my best moment but she threatened my life so you just decided to let her drown i didn't decide anything everything happened so fast i panicked and by the time i got to town brown was already on his way out there was nothing else i could do you tried to burn down our barn and knocked tyler unconscious i never meant to hurt anybody you weren't supposed to be home doesn't excuse the fact that you didn't even stop to help what do you want me to say i panicked i was terrified that this whole thing was gonna blow up in my face i had to do something hey you hearing me yep sorry i'm trying really hard to keep myself from punching him in the face does he really expect us to believe there wasn't anything else he could have done that night i don't know ellie i'd rather not think about it he's not even the least bit sorry for what he did he could have seriously hurt you yeah he's just a [ __ ] coward so what do we do now we tell him he's gotta fix the mess he made me one way or another you failed us tom you need to make it right i'll do whatever you want as long as none of this gets out excuse me you want me to pay for my mistakes fine but please tessa can't know this would kill her tessa already knows tom no that's that's impossible it never occurred to you the reason tessa cut marianne off was you i but she she never said anything oh lord you should try talking to your wife maybe if you had we wouldn't be in this situation [Music] and maybe marianne wouldn't be dead oh come on you of all people should appreciate how troubled marianne was she was unhinged something like this would have happened sooner or later that was convenient for you huh you preyed on her because she was vulnerable and you knew you could always blame it on crazy marianne ronan if you got caught it was nothing like that nothing at all your mother was a very pretty woman and she'd been so many places and done so many things the way i always thought i would have i got caught up love made me a fool look i made mistakes but this will not go any further than the three of us why we know tessa knows marianne's dead there's no point in hiding it anymore [Music] he's afraid it'll tank his campaign am i wrong jesus tom i've kept your secret all these years i don't want to go spelling it but i will if i have to what yeah your little story about self-defense i've never told anyone how marianne really died that night i came out here because i was worried about your mother [Music] this is [Music] [Music] man hunter [Music] please [Music] oh [Music] no no way you're a [ __ ] liar i saw what i saw you're manipulating us just like you manipulated her tyler you're not listening to this are you be smart about this alison are you sure you want this to get out you've got way more here to lose than he does his name will be i'll be clear but you you'll be a killer what will your uncle say and michael hmm well the whole town might turn on you don't touch her you know i'm right just get out of here tom tyler and i need to talk alone just please think twice before making any rash decisions there are a whole lot of lives at stake here leave us the [ __ ] alone and never come back [Music] allie you okay he didn't let that [ __ ] get to you did you did you what if he's right i've been having all these nightmares about that night and they were a lot like how tom said and now when i try to remember that's all i can see he's trying to mess with your head and you're letting it work no it's more than that ever since we started digging i i haven't been able to shake this feeling like something's off something's off because he put this in your head don't let him get away with it he might not be lying we we keep getting things mixed up we remember totally different versions of the past those are just details this isn't that she was going to kill me i'm not so sure anymore tyler [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] she had a gun pointed at me she chased me she said she was going to kill me she threatened tom with those exact same words with the same gun on the same pier the thing you said to eddie the other day got thrown back at me don't you think it's possible that happened here too i guess it's possible [ __ ] i i don't know and we're never gonna know the truth are we because the second you walk away from something that's it yeah i guess at this point you just have to decide what you believe me yeah you need to start dealing ally and that means coming to terms with whatever version of the past feels the most true to you no more running whatever you choose you gotta live with it okay i'm not gonna hurt you [Music] i'm going to [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh please no don't do this [Music] this isn't what [Music] she was going to kill herself just herself you interrupted her and wait we got confused are you sure yes that addict tyler that was meant for us it was our way of of explaining what she was going through i made a horrible mistake hey hey it's okay i'm here [Music] uh [Music] hey peep what i just found downstairs what do you think a little aged well or just count bad where are you at right now i just keep hearing her say she wasn't going to hurt you over and over we were kids we freaked out you weren't equipped to deal with that [ __ ] she was just talking to you and i i killed her stop i don't want to use our voice again ever what seriously i don't know but i want to stop feeling like this and i think we'll be better off without it this morning i kept getting these horrible visions of you and marianne and eddie visions like our memories yeah but different it was all my worst thoughts brought to life you were in my bedroom saying i abandoned you eddie called me a snake i'm sorry i should have been there for you it's okay i was the one who walked out i just i can't let that happen again i i don't think it will something's been pushing us to find answers and now we have them maybe i'm wrong and if it stays bad we can stop but i really want to keep what makes us us [Music] the mad hunter was forced to remain below the lake with the moon but she did not kill him because even reduced to just one hand he was too useful a servant lo he plotted [Music] [Music] and that is the story of how the crafty goblins rescued the wise princess from the mad [Music] hunter [Music] so uh one last look i'm good to go [Music] hey it's me hey me house is empty i'm getting ready to head out so last chance is there anything you want me to do while i'm in town listen ty you're
