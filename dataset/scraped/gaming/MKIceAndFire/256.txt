underutilized [Music] okay i'm done playing with the snow monkeys is that really what we're calling them hey they're the ones who keep yelling when they go see sounds like we haven't seen the last of them maybe hellbender will want to add some of those wendigo to her army assuming they don't hold a grudge hey they started so much for not holding a grudge oh what do you think well they still just tried to communicate [Music] well let's make sure we don't end up on the menu [Music] its pitiful existence has ended [Music] [Music] guys huddle up [Music] what a bunch of losers me and groot we win

knows what he means [Music] all right heads up i'm gonna drop something down for you guys that'll work you think those creatures were using this ship for shelter scrub they're dead you say finn thank fume is a foe unlike any one could imagine i mean he's basically a dragon from the fairy tales on earth ridiculous this is not some terran tale of fairies he's a great reptilian beast gifted with flight and a rage so hot he breathes fire right my mistake here give me a hand we should be ready we don't know the source of that smoke maybe it's just a nice ground fire and some cigar and spirits uncharacteristically optimistic for you no doubt it's something that'll try to kill us this place is like a fun house of razor blades great speech but i'm not worried we face meteors poison zit cats and abominable snowmen when to go right and we beat them all i'd back this team against anything including fenfang right except not because we're not killing him whatever it is it smells bodies it smells of bodies jeez was all this food undoubtedly up ahead looks like there's a survivor who goes there go ahead she has no head i believe that repulsive tentacle orb is her head and i can hear you with it are you the only survivor clearly not who are you meat sacks we're here for film forget what i said yeah i'm the only survivor or will be i take it you know where we can find him sure digesting my men back at his roost big eyes obelisk sticking out of the caldera's frozen sea don't worry we'll take care of boom sure you will taryn just don't come running back here when he chases

safe right now when is it ever seriously maybe you should just come with us i've been embarrassed enough today without taking help from a stranger i can look after myself well if you hear people talking about a promise with a matriarch just steer clear i'll keep that in mind sorry about your men dead men collect no paychecks speaking of aren't you the mad titan's daughter what of it relax i'm not looking for trouble there was a time i'd have taken you in for the bounty there was a time i'd have killed you for trying yeah seems we've both got bigger problems right now seems like hey we're lucky we dragged our kids we'd been here we would have been torched like the rest of these steps perhaps had we arrived sooner we would have been able to save them are you kidding look at this place they clearly got caught with their pants down it was over before it started big ice thingy on the frozen sea eh you said it buddy sure is a long way down finders keepers hey you better not be taking anything valuable you little weasel relax everything good has already been birthed to a crisp except this um any of you corpses mind if i help myself to your stuff no well thank you may as well put it to good use right they ain't using it one fine tech upgrade hot and fresh here's hoping we do better against boom than this one another hunt marker this one is unclaimed no doubt it belonged to one of these corpses yes they never got the chance to plan it i've appropriated it for our own use to herald our bravery this day shall mark our ultimate conquest or our glorious defeat who may be bad news but he's nothing compared to the fight that comes next it shall mark our penultimate conquest one conquest at a time [Music] all right people let's catch us a dragon yes we grow ever closer to our great destiny you're awful chipper considering fume obliterated that camp like it was nothing we are not nothing i'm with drax no mountain too high no valley too low literally in the case of this place [Music] [Music] incredibly dangerous it's actually kind of funny our death well that takes care of the getting down part i don't even want to think about how we're going to get back up or how we're going to get boom up there look on the bright side we may be dead nonsense we shall be victorious and our conquest will fill us with the vigorous tent back on earth people would use dog sleds a whole line of huskies pulling a sled across the ice that was actually thinking of the wendigo and fume is the sled that's the craziest idea i've ever heard yeah i love it [Music] [Music] so what was up with all bubble head seemed like an augment to me some sort of amorphous biochemical appendage imagine what she could do with all those hands don't be gross what i didn't mean it like that oh i didn't think it could get any colder you know it's days like these i'm glad i installed seat warmers in the milano [Music] up ahead there's the ice obelisk this must be it the frozen sea this is the perfect spot here we will challenge the great beast didn't find boom come and face your death what are you doing we can't get the drop on him if he knows we're here also we're not killing him remember

behind that let's find out [Music] [Music] [Music] how are we supposed to capture that by beating him into submissions [Music] all this trouble [Music] i don't [Music] you are of ice peter quill you see pain of ice isn't such a bad nickname [Music] he is [Music] his opinion does not appear to have improved nice work peter that's so hot now are you true [Music] figures it out [Music] what are we waiting for these blades are thirsty mine too i want to run in there right now and do some serious damage peter this bloodlust you feel it makes things unreal and it'll get you killed if you don't

of us together [Music] lord [Music] the final harvest begins dead worlds screaming across space we must go now someone needs to take a stand against the church you could really use some help you pay one debt then create another no though i can kind of see enough [Music] i will gather my foxes all right let's go [Music] yes the noble lady hellbender shall fight alongside us this day after we bested foom formed the invincible we found draxes peanut butter and chocolate we are on the path to destiny my friends i still can't believe we did it we did do it right we sure did and we got mantis back but we lost warlock and we'll need him to exercise the magus once we shut down that ritual so we bust them out of cult prison i've done jailbreaks before we all have we still tracking them oh yeah that thing ain't coming out easy good then all we got to do is get there on time and hope lady hellbender does too oh she will i'm certain of it all right let's gear up people tie up any loose ends take a pee if you have to because we're not stopping again hey quill let me borrow your tunes why i need to focus come on do not drop that mantis what happened on the mantis after we left last time we saw you things looked dire it's a long story we can talk about it after you do like star guy says and use the bathroom i don't need to all right but don't say i didn't warn you in church grandpa makes you do faith crunches wait raker's gonna do what it depends but at some point someone says my name and then there's a little bit of p great i did not want to know that oh yeah a little fuzzy maybe the little bit of p is you nope [Music] oh she says thank you for getting rid of aiden warsaw apparently she likes me better uh adam warlock yeah him she thinks i'm bleets it translates weird mantis i've got so many questions i know and i've got so many answers like c is the means of production or it's not just a rash or yes it is gluten-free not the answers i was looking for but i'm wondering about the questions what questions how did you convince lady hellbender to meet us on mac lew 4 you weren't even with us when we decided to go actually convincing her to go after you wasn't hard at all but convincing her to hear you out that was tough i had to get all creepy mystical and spook her with warnings about what would happen otherwise you told her about the end of the universe and she believed you oh no not at first but when i brought up all her precious monsters dying she came around couldn't take that chance with her babies you know happened on lamentis after we left he said some people would survive but that doesn't fare super well for the others many of the elders died they didn't resist the invasion but they would never accept the promise it isn't their way i'm sorry don't be their sacrifice bought time for me and the kotati to hide most of the others they will emerge when the galaxy is saved so you're able to hide them in the caves hope you told them to stay away from the fog well i'm glad to have you with us oh good because you're not always glad why not well sometimes i'm your ex-wife what i think she's pulling your leg quill it only ever happens at one time but it's so funny hey rocket working on something i'm always working on something you're not listening to my tunes no you turned the music on then can i have my player back why you already got music playing right so you don't need the player to focus anymore you might turn it off yeah but what part of i need to focus don't you get quilt what do you need to focus on so badly anyway something that might give us a way to get through the armada around sacrosanct just in case lady skull suit doesn't show up in time nice what is it you'll see let's see what we can make with the parts you've got just browsing huh all right let's go good thinking get the watering sorted out before we go [Laughter] he looks so sad swishing around in his robes what what what'd he say groot wants to water the grand unifier oh right the soaked unified the grand humidity [Music] now that's a knife it is indeed a spectacular blade tracks hey i was just is no need to explain yourself peter quill unlike the rodent i do not mind when others are curious about my things it's a really cool blade with an equally impressive history you recognize it it belonged to zatar the unfinished a great catastrone warrior king who led the first pilgrimage to maklou iv wait so you're saying this is basically excalibur i am unfamiliar with such a weapon it's a mythical sore belonging to a famous earth king and yes i suppose you could say this is the excalibur of my people it is a symbol of a king and the great hunt he inspired for those seeking to regain a place in ultath so this great hunt thing seems like a bigger deal than i thought did we mess it up for everyone by capturing finn fang fume what do you mean well uh its purpose is to regain entry into katathi in heaven and stuff and now there's no foom to you know send you there oh peter quill there are many paths to ultath the pilgrimage to mock the four is but one of them right when thanos murdered my family and destroyed my village twice i chose the path of revenge first i raised a small army of catatium warriors even outnumbered we cut our way through the chitauri line and challenged thanos himself wait wait wait on cath you faced thanos twice during the galactic war yes but i was not strong enough the first time strong enough to survive thanos allowed me and a few others to live to set an example defeated and humiliated the surviving members of my squad chose to make the pilgrimage to maklou iv but i could not i continued to walk the path of revenge until you you helped me put the ghosts of hovat and kamaria to rest to be fair i had a lot of help and yet you have given me a new purpose peter quill seems my destiny was not in the mountains of kakaranthara after all but here on this ship with you zitar sounds like a hero of yours king's atar and he is every catastrone warrior knows the story of his pilgrimage to machu 4 why is he called zatar the unfinished then in the history of my people a rival king attacked zatar's lands easily overwhelming his forces captured and broken zatar challenged the rival king to a fight to the death but the conqueror refused banishing him to a life of dishonor and disgrace instead so king's attar went to machu 4 to challenge the mighty finn fang foom and change his destiny well that's depressing how is it depressing because he obviously failed finn fang foom still alive and kicking mostly he did not fail peter quill king's attar did not vanquish finn fang foom it is true but he did redeem himself in the eyes of his people by dying not exactly a happy ending by never giving up a warrior only truly dies when he stops living king zatar proved that our stories the records of who we were in life are ours to shape he could have died a coward who lost his place in ultath or he could do what i and many of my people believe he did change the ending of his story well i'm glad you're here with us now i can't guarantee where our path will take us but hopefully somewhere with lots of money and comfort i do not have a doubt in my heart peter quill that we will have moderate success i'll accept moderate nice move there drax peter quill spar with me uh i i think i'll pass drax i uh don't want to get tired before the real fight but this is the warm-up not a bad idea we don't know what's gonna happen when we get out of hyperspace what if we get ambushed that's what guns are for guns i think i preferred when you two didn't get along bet those moves are really going to impress lady hellbender i do not need to impress her besting the great finn fang fume is proof enough of my combat skills yeah that would do it i'm not sure lady hellbender was really impressed with how we handled that fight you know since we accidentally killed that dragon before groot revived him would you not be impressed by a man staying a dragon maybe if he does it without my help gamora sanubery wish to practice hand-to-hand techniques it's still weird when you say my actual name i am getting used to it we've come a long way since murderous sorceress wasn't it what you were calling me back on my first mission with the team yes at first i believed you had bewitched peter quill i could see no other reason he would hire an assassin for a protection contract really no other reason than magic you could also have seduced him he lacks mental fortitude in the presence of women true if i remember right he spent most of that protection contract flirting with the waitresses raker's going down this time gamora i promise you and i promise you i'm getting nikki out of there no matter what we will get her out together together no not like that what is it your angle of attack was off you have to go at it from the inside out especially since raker's body armor has inward folds ah a tactically sound observation i noticed it made a big difference when i had to assassinate a congregation of badoon dignitaries they were wearing so many layers all right not stopping again did i forget something you do in most realities here goes nothing yeah no scratch that here go the guardians of the galaxy i'm gonna barf [Music] and we're back deja vu it just me or that fleet looks twice as big now wrong it's at least thrice as big that's the biggest i've ever seen it what now kill the lights kill the engines and wait for lady hellbender to show up we're sure she's coming right she is a woman of honor a queen she promised to gather her forces and how long is that going to take too long no we can't be too late we got to save the galaxy and nikki one way or another we need to get in there and shut down that ritual we can't take on a fleet that big little fizzy rocky what are you doing man we need to get into sacrosanct to disrupt the ritual right we all know we get killed out here so i'm gonna make a really loud distraction my tunes yeah i rigged it to blast your scuddy music across all channels while the church is out looking for the source we cut the engines and we flow silently right past them to board the sacrosanct smart seriously fine but we're getting it back as soon as we win now get back in here [Music] all right let's find a place to park look at those animals our deception is working sounds so surprised we are so gonna get my music back once this is all done sorry quill chances are they're gonna blast at the pieces once they pin it down let's make sure the sacrifice counts can we not call it that [Music] [Music] mark [Music] why are we whispering anyways i know they're out there but they can't hear us through the ship's hall yeah you're still whispering because i don't want to be the one to flark it up if they can hear through it but they can't certainly a fake what orgoth's breath whoa yes lady hellbender has arrived guardians of the galaxy stop hiding the monster lords of satnav 9 hunger for battle we're not hiding we are sneaking because we need to get into sacrosanct alive then we will slaughter as many as we can out here while you fight your way in eat my children crack open their shells and feast upon the sweet meats inside [Music] this is so metal all right people let's take advantage of the nice lady's murdering spree we're busting into sacrosanct from that landing base our way in there's still a lot of pain between here and there maybe we can blow faster if you get us killed quilt i'm gonna kill you hurry up peter the real fun is gonna be inside getting us in there as fast as i can crap that's a lot of turrets kill them or dodge them we gotta get through there [Music] right she's fighting with us not against us mantis you sure you could fly her yes sometimes hang on maybe you should two arms the enemy approaches [Music] you
