mongols to survive you should have fought back and you should have run away like you always do she risked her life to save you do yourself a favor my lord keep away from that one ichi we can protect you from alton just tell me where to find him no one knows where he is not even his men but if you really want his attention tell me find his most valued allies the japanese slavers who do his bidding

them to this i will kill them where they sleep without being seen show all time that no one is beyond the reach of the ghost the mongols won't sleep for a week do it gin if it goes wrong in there

yunna without being seen uh uh tell me they suffered not as much as they deserved but all of otsuna will know what became of them all the horrible things they did for years and i knew i never did anything you can do something now it's time we sent alternate message written in blood and covered in flies let's draw the mongols out send our message i want to watch we'll hide in the tall grass i'll get their attention [Music] [Music] oh look at them running like scared dogs elton will hear this but it won't be enough all the slaves in that bomb came from one man the black wolf then we'll hunt him down and bury another one of altan's friends i'll find the plaque along the coast near his old hunting grounds look for me there [Music] [Music] wow here ah [Music] people look to sum rifle guidance to keep them safe and act with honor on and off the battlefield i can't forget that good horse let's go [Music] [Music] what is it a child still stained in blood the black wolf enslaves children yes then he sells them to the mamushi brothers where is he this comes down this path but it's crawling with mongol gods and they will die with him i need to be the one to kill the black wolf i had a chance a long time ago that i i couldn't i can help you we'll attack head-on let him know we're coming i want him to feel helpless paralyzed he will and by the time we're finished a ton will feel the same this way mongol if he sees us he'll warn the others leave it to me let's go you know this place well i thought i came here after we left i thought it was a refuge i was wrong send your best warriors yes [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] huh the coward likely fled he can't get away wait that mongol ship offshore he may be inside where is he mongol screams will draw him out uh whatever you think i've done autumn forced me you enslaved children no you've done it for 20 years you held me and tucker captive sold us to the mamushi slave farm tucker he was my favorite but the way i remember it you brought him to me i didn't know you know he's yours are you all right let's get off this boat burn it alton will see this and nowhere coming he'll be forced to act what the black wolf said where's the truth what do you mean i met him when we came to otsuna he offered me food and a place to stay i asked if i could bring my brother he got us drunk and then [Music] tucker doesn't remember but i do [Music] i was frozen i could have killed him save tucker i was too scared it's not your fault because of you you'll never hurt another child i need some time i'm going back to the inn i'll see you there foreign [Music] okay okay uh what happened got our message this was his answer he said to meet him at a camp near the kushi border he'll pay for this we will bring him to justice you've brought nothing but death it is our duty to exact revenge we'll take it from malta die trying that's the duty of a samurai yuna's just a thief and thieves have no honor we'll make this right i swear your promises are just like you worthless [Music] let's get the horses [Music] you know we're riding into a trap i know but i owe it to ichi our focus has to be our tongue whatever happens between you and her they can't get in the way you don't understand ichi was a slave at the mamushi farm it's where we met she looked out for me and taka shielded us from the worst she's the reason we escaped she chose to do that you don't know her anything that's not all of it we swore to get out of that place together one moment we were all running the next ichi was screaming and i kept running i abandoned her i owe her my life you were right to run i saw what kind of men those brothers were if you tried to fight them they would have killed you is running part of the samurai court you were children sometimes running is the only way to survive what's done is in the past you have to let go of your guilt it will only get in the way when we face our time i don't let anything get in my way [Music] [Music] uh oh [Music] um this is it be careful we don't know how many men alton wrote with where the bastards hiding stand and fight uh ugh huh [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh is okay huh i can cut down your men all day it's him with another pack of dogs face judgment for your crimes you cannot judge me you murdered your own people the mamushi brothers and the black wolf are traitors is that your excuse your reason to become the ghost and kill no wonder the straw had ryozo turned on you enough it's time to finish this [Music] [Music] foreign and yet you despise others for doing the same [Music] you kill in service of yourself no more lies alton i know what you are [Music] [Music] but our people know what you did to the others now they're afraid the ghost will come for them next good people have nothing to fear from me what do you believe eg are we monsters think you did what you had to goodbye yuna don't let what ichi said bother you i don't want our own people afraid of me you can't expect everyone to understand what you're doing or why no but i wonder if i've crossed the line if we have we are on the right side of it [Music] um hey come see what i can make for you my lord worthy of a samurai an excellent choice that's all i can give you right now i'm sorry i need more for that farewell i look forward jin you made it why are these people outside the town walls the mongols have surrounded yarikawa no one can get in recruiting lord shimla's old rivals was never going to be easy but now now they need allies too think about it we help them drive off the mongols and they help us i need their word before i fight for them and we can't even get into the city yes we can there's a hidden entrance from when we were children even if it's still there we can't reach it it's worth a try i know a place we can scout for a way around the mongol siege [Music] you
