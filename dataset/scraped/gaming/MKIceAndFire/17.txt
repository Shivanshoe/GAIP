[ __ ] of course so wait what happened to you right right okay so like i was saying okay i heard abby screaming so i came running like as fast as i could from the lake yeah and then then out of nowhere i stepped into this like i don't know like a like a booby trap like some sort of hunter's trap the goddamn thing snared my leg hoisted me halfway into the trees so i'm hanging there half naked and then this guy with like a [ __ ] machete comes right up to me looks me right in the [ __ ] eyes but i thought that guy lesson booked it right the [ __ ] out of there we gotta get nick and abby back to the lodge like right now uh hard agree also why are you covered in what i hope is strawberry jelly oh yeah no um i'm pretty sure it's blood it was this guy with like um he like a bottle thing

girlfriend's life [ __ ] yeah i don't think she's your girlfriend dude what get the [ __ ] [ __ ] ah [ __ ] stop we're in a real mess here guys you're acting like pricks both of you jacob we're keeping this nick and abby are injured we need protection there's someone around here ryan sorry this is [ __ ] make sure she's safe if she's on the island she's definitely fine and what risk another run-in with captain deliverance no thanks okay there's probably another boat by the zip line either way i can make it to the island from there we need to get back to the lodge try to get help how nick can't walk properly yeah i have an idea okay let's see what tonight brings okay here's a riddle for you what's got two thumbs and is suddenly riding solo on a freaky island in the dark this fool well one thumb one available thumb okay and it was here on the strange uninhabited island that this brave young soul found herself okay full disclosure i've suddenly found myself on a a strange tiny little island all alone with nothing to do but show you guys around so there's a tree house over there i'm gonna go and see if i can't dish out some of that sweet sweet panoramic goodness because here's the thing not that i want to go back because i don't but even if i did i can't because then i'd look like the super needy one when he was the one who who stormed off in the first place god you know what sorry i'm bending oh explore venting you know what [ __ ] it let's do it to the tree house fellow explorers and this is the meeting shelter it's a shelter where you meet at okay i'm trying really hard to make this interesting but sometimes a thing just is what it is i think i made my point so this island is like an unexcavated part of the quarry that rewilded itself after it flooded into the lake pretty cool huh you know when i was little i used to think that islands just kind of would float in the middle of the water kind of like an air bed but i'm older and wiser now and realize that not everything's always as it seems kind of like how you thought you were just having a hot summer fling and then it turns into babysitting a big hairy man-child who's all sad because you don't want to go steady with him and write him love letters every freaking day and while we're talking about it you don't mind that we're talking about it right why why is it up to me to justify my feelings when he's the one who got all bluff about it you know oh look a metaphor in the narrative by mean of fork in the road how fitting here's the big question do i take the high road literally and forget about it or do i continue on the path i'm on and keep ranting about my stupid dumb life i guess since this isn't live the choice is up to me oh what the hell we're in it now anyway well and truly in the thick of it because you know what else i was really excited for the next part of my life you know i mean the summer was great but what's next i mean come on i know by the time i post this hack its quarry will just be about a distant memory and you know it's just one night and you have to make the most of all your opportunities and yada yada i guess i just don't want to have to settle for what's around me you know abby sees me as this confident person but really i'm just desperate to stay afloat in a world where everyone wants to be different this is actually kind of fun i feel like this is the first time i've been alone all summer kind of like it i guess that kind of reinforces the whole jacob thing i know the plan was for him to come get me but now that i'm by myself i kind of like it sorry jacob if you're watching nothing personal it's a me thing we're cool right yeah we're cool actually no we're not cool you left me here on this freaky ass island i'm so gonna make you pay for this in fact let's do this idea time what'll it be tie his shoelaces together no two slapstick not even sure jacob knows how to tie his shoelaces to be totally honest laxatives in his drink i think that's a felony oh man i need some inspiration i'd say throw your ideas down in the comments but we'll all be long gone by the time this uploads maybe i should do a series of pranks though no no those those videos always seem so staged god whatever happened to good old-fashioned authenticity i guess i gotta do this one-handed huh that didn't sound great oh [ __ ] wow all right this is the luxurious skyway treehouse obviously constructed in the year 18-0 [ __ ] by a blindfolded man who used only the finest rotting wood rusty nails and donkey spit that money could buy a real hacket vintage classic honey i'm home what's that now i forgot the children's bedtime well now that's a fine how do you do take it all in folks that's the summer camp experience right there and oh look it seems somebody forgot to clear the place out i guess one of the kids left their stuff or maybe one of the guys back there but i don't recognize this did you hear that looks like we have a choice on our hands do we snoop through someone else's belongings or do we open the spooky trap door and die a horrible painful death there are literally no right answers bag it is and you know what i'm putting some clothes on this is all you're getting fun okay so i think there's something up there and it is not gonna make me jump i can promise you that much goodbye cruel world the final curtain is calling and there's no time for an encore foreign huh [Music] ugh oh um easy i got it he's okay are you in pain no no sorry i'm just i'm really hungry we'll get you some food inside okay yeah okay come on oh man i can eat a horse well i don't know if we'll be able to find you a horse but maybe some granola oh yuck i had granola this will open the nurse's station should be plenty of stuff in there well hopefully we can just get him cleaned up for now i'll get you something neat you and i are gonna find a landline oh uh yeah um isn't there one in mr h's office yep we'll come meet you copy that do you think that whatever attacked them out there is i don't know has their scent or something what i don't know like what if it got a taste for blood and now it's gonna track them down i i doubt it i just feel like if we stick with them we're sitting ducks i don't know i really don't think that whatever attacked them out in the woods is gonna get into the lodge okay yeah yeah you're probably right come on let's go call for backup it's pretty weird to see this place so dead you never came down here at night while camp was in session what no did you a couple times yeah [Applause] where are you going i i i i thought i just heard my name i didn't hear anything i don't think nick's injuries are as bad as we thought we don't know that no it's true caitlyn said so all i'm saying is that we are not professionals okay we don't know we he could have rabies or something way to be optimistic man i'm just being realistic we gotta call for help who should i call uh mr h the only number i got is to this phone okay then 911. you mean 9-1-1 who says 91-1 i don't know anyway yeah but like what should i ask for like police ambulance uh cops yeah don't [ __ ] around there's hunters out there trying to kidnap us so they'll say 9-1-1 what's your emergency and i'll say help for help my friends may have been attacked by bears but maybe not a bear but definitely an animal with teeth and then one of them was kidnapped by these hunter guys with blood on their faces and there may have been shots fired but not by us but also maybe by us and they cut my friend jacob down from a tree separate incident long story yeah yeah that's that's good okay what's wrong dead well that's weird phones go dead sometimes out here right when you're about to call the cops though it's a coincidence did you try the hang up thingy what here what are you doing i don't know it's what they do in movies when the phone goes dead you tap on the little thingy we're not in a movie okay well you know how do you know that maybe that's just what they want you to think man okay so this phone's a no-go no one has signal is there anywhere else in the camp that has a landline well not a landline what the radio hut has some old broadcast gear where you do your announcements where i curate my sweet summer jams yeah and where i do the pa announcements it has some old equipment there i think we could probably break something up and get a message out all right yeah let's let's head over there and see if we can contact somebody put that back dylan you gotta be [ __ ] crazy if you think i'm gonna go out there without something to defend myself it's more of a safety concern oh do you think i'm gonna shoot my eye out or your whole head don't be a dick man i know how to use this okay uh it's it's probably the weather what weather ryan maybe maybe it was the bears bear and why does everyone blame everything on bears okay so for the sake of argument what if that bear that uh cut our phone line and just cut out all the power what if that bear is waiting for us out in the hallway fair point thank you we should probably tell caitlyn that we're going to the radiohead they're probably freaked yeah okay yeah let's go oh god yeah we should probably leave that with caitlyn do you think she really needs it though uh she needs it just as much as we do she's staying in the lodge we're going out there you literally just said there might be something dangerous in the lodge when like 20 seconds ago okay sure but that's because i really wanted the gun just give her the gun man uh all right you're right hey we'll still have mine if you're extra nice to me i'll i might let you hold it don't write a check that your ass can't cash my ass has got quite the bank account am i interrupting something chin up big guy it i wouldn't really know what to do with it okay i trust you oh thank you so much dylan you're so generous and handsome yeah no problem don't mention it [Music] ah [Music] uh [Music] uh uh [Music] ugh oh good to see you good to see you a time again is it strength strength can be surprising knowing one's own raw power tapping into it tapping into a previously unknown energy i suppose there are forces that work within us all and with one hand it gives and with the other it could rip away as always there's more to see and as always the choice is yours would you like to see more [Music] so it's goodbye again i'll leave you with this remember who your friends are remember who's looking out for you hey i couldn't find anything to eat the kitchen's pretty cleaned out oh shoot i left my bag i brought you this that was [ __ ] i don't even know what happened it was all just a blur how are you feeling how are you holding her i'm uh well i i i'm just happy you're okay are you okay i'm sorry i i just asked you that i it's okay all right they're off to find a radio or something what's with the um uh oh uh we found another mr h's office so just in case what happened to the lights not sure any better i'm doing okay kind of wait are they going to the radio hut phone's dead they're going to try to send out an sos or something we're holding down the fort did anybody else hear that [Music] i thought you said dylan and ryan already left stay here i'll check it out we don't know what's out there it could be dangerous yeah that's why i'm gonna check it out um um foreign [Music] no sign of them when you find them and keep me posted bobby so [Music] oh [ __ ] hey so this may not be like the best time to say but like what yes so like i was just you know thinking about like the start of summer and when we first met and started camp and well like now that summer's over and you know is that like the last time i'm gonna see each other you know sorry nick what what are you saying hey don't worry about caitlyn she's tough i know i'm sorry nick i'm just distracted let's just get through the night okay maybe i was misreading the situation back there but kind of felt like a little bit more was going to happen well did you want a little bit more to happen are you dumb hey sorry i just mean of course i wanted it to happen i just didn't know if you did too that seems like such a long time ago now you didn't want it to happen though um you can tell me yeah i i guess you're just saying that cause i'm hurt nick what is going on out there caitlyn we have died we've died i got this oh my god what happened jesus where's the gun we gotta get out no we have to hide [Music] so [Music] so the radio hut has like an actual radio i thought it was just like for your morning announcements oh yeah yeah it used to be more of a actual radio station actually um uh you know i mean it is still technically but nobody brings their radio to camp anymore yeah it's weird actually that there used to be kids with their radio and their portable cd player and everything and you know nowadays everything we need is on the phone but mr hakka takes it on the first day of camp so that we're not distracted by technology technology it giveth and it taketh so is is that something like that you want to go into camp radio no like uh dj or music or something oh um yeah i mean i like music but i think i want to major in um quantum physics wait what yeah uh you don't really seem like a science guy oh yeah i mean you know not not here um i'm i'm sorry i'm so completely fascinated by this what do you mean by not here not here at camp i do that at home and then here i um euro wise wise cracking smartass that's a little harsh but no okay so maybe i was a little nervous when i arrived in an uncomfortable social situation and i overcompensated a little bit by making a bunch of jokes you played into it yeah i mean people kind of enjoyed the blase dillon and do you enjoy the blase dylan not yet like you know whatever man it's pretty cool that's fine um i like dylan dylan well it's nice to meet you dylan dylan i'm ryan ryan well actually i'm let's get the [ __ ] out of here ryan yeah i like him he's that makes a lot of sense oh what in the name of voodoo dude is this all good all good oh this place is kind of a dump huh okay when i was a camper here it was barely working it hadn't been used for years and it took me a really long time actually to get this place cleaned up and looking the way it is so i'm sorry if it's not up to your standards but i've been putting in a lot of tlc okay okay let me get this set up all right anything over here we can use the power tools no um that's mr h wanted more storage so it's kind of how he lets me keep the station going gotcha so uh how far does it go oh um well it was designed just to broadcast to the pas around camp for announcements and to you know portable radios and whatever so i think the range is about a mile how do you even know all this stuff i just kind of picked it up the tech technical stuff has always been a little uh hard for me to get a handle on well if you like i could show you the ropes like a class yeah it's easy like climbing sign me up teach anyways this thing's gonna need a bit of a power up um but that's where this comes in dust magnet it's supposed to be a signal booster it's kind of janky looking but it's worth giving a shot so we can actually talk to people with this thing yeah well it's not a two-way radio so um you know we can talk uh but then the best we can do is switch it over to the receiver and see if anyone broadcasts anything back which is unlikely but well i mean it is what it is i guess yeah so what should i say uh just like make it sound urgent okay hello how's it going out there this is uh uh we need help this is uh we are counselors at hackett's quarry summer camp and there's been a horrible accident attack some stuff bad here we need your help uh there is a swarm of bears and they are everywhere and there's these hunters too and they seem to be shooting at the bears but also at us um which is not good and a few of our friends are hurt and um we are in desperate need of help so please there's vicious bears and uh we don't know what to do so please uh come help us sos uh this is an emergency s save our ship come on down please help us did i do good was that swarm of bears yeah heard of bears yeah i've heard of bears but oh my god all right i i guess i should just like switch this over to the receiver and see if we get anything back okay yeah i'm gonna keep an eye out while you do all this techy stuff okay yeah sure up check it i gotta ping on the radio but no response i'm gonna have to wait did he did he say live another couple unaccounted for holy [ __ ] they're talking about us how cuz we just told them on the [ __ ] radio [ __ ] they know where we are man we can't stay here [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] let's let's stay calm okay um let's let's go find caitlyn and everybody okay okay why didn't okay tell me that there's something out there i i i wasn't sure man [ __ ] what the [ __ ] was that i have no idea uh ryan is it a bear i don't think parents can jump like that [Applause] what is that [ __ ] what caitlyn abby and nick they're coming up the path oh [ __ ] they're coming toward us we gotta warn them um what about

hunt get your cabin now go oh [ __ ] dude they're gone what now okay is there anything we can do i don't know i i don't know it's just an animal right i mean maybe we can scare it off uh well yeah i mean if it if it has hearing like a dog maybe we can play like a like a really high-pitched feedback loop and just blast it and and i mean it would hurt like hell but you know do it okay okay come on dylan let's do this um what it's almost hey dylan just take a breath i'm sure you can figure it out okay yeah right so there's something missing i do what's missing [Music] oh crap i pulled the wire

here [ __ ] you get a message out i'm not sure anyone heard it great what the hell is going on oh my god tell them what happened oh um i'm okay i i mean i'm not um but it's it doesn't doesn't hurt

keeping a record of everything that happens for the police yeah dead girl in the pool need some explaining huh easy man maybe like photos whatever we can i've got a funny feeling the cops are not gonna want to believe any of this crazy [ __ ] unless we've got some hard proof from now on if you got your phone and you see something take a photo or a video or whatever you okay over there abby look why don't you look around and see if you can find anything to help make nick more comfortable here that better thanks hey this place was so different like 12 hours ago i wonder where caleb is yo

i tried to clean his wounds too at the lodge what do you mean all of his clothes were bloody but i couldn't find where he was bit or scratched or whatever he just kept moving around like he didn't want me to see how badly he was hurt huh rabies she's not frothing in the mouth i think abby would beg to differ point yeah isn't aquaphobia a symptom of rabies hydrophobia yeah but i think it's more about a fear of drinking not just getting wet this was like like my cat in the bathtub abby yeah can i ask you something of course you like me nick please just tell me i've really enjoyed spending time with you this summer that's such such such what such a cop-out answer abby uh what i've got something to ask you uh yeah okay why don't you like me abby nick i do like you no [Music] you don't
