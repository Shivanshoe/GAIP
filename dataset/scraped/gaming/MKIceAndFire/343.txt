[Music] looks like we get to sleep with a roof over our heads that blazing swords turned out to be even stronger than i expected with that much sheer power elemental types are hardly a concern anymore you can bring practically any foe down to their knees in a flash don't count on me being able to pull off another gates of fire that only happened because i had the help of that spirit vessel monster too still you did defeat balsa with it which means it can also take down the other lords that's enough for me besides if it was any stronger your body wouldn't be able to handle it have you forgotten what happened after we finished off balsev no but aren't you scared of having that much power inside of you even a little why would i be power provides opportunity you don't expect me to simply throw it away do you no i get it it's a good ace to have up our sleeve that's for sure i'll make the most of it well as much as i can without becoming charcoal [Music] i'm impressed how well balanced this thing is [Music] this should definitely keep you guys full [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] rising here i am [Music] [Music] you see anybody around here who could use our help we can't chase after every little thing [Music] this is [Music] what [Music] why do you keep people at arm's length [Music] you're always trying to wave it off whenever someone's nice to you [Music] like with tulsa just now why couldn't you just accept your gratitude [Music] our interests just happen to overlap i don't want people thinking i'm doing things to be nice when in reality they benefit both of us all i care about is that we hurry up and defeat the lords [Music] see that's what i mean you want to defeat the lords i may have been skeptical at first but now i really believe you meant it yet despite that you still took the time to help out those injured dannons didn't you i did it because it was necessary and i got roped into helping out is that the same reason you helped that kid in boston's castle because it sure didn't look that way to me you've helped me too not just with my injuries but by being there for me as well even though i can't feel pain the injuries i get from using the blazing sword could probably kill me i thought alone should be terrifying but i know you'll always be there by my side ready to heal me it's because of you that i can wield the blazing sword don't just close in on me like that [Music] if you get any closer you're going to set off my thorns you know i was just trying to compliment you you were [Music] your thorns it's okay i'll stop talking about it you you will [Music] in any case i'm just glad that you're the one who ended up with the master core thank you shion for everything [Music] now let's go check out those gates of fire really i swear you're bad for the heart [Music] okay off we go i don't see any soldiers or their pet zoogles just strays roaming around they must have split once balsa kicked the bucket and they had nobody left to obey [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] don't take your eyes off the prize i'm quite aware without you reminding me rising library our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion so [Music] that monster that appeared from the spirit vessel and the power inside the blazing sword they're both born of the same thing it's all astral energy harvested from the souls of dying danones i suppose so then it was the danens who gave their lives for today their power after all this time is what finally destroyed balsa and his wall by the way what happened to all the energy that we released it's dispersing and spreading across dana as we speak finding its way back to where it belongs and all the energy the renins have harvested where does that go one sovereign's decided i mean i'd wager they don't give it back right what can't tell the dan in that or about why you want to kill all the lords oh like you don't have anything to hide the blazing sword it's powered by the burning astral energy of the master core i possess so why don't you explain how it manifested into the shape of that beast hmm just how did you manage that how am i supposed to know my memory's a complete blank remember fine be that way it's not like we ever trusted each other anyway [Music] she's still not awake not yet her injuries aren't serious but she's severely weakened must have been quite a fight there's nothing we can give her if only what with the beatings we've taken lately we're barely getting by on the little provisions we have as it is that bad huh if there are no supplies here then that's it we need doc doc the same doc that took care of you yeah he's back in mosul if anyone can help us it's him in that case would you mind asking for us i'd go myself but i'm tied up here for now not a problem leave it to me [Music] i wonder what that girl's deal is never imagine anyone would ever come from outside the walls of calaglia it's really not that big of a deal there are more realms out there than just calaglia you know maybe it sounds normal to you but i've been behind those walls for as long as i can remember of course i knew there was more out there but it sure didn't feel like it when unscalable walls are trapping you in i hate to burst your bubble but the rest of dana isn't much better the world's full of lords who are just as bad as balsa i know that girl must have had her reasons for coming over to our territory even so it's nice to see there really is life beyond the walls of calaglia it might not mean much to you but that's reason enough for me to be happy i feel like somebody's watching [Music] maybe there's someone around [Music] it's so quiet from now on no one is going to be whipped or killed here ever again [Music] hey there doc who are you it's me iron mask though these days i go by alfin i finally remembered my name elfin i heard that was the guy who brought down balsiff wait you're telling me you're the liberator of calaiglia our own iron mask of all the people i told you i'm alpha now and i didn't overthrow balset alone even so that's no small feat you've accomplished and you managed to get your face back too that woman with you the renin you know about her only what i've heard from rumors i wasn't sure i believed it but now i suppose i must doc sheep thank you you sure you should be saying that to a renin i'm not saying it to any old renin i'm saying it to you young lady i only helped because it was in my interests as well of course i would imagine as much but that doesn't change the end result the two of you defeated balsa and now all of us are free that is a fact thanks doc i should be the one thanking you i'll never be able to repay what you two have done anyway i'm guessing you didn't come here just to catch up uh right we need your advice we found a girl who's collapsed from exhaustion and she needs medicine do you know anything that could help hmm if she's that weak she may need a nutritional boost the herbs i have here won't be enough oh have you tried searching cured garrison no we passed it on our way here but with all the running soldiers gone that place should be empty now if we're lucky maybe they left something you can use good idea we'll take a look cured garrison if i'm not mistaken that's located off to the side of the railroad tracks wherever it is just make it quick [Music] you look happy do i i guess i am getting thanked for everything by someone i actually know it made it really hit home that we made a difference that guy's a strange one though doc i don't think he's that odd he is though he thanked me a renin for helping despite everything my people have put him through over the years he's free now he doesn't have to act nice around my kind he's not acting he means it and like he said before he was thanking you as an individual not just some renin that's what makes it so strange would you have preferred he yelled and threw rocks at you i'm not saying that it's just hard for me to understand him [Music] we've reached our destination [Music] [Music] get lost this was all less talking more pummeling this could be useful think this is it how would i know it matches the description we were given at least no use standing around here hamming and hauling let's take it back and see i hope you're right there's no way i'm coming all the way back here just to be safe i think before we head back to ulzebeck we should maybe have doc double check this is the right stuff all right but let's make it quick [Music] [Music] i'd hate for this to turn out to be the wrong medicine let's have doc double check to make sure before we head back [Music] [Music] did you find anything useful we think this might work but we wanted you to take a look at it first let's see ah this stuff yes this'll work i'd hurry over and give it to the girl right away right then we'll do that now say iron mask no sorry it's elf and now right are you and that young woman planning to stick together moving forward uh yeah i think so hmm i see you know i think things just might be starting to change what do you mean i'm not sure of that myself but i feel like after being stalled for a long time the gears of progress are finally starting to turn again i imagine people are going to have things to say about the two of you but you simply keep doing what you feel is right if you ever get tired and need to rest feel free to come back here until then take care of yourself thanks doc [Music] [Music] okay off we go [Music] [Music] you see anybody around here who could use our help we can't chase after every little thing [Music] is this what you asked for perfect that'll do nicely i had a feeling you'd come through for us with this the little one should be right as rain in no time [Music] i can't believe it not often we get visitors from cislodia around here cislovia collagelya's neighbor one of the five realms what with that wall in the way i guess it's not surprising but i've never actually met someone from the outside world before up till now the only time the gates ever opened was to let ren and convoy units in and out no one ever thought to stow away and hit you right out this place might be a living hell but when next door is a living hell too you start thinking it doesn't matter much one way or the other so you're rinwell and you're with the cislodian resistance known as the silver swords your organization sent a group of you to establish contact but you're the only one who made it through that sound about right lately our people's oppression has become more and more severe when we heard rumors that you had staged a successful rebellion in calaglia we hoped that maybe you could help us new sure gets around quickly huh if you ask me it's awfully convenient she just happened to show up now certainly raises a lot of red flags please i swear it's true my people are dying i risked my life trying to get here so i could find help it's okay you did well we'll take it from here [Music] hold on zephyr you're not really thinking we'll join her elfin start getting ready i let you use the blazing sword and we work together to overthrow the lords that was the deal remember wait is that a renin what is this take it easy it's complicated but she's on our side she helped to find some medicine for you she did but no she's a i can't believe it the renins from other realms could attack at any time that's for you all to worry about i've got bigger fish to fry that sword of alfins is our best weapon we can't just go lending him to other lands even if you keep him here the blade's as good as useless without me on board and what makes you think i can't persuade you bright eyes what makes you think you can last i checked you couldn't even touch me enough alfin what do you want to do i i know all too well the hardships the slaves of this realm had to endure that's why i took up the sword to help them if dannons are being oppressed in other realms then and i have to help them too nath has a point we can't discount the possibility of further attacks but now our struggle has grown it's become much larger than just liberating the people of calaglia [Music] we can't be in two places at once zephyr true which means we're limited in our options we play this the same way we did with balsa [Music] [Music] i have a bad feeling about this you and me both but it's too late for regrets geez really you don't say so you're really going huh just the four of you afraid so look after the place while we're away [Music] always the smooth talker we'll do what we can to hold down the fort we've got the run-ins to keep us busy good luck just remember yeah yeah don't go killing anyone without good reason i get it i'm not about to repeat what they did [Music] let's move people [Music] do you think we'll really be able to wipe the renin's off the face of dana who said anything about doing that but we have to in order to survive don't we now that you have the blazing sword and have shown that we really can win this fight do you really think we should go around killing every last renin but what else are we supposed to do say we go around killing renin's so they don't kill us first in turn that'll just make more and more of them want to kill us where does it end once you enter such a vicious cycle is that why you told grenard not to kill any renance without a good reason i'm not saying we should forgive and forget what they've done to us but we can't let ourselves be dragged down by our own hatred either hatred comes in many forms there's no one solution that will work in every situation we have to keep searching for new ones if we're going to survive it's a lifelong journey finding the answers that goes for you too you have to come up with your own answers [Music] [Music] hey zephyr why do you keep fighting what do you mean until i met you and the crimson crows all the danons i ever knew just accepted their lot in life as slaves hell even i was like that but all of you in the resistance are different even when you have no hope of winning you keep on fighting why is that come on that's an easy one i just refuse to live life as a slave that's all better to die fighting for freedom than to live as a slave huh let me ask you a question elfin what does it mean to you to not be a slave any longer i guess it means living a life not being ruled by the remnants right but what about the danons who died standing up to the renins are they still slaves would they be truly free if all they did was follow my orders and die without knowing what it was they were doing but that's being a slave isn't just a position it's also a state of mind don't become my slave elfin [Music] i'll take you all on glad to hear it in that case cover me i'm sure i can put this to use what's that over there some kind of castle yeah one that belongs to a different more than balsa right that makes sense you said there were five of them in all right right we've still got a lot of work ahead of us [Music] great now i'm hurt and dirty [Music] rinwell right it's nice to meet you does that little white animal follow you everywhere he's not a little white animal his name's hoodle and he's a baby owl [Music] and he's the only friend i have normally i don't pick on the weak damn it you're mine these are all you see on swallow blade [Music] pathetic [Music] [Music] gotta break through ignite zero [Music] another notch in the old belt keep them coming you like that taste of freedom kid [Music] what's got you so worked up poodle [Music] is that watch out they know we're here flying zoogles huh this is going to get interesting they're nothing i haven't seen before see on i'll shoot them down you finish them off got it [Music] knock a flying enemy out of the sky and it's as good as duck right let's see what i can do show me what you can do kiddo these little ones are hardly worth our time [Music] what was it those zoogles were attacking just now is that [Music] what it's nothing i only helped because it was convenient we couldn't have moved forward without clearing out those zoogles i don't know what's got you ticked off at me this time but i suggest you keep your hands away from me no one asked you to help rinwell she healed its wounds she's not trying to hurt it how can you be so [Music] oh [Music] they look like they're talking to each other he's probably happy to see another owl i don't think hoodles ever met one before he might have been wondering if he was the only one [Music] oh oh you just barely got to say hi at least we know it's out there i'm sure we'll run into it again somewhere yeah i'm sure we will right hoodle [Music] let's keep our eyes on the prize [Music] i'm always impressed how good of a shot you are shion what do you mean just that all i'm good for is throwing myself at things with all my might by comparison your way is more how do i put it precise it's not like i'm that good of a look that's just how it is with guns if you miss it's a wasted bullet you can't get back is that why you're always aiming to exploit enemies weak spots i wouldn't say every shot is that deliberate but that is part of it for example if i see a flying enemy i'll often go for their wings also if i see a jumping enemy without wings i know they're an easy target because they can't get out of the way while in the air in your case i bet it's easier for you to deal with enemies that stay on the ground right definitely things that can fly circles around me are a real pain to deal with exactly it's important to keep your enemies movements in check true although your shots have the added benefit of stunning enemies so it's easier to swipe materials from them and it's really helped out it's nothing really as long as you keep doing your part when we fight i'd say we're even [Music] i hate camping out [Music] [Music] i'm surprised there are owls here too yeah there are more of them around than i thought [Music] what are you staring for do all danon fighters look like you what this getup i pulled this number together from scrap and parts i salvaged throughout the years though now i'm feeling self-conscious seeing how put together you seem to be oh oh no i was just curious did you fortify your right side more because that's your dominant side partly but mostly because my body's a little worse for wear after all these years fighting that makes sense so you take extra care to protect your dominant side with more armor smart is fighting all you think about [Music] i'll see you again tomorrow [Music] i think we've rested long enough let's keep moving [Music] i take it we're heading through here then everything all right zephyr yeah it's nothing what is that a ring it was my wife's your wife you never mention anything about being married that's surprising you said was so then is she gone was it the renin's no she was sick i couldn't get her the medicine she needed and then she was gone i'd always wanted to show her the world as it could be i'm sorry don't be there are plenty of people out there more deserving of your sympathy than me but [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] don't get careless don't tell me [Music] [Music] [Music] let me know if you're struggling what is this place anyway what's with these columns and steps no idea i've never been here before either rena's convoy squads probably used it in the past i guess it's definitely seen better days but you wouldn't know anything would you shion nope and i'm not interested in learning either actually these are dannon ruins see you can tell by the way the columns are decorated and stuff they're all old danon designs are you saying these things were built more than 300 years ago then yeah i have no idea what they were used for though it's amazing to think our ancestors were capable of making such structures hopefully there'll come a time when us dennins will be able to walk through here freely again that's exactly what you're fighting for isn't it let's keep moving yeah right this one's tough but we have no choice [Music] do it see you continue on in that this end thing consider yourself finished [Music] i never imagined there were zougels out there that could pretend to be statues that's because zoogles don't come from nature who knows what else is lurking out there guess we have to be prepared for anything [Music] [Music] it's freezing in here and after how hot it was outside too it must be the cold air sweeping in from cyslodia it's the polar opposite of calaglia so i'd get used to it if i were you is the little guy okay oh don't worry about hoodle he's from cislodia probably just nerves is all he's not really used to being around other people this much [Music] rinwell how about filling them in on what to expect from cislodia oh yeah um let's see well for starters nobody trusts nobody come again just like i said you never know when snake eyes are watching you that's what they call their lord's henchmen apparently their official title is the bureau of civil observation they've got cronies undercover everywhere observing us at all times so renin surveillance was an everyday part of life in calaglia difference is in cislodia it's not just renin's they've got danons spying on each other too or in other words there's the snake eyes themselves plus all their small time informants all it takes is someone squealing on you and it's straight to labor camp no questions asked no goodbyes course informers are rewarded handsomely for their deceit everyone's always got one eye open waiting for the moment to inform on someone before being tattled on first hence the not trusting one another huh in that case what do you think they'll make of us hard to say although not being from cislodia will probably help honestly more trustful of outsiders than even your own people why go along with it though why doesn't anyone take a stand not everyone is strong enough to stand elfin [Music] that's why the world needs people like us [Music] is the blazing sword okay a little water's not going to hurt it [Music] [Music] you're mine destruction [Music] [Music] everything's coming up zephyr i'll take you all off this one's mine [Music] see you uh yes my lady i can feel my power growing [Music] so [Music] this one's tough but we have no choice let me know if you need [Music] destruction [Music] i'm quite aware without you reminding me i need to be stronger [Music] ah guess i misread the landing that is one enormous stray i don't think we can take it right now [Music] [Music] so [Music] spray yourselves this one's tough [Music] this is it dig deep easier said than done no excuses this is up to us [Music] [Music] that took more energy than i expected and what have we got here oh i saw that in a book once those things are worth a lot you're a little bookworm aren't you break yourselves this one's tough [Music] take this here i come back all yours [Music] more pummeling [Music] another notch in the old belt keep them coming you like that taste of freedom kid i think i could get used to it not much further now the exit will take us straight into cislodia you're brooding again what's eating at you we defeated bolsf and liberated calaglia from the remnants now we're on our way to rescue our fellow dannons in sislovia i'm committed to helping our people you know that but then what happens after that what's our end game here good question the danon's vastly outnumber the renins yet we rarely take up arms because we know that when it comes to firepower we don't stand a chance even if you succeeded in overthrowing the lords and freeing dana then what lenigus would still hover over us the ren and motherland behind it if they so desired the renance could potentially use their might to wipe us off the planet in a second no matter how powerful that blazing sword of yours is so what you're saying is we don't stand a chance so what the heck are we even doing there's no sense in discarding today's victory for tomorrow's loss if fighting yields even a single day of freedom it will all have been worth it in the end who knows maybe that's the day we make preparations for the battle that will free us for good speaking pragmatically the fact the renin's don't exterminate us all in spite of their technical advantage has to mean one thing they need us it's up to us to put a dent in their armor before they cotton onto our plan that way we force them to the negotiating table you want to negotiate with the runnings it's galling i know but it's the only way to survive while securing our freedom at the same time that that's but even so we can't just if you lot are done talking there's a lord we came to overthrow what about you shion what do you plan on doing after we've given the lords the boot all i know is my reasons for fighting aren't the same as yours i'm through answering these pointless questions [Music] so this is cislodia how far is it to the capitol we've still got a ways to go also the zoogles here are different than those in calaglia so be careful got it sounds like we should make sure we stick close together as we keep moving agreed the hey xi'an it'll be hard for me to use my rifle in a pinch if we're all bunched together i'll follow behind the rest of you right makes sense what's up with her she seems even more up front than back in calaglia in case you forgot we're in enemy territory now if you don't get serious and focus on the task at hand you'll be inviting trouble don't take it personally i think that's just the way she is plus you have to remember with those thorns of hers she's probably not used to anybody being all that friendly to her the fact that you can't feel pain means you probably end up getting closer to her than she's used to you really think so we're talking about someone who came down to dana all by herself but you don't see her homesick for lenigus at all do you no that alone speaks volumes about how difficult her whole situation must be yeah it's your job as her partner to understand that and give her the support she needs you two are gonna be stuck together for a while so the sooner you make nice the better make nice yup now come on i get that they're not exactly on the best of terms but [Music] is everything going to be okay with these people [Music] rinwell don't go too far ahead you never know where zoogles might be lurking oh we'll be fine we've been able to handle them up until now still better that you hang back a bit no way i'm the one who asked you to come here in the first place remember yeah but if we lose you we won't know where to go besides it's old guys like me who should be sticking their necks out first but we need you in order to get in contact with the resistance in cislodia so stick close until we find them okay okay thanks now you've got me wondering how'd you make it to calaclea in the first place i find it hard to imagine you didn't run into zoogles along the way are you good at hiding or something uh yeah that's it i'm just really good at staying out of sight [Music] wow still you had to have been pretty lucky to have made it the whole way unscathed lucky indeed [Music] it's crazy to feel just how much the temperature has changed from crossing over a single peak is it really that big of a difference definitely collaguia was hot i can only tell from appearance so that's true you might not be able to feel it but it sure looks like your body responds to it just the same seems like it so if i sneeze i guess that it's a sign that it's getting chilly they say that sneezing is often the first sign you're coming down with a cold too that's all the more reason you need to be careful with you [Music] was that also a sneeze i just bit my tongue that's all no it sounded a lot different from mine but i could swear it was still it wasn't a sneeze okay guess we both need to be careful out here in the cold [Music] is it hard leaving calaglia behind no actually it's kind of a relief to be away from there really what makes you say that because it was getting to the point where every man woman and child would come up and talk to me like they knew me i could barely find a moment to breathe let alone relax well what you did was kind of a big deal you know you overthrew a running lord and burst open the gates of fire [Music] yeah but that was only because i had the blazing sword with me we wouldn't have made it to bolsef without you and the crimson crow zephyr maybe so but you're still the one who took him out in the end it's only natural for people to look up to those who protect them you're a hero to those people i never asked to be one i never asked to take the place of a lord in people's minds i don't want it you're a strange one alvin that's for sure if that's how you really feel then hold on to that listen to those thoughts when you feel lost and don't know what to do if you can do that you won't lose sight of who you are or what the right path to take is the right path to take huh what's this [Music] thing i've noticed the zoogles here a lot different from what we're used to back in calaglia it's because this realm is so cold i imagine they had to be adapted to fit the climate meaning if we hit them with fire arts it should be extra effective against them [Music] i'll take you all off swallow blade try this infernal turret dragon don't let them form them you're [Music] everything's coming up zephyr [Music] normally i don't pick on them where are you going [Music] one final [Music] we did it these little [Music] pathetic [Music] what's this thing [Music] brace yourselves this one [Music] come on [Music] consider yourself finished [Music] with your flames and my technique we're stronger together than we are apart [Music] an opponent like this should be easy [Music] [Music] that was almost too easy [Music] would you like to warm up some [Music] aren't there people in there you should let yourself unwind when you get the chance i guess there's no arguing with that [Music] hey mm-hmm hey [Music] oh [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm right [Music] what hmm [Music] [Music] just great all right [Music] nice right right [Music] happy now shion yeah i'd say so she better be after all she ate i stopped before i was full though what [Music] okay off we go [Music] [Music] you
