by shinnok's evil they are no longer the champions we once knew we must strike them preemptively it's about time we brought the fight to them what's the target buried deep beneath luke kang and katana's castle is the cathedral of shinnok the seat of their power destroy it and their undead army will fall removing its threat to earth realm aren't your powers weaker in the nether realm yes but i will have sufficient strength to occupy the undead army that'll buy us enough time to infiltrate the cathedral destroy it from the inside we get pinned down in there there's no way out to ensure earth realm survival we must all be willing to sacrifice uh you know it's been two years too much of your grim and gritty makeover droning on about sacrifice you don't have a family to lose i no loss

you deemed threats that cannot be my raiden wears shinnok's amulet as a symbol of his fury be assured khan i am not that raiden we have common cause both in solving this temporal crisis and in defeating shao khan agreed liu kang kung lao and i will return to earth realm and learn what temporal anomalies have occurred there we must better understand the phenomenon we are experiencing i will

time anomaly we must help our shaolin masters why would the nether realm wanna bust up your alma mater liu kang the dragon grotto it's underneath the academy earth realms ginsei energy bubbles up in its springs that's no good we've seen firsthand what happens when the nether realm screws with earthworms life force they will not reach the grotto it is protected by powerful magic the deadliest traps i am sure our counterparts from your era are already dealing with them kung lao who kang you might want to sit down i die in the coliseum you on a rooftop fighting lord raiden our future new

lesson fighting you at shang tsung's tournament this time i am prepared fight [Music] [Music] oh i can't stop the traps the locks have been changed ugh uh it stopped why our plans require that you live jade what happened to you an untimely death like yours due to raiden's incompetence you cannot turn us against him we know about our deaths they were caused by our mistakes you have been deceived luke the truth is raiden murdered you lord raiden may make mistakes but he doesn't murder his followers is it not murder to send an ill-prepared warrior to his death braden's mistake costs your life queen loud fight don't cut yourself i like the real you better [Music] [Music] the dragon grotto is through there what if the next revenants we have to fight are us then we fight them [Music] elder gods i have come to seek counsel the realms are in crisis the crisis is grave indeed raiden every being will be erased in a temporal armageddon even we elder gods already our power weakens i will fight cetrion but how you must find cronica's keep and gain control of her hourglass only then will time's momentum be restored it will be done speak your mind raiden since this time merger i have learned about my future that my champions fall that i become a tyrant if cronica is defeated will i be consigned to this grim fate the restoration of time will not predetermine your destiny that is for you to shape [Music] [Music] is there any point to us asking you to put those back they said you'd come who said who do you think [Music] [Music] welcome to your future courtesy of raiden our future may be tragic but it's not lord raiden's fault you've both been warped by sinnok's evil shall carve snapped my neck in the arena raiden saw it coming and did nothing i would have defeated shao khan but raiden wanted the glory his lightning cut me down no i don't believe that one day raiden will betray you then you will believe the thought of becoming you sickens me but i won't blame raiden you owe cronica she saved your life by stopping time fight one hat is better uh you shame our family name is it me or could they be telling the truth worry about it later we have bigger problems you

stronger fetch the ginsei chosen one you're good but you're no great kung lao you've met my ancestor he stood a chance against me you have none fight [Music] huh aah i can't kill you but i can knock you out you shall and monks exceed your reputation i respect your spirit but kronecker's will must be done yes it's dangerous to let them live if they die their revenant selves will cease to exist we need them to defend the keep yet again liu kang you've chosen the wrong destiny i now have the energy to re-sculpt the sands of time the nether realm's undead army will protect the keep as i work shall khan when will you deliver the outworld army soon it will be mine once coatel is killed and what is your progress sector the cyberlink query factory is modified to your specifications production exceeds projections lord raiden what did the elder god say we must find cronica rest the control of history from her if we succeed our destiny can change so what we were told is true you were involved in our deaths yes as the timeline continued my decisions would have led to your deaths but the elder gods assure me that such a future is not inevitable this is but one of many possible timelines that is a lot to take on faith rest assured kung lao i am aware now of what may come i will not bring harm to either of you you have my vow thank you lord raiden we must find kronecker's keep and strike it as hard and as fast as we can muster before all is lost what have you learned about cronica's effect on earth realm we're tracking sites around the globe with major temporal anomalies texture's still fuzzy our kid's something isn't she we see no pattern oh cage i'm not your sonia sorry too easy to forget we've prioritized info that correlates attacks from the nether realm with time anomalies helpful but we have more to worry about than the nether realm yeah we do grandmaster sub-zero reports heavy losses to his lin-quay clan the time merger has resurrected his old enemy sector sector was he not the grand master who years ago enslaved the lin quay that's him he's reactivating and upgrading the same factory he built to convert the lin quay into cyber killing machines undoubtedly to construct new and more powerful cyber lin quay kronika may seek to co-opt them what of sub-zero already on his way to shut down the factory grand master hisashi is going with him grandmaster hasashi hanzo hasashi your hearing is failing sub-zero i recognized your footsteps hanzo with segador i will not let him threaten my clan again the old cyberlinquay factory was defunct buried beneath this quarry until the time disruption now sectors returned and reactivated it he's building an army by processing lin quay warriors kidnapped from my temple i can see why you need me we could enter through that tunnel but a frontal assault would be here bloody needlessly dangerous there's another entrance less populated and the rest of your plan we get help on the inside we'll avenge your clan [Music] cyrix is your inside man he was converted against his will if we disable the behavior inhibitors that control him he will turn on sector all cyberlinkway are linked to a common network cyrex can shut them down from within who is the woman i don't know focus on disabling cyrax he's the key we require additional candidates for cyberization once delivered how long before the next generation frost i gave you a home i was your mentor yet after all this you ally with sektor he corrupted the lin kuei you corrupted our clan when you make peace with this shirai bryu filth with cronica's help i will restore the lin kuei's honor keep cyrax alive we need him there is no future in which you are fit to lead the lin kuei you always doubted me sub-zero held me back cronica sees my true potential fight [Music] the ice cracks beneath you uh you deceive yourself frost [Music] so linguay's glory in the new era take the others you've been enslaved cyrux first by sector now by cronica it ends today fight your bones will freeze thank you [Applause] you will be freed hurry before we face more cyber linkway you'll need a moment to initialize sector show yourself [Music] its the linkway principles i thought you shared fight to make for your life come on [Music] we share blood we are not brothers [Music] your soul is intact cyrux trust me i speak from experience is that you you look so old and scorpio we'll explain later for now know we share the same goal the cyber linguist destruction we need your help cyrux i can disable their communications network it will shut down this factory and every cyber link connected frost warned me that you truly become allies i did not think you capable of such dishonor sub-zero aid cyrax sector is mine i've taken your head once sector i will do it no longer again the cyber lin quay will usher in cronica's new era fight you are no warrior let's go shivering the cyber linquay are finished it is not the end i will find a way to restore you anything is possible hanzo and i are living proof please don't bring me back his machine i can't live like this machine or man you have a war your soul as long as i am grandmaster the lin quay will welcome you until we meet again first we speak with raiden our lady chronicler will get all the service she needs but i can't quite feel until i know the job you will see can you restore him there's some frame damage circuitry looks good it looks like someone did a software wipe fixing that won't come cheap once he is repaired can he be replicated hundreds of times thousands that's a tall order but anything's possible with the right help serve chronica and she will provide take the deal trust me [Music] otherwise who can you trust you weren't kidding it's like a mirror reflecting the past how about that over 50 and still a ripper there's still the matter of our fee we get paid in the new era kronecker will make sure the black dragon come out on top not only in the black market in every market right then let's get to business you read your dad yet kid the network's still down i hate being so far away dad must be climbing the walls be patient you'll get through i know my dad's still

how horribly you have suffered that was not my plan for you your plan you were to retire distinguished not in disgrace years from now general jackson breaks more importantly your daughter was not to serve nor endure the same tragedies you have your home should be filled with grandchildren help me [Music] he relies on their power coastal scouts tracked a tarkartan war party to the kaitin's lost hive devorah's ancestral home her hand in shao khan's escape makes that our starting point please advise me of what you learned i must consult with the elder gods when do we leave your duty lies elsewhere princess i need you to enlist queen shiva her support is critical against both kronecker and shao kahn surely you can green shiva does not trust me no shokhan has since my bloody battle with goro shiva's always respected your opinion more than anyone's when she hears you support codel she'll join us if that is my duty so be it thank you princess are you my friend or his consort it was my idea katana it's in your best interest succeed with shiva and kodu will pledge as loyalty to you there's no bond more sacred to an osh tech like him i remember when we could ride like this alone my life has changed as outworlds come thankfully you have not you haven't changed much either despite the years you're still the same noble warrior i met in shao khan's court and now your car i'm surprised no woman has claimed your bed and become your queen many have tried yet they failed why none of them were you [Music] there are fresh tracks leading into the hive if shao khan's in there he'll be difficult to find the tunnels are endless set fire to them if he's hidden he will be smoked out codel we don't know who else is oh oh [Music] by the gods it's true this is what i become blame your loyalty to katana it led directly to our death then so be it i would not trade katana's friendship for anything it is pitiful you choose servitude she and i fight side by side against shao khan his oppression cannot stand fight take your time getting up [Music] when called for a higher purpose we must serve you will bleed for your betrayal devorah this one acts only for the hive survival you'd best flee divine is mine fight not enough don't stare too long [Music] uh wish to survive tell us where to find shao khan [Music] ghosts of my past spoke the truth we are outnumbered give me a few of your best soldiers we'll infiltrate the camp in search for shel khan unseen what you propose is dangerous of course it is [Music] [Music] please [Applause] with me [Applause] [Music] [Music]

welcome to the fire garden the elder gods are gone shinnok is cronica's son no wonder she sent the black dragon after me and dad we both kicked his ass it is not vengeance that drives cronica she restarts history to balance light and dark among the realms what can we do lord raiden gather earthrealm's forces but that effort will be for naught if kotal khan's armies cannot join us cetrion informed me that xiao khan has captured kotal khan we must spare no effort to free him kung lao and i will go we will rendezvous with princess katana thank you both may the elder gods protect may you return victorious you are passionate princess katana but i am not persuaded queen shiva haven't your people fared better under kotal khan than shao khan in some ways but we can only guess which khan will prevail in this struggle we gain no advantage choosing science now princess liu kang why are you here cotto khan has been captured by the tarkartans we must act quickly before he is executed my people will not rally to a car held in chains we have earthrealms support your highness with yours we can guarantee victory there is no path to victory without the talk cottons if they can be swayed to kotal khan it would be to our advantage to join him i will return queen shiva with the tarkatans at my side together we will march on shao khong um [Music] what is it about jade's blood that intrigues you scarlet indian blood is most sweet your excellency it is also a rare commodity where are they taking him to the coliseum no doubt then we attack now we'll never sway barack at a codel's side by taking the offensive we must turn baraka first then attack shao khan together the tarkatans won't grant an audience their instinct will be to attack not to mention jade at the first sign of trouble they could kill her i have an idea who is in charge here then time to feast princess kitana our gift for shao khan we wish to join his fight against koto all those years the khan's high and mighty daughter now brought low by common soldiers have you learned finally that you're no better than the rest of us she is for shao khan we demand to see baraka you won't be seeing anyone [Music] uh [Music] you betrayed your father kitana i was shao khan's daughter by conquest he stole adenium from its rightful ruler the father i never knew because your people and your bloodline were weak fights i will execute [Music] there is more to power than conquest scarlet as requested zero casualties jade are you all right we must find baraka quickly to save codel baraka won't join us kotel's hate for the tarkartans runs too deep if i hadn't stopped him kotor would have executed them all yes cortal has made his attentions baraka please listen no more tarkatans need to die cortalcon threatens altar cottons fight you lack elegance and grace hear me baraka i speak truth jade liu kang kung lao stand down [Music] speak you've earned the chance shao khan has pitted out world's peoples against one another for millennia and for what the honor of dying in his wars we must fight for each other baraka not with each other kotal wants us death he said as much to my face aid us and i'll make sure you sit at codel's table which do you prefer baraka to be shao khan's slave or kotal khan's trusted ally no one has ever made tarkoten set but these are your words not his help me save kotal khan we'll ask him together he offers less i'll slit his throat if he offers less baraka i'll help you you've suffered too long at this pretender's hands but i've returned and i will save you from his madness only i can reveal the empire all realms will tremble before me outworld will again be cobras [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] where's this boldness been hiding katana had you shown it before i'd have had no need for molina my sister was an unholy monster exactly like you father [Applause] born to privilege which you throw away who are you to judge me you have not known cold or hunger if you had you would value the gifts shao khan gave you fight [Applause] respect my rule uh [Applause] [Applause] be grateful you still breathe [Music] [Applause] [Music] surrender or face the consequences

outworld kitana khan she's now officially out of your league i am humbled from this day on may all our peoples fight together as one [Applause] the news from outworld is indeed hopeful but the location of kronecker's keep remains a mystery it is beyond the realms and has proven to be beyond my sight do you know of kharan raiden koran of course who is kharan master of the ancient ship of the dead sub-zero and i met him during our time as revenants he travels in the space beyond realms transporting damned souls to the nether realm if the keep lies there codon may know its location would he help us it is possible but i cannot be sure i urge you both to investigate we will leave immediately locking down outworld's army is huge but still i'd feel better if we had more manpower the shaolin will join us liu kang and kung lao travel now to aid the monks preparations good i'll be leaving soon to go after johnny and sonia i'll go too we're both going no raiden needs you for an intel op we need to get sonya back undoubtedly but cronica's behavior makes it clear that while mighty she is not all-powerful otherwise why would she attempt to steal ginsei think maybe she's still building strength a distinct probability then what's the next move with the dragon grotto's ginsei fountain sealed there is no greater energy source in earth realm than the well of souls beneath shang tsung's island then we better go check it out i regret that i cannot join you i must keep vigil for signs of kronecker's further tampering with time we all have our duty i am told you defeated shinnok cassandra cage you will defeat the likes of kano but proceed with caution if either johnny or sonja die you will cease to exist it will be beyond my power to save you [Music] [Applause] rise and shine

raiden things will never go back to what they were we all have to choose our destiny luke kang and kung lao weren't kidding about this guy all squads withdraw evac now giris failed when he returns i will strengthen him further for the final battle speak your mind we've lost our khan his outworld army and now the black dragon while raiden's allies have burned precious time fighting kano and shao khan our most important work has continued uninterrupted on shang tsung's island that island is in ruins what could possibly time craft requires an abundance of raw temporal energy every mortal soul contains a lifetime of this power every hour every minute every second lived is stored within shang tsung fed off souls he collected them in his well of souls which remains untouched beneath his island a destiny i crafted for shang song in case i ever had need [Music] will be mine [Music] how's the view no sign yet of the mystical barrier you mentioned oh you'll know it when it comes how you feeling for the first time in a while in control i got tossed into the deep end of this world of gods and monsters but now knowing my future i feel like i finally come up for air those bad things that happened to me i mean will happen to me like raiden said it's gonna be different isn't this good news the things that happened to my dad that trauma he suffered it's why my parents met they fell in love while he was in recovery if they don't happen you and mom may not meet i may never be born jackie i i can't pretend i get all this cosmic time stuff but i do know you are here for a reason you're not just some random accident i hope so [Music] [Music] island here we go again [Music] [Applause] [Music] when i was here for the tournament there were people everywhere these guys looked a lot younger seems like only yesterday guess after shang tsung died this place did too nobody's home so much for needing stealth should have brought the whole squad kind of hoping raiden's wrong about the well of souls i don't want to be here longer than we multiple contacts how many [Music] two but one of them circling us real fast kroneka knew rayden would send someone here give me 10 seconds with this guy jax braves we were partners under quan chi's command you'll join me again got the wrong jacks i haven't been a revenue and i never will fight more fries with that shut up [Applause] time to change it cabal you did not [Applause] you'll not disturb kronecker's work disturb try ending you're done messing with the will of souls you're not as strong as you think jax as i recall sindel made quick work of you i'll take the lady in green [Applause] [Music] was a time when you knew to fight for but between quan qi and kronika your mind ain't right i joined raiden against shao khan he led me to my doom now raiden leads you there too fight [Music] go back to hello man what are you gonna do i'll take my chances with raiden enough dancing with the dead raiden said this well of souls would be underground this way [Music] this is goro's lair thankfully mine is girl shang tsung kept me locked up here back at my first tournament never thought i'd be back remember where a well of souls might be i couldn't tell you i was pretty beat up it's all bit hazy [Music] i'm guessing this is it that crown five bucks says it's chronicles it's drawing souls from the world there's no way that things unguarded let's grab and go before whoever is on duty gets back i never left [Music] yay and i should know who that is the first sub-zero scorpion ripped out his spine left it in a heap upstairs in shang tsung's old throne room an event the new era will wipe from history hang on jackie i got this got that right i'm just that tough fight [Music] fries with that two guess irmak's not the only one who's weak come on let's get that thing and get out of here [Music] [Applause] [Music] dad how do you get here i'll give you one guess dad your your arms those look like cronicas design what are you doing giving you the life you deserve by destroying the universe restarting it not destroying it being a revenant the years i lost the things i did your mind held me together but i was never the father you needed you're talking nonsense man you raised a fine daughter she's one hell of a soldier she shouldn't have been a soldier i never wanted you out there taking those risks if i hadn't fallen apart you wouldn't have felt the need to enlist that's not why i do this dad please give that crown to me i don't want to hurt anybody this is seriously messed up ain't that kid i know i wouldn't want to fight my dad how about we keep this between me myself and i never thought i'd stoop so low you don't know how bad it gets losing your arms was just the beginning i know you suffered you still do but you don't betray your unit and you sure as hell don't betray your family fight with that oh [Applause] there's got to be a way to make this right he's out but he'll recover how are you tripping you ditto we can't leave him let's get him and the crown out of here if i never come back here it'll be too soon i heard that surrender cronica's crowd and the elder jackson briggs no harm will come to you no deal we know you betrayed the elder god cetrion gronika must restore the balance that raiden destroyed can you not see he is the devil in these matters at least he's the devil we know can we take an elder god cassie beat shinnok only because the cages are born with crazy magic powers maybe we have our own magic [Music] stand down please resistance only ensures your suffering what are you doing stand back we don't know what this thing will do [Music] that crown is meant for cronica your human physiology cannot control its power only got to wear this thing long enough to beat you fight uh fries wow [Music] mission accomplished you were warned mere mortals cannot control the crown i did not wish to harm you but now you have forced my hand [Music] [Music] the hell are you doing give me the crown and i will spare her don't don't give it to her go her life is in your hands nobody here wants to hurt anyone now please don't let this happen to our girl [Music] damn it now bring jackie back dad how could you do this to me i'm not doing this to you jackie i'm doing it for you [Music] i love you gronika awaits our return come on this fight isn't over this will bring us our deliverance thank you you both of you i sense apprehension jackson breaks i'm not usually surrounded by so many friendly faces we are unlikely allies united for a common cause worry not lukang katana are the armies assembled aaron roots kitana and i will see that they arrive as planned excellent [Music] [Music] as my strength gathers the new era closer [Music] the report from jacqueline briggs her father's actions have compromised our situation gravely i know i can't i can't believe he did this even if we locate her keep gronika's power now likely exceeds the might of our combined forces maybe we should rethink using chinook's amulet we cannot cassendra cage i've seen what you can do with it you held off the entire nether realm army you weren't even at full strength i dare not risk the temptations of its dark power even now it calls to me despite chronica's advantages we must attack as soon as we know the keeps location it's been hours since we heard from the grand masters what's the plan if they don't come back they must or else hope is lost those warriors must be headed for chronica's keep agreed but why not use karon's fleet the bridge clearly taxes her power the fleet's bound to caught on it sails only by his command that it's still moored suggests he won't help cronica in which case he may help us [Music] it looks like caught on his home perhaps hosting some unwelcome guests return to earth realm tell the others we've found him we'll deploy as soon as i return are you certain karon will aid us no but he's our best chance [Music] [Music] you should have aided chronica caron now you must suffer i am immortal devorah you cannot kill me this one [Music] now chronica you fight for lost causes this one ensures the hive survival you will not save the shrai ryu fight oh oh [Music] this should i like you will not fall land of imposters will indeed fall i've restored the [ __ ] i raised built a clan that's never been stronger are the foundation of pretenders and outsiders kronecker told me [Music] foreign without our original bloodlines there is no [ __ ] our clan's massacre extinguished them kronecker will revive the true [ __ ] in the new era do not trust konica she uses your anger to enslave you as quantity did both of us i let go my rage and it saved me to save yourself you must do the same fight you can't it's past time you were freed we both know what truly drives you it's not should i you it's your wife and child harumi and satoshi were stolen from me murdered seeing them again it's all that matters we share this pain i fought through hell to end it but cronica's new era is not the remedy she would resurrect chinook the same devil who brought death to our family and clan he cannot be allowed to return when i revived the shirairayu i vowed our clan would ensure earthrealm's protection help me keep that promise [Music] ah poison chronicle knew your past sins would distract you now this one ends your misery now you died [Music] raiden is at the fire gardens enlist karan's aid bring raiden's army to the keep you must [Music] it's hot not blood that makes them warriors [Music] you're shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grand master hasashi no if we do not hear soon i will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get raiden the fire gardens they built the shirai nayu are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is grand master hasashi he is dead and now you have come to finish us i understand your mistrust but i am here to assist you i find that impossible to believe fight uh [Music] you misunderstand my intentions who sent you here scorpion my future self is dead i am here at his behest grand master hasashi sent you i honor his dying wish kharan will ferry your armies to the isle of gronika we must leave at once do you have proof of karon's offer only my word your word is worthless at the tournament i trusted you to spare behind and you betrayed me a mistake born of rage i seek redemption lie scorpion you are a slave and cronica is your master fight oh uh [Music] [Music] your falsehoods elsewhere scorpion chronicle will not entrap us it is no trap karan awaits you in the nether realm lord raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out [Music] now scorpion the truth stop this step aside lukang put down the amulet its darkness is taking hold of you our time has run out i do what i must to save earthrealm stay down this is not the way scorpion is not the enemy this time do not interfere fight fate be glad of my mercy do not force my hand lieu kane the realms hang in the balance to defend them i must command order i thought it impossible but the revenants were right you cannot be trusted i do not need trust i demand obedience enough of your madness if you must die sophia this this has happened before [Music] [Music] do not interfere you cannot enough of your madness if you must die so be it uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i have been a fool lukang gronika's puppet we only battle because she wills it i must help him i was wrong to doubt you i too have been a slave to anger i do not understand lord raymond your rage was caused by chronicle yes i succumbed to her influence but then our confrontation it unlocked memories memories not only from this timeline but from timelines that have come before wait a sec timelines plural cronicas restarted time on countless previous occasions using each timeline to learn and to perfect her plan the details of each timeline are different but in each one events conspire to bring lou kang and i into conflict in each one he dies only cronica has such power to control time and fate i don't get it why do that i do not know but be assured cronica will control us no longer at long last you see the pattern the pattern but not the purpose why set me against lou kang is it not obvious your combined power threatens my vision for the timeline lou kang and i will not be divided further by your machinations [Music] do you think this is the first time you made that vow we have repeated this exact conversation so often in so many timelines i have lost count this timeline will end differently we have played out all possible scenarios raiden you cannot win you are welcome to try of course but without lou kang by your side [Music] enjoy these final hours raiden they are all you have luke hey where is he kronecker has taken him to her aisle we must leave immediately to save the realms we must save liu kang [Music] a new look just for me you shouldn't have what do you want from me you will aid in my protection not likely i have mastered sinnok sorcery i will add your soul strength to mine and finally avenge myself upon rain my friends raiden's armies are coming they will fight us and they will lose [Music] lies beyond the fog [Music] [Music] battleships my fairies cannot fight a war this fleet is under my protection if karon falls our fleet cannot sail protect him at all costs so [Music] uh yeah [Music] i don't want to fight but i've got to but jackie's sake and mine fight yet again you failed let me help you kronecker's promises to you are a cruel deception she is the mother of shinnok the architect of your revenant enslavement but [Music] no she's cetrion's mother cetrione is shinnok's sister in kronika's new era shinnok will be the darkness to balance cetrion's light which will only happen if the realms keep on fighting each other [Music] what have i done i'm a fool it is not foolish to fight for your family's betterment i'm sorry raiden i promise to make this right [Music] [Music] uh i have died a thousand deaths to prepare for this battle my defeat is impossible yours inevitable fight [Music] [Music] yet again you failed foreign i will suffer you no more [Music] that is unfortunate for you the sea of blood is bottomless you will fall forever [Music] yeah now do i have your attention raiden the warriors sinking your fleet are under my command you have made a devil's bargain with kronecker frost you ignored me my entire life cronica saw my talent from the start fight hmm you will share shinrok's fate envy and ambition consume you such wasted potential the good she could have done in command of these cyber linguists she commands them not sector if so she is linked to them they follow her thoughts then let them follow her to defeat [Music] [ __ ] [Music] [Music] raiden's fleet nears our shores the two of you will command the army defending the beachhead where will you be land hole [Music] thank you [Music] time after time cronica schemes have pitted us against each other that cycle must end liu kang this time it will [Music] your power is this kronecker's gift a gift to myself you could say you stole your own soul perverted your own nature it's a lesson you taught me raiden to fight my enemies by any means necessary fight yet again you failed i have conquered the darkness within me you must do the same you will have to kill me i would rather see [Music] great [Music] [Music] [Applause] you king i am and i am not what happened to raiden he is part of me bound to my soul he made me a god for now at least a god incredible now he's out of her league my revenant counterpart i have absorbed his knowledge of the key of kronecker's plan i know where to find the hourglass we can beat cronica [Music] out of desperation comes invention i had not thought it possible for raiden to surprise me our success is no longer certain we must make haste [Music] [Applause] [Music] race for impact [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] ah [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] doesn't mean you're back this means i'm sorry jackie in hell yeah i'm back [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] my dad back [Applause] foreign hey um is the battle lost victory is still at hand the hourglass is nearly ready you will prevent blue kang's interference but you will require more assistance whatever happens i am honored to fight at your side likewise okay me too brother may the elder gods protect us [Music] [Music] with raiden has the benefit of novelty but it is also too little too late come on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] regardless your allies are gone while mine remain to defend me finish [Music] ah earth realm's ginsei flows within you let it fuel your fire [Music] ah [Music] ugh [Music] now stand down i have no wish to harm you harley you already killed me my fate was sealed the moment i joined you at raid inside it's a mistake i won't repeat in the new era fight [Music] our bond was no mistake your ego knows no bounds i did not ask for this it was thrust upon me it should have been me lou kang from the beginning thanks to cronica it will be fight um still you are alive yes cronica you were right to fear mine and raiden's powers combined a demigod's power cannot rival that of an elder god cetrion as you wish you match me step by step [Music] because your heart is not in a battle centrion you fight for your mother's vision but as a goddess avert you you know that her desired balance is folly heed me cetrion he lacks our vision and wisdom please no virtue is served by condemning the realms to endless war [Music] the greatest virtue is abiding my mother's will lukang i cannot fail uh club [Music] your heart betrays you i have cetrion you dearest cetrion you have done admirably yet there is one final service to perform yes mother i understand you will be exalted in the new era cetrio and you have failed history rewinds giving way to the new era no the realms as you knew them are undone erased you cannot save a future that no longer exists there is only the new era fight [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] the realms will not fight your endless wars fight me further and your friends are lost they have no future unless i create it the future you offer is not worth living it will not come to pass fight four times [Music] welcome to the dawn of time here history ends and begins again behold the start of the new era [Music] i had intended to leave your destiny intact liu kang until raiden went and made you immortal now you cannot be ignored fight [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] our work is finished liu kang lord raiden i am merely raiden now you have proven worthy to take my place as the new protector of earthrealm once it is restored you honor me raiden the honor is mine lord liu kang the sands of time are now yours to shape it falls upon you to architect a new history the fate of all realms in my hands raiden i cannot do this alone i shall advise you for as long as my mortality allows but have no doubt you are up to the task then together let us begin [Music] cease lukang before you doom us all shank soon before the hourglass shatters even here at the dawn of time you spew lies and deceit we will not hear it in defeating chronica you destroyed her crown without it you can't restart history the hourglass will shatter all realms will be lost fujian is this true cronica's every action was taken to ensure her crown's preparation she would not dare to restart history without it [Music] how do you know this kronecker came to each of us for our help she offered places in her new era for refusing her we were banished to avoid beyond time we could observe the events leading up to your siege of the keep but we were powerless to intervene but then you killed chronica the void seal was broken open permitting our escape via the hourglass if you know so much about the hourglass how do you propose i reset the timeline with the crown the crown is destroyed only in our present not in our past and while i cannot restart history without the crown you can send travelers back into the current timeline i see i must return to the moment before kronecker's defeat end that battle differently so that her crown remains intact that leaves too much to chance chronicle must never possess the crown otherwise you cannot guarantee victory what do you propose sorcerer that you send me into the past to steal the crown from my island before cronica sends to claim it i'll then deliver it to lord raiden and together we'll defeat chronica with a crown an hourglass under our control we can restart history safely why are we listening to this snake because i am a snake who's toiled beside chronicle learning her secrets i know them do you he has a point ready a word [Music] how is it you conspire against cronica did her promises of grandeur not suit you she wanted me to be her porn not her partner she sculpted my entire existence to serve her to collect souls for her crown when my purpose was served she betrayed me casting me into the void your grievance does not fool me shang tsung then trust that we have a shared interest in breaking chronic a stranglehold on our destinies inevitably our interests will diverge this alliance is temporary have no illusions otherwise i understand your misgivings but it is the only way but the risk leukeng will be rewarded say nothing to nightwolf [Music] we will proceed with your plan changson i must stay behind to operate the hourglass but nightwolf and fujin will go with you to supervise i welcome the assistants i will join you no raiden i need your counsel here have faith in 14 and nightwolf if i have faith in anyone it is you brother [Music] i will try to send you back to the time merger you should have enough time to claim the crown before cetrion delivers it to chronicle your confidence is inspiring as the keeper of time i am still a novice may the great spirit protect us you've suffered too long at this pretender's hands but i've returned and i will save you from his madness only i can rebuild the empire all realms will tremble before me outworld will again be conquerors wow [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] where's this boldness been hiding my sister was an unholy monster exactly like you father [Applause] [Applause] when have we arrived immediately after the time merger yes the battle between kotal and shaokar no look [Applause] it's much later than that this is katana's battle with shao kahn then we're almost out of time we must escape quickly changing this battle's outcome could cause cetrion to claim the crown earlier than expected and guarantee our failure let's go uh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] we escaped the battle undetected [Music] or not where have you been hiding you can sort with earth realmers now his business is none of yours collector my business is collecting what shao khan wants he will pay handsomely for you you're outnumbered collector am i [Music] [Applause] these are indeed strange days how do earthrealmers profit by protecting shangsu he shares our goal chronicles defeat you will be partners in death fight uh oh thank you great spirit [Music] do katana has defeated shao khan she always had more ego than skin come let us leave while a crowd is distracted no we're already here later than we wanted to be let's go to your island now and take the crown no detours our rather public arrival at the coliseum makes that impossible chronicles outworld allies will inform her of our presence go to my island now we could be ambushed by cetrion herself and our combined power won't stop her we need help but whose help we can't recruit any of our allies without altering this timeline's events cinderell sindell's a revenant who can be restored to life and who plays no major part in the battles that lie ahead we can safely recruit her without disrupting events it's a tactic chronic has unlikely to anticipate she was shao khan's empress his equal in evil because he had her bewitched returning sindell to life will restore her original more heroic self and if we fail the sindel i knew wiped out most of earthrealm's champions in a single battle if nightwolf hadn't sacrificed himself she would have killed them all and that is the power we need to assure victory against satrian sindel is the key and i suppose restoring her will be easy anything but we can use earth around jinsei to heal cindel's body but to break quan chi spell and revive her soul we will need access to outworld soul chamber you have a different plan night wolf a better one want him to betrayal sorcerer and we will finish you where do we start earth realm to acquire the ginseng [Music] [Music] all were seen in the coliseum how is that possible it should not be those cast into the void do not return [Music] take frost and find them we must discern from when and whence they came that will be sufficient you two may leave i'll stay behind to secure the grotto your aid is not required these traps are excellent who knew the shaolin was so diabolical from you that's high praise indeed shang song calm chronica is keen to question you [Music] [Music] ah ah [Music] [Music] isn't the future frost we've seen it join us on the right side of history the only side is cronicas my place in her new era is assured fight dangerous nothing is assured frost [Music] is he finished i am eternal fujin my will and my strength infinites [Music] oh [Music] huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] of all the night wolves i have fought you are the fiercest it must be why the great spirit chose me to wear the mantle you are also anomalous no one has ever escaped the void fight we fight until you're not fit to survive is that necessary to buy his time we must be rid of him before he recovers [Music] pudging summon the wind [Music] foreign where did you send him chaos realm havoc will keep him entertained let's get to the nether realm we're running out of time to find sin down no sign of sindel not entirely unexpected given that she did not aid in the keeps defense what was her role then if she is such a formidable weapon is it possible that [Music] great spirit what is it my revenant he's close [Music] the great spirit cannot save you [Music] [Applause] [Music] take them to the bone temple night wolf shankson nightwolf shang tsung where are we [Music] raiden's violence against our lord will not go unavenged fuji prepare to pay for your brother's sins sindel you look well death becomes you always the charmer shang tsung i will enjoy feeding lord shinnok your soul [Music] but you night wolf you get the privilege of suffering most only the best will do for the man who killed me i should have saved you hopefully we will today uh [Music] you can't kill me sindel not without killing my revenant i'm not going to kill you [Laughter] as raiden said to lord shinnok there are fates worse than death fights thank you great spirit uh [Music] i can imagine few fates worse than yours [Applause] hmm you will die by your own hands harming me only hurts you my sacrifice will save the mature kronecker has no love for our people the great spirit is a fraud who allowed us to suffer cronica is our future fight time is wasted cronica is not the answer [Applause] we can restore him [Music] must live [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] are you happy now i am healthy night wolf that should be your concern both of you please we must make haste to the soul chamber then let us hurry and hope shiva is eager to aid us as i anticipate escort you and your comrades to the soul chamber yes have you come from the future only to insult me i am no sword for hire this request is far below your present station your highness but defeating chronica depends on us reaching that chamber why because we must restore cinderella my empress [Music] [Music] you've captured her revenant together fujin and i can restore her to life why to make a slave of her as quan chi did so that she can aid us against cronica but you have my vow she will return free of all influence as i recall you were blood-bound to empress cindel i was her protector for life how it must have pained you when she died that was not your fault you could not save her then now you can [Music] then i no we must present this to katana khan respectfully your highness if we approach katana she'll cut shang tsung's head off kitana never appreciated my contributions to the empire like replacing her with an evil clone yes time is short queen shiva we must act now and beg katana's forgiveness later after restoring her mother will you help us by concealing you from katana i betray my oath to her but my life belongs to sindel you will be recognized by katana's imperial guard true they won't take to me kindly that will do [Music] we've made it this far there's a stairway beyond those doors and at the top the soul chamber i feel it so there he was neck deep and [ __ ] towering in the business end of an outhouse he picked a bad place to hide and an even worse place to die [Music] [Music] follow my lead what secret did you plan to bury here it is the khan's business baraka we are equal partners remember the khan's business is my business [Music] you are not shogun i know that scent smells like shame songs [Music] [Applause] [Music] how's that for strange bad what you say we skip the preliminaries and y'all come with us quietly we'll have a nice friendly chat with katana khan there's no time for chat we must get to the soul chamber urgently and go on and get to it but we're taking shane soon and that coffin [Applause] my sincere apologies [Applause] were you not warned tar cottons are all mouth and no ears fight [Applause] oh [Applause]

attached to them fujin sentiment will impede the execution of your duty but warriors like you and i we are strengthened by sentiment we do not fight to kill enemies we fight to protect our loved ones that is why it cuts so deeply when we fail well i'll be maybe you do get it chronica knows your pain she manipulates you with it jacqueline is on her way here cronica expects you to fight her worse even break her heart is that someone who cares one wit about you or your family oh huh [Music] [Music] you were to defeat me i am not finished yet [Music] [Music] or can you fight i'll do what i can cronica offered the future but instead you will have none blame only yourselves for this fate fight back for life it is your fate that should concern you cetrion [Music] oh so [Applause] ah well shang tsung your strategy proved sound after all of course it did that hair so much as twitches ease up baby girl dad how did you get here we're all on the same side against cronica yes and now we must bring this to raiden is that a crown cronicas crown without it she lacks the power to restart history about time we had some good news now that we have this we're in uncharted territory we've changed

him again mother this time i will succeed i must go with shang in possession of the crown he's [Music] shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grandmaster hasashi no if we do not hear soon i will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get

the outcome of the fight against kronecker we can defeat her and fix time i had never thought you gullible brother shang tsum scheme serve only to benefit him how could you fall for such lies be rational raiden spread your falsehoods elsewhere sorcerer you will not deceive us lord raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out the truth braden stop this step aside luke put down the amulet its darkness is taking hold of you you also betray me this is not the way shang tsung is not the enemy this time the realms hang in the balance and you form this unholy alliance enough of this madness if you both must die so be it my brother is my problem i will signal if i need help shinnok's amulet inflames your anger and clouds your judgments have faith in

curse we will face their evidence soon enough what else can you tell us about the final battle we must use every advantage [Music] so i trust you are enjoying your travels you have already been defeated once kronecker of course fujin how else could you have escaped the void if you know this accept the inevitable surrender but clearly my loss was not your victory raiden if your future savior had gained full control of my hourglass we would not be here this timeline would no longer exist i see no harm in confirming your suspicion even if you defeat me what then who claims the hourglass surely you realize that shane soon will break your alliance we are prepared kronecker are you have you wondered why shang knows so much about my crown because he did your bidding gathering souls to fuel it shang is far too is his modest no one save me knows more about its power i told you we would still be marooned at the beginning of time bickering among ourselves you must decide raiden who do you wish to keep time for all of creation me or shang soon neither chronica you will be beaten and if shang soon betrays us we will finish him you are a fool raiden do not condemn the realms to oblivion [Applause] [Applause] it is a mistake challenging a titan now i end your existence [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are vulnerable kronecker [Music] ugh [Music] brother are you all right ah yes
