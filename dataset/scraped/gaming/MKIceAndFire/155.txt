we're going to another realm are you coming with us only for a little while only for a little while we'll use this gratha can't send you said it was broken syndra the dwarf at the foot of these hills he was fixing it when we got here no one was there when i passed by perhaps he finished dwarves are awfully resourceful and irritating based on the two we have met that too tears temple is at the center of the lake it is from there we travel to alpheim thankfully it's no longer underwater why is that creature in the bay no one knows he just appeared one day soon after thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms ultimately it ended in a stalemate and thor returned to odin empty-handed the serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of midgard see told you they've hated each other ever since destined to kill each other come ragnarok you believe in ragnarok i dearly wish i didn't child you know we actually talked to the world serpent you did an exaggeration i'm good with languages even ones i've never heard before but when he talks i can't understand any of it sadly no one can he speaks a dead tongue oh must be longer watch your step just along here you sure we came through here before and there's no way back thought see is that so let me show you something are you watching what it's solid elven architecture my bowstring was soaked in the light of alphaim it can now reawaken the magic of the elves wait it won't just disappear will it not as long as the light shines free this way i want one those roots what kind of magic is that it's vanire from vanahan you know of it just stories mother didn't say much about the vanir gods just that they're always at war with the acer as compared to odin thor they're the good guys there are no good gods boy but i taught you that tears temple built with help from the giants great tear used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them doesn't seem very peaceful everywhere we go we're attacked especially by dead things the risen dead grow ever more numerous once the roads and trails would have been full of people now all have hid or fled save for the reavers savage enough to survive in such a world make a ride at the bottom of these stairs hey another one of those light crystals wait there while i reawaken the light leosta that did it what are we doing exactly mending the disc repair start by lifting that axle good now push it back into place now realign the wheel onto the track perfect now push the bridge along the track what the whole entire bridge is turning how is the whole entire bridge turning boy you're really strong just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position tired yet no he's always been really strong so about the dead we heard someone call them hell walkers but what are they they are poor restless souls denied their judgment and their peace by what if then your magic raised the dead it could once but this is no spell this plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance something or someone has meddled with powerful forces that is all i know for sure that's perfect come back up we're ready now that was impressive you didn't hurt your back did you i did not hurt my back through these doors wait so did the giants or the elves build tears all the races helped with its construction it was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before peace disappeared for good wow your bow strings stop blowing its power is now depleted only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them your bow please once you claim the light of all time infuse the bowstring with its power don't forget you talk like you're not coming with us i'll try but measures were taken to keep me trapped in midgard why the gods don't care for me much is this it it's so dark this temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters it needs only the light of the bifrost to reawaken those roots don't look like your magic they aren't these roots are part of the great world tree and make travel between the realms possible approach the table how does it work you will need this a bifrost to create travel between realms it can capture hold and transfer the light of alpha place the bifrost there what now give it a moment the temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber it is from this room and this room alone that you will be able to cross between realms what you see before you represents the temple in which we stand as well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside all the realms exist in the same physical space reflections of each other these doors the towers outside and the nine realms are all intertwined and co-existing on the branches of the world tree separated only by the bifrost light of alphein this place can focus and control that light and is this the world tree only an artistic representation of it no the yggdrasil is much much more than this the tree of life is bound to the fate of the world just as we are bound to it the tree nourishes our soils the dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers the tree's very existence supports all of creation along its bounds it's life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life birth growth death and rebirth every strand transcending time transcending space everything comes back to the tree so that's how it works but i'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer yes very well the bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of anaheim instead turn the wheel to our actual destination wait is this moving the big bridge outside yes the wheel turns the bridge and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside wait there's no tower on this one and that's why realm travel to ottenheim is impossible without a tower for the bridge to lock into the sequence can't begin every realm has a travel room that unlocks the bridge to that realm i'm giving you the one for alpine now you can lock in your destination we're ready remember to take the bifrost you don't want to lose that now the realm travel bridge will align and the realm between realms will open see that giant crystal each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the bifrost opening the bridge to that realm that's why realm travel is only possible from this room what about that one round town missing from the lake the yottenheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago when the giants vanished from midgard where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery it didn't work we're still here follow me the bifrost is dark this trip was its last use there's no going back until it's replenished with the light of alfheim so we are trapped someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to midgard and we'll be able to make that black breath go away with the captured light of alfheim yes [Music] welcome to alpheim gentlemen think you can spot the light i can barely see it something's wrong see that column of light on the horizon it's housed in the heart of a ring temple we'll find what we need there no no no no damn it not yet what's happening to restore the bifrost magic you must step into the light but be very careful she's not dead is she not likely um look at this place stay by me touch nothing okay what is that i think you killed it look up there whoa what's that about not our concern boy focus what does it say hmm something about an eternal war for the light i don't get it if both sides need it why not just share it greed you will find it a common cause for war [Music] they keep murdering the white house it is war the end of one but the opponents lost [Music] what are they attacking us for we didn't do anything more will come where's this stuff even come from did you say something no oh okay soon we'll be able to translate those moose behinds at least we're getting closer to the light wait is that century oh i could use a distraction be seeing you let's get to it i probably shouldn't let my brother lay hands on it again but if he does tell him to temper his steel longer he's warping the bit work oh oh what'd you say i said nothing really okay did your mother speak of this realm not much just that since the elves are always fighting over hawaii they kept them isolated [Music] huh again i said nothing wait there's one you said something ah what is it boy boy says you don't hear that are you nothing [Music] it's going away now it was screaming lots of voice angry you really didn't hear that no it felt evil [Music] [Music] look should we try talking to them no but maybe they need help they do not stop us so they do not concern us they do not concern us look at that that must be the ring temple [Music] look they have sand bowls and i'll find two [Music] should i read it what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life most pure but i don't see any runes around here ah we must find it back to the boat it's sad the elves can't work things out i'll find such a beautiful place but war makes it ugly you see with the eyes of a child in war a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy the rest of him is lost sometimes never to return you know about war don't you wars are fought for two things survival or advantage battles may be won by the better soldier wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory the blue door has got to be the entrance let's go careful boy what are they doing the bridge is gone they covered the crystal with that stuff why to prevent reinforcements up oh maybe we can fix the bridge from down there okay so that did something i think oh [Music] what is their problem with us we do not belong here wait combined together like that they kind of look like a room it doesn't make sense come back to the sand bowl sundry said mother was a warrior was she in a war too of a sort her family was decimated by hostile rivals and she alone survived she walked the warriors path but her war was to live on to brave an unforgiving world alone and that's why she has syndry and brock to make her the axe she had the strength to wield such a weapon and the wisdom to use it for good she found purpose in protecting the weak so she'd help out the elves no father the pillars in a ring farm in elvish room draw it boy it was the voices again but different voices less angry you're asking for help we are here for the light i do not care who they are nor what they want you never care about anything you have something to say no what's happening whoa look what we found father yes the voices i heard it was hard to make out but way in the back i'm pretty sure i heard mother that is not possible i know what i heard petraeus enough who would i want here look at those horns that can't be good [Music] one more to go yes uh uh be ready [Music] hope that was worth it huh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh okay tricky very tricky think that side hallway will get us to the temple we will find out hmm you were wrong back there i know mother's boys better than anyone who's her she is gone boy speak no more of this fine huh nina [Music] hold on boys thanks god oh uh ugh hey you sure the witch is okay i'd hate to think she died helping us she knew what she was doing okay [Applause] ugh more of it if we cut enough away the bridge above us should reappear right expect resistance right good oh you'll find its weak points oh oh well there it is watch our backs boy uh you're freezing at first we must find a way up i bet there's more where those came from huh guess the light makes more than bridges maybe this will spit us out on top look the blue door we made it you know i will never get used to walking on solid light the door there's no seam what we have a problem these doors do not open hello i don't get it i even have a door then hello come we will find another way in more of those bells a nor near chest must be nearby huh [Music] so [Music] the dwarf again whoa you killed an ancient yes was it difficult yes is that all you're gonna give me yes how are you here before a store we were told our path was the only one between realms well it may be the only way for you to travel but we dwarves are full of surprises that is not an answer ah hang on to that sense of wonder there's so little mystery once you've amassed the wealth of arcane knowledge that i have where to comb the realms for exotic resources how to craft them into creations that defy imagination to the novice i'm sure it all seems like magic but uh oh all right it's magic are you happy now syndry have you always been so clean huh don't i wish no i was just as unsanitary as the next dwarf until the day a van your witch set me straight she discovered with her magic there are hundreds of thousands of tiny beasties on everything around us oh so small you can't even see them no it's true and if they get inside you they make you sick but the witch told me there's one wood the oak that's a natural deterrent stops the beasties from spreading so now i make all my handles from oak see i think of these things okay back to work so how come brock's blue and you're not boy oh it's fine very good question actually you see my brother's not as careful as i am in fact he prefers to work with metals using his own bare hands no gloves says it's the only way he can hear what it wants to be touch enough raw silver and it changes your skin irreparably that means forever i wouldn't bring it up to him though you know how sensitive he can be i guess that makes sense syndra why don't you just make up with your brother already me make up with him because he's an obstinate pig head incapable of change because he says the most terrible things about me just because he's insecure about his own work which let me tell you is subpar because he blames me for for the things that aren't my fault huh like what would you pardon me please i need to collect myself oh what brings you around friends how about you young one where were you even carrying those well um if you don't need it don't buy it i always worry [Music] we're inside of course focus up boys oh uh did i do okay not bad but not good either [Music] [Applause] yes one [Music] whoa now that's impressive [Music] [Music] huh [Music] ah huh look another light up what's he doing oh no why are they killing him he didn't do anything do not assume you are seeing the end of a war boy you do not know what led to this moment but he didn't even defend himself that was his choice we make ourselves [Music] but now the light is near look for a way inside that did it look more light bridges follow me huh oh [Music] here we go he did it you're restoring all the pathways [Music] uh [Music] ah i don't think we're supposed to be in here quiet did you hear that stay alert and by my side hey when we make it to the light how do you think we get it into the bifrost the witch said to step into it she did when she was ripped away from this realm oh i missed that you are more concerned with her safety than our goal quiet i have him your knife that was close do not stray from me boy you don't gotta tell me stay back yes we are near our goal but we must be careful understand god there when it falls be ready we will need to move quickly okay jump boy look out here they come stay behind here protect our flank yes sir done [Music] shorten the time between your volleys superior numbers stay focused boy are you injured i'm fine wow it's beautiful the light it's making the whole temple reappear it's the source of all of it wait it's it's singing i hear a year i told you i heard her do you think she's in there ah i really hurt i felt like my hand was on fire stay here stay here only use it as a last resort you're giving me your axe i am letting you hold my axe it is not a gift ah what is this faye [Music] you have to come back you left me here alone atreus along with him he always leaves he's never here he doesn't want me he never will [Music] i don't know him and he doesn't know me doesn't seem to want to i'm strong i'm smart i'm not what he thinks i am i know better he doesn't talk to me doesn't teach me it should have been him do you hear me him not you [Music] except i don't mean that you know i love him i just wish he was better i know he can so if he tries i'll try but if he doesn't please come back i know you're out there somewhere [Music] um [Music] wait come back no no what have you done why did you do that i saved you you are trapped in there i waited and i waited but you wouldn't come out so i pulled you out boy i was gone only moments no you've been gone a long long time i didn't know what to do you left me here again why don't you care that's impossible we should go before they come back i hope you got what you needed yes look there's our exit but there's no light to make a bridge we're trapped and the witch's bow string is useless boy your bow hold it out [Music] on my mark loose your arrow into the stone it worked we can now make our way back come that stairway's blocked there's a white crystal ahead just laying there maybe it'll help us get out of this stupid place uh [Music] so uh [Music] go ugh finally i like the crystal if you find me an angle let us make our way back up [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh oh where are you taking that boy over here you gonna carry that everywhere i just might oh look the blue door that's not a door and a sand bowl but how do you expect me to reach it oh maybe instead of looting a sacred temple we could just get out of here if i want your opinion boy i will ask for it [Music] now where do we go from here uh [Music] you can reach the bowl now uh-huh uh anytime you're ready what does this mean see remember the shape yeah i know go ahead greatest man or tallest tree begins as any more than me yeah let's see stupid raiders so it's a door after all hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] he will be back [Music] we really gotta go back down here again do you see any other way then [Music] there isn't a way back up from here you know i know all right now i can barely see there's light make two [Applause] [Music] adapt [Music] plan on carrying the crystal everywhere like the last one if need be [Music] ah come on [Music] so uh huh foreign boy shoot i know how it works finally we can use the same sample that brought us down the first time i want to get out of here uh uh foreign god no that can't be what did it say that we made a grave mistake did we help the wrong side all right let me guess you're gonna be smug and say you told me we shouldn't get involved that is enough can we go now do you remember the answer yeah boy read this boy what's that only time you want to talk to me is when you need do you want to tell me something i said the only time you care to talk to me is when you need me to translate for you if mom was if your mother was still alive we would not be here at all latroyas forget it fine [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] go [Music] look uh oh [Music] oh oh come on uh huh [Music] huh oh uh god [Music] hello [Music] my [Music] [Music] oh uh uh [Music] [Music] god aah huh [Music] oh [Music] it's magically locked [Music] uh so so pushing the light until our journey is over one of us must remain focused do not mistake my silence for lack of grief more on how you wish leave me to my own i'm sorry i didn't realize no why would you you do not know my ways i know it has not been easy [Music] in the light i felt only moments pass if that is of some comfort to you that's good to know really so should we go back to midgard face the black breath what do you think there's more to see in this realm father you ever know anyone else who heard voices i knew desperate men at sea who when our supplies ran dry would quench their thirst by drinking seawater they swore the sirens evil creatures singing to them from nearby islands were in fact their wives and daughters calling them home they endangered the crew steering us toward the reefs um how did you fix them we threw them overboard oh well good thing i didn't drink any seawater ready yes it is you're back i see you've been busy how observant i am known for my attention to detail there's an abandoned temple in midgard that a fellow dwarf converted to his personal storeroom packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms throughout the realms which ones did he go to what did he collect fafnir was a shall we say aggressive collector of magical artifacts the more he acquired the more he desired there was no realm too dangerous no relic too hazardous he once ventured deep into niflheim for a whetstone of all things huh i bet that was quite the whetstone does this story have a point yes it does i just happen to have an entry stone to fafnir storeroom you might find something useful in there neat thanks andrew you're very welcome oh and uh if you find that whetstone well it sure would be nice of you to bring it to me i'd advise caution if you're heading to the storeroom last i was there all manner of nastiness had taken up residence won't your friend be upset if we steal all the stuff oh no no not at all he's dead i think oh sorry no no need to be sorry these things happen when one travels from realm to realm collecting priceless artifacts that don't belong to you [Music] good good also remember to breathe and what do you have your eye on oh what more do you do that should tie you over [Music] foreign just make sure you watch each other's backs in the storeroom wouldn't want to lose my loyal customers father i have a confession tonight all those voices in my head well this wasn't the first time back when we met brock his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees that's why she didn't want to cross she told you well i could just feel what she was feeling what she was afraid of it happens again you tell me understand i promise cool what now we have the light to mid guard it's crazy to think that all the realms exist in the same space one on top of the other it's like this room lets us travel without moving brock we just came back from another realm and we met your brother wait not that over did you let that seed saw put hand to your blade you do know he lost his talent right just up and left him one day tried taking me down with him did he botch up on her girl quite the opposite hmm you're leaving a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again but you know what really counts consistency and i got that coming out of all of my parts what did you do it's better sure i'm open sorry you wasted my time do you remember the way back to the black breath of course we need to walk across the bridge to the manheim tower are we going to the black breath or exploring your choice so know any good stories to pass the time what kind of story i don't know mother always had stories weren't you told me when you were a boy there was a man i knew of long ago his stories were brief and purposeful sounds fun do you remember any there was one that concerned a hair and a tortoise like the witch's house unlikely so what happens they wager on a race between them the hare is too confident of victory and foolish while the tortoise is steady and disciplined the tortoise wins you haven't told a lot of stories have you hey it's another brazier i suppose you wish to light it can i boy [Applause] keep it up yes another spirit hello i can't remember the last time i saw something walk these islands that wasn't dead or corrupted what do you mean the desolation child flakes the slat growing more severe with each passing winter do you know its cause i'm not for certain but i suspect the appearance of the world serpents along with the great flood that followed many were drowned myself among them the dead began to walk not long after do you need anything from us boy i only wish to speak to someone again a wish you have just granted thank you yep what hey what did i tell you about offering help don't correct but this is not a debate you must learn focus our journey need be your only concern but what if they can help us that one seemed to know a little about the lake and how does that help us with our goal we won't know unless we ask so oh [Music] oh boy my pain is not your concern uh more time [Music] ugh um but they're different from the others so one more where was a horse the horse sought vengeance upon his enemy a stag but he could not kill the stag alone the horse met a man a hunter and made a deal he took the man's bit and bridle and allowed him to ride in a saddle on his back together they killed the stag and the horse tasted victory but the hunter would not release the horse and made a slave of him so getting revenge cost him his freedom hope it was worth it it was not well well what the brazier if you must yes [Music] tell me [Music] [Music] well done yes never thought i'd see a scrap like that again what do you want to thank you these dead reavers drowned me many winters ago and i've been itching to see them get theirs so you died after all the flooding indeed i came to the lake of nine to pillage tears temple but i underestimated the severity of the desolation have you seen other men living a bearded one with tattoos only the one standing in front of me thank you both for avenging my death useless well we can't expect them all to know something useful [Music] yes what maybe the next one will have more information keep your expectations low boy spirits are rarely useful how do they even exist when you sever a man from his life it is not always a clean cut so you've met other spirits yes many what were they like annoying the world serpent's even over here i told you [Music] so what other stories have you got there was a tale of a frog his pond had dried up so the frog and his son left to find a new home they found a well the sun saw the water and made to jump in but the father stopped him he saw the well was deep and once inside they would not be able to escape if the water dried up again wisely they moved on that's it yes it's really not a story if the sun jumped in it would be a storm he would be trapped starved while the father watched helplessly see that's a story oh treasures from all different realms do you think that fafnir went to i'll find two i do not know we go to the store to collect anything useful for our journey not to learn more about the dwarf [Music] poor fafnir there's a fine line between ambition and greed you know let's get to it don't let the dragger get you [Music] [Music] yep rivers uh oh they must have gotten here first yes [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] there's something up there what's that [Music] boy yes sir another map great looks like the ravers made it inside i hope they didn't take all the treasure [Music] oh no magical treasure and know what stuff keep your expectations low boy and you will never be disappointed they caught you off guard i wasn't expecting them exactly [Applause] um i'm gonna be okay there's nothing but poison in this one and the stupid bird statue and useful resources the main reason we are here boy however many of these chests have been emptied probably by the reavers i hope they didn't take cindy's what stone i have a good feeling about this next one maybe we'll even find the wet stuff remember what i told you about expectations boy i remember still good feeling oh so much for my good feeling focus up boys i was ready for them this time i saw so i should keep my expectations low but always expect an attack it is a delicate balance expect the worst assume nothing and always anticipate an attack sure is a lot to remember [Music] and only one room left i know i shouldn't hope but you think we'll find it there no huh so you back to piss on my corpse you ungrateful little ah who are you two we're looking for a wet stone have you seen it i there was one in this room my son sharpened his dagger on it right before stabbing me in the back what little bastard thought it was his turn to lead my crew i was hard on him sure guess i shouldn't be surprised i did the same thing to my dad when i was his age he killed his own father where is he now he may be a bastard but he's my bastard you'll get no help from me fool then his dagger will help hey that's mine harry come boy we are leaving oh [ __ ] well done that was good right better [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] kill his own father over some treasure seems so greedy remember what i told you boy assume nothing well sure he didn't seem like a great father but you only know half the story gosh yep um oh you uh didn't happen to find that wet stone perchance we found a whetstone this dagger belongs to the river who took it they took most of the good stuff oh well here take this in exchange for the dagger the dagger you brought me is quite interesting and artless design but the construction is sound where in the temple did you find this inner river is back oh oh he mentioned he was part of a larger clan maybe they took the wood stone quite possibly i know i've seen this design before what speaks to you it's a sad day for your enemies well that's something and what do you have your eye on and we're back to you [Music] [Music] [Music] oh so what other stories have you got one more there was a young man who was caught stealing and condemned to die his mother came to visit his prison she was a kind woman who could only give love but her son the thief met her with rage and bit off her ear what what because the boy had always been a thief and his mother had taught him only love and nothing of consequences had even taught discipline instead he might have lived longer sure but her ear that's not right should we dock [Music] [Music] [Music] boy yes sir uh i speak with you remember spirit you want something from us what's wrong i came to this lake with a group of tradesmen seeking refuge from the desolation but how could we know it was even worse at the lake of nine we cannot undo your mistakes spirit i know that but i fear for my captain and crew i believe they are still under the water will you find them for me is there anything you can offer us in return i i have little to offer oh well i'm not sure wait i died wearing a valuable family heirloom it's yours if you promise to find my crew dear thank you you are learning why didn't your mom ever tell me about the desolation i won't speak for your mother but it was never my concern or should it be yours doesn't it concern us if everything around us is dying our only concern is reaching the peak really then why are we exploring all these islands the resources we find improve our equipment if we stray from the path it is only to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead i can live with that if it means we keep exploring and helping others hey this does more than decipher those muslim runs it also contains the travel room should we go visit the fire realm [Music] i wonder if the world serpent even knows part of his body's laying over here so what other stories have you got there was the story of the mother crab who scolded her son she told him he should walk forward and cry not sideways as he always did but she's a crab too you should say sure i'll look for it as soon as you show me how yes he did say that that was the story i got it oh now um i can read what this says now but it's a name the name made it light up it is not a name i know me neither huh so oh oh hmm one more for the collection did you see something out there that tower i see no tower maybe i'm seeing things should we knock on this beach oh [Music] god [Applause] ugh done look boy over here sir another map that we'll find something useful here come and face me god of thunder your challenges mean nothing to the god spirit they do not listen do not mock my pursuit of vengeance though my family devoted their lives to worshiping thor i've devoted mine to his downfall and i will start with that statue running over my father's grave unlikely you are dead is there something we can do for a reward of course if you bring down the statue you have my blessing to loot my father's grave he rests on an island to the east why do you hate doors so much after my father passed my mother built the statue to watch over his grave imagine our surprise when the god of thunder himself came to offer condolences first we were thrilled that he quickly took advantage of our hospitality my mother begged him to leave and thor in his drunken rage killed her i was left with nothing but grief eventually i lost that as well and found only rage in its place i i'm so sorry come boy we have a statue to destroy huh so my father's grave lies on an island to the east do not mistake my mother's statue of thor with that monstrous eyesore to the south oh yeah that's the answer yep [Music] what realm you just shaking off let me guess all fine how'd you guess i'd know that smell anywhere used to spend my fair share of time there but uh i ain't allowed anymore on account of the uh incident what happened well ain't too sure your daddy's gonna like me talking about it on account of all the swearing and stealing and flicking involved what don't judge me you're the one came in all wreaking of elf stirs up a man's memories go on now i got things that ain't gonna hammer themselves now you're talking okay that'll hold you for now yeah next time look we wrote past that statue of thor earlier when we left the wishes and what direction is that it's mid morning the sun is in there so that's south southwest good another name rocha i told you we should come back with the cipher oh look the witch's magic is still covering those scorn poles saves us some time huh interesting huh i'm feeling creative today you don't need to make excuses to say hello [Music] so uh ready yourself tell me when father do you do you think i could carry here now no but i i said no okay so who do you think carve the face in the mountain you would know better than i thanks now watch your step carelessness will only delay us right well there's a black breath again what do we do now we see if the witch was right it's working she was right go let us finish this [Music] [Music] [Music] then we climbed you know others said the giants used to visit the midgard mountains before they disappeared disappeared yeah i guess they just up and left one day no one knows why perhaps they returned to their home kyodan maybe i wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important giant the mouth we made it more black breath [Music] giants did come here where are we going the entrance was back there are you in a hurry no but you normally are i'm happy to keep exploring you want to leave already you just got here is that idea i don't remember stories of a giant with a deer head i wonder who he is the floor boy that doesn't mean anything something's missing think what does it say no your beast nor fearful throw nor rooted tree that's no my call nothing [Music] is this place must have been important to the giants it's like they're testing us okay that looks right i can almost make it up is it the answer freedom sure that works go ahead sure we're also what you doing oh i thought maybe there'd be a bridge ah your giants need to test us further there's a crystal that tortoise should i let it that helps right guess we have to go down these passages seem too small for giants why do you laugh i am always serious i forget mom always said you never took an interest in history giants are just a race like it doesn't mean they're big one of the worlds of it okay in that case giant also means big there's only one [Music] can we keep moving um [Applause] uh ready uh [Music] you are more uh [Music] uh this is a lot of bodies oh ah huh [Applause] huh [Music] boy another light crystal just look at this place it feels so dead i was gonna say

light eyes open hello stop that come on i was just okay whoa what is all this where are we mine and if this claw reaches the summit our goal is near all right how do we use it i think i see how this works the claws on one side and if we get this unstuck oh no i think the rope stuck under that rock that was careless yes sir sorry sir stop maybe we can find out getting rid of those things i'm ready it is over well that's not going anywhere you had a way around the black breath all along now don't go thinking i could have gotten you past getting a big sack of meat i got ways around most everything especially up here time was my folk had the run of this joint improve the design of the yodnar traps and built workarounds to boot why you think they're so devious oh they remind me watch
