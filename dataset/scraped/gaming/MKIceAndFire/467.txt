hey so [Music] let's go foreign right behind you ship what's good just lead the way oh how did you get in here i didn't think there was any way past the barrier we blasted through with the mining laser of course yes that makes sense please get me out of here before morgeth arrive that button over there should shut down this containment field any idea how we get out of this place there is an elevator back in the center of the tower at least i i think it's an elevator it should take us out of here come on i i still cannot believe all this why would the guest come after me do you think benezia's involved saren's looking for the conduit you're a prothean expert obviously he wants you to help him find it the conduit but i don't know [Music] what the hell is that these ruins are not stable that mining laser must have triggered a seismic event we have to hurry the whole place is caving in joker get the normandy airboard and lock in on my signal on the double mister aye aye commander secure and away eta eight minutes if i die in here i'll kill him surrender or don't that would be more fun we don't have time to deal with this idiot charge i like your attitude so [Music] move [Music] too close commander ten more seconds we would have been swimming in molten sulfur the normandy isn't equipped to land in exploding volcanoes they tend to fry our sensors and melt our hole just for future reference we almost died out there and your pilot is making jokes sometimes joker's a real ass just try to ignore him i see it must be a human thing i don't have a lot of experience dealing with your species commander but i am grateful to you you saved my life back there and not just from the volcano those geth would have killed me or dragged me off to saren what do you know something about the conduit only that it was somehow connected to the prothean extinction that is my real area of expertise i have spent the past 50 years trying to figure out what happened to them how old are you exactly i hate to admit it but i am only 106. damn i hope i look that good when i'm your age a century may seem like a long time to a short-lived species like yours but among the asari i am barely considered more than a child that is why my research has not received the attention it deserves because of my youth other asari scholars tend to dismiss my theories on what happened to the protheans did your research turn up anything interesting what is interesting is what i did not turn up there is remarkably little archaeological evidence of the protheans and even less that might explain why they disappeared it is almost as if someone did not want the mystery solved it is like someone came along after the protheans were gone and cleansed the galaxy of clues but here is the incredible part according to my findings the protheans were not the first galactic civilization to mysteriously vanish this cycle began long before them what cycle what are you talking about the galaxy is built on a cycle of extinction each time a great civilization rises up it is suddenly and violently cast down only ruins survive the protheans rose up from a single world until their empire spanned the entire galaxy yet even they climbed to the top on the remains of those who came before their greatest achievements the mass relays in the citadel are based on the technology of those who came before them and then like all the other forgotten civilizations throughout galactic history the protheans disappeared i have dedicated my life to figuring out why they were wiped out by a race of sentient machines the reapers the the reapers but i have never heard of how do you know this what evidence do you have there was a damaged prothean beacon on eden prime it burned a vision into my brain i'm still trying to sort out what it all means visions yes that makes sense the beacons were designed to transmit information directly into the mind of the user finding one that still works is extremely rare no wonder the geth attacked eden prime the chance to acquire a working beacon even a badly damaged one is worth almost any risk but the beacons were only programmed to interact with prothean physiology whatever information you received would have been confused unclear i am amazed you were able to make sense of it at all a lesser mind would have been utterly destroyed by the process you must be a remarkably strong willed commander okay this isn't helping us find saren or the conduit of course you are right i am sorry my scientific curiosity got the better of me unfortunately i do not have any information that could help you find the conduit or saren i don't know why saren wanted you out of the picture but i think we'll be a lot better off if we bring you along thank you commander seren might come after me again i cannot think of anywhere safer than here on your ship and my knowledge of the protheans might be useful later on and her biotics will come in handy when the fighting starts we've already got every other non-human species on board might as well add in a sorry to the team thank you commander i am very grateful oh i am afraid i am feeling a bit light-headed when was the last time you ate or slept dr chockwash should take a look at you it is probably just mental exhaustion coupled with the shock of discovering the prothean's true fate i need some time to process all this still it could not hurt to be examined by a medical professional it will give me the chance to think things over are we finished here commander go see the doctor the rest of you dismissed mission reports are filed commander you want me to patch you through the council patch him through joker setting up the link now commander we've received your report commander i understand dr dasoni is on the normandy i assume you're taking the necessary security precautions liera's on our side the geth we're trying to kill her benezia would never allow saren to kill her daughter maybe she doesn't know or maybe we don't know her we never expected she could become a traitor at least the mission was a success apart from the utter destruction of a major prothean ruin was that really necessary shepard the geth were crawling all over those ruins we were lucky to make it out alive of course commander the mission must always take priority good luck commander remember we are all counting on you [Music] shh [Music] i prefer gold to silver you know for my metal i figured you'd recommend me for one since i uh pulled your boots out of the fire i want to talk about something else oh i get it it's supposed to be a surprise don't worry when they pin it on my chest i'll pretend i had no idea was coming so commander why don't you tell me why you're really here how's the normandy performing is she everything they said she'd be she's the best ship in the fleet if you've got a pilot who knows how to handle her balance isn't what you'd expect takes a while to get used to that oversized drive core we got stuffed in the back and a power can sneak up on you if you're not careful the normandy's probably too much ship for your average alliance pilot commander lucky for you i'm anything but average i have to go all alright see you [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] message coming in patching it through commander shepard my name is nasana dantius i have a job for you i can't say anymore in an unsecured communication if you're interested in hearing my offer meet me on the citadel so we can talk in person i'll be waiting in the diplomats lounge on the presidium [Music] approach control this is the ssv normally requesting a vector and a birth normandy arrival was not scheduled our defense grid is armed and tracking you state your business citadel business we got a council spectre board landing access granted be advised we will be confirming identification on arrival if confirmation cannot be established your vessel will be impounded what a fun bunch i think i'll take my next leave here equalizing interior pressure with exterior atmosphere logged the commanding officer is ashore exo presley has the deck that's far enough something wrong officer you better hope there isn't this is an unscheduled arrival i need your credentials you first we're the law here show some respect i'm captain maiko matsuo atlantis risk control services i'm a spectre my name is shepard load of horse crap ma'am we will need to confirm that also i must advise you that firearms are not permitted on ovaria sterling secure their weapons [Music] don't try it let's not start a fight why not captain matsuo stand down we confirmed their identity specters are authorized to carry weapons here captain you may proceed spectre i hope the rest of your visit will be less confrontational parasini-san will meet you upstairs behave yourself i am gianna parasini assistant to administrator analyst we apologize for the incident in the docking bay i appreciate your help you're welcome you understand our security chief was only doing her job one of my duties is orientation of new arrivals do you have any questions pretty heavy security for small port the executive board does everything in its power to protect the privacy of our client corporations i'm not here to dig out any corporate secrets that's gratifying to hear has anyone unusual pass through here recently unusual and a sorry matriarch passed through a few days ago lady benezia saren's aid is here that's through where is she now benezia left for the peak 15 research complex days ago to the best of my knowledge she's still there that's where i need to be then you'll need to ask administrator analysis for clearance to leave this port where can i find the administrator his office is on the main level left at the top of the elevator understood can we go in now of course if you need any help you can ask me at the administrator's office commander it might be wise to bring dr dasoni along she knows her brother better than any of us welcome to port hanchan the galaxy's most respected site for independent scientific research and development for your own safety and to protect the privacy of others you are required to obey any directions given by our security personnel if you have questions or concerns our friendly administrative staff is always available thank you and enjoy your stay every time i come here there's a damn this one offers greetings you are the specter that visits port hanchan news travels fast here indeed esteemed spectre your arrival was not greeted with any joy by the companies here this one has a burden that you could ease if an arrangement could be made it would compensate you this one has procured a special item for a customer the item is not permitted within the station but you could bring it through customs you want me to use my status to smuggle for you that is not inaccurate i have no problem with that this one humbly thanks the spectre the package will be delivered to your vessel all you need do is bring it to this one please do not mention this to administrator analysis that one would levy fees is there anything else this one might help you with could i buy something now is there anything in particular the spectre is looking for [ __ ] uh how can i help you how large are the facilities here we have 17 research complexes built into the mountains each is a self-sufficient facility housing a staff of hundreds tell me about the companies that work on novaria over 250 high-tech firms rent our labs major shareholders include elanis risk control services binary helix and synthetic insights limited binary helix they work in genetics bh is a leader in genetics and biotechnology they try to keep a low profile in the media much of their research is in biotic modifications that angers many luddite organic baseline and fundamentalist groups i'd like to speak to analysts one moment please mr analyst yes what what commander shepard is asking to see you sir right fine come in you will excuse me if i don't stand up i have no time to entertain refugees from that urban blight called earth i see you looked up my service record only a fool enters negotiation without knowledge of the other party's tendencies this greeting is a courtesy i will only cooperate as required by the executive board businesses come here to avoid the second guessing of galactic law are you telling me you have no safety protocols don't be ridiculous do you think a for-profit company would take no precautions against loss of life and material project leads have the final say here not meddlesome politicians do you do business with saren agent seren one of your specter compatriots he's a major investor in binary helix corporation which is one of noveria's backers is binary helix developing weapons for him it's possible given his interests what our clients do in their labs is their business opeld wants me to smuggle a package through security i need more than your word to act on that bring me whatever he's smuggling and i'll act accordingly what will you do for me in return i would compensate you the precise amount in credits depends on the severity of opol's crime so you'll arrest him no one here is fond of trials they make shareholders nervous more likely we would simply let him go of course he would be blacklisted by the companies here i'll look into it and get back to you i appreciate your report i've heard an asari matriarch is here benezia she arrived a few days ago accompanied by a personal escort and some cargo she's up at peak 15. what do you mean personal escort the phrase is self-explanatory bodyguards attending to the safety of her person mainly asari commandos commandos you didn't think that odd they followed all our regulations i had no reason to forbid lady benezia from taking them i'd like to see her immediately i'm afraid that you cannot peak 15 is a private facility in the scotty mountains regardless there is a blizzard in the area shuttles are grounded and surface access has been cut off surface access you say cut off i said the roads are not suitable for travel don't make an issue of this shepherd forget him commander if he won't help us i'm sure someone else here will i have no more questions at this time good i received a dozen urgent messages while you gathered about mr analyst isn't the only one with the pass to leave hanchan you've never worked in the corporate world have you commander you can't bludgeon through bureaucracy all right what would you do talk to lauric keane you should be able to find him at the hotel bar can't say more not with an earshot of mr anileus you said i should talk to laura keane mr anileus isn't the only one with a pass to leave han chan kean spends his days at the hotel since his office was closed i've taken up enough of your time not at all spectre this is my job after all so corporations here hire their own private security forces it makes it easier for them to break the [Music] laws afternoon sit down have a drink what can i do for you are you lauric keane i've heard you might be able to help you are the specter that just arrived are you not what can old turian like me possibly help you with what makes you think i'm a specter your picture has been sent to every employee they've been warned that speaking to you is grounds for termination loric keane for the moment i'm the manager of the synthetic insights office for the moment mr anileus closed my office he claims to be investigating reports of my corruption the administrator is an interesting man he's become quite wealthy since he took direct control of rents i sense a connection there indeed i acquired evidence of analysis actions his hired goons are ransacking my office to find it i suspect your goal lies outside this port mr analyst would be disinclined to let you wander if you recover the evidence from my office i will give you my garage pass as well as a sum of credits that sounds like a fair trade violence against mr analysis thugs may be necessary he has members of han shan's security team searching my offices he's paying him under the table miss matsuo is unaware of their outside employment if he's paying them under the table they're mercenaries i can kill mercenaries excellent here is my pass into our offices it will activate the elevator the evidence is on my office computer this osd contains an encryption key to access it slide it into the drive and it will auto execute oh and do try to keep blood stains off the carpets would you [Music] watch your step your ship technically china shhh shhh freeze hand shun security this office is sealed what are you doing in these offices the administrator's orders laura keane is under investigation i'm going in there and i don't want to hurt you why don't you just go we'll pretend this never happened you want to cause [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh uh [Music] so i don't think you're supposed to be in here shepard you have me at a disadvantage miss oh now you're gonna show some respect i'm sergeant kyra sterling elanis risk control services analysis would throw you off world for what you did here i won't you know what we did to cop killers on my world your men are dirty sergeant you're here off duty breaking the law for bribe money i didn't want to fight them they fired first well i don't need to rip you to pieces [Music] so [Music] take out those hostiles not now shepard [Music] so watch your step your ship these people will smile to your face while they stab you in the back commander there have been reports of noise from the synthetic insights office would you know anything about it speak plain what's your interest not here spector meet me at the hotel for a drink before you talk to kean i'll be waiting shhh i used to get a lot of freelance business here fastest way to climb corporate ladder is excuse me i need a moment of your time the male human at the hotel bar he's a sales rep for binary helix his name is rafael vargas i need you to speak with him do you know who i am everyone here knows who you are dalstone that makes you ideal for my job you are a known quantity or so vargas will think he will assume you are here to investigate his company's dirty laundry that will distract him from your my real intentions [Music] strange people skulking in corners have gotten me in trouble before i represent the aramaic city council on pessia our town is known for its biotic amp crafters what's your interest in binary helix they do genetics work much of bh's work relates to biotics there are rumors that the novaria branch has flown in asari biotics powerful ones commandos to be specific we want to assess any potential risk to asari copyrights you will present yourself as a buyer on behalf of the spectres or the alliance discuss their military enhancement programs your real objective will be to distract him i will give you a device that will crack into his personal wireless network it will upload a variety of monitoring viruses they will infiltrate binary helix when he logs onto their intranet what's in it for me money of course i would be well paid for this so would you 500 credits [Music] you think this uniform is just for show my job is to enforce the law not break it do you think that binary helix obeys all the laws that they do not spy on other companies what they might be doing somewhere else doesn't justify my acting against them here very well spectre i'll be on my way can i help you can i help you allow me to reintroduce myself parasini noveria internal affairs [Music] what do you want the executive board knows about analysis corruption i've been undercover for six months i want you to convince keane to testify before the board with his evidence this planet can run profitably again why don't you ask keem directly i'm annelise's secretary you think he'd believe me that he'd meet me in some dark alley with his evidence [Music] i thought corruption was the rule on the very end the rule is don't rock the boat self-interest is tolerated if it doesn't interfere with business analysis is driving customers away i need teen's garage pass to complete my mission you help my investigation i'll provide whatever you need favor for a favor analysis is dirty it might be best to help look shepard i don't like this either you specters play fast and loose with the law that's bad for business all right i'll talk to keane and see if i can convince him [Music] thank you you know where i work come talk to me once you know if he'll play ball always a pleasure specter any news on that matter i asked you to look into [Music] i finished the job but an internal affairs investigator contacted me she wants you to testify against analysts now that you have my property you want to dictate how i use it i have no interest in a public spectacle everyone on this station is chafing under analysis extortion you might end up a hero [Music] my employers rely on the goodwill of the executive board to work here the board is investigating analysis they'll be more angry at him than any all right it is obvious that i cannot dissuade you very well i will testify make whatever arrangements you need with your contact i will wait here [Music] [Music] so [Music] corporations here hire their own private security forces it makes it easier for them to break the laws that way [Music] spectre have you given any more consideration to my offer it takes some persuasion but keen has agreed to testify that's a world of stress off my back i'll take the evidence for safe transport i didn't think you'd help me being a specter and all i guess some of you can be all right so how about getting me into the garage while you were working on keen i got you a garage pass be careful up there i have an arrest to make wish i had time to change into something easy to move in i hate skirts this is an outrage i'll see that you never work in this sector again yeah yeah get a move on you shepard i demand you place this [ __ ] under arrest you have the right to remain silent i wish to god you'd exercise it i owe you a beer access to the garage is restricted i have authorization excuse me yes that's genuine drive safely the weather's supposed to be pretty bad out in the elutes valley [Music] so that's what
