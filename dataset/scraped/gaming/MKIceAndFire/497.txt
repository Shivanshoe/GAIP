is said that he is not the only monster that lives in those waters the fourth and most dangerous is heisenberg he works in his factory on the village outskirts and the project let's just say parts of the human imagination are better left alone if you truly wish to save your daughter you must first gather the four flasks i'll do you a personal favor i've marked the lord's locations on your map some

seat catalogs all of us however she will be reborn as my daughter she's my child not yours where are you show yourself why did rose come to be was it because of her parents and you are truly a special case but i've learned all i can for you your worth as a lab rat has run out miranda you coward come on and face me don't worry your death will come quick you will join the mega my seats records i will make sure to sample your blood for later once dawn breaks the ceremony will be complete and i will become her true mother bound for eternity [Laughter] i've waited so long but dreams really can come true best or not i can't wait to see my true child again captain i've confirmed the death of ethan winters i wasn't able to retrieve the body but i've recorded evidence share your screen and i'll go over the situation my team and i were careless yesterday we took down the transformed miranda but we didn't kill her who knew she could fake being a corpse since miranda could have infected ethan i forcefully took him and rose with us but the vehicle they were riding in was attacked when i got to the wreck ethan and rose were gone the last time i was able to contact ethan i heard miranda's voice murdered him and she is not gonna get away with it god damn it when does it end what's that sir the mission all of it three years trying to put this thing in the ground three years too long we'll get her captain so bsaa got here already they didn't waste any time mission adjustment no it doesn't change anything terminate miranda and rescue rose that's the mission and failure's not an option let's have some fun people like old times move out roger k9 i want to know what the hell bsaa is doing here find out what you can roger that i'm alright in a while since we fought together captain when was the last the desert doing nothing but recons gotten me out of shape but thanks to your recon we know miranda's plan couldn't quite believe it when i heard you turn yourself in the mia though taking five shots to the head's nothing to sneeze at either spooky hey alpha look at this yes haley they've gone too far christ looks pretty rough down there how are you planning on reaching the objective first we're gonna have to take that thing out i've got your back boss let's get to work everyone watch for hostile bio weapons roger made contact with a group of hostile fire weapons eastern route is bsaa craft spot two guards don't get cocky [Music] what the hell is that thing it's all new to my seat that's probably where miranda is let's go large mutated fire weapons [Applause] may be releasing infectious particulates keep your mars assorted hey boss it's me i'm at the location preparing for support fire might be a minute roger tundra here leaving some supplies in one of the houses captain help yourself i see you 200 to the point [Music] i've never heard of a mutant yet [Music] oh hey boys [Applause] [Applause] like hey my mom saw this [ __ ] she thinks she died i've reached the target location damn this is big all right lobo marking the target roger that boss all right reloading now just a minute there's a swarm headed that way [Applause] ready when you there must be something stimulating [Applause] two i'm sure they're thinking and keep the laser on it as long as you can find more from the mountains east side i'm nearby i'll handle them is [Applause] wow i'm reloaded [Applause] just point the laser on the target take that good mega mice must be below i found a way down i'm going in the rest of you stay back captain i compared the mold at the village with a sample from the bakers and there's no sign of the genome editing we saw in the e-series the stuff originated here ugh there's an opening in the roof use it um drink reloading now just a minute um hmm hold your horses i'm reloading foreign next ripping the next round i'll keep going the rest of you stay above ground so if miranda was the fake mia where's the real one i doubt she saw any further use for her i don't get any of this how did miranda even know rose exists the moldy little bird told her maybe we can figure that out later focus on the plan i found it it's the mega my seat out for the squad i've located the mega my seat so now we can end this mess after all about damn time and two explosives armed there's enough there to blow the whole village sky high let's get out of here and blow the damn place not before i end miranda i'm not taking any more chances i'm going in captain i have eyes on miranda at the ceremony site keep your distance do not move until i give the order i know it's too late now but we really should have told ethan the plan there wasn't time we didn't expect miranda to act so soon even so you should have told him this must be miranda's lab so spencer here no way so they're using this to control the bio weapons show me your hands i'm bryce this is alpha where is miranda right now god damn it really is you i'm glad you saved me why are you here i was caught and used houston experiments in the flesh what's the situation up there kind of a war going on nothing we can't handle don't get distracted stick to the mission i'm headed to the ceremony site wait you
