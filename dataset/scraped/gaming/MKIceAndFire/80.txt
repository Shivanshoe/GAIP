to revive the relics then extract their magic so that sort of might use it in some way and you could not how [ __ ] dare you of course i could but not for [ __ ] like him of course claude was too dim to see that i was dispelling the magic rather than storing it and as soon as i knew you were coming i gutted the relics rendered them useless so no mighty weapon for that prick suitor it is unwise to underestimate such an enemy but you were short-sighted if aldi i could have made good use of that magic well if it's items of power you seek during my imprisonment i heard rumors surter is building something something small yet very very potent and highly valuable to him so valuable that if it were to fall into your hands you might do some real damage here i think music to my ears i will seek

your people oh it's a tragedy no doubt but life's about searching for that glimmer of gold i'm happier here than i ever was before i would welcome a glad tale i've been few enough of late i'm a blacksmith good as any man but you try telling that to them up there if you don't have hairy forearms and a beard they'll go somewhere else business was bad no one gave me a chance thought a woman's hammer toil was inferior those clod-brained dunces then the invasion we fled to this shelter and i'm the only smith down here are they paying attention now you bet they are the finest armor the sharpest swords they sing the praises of elga the smith now just sad so many had to die for them to see it [Music] oh [Music] find him [Music] [Music] sail out hmm this wave will take me this looks like a bird's list must be on the right track a shelter must yes the dwarves hide their path in plain sight fix up your boat or don't makes no odds to me have you got any new designs for me i would like to see what you have in stock anything else your enthusiasm is quite inspiring oh is it that's nice are you buying something i'll come back later [Music] let me make art of your skin a sculpture of your hair the plight of your people has not dampened your spirits it seems the surest cure for sadnesses to make many and we have made mary indeed what have you got anything else does it not prick at your conscience to feast in this place of plenty while your kin starved throughout the realm should i be miserable because they are to each their fate mine was to find sanctuary here beneath the bountiful tree i will enjoy what time i have till better days come or not another time look around there's got to be a tank that we can tongue a few drops out of don't let me interrupt you look am i pissed or does the all father stand before me both [Laughter] this this is good and the wise one will surely help solve our problem let us help one another what exactly is the source of your grief here rhymes rhythm oh we could use your poet's heart my what your words your gusto we the greatest of the sons of evil aldi i need a fitting end to the song well rn i'm here to understand how you might help me strike back at sutra strike back nonsense besides it is not only he we must contend with but his kin his daughter asa stars above snatches up our people works them to death an unwinnable war all that's left to do is eat drink shag and seal our legacies exactly but as is clear as day we have drunk ourselves to hell and no crying sticks the way it should so it must be you who completes the song of our saga mine and loms that is not why i've come of course it is faith has brought you here we are to be remembered and revered by all yes with javi among us we must adjust the final verse listen closely the depths of spartalheim great javi came met with dwarves he knew not by name in search of warriors without remiss instead found cowards who reek of piss and not quite what i was thinking let's try you call yourself the sons of evild why to [ __ ] on his name brammer i don't think he means to lend his words to our song go away boom your words carve a deep wound but they are true enough each day we see our numbers dwindle trends go out do not return choice to forget this alluring sutra has stolen my son and i do not have the luxury of forgetting you said suits her as a daughter yes clever cunning commands an elite swath of warriors she oversees sorter's operations here wherever i find her there is a smeltery of the road the dwarves there may not i'll go there see what your people know luck i can travel trade her life for my sons thank you premier i'll tend to your people as a true son of evaluation i need you i will you will bear the thrust of our fury she will regret having ever followed her father into swanton do we always get turned into food this is a terrifying card good to see you somewhere safer hi warren good to see you again here something to show my appreciation for saving my life this is unnecessary but thank you more of these live i should do something about that you shouldn't be here host father mighty poet chooser of the slain the raven god whom they call oscar sigir harvey i know my names friends and they are many but what is yours i am ori son of nori son of gory also son of gory they have the same name you see a baguette of fimber who was sired by foamer third child of bomber and then there was kubrak voldy gory again ori you said well that's right son of nori something else your pride in your family does you credit any of them here with you oh no dead a lot of them father he was crushed when a cow wandered off a cliff and landed on him grandma a bird said her face she fell off her pony and ran herself over with her own cart grandpa lost his razor so he tried shipping with his axe instead you can imagine how that went that is quite a streak of misfortune exactly bad luck runs in the family prone to misadventure you might say still i made it down here when the invasion began feasting and idling all day long so maybe my luck has turned at last [Music] but i heard that hello there welcome looks as though we have a guest of honor come to join us in our final moment of respite taiwan is that the sorry side i see before me i'll piss off with that high and mighty aura you will not dampen our mood of that i'm sure this is quite a feast for so desperate a time bountiful food bountiful ale bountiful women would you be anywhere else you make a strong argument excuse me you're looking for the blacksmith he's out went on an expedition he said you're looking for the plattsmouth he's out he went on an expedition he said ugh greeting stranger you've got the look of one who knows how to throw a line i would have thought you had a little need of help in this place of plenty it's true the fish came easy from that lake too easy we ate our fill and more and we thought they'd last forever we were wrong bring me fish from outside stranger from the places we dare not go i'll reward you well i have something that may interest you need something more i'll return another time you can't help death may have to carry us into the next realm a hubble full of weighty dwarves the burden alone may prove too much don't drink with me come back last year life taker yourself dirty [ __ ] [Laughter] i should put it to the test surely his beloved daughter's life is worth baldur's freedom the dwarves of the smelting camp maybe they can help me hunt down that princess hmm that stink smells worse than evil these forge asgard let's see what these storms can tell me about acer no no you toil as if tomorrow will never come is this the pace acer demands it keeps our pesky rotates off my back keeps me fed well barely at this rate i could eat the troll i imagine the hunger pangs hit quite frequently here may i offer you something to eat it would surely help keep this toiler going i have something that will say to your belly and hopefully roush your spirits how can i repay such a kindness acer is a common enemy of ours and i'm looking for her common enemy is right if i had it my way i would bash her pretty face into sculpting go sadly she has not returned for me to try my hand and i do not know where she has gone is there anything you can tell me hmm i get the growing sense you mean to confront her forcefully then do have caution asa can use magma to treat her wounds quite quickly i'm a dead she always has a silky fresh layer on her skin i'll have to remember that if you see asa you will give her my friendly regards won't you spare a moment please piss off one eye friendly can you spare a moment piss off one eye friendly leave us in peace i would have a word with you you you should not be here i'll only take a moment please go i do not want trouble with the guards they allow me to speak only when reporting to them and them alone [Music] i should disguise myself as a misspell why are you here that is quite the disguise if loki is giving lessons tell him we could use his expertise i have him locked away in a dungeon cell for roughly the next thousand years ah so then what brings you you have not come to land your hand in the muck i'm looking for asa can you help you then suitor's daughter haven't seen her for some time now she's got her minions keeping a watchful eye on us though what i can say is that wherever she goes she makes it a point to forge large magma pools seen her do it here walks around in there i hear she can even move through them something to look forward to crafty she is if you see any liquid fire pits it may be proof she is nearby i will keep an eye out uh we have the advantage ugh we don't want more trouble are you all right move away i need to fix this or i'll lose the whole patch along with my head you and i should talk hi one is that really you what are you doing here i've come looking for sutra's daughter one they call asa here she frequents this place she makes her rounds comes to see that we are working as best we can what is all this work for who knows she brings us the oars we extract the metals they go to sutra for whatever it is he so desires what is she like this acer get on her bad side and she'll bark her threats but so long as you keep on the straight and narrow she is um tolerable ensures you are well fed and healed of your wounds sets the bar high for a must spell where might i find her now i do not know but you can try your luck around the kiln asa appears soft of heart for muscle this is very very bad you shouldn't be here leave us alone go my eyes any longer so oh [Music] remain steadfast don't get me oh what are you doing getting you out of here now keep quiet quiet my arse is on fire wait you can walk over magma we are in the clear i think put me down are you okay i owe you my life those whispers were prepared to let me bake to death you are no death to me although as it turns out i have need of your help what can i help you with putting a stop to this invasion i am listening i know asa oversees your work i need to find her what do you know of her whereabouts nothing more than which way i saw her leave it was east though interestingly she took a punch off my people with her diggers maybe she is scouring another site that is helpful farewell and keep safe oh relief how can i loosen it go east that is where i last saw acer headed if i could just free the damn trap how can i loosen it name your spear it works it works go away please as good as new you have done me a great service i could kiss you i'd prefer you use your lips to tell me where i may find asa asa what business doesn't asir have with a moosebell princess i have a quarrel with his daughter will help me rectify it and how do you plan on that asa may come off as a young cub but she does have a dark side as do i can you tell me where to find her or not not exactly the resources we receive come from a milner but i haven't got a clue which our blacksmith dramnik asa took some of his workers with her he may know more but have caution last i heard the guards are making an example out of him some other task has stolen aces attention as of late if she's distracted that will make capturing her awesome uh [Music] ah [Music] everything the muscle princess could never want what is this that depends i'm looking for someone i was told i might find her here maybe you know her muscle around your age goes by asa father's uh how shall i put this a vain glorious fool who thinks himself a god never heard of her then you will not mind if i stay a while dip my toes in one of these soothing fire baths i have a better idea oh turn around go back from where you came and please do mind your step that is no way to welcome a curious outsider care to put that away why afraid i know how to use it i'm sure you can use it possibly well but then i would have to kill you don't worry you won't yeah these fires there is an easy way out of this now where is the fun ugh gift [Music] shoot will give her life oh [Music] focus [Music] huh let's keep the baubles out of it shall we oh no the godly gloating smite me i cannot bear it if i were you i would save the tongue wit for a more appropriate time i saw no such trinket on sutra yet he too has a problem with dying so that was you neither in what squabble had you trading blows with my father he has taken my son and now i will give your father a taste of what he has wrought move so that i may trade his child for mine you clearly do not know my father your son i assume here's something my father needs and if that is so papa would sooner see me dead than given to your demands if you want your son back you will need something far more precious than me to barter with me his own daughter i simply will not do then there's no longer any need for you to draw breath asa we found it we oh found what what have you found uh asa would not want me to say acer is no longer here i am javi of asgard lord of frenzy you are in full control of my temper mural asa believes it may help her gain entry to an ancient vault it is in a cavern that way my son will be his prisoner how does one kill that which cannot be killed if death is not his weakness then i must find something that is she believes there's something interesting here it is trash oh uh a few of which may allude to peaks or mountains you can you read this to me me uh i i can try elven runes are not something i can decipher with ease you will fail better than i and that will have to do any mention of an ancient bolt a door secret entrance maybe no uh but i can make out this see two great mountains to the north the sun and moon above that's it regrets asia we are simple diggers not experts of things written long ago not to worry you've been a great help let's see now who's located between two great mountains to the north i should search there we sound so crazy [Music] wrong with you so huh this must be the place spells right here i can still smell this stench in here now where shall i point this one now we're getting somewhere so now you have to match one of the doors the sun strange place and reeks of death wonder what secrets i will uncover here whoever was here made it a point to occupy this space secret and hellstain whoever did this will see that there is a price to pay the wounds and that just identical and cauterized seen nothing like it it's unnatural [Music] [Music] more elven symbols whatever was in this wall sat undisturbed for many ages until now [Music] only most spells leave ash in footprints like these ones larger than the rest drag marks and blood were shared but only a small amount were the victims still alive aces sought to enter this walk and unlock its secrets but before she could do so someone beat her to it that being that a group of muslims among them injured but very much alive were taken to the center of this chamber where it appears that some sort of ritual was prepared the orchestrator came to the ancient elven object built into the wall possibly even used it in the ritual is that what led to the dwarves death the muspels then left taking the object with them but the purpose of this ritual of theirs remains a mystery to me that sigil i think i glimpsed it before an a3 while i searched for balder perhaps we'll find some answers there [Music] spells they must have fought [Applause] [Music] [Music] find it and i may find the culprit amid all this excitement i have had little time to dwell on ragnarok when will the storm break tomorrow or find the future i think the latter more likely i have loki imprisoned for whatever role he has played in baldur's predicament but for now he is merely the abductor of my child not the bringer of the twilight still once boulder is safe i will return to ascot and raise an army spell he must be conquered without mercy so can't need to get on the other side storm growing there all locked there are three inserts shhh uh oh is thank you [Music] stop third key looks as though it may be complete well whoever held the ritual at the balt was once here writings on the ritual they are performed at night there is emphasis on something called a salacar my alvin is rusty vessel of souls i think is this the object from the vault the culprit was deciphering elven ruins something about the binding of only the most powerful hygges [Music] the culprits are just why yelten and a must-spell subject to complete their work more spells killing moose spells [Music] as much secrecy about the culprit's affairs only she and sutra i wear [Music] [Music] the vault is marked here along with a second location another original site perhaps you're lied on your feed a sir following me now you've become quite useful esier my gratitude for opening the vault now tell me what happened there i'm following the stink as it rises as are you care to tell me why that is days ago sinmata ordered my best warriors to the vault without bothering to inform me i've not heard from them since well you're casting your suspicions that the right people whose quarters are these his name is calder an adept in magic or sometimes call it this place is where he practices it whatever he's doing it is not sader at least not as i know it he is using something called a salacar as part of a deadly ritual and from what this room tells me the debt will continue to pile up wolves i don't know what you're talking about you wouldn't your stepmother despises and distrust you your father only the latter of those for now but in time thanks to her venomous whispers he may come to hate you as much as she does this is a lie all of it your twisted attempt to pit me against them sift through the mesh yourself no other truth lies within where are you going after the salah whatever it is your father needs it maybe the only leverage i have to get my son back call the mark the place on the map surrounded by waters just northeast if he's planning another ritual there i may be able to understand what value this seller car holds best not to draw well there may be nearby this roof should give me a clear view oh no out lord calder with your permission we will now return to asa soon i have need for you still asus warriors where do they fit into all this you are one of our captains yes a duty i share with two others here i thought i saw something in you stout resolute step over here secret and holstein were two of the most revered sons of evild if such prestige is a requirement for these rituals and calder is surely luring that must spell to his death i wonder if there's a way i can observe the ritual up close i need to approach colder without him taking notice perhaps the best ways was deception join me not sure i'd buy it but keep your eyes open let me kill him northwest lasers made it farther oh work with me what i find in this pursuit what do you see these fools dad stand in her path several wombs this one put up a fight briefly i suspect [Music] no other bodies it was the last to die how hard was he knocked into this rock most likely dead upon impact he's a caught up to calder his warriors moved in while he pushed on the days that tore through them like a whirlwind the trail of the dead reveals a direction for those two most importantly the southern cars they are headed west i need to find calder before ace of those in her bloodlust the salakar is not safe looks like these two brought all the fires time with them and freya wonders why i've always refused to take her on a two of that scorched dunhill a sun calder fought here blood was spilt two sets of footprints one is stretched like someone fled the other closer together uneven and lined with blood they were hobbling perhaps asan calder fought here he gained the advantage foolish girl acer young raids makes you vulnerable she's hurt but not enough to stop her looks like she followed calder up that hill i must be careful now no side effects are colder only these curious yelpton buffoons who stand in my way they should run but they won't these are similar we used to restrain someone there was a card here and drag marks leading to it the dead stack up for these misspells ragnarok came early asus spear abandoned that calder and his minions finally best her [Music] asa chased calder into this camp leaking her lifeblood blinded by rage and utterly reckless looks to have caused her to she came crashing in smalling whatever halfway stood between her and calder those halfwits fought back in numbers injured and disarmed he was overpowered and restrained calder then had him tossed onto a cart like a sack of turnips looks like they fled up that path what is it calder plans to do with the little princess now that she is his prisoner she only not these tracks lead west i must find calder and the seller car for all the safe is this about asus or is she still proving too much to handle perhaps balder would not approve of my methods of the cruelty i must perform on his behalf he and acer they're young pure of heart but lacking in logic one day they will grow up and see life as i see it in the meantime they must rely on me to ensure they live long perhaps balder would not approve of my methods of the cruelty must perform on his behalf he and acer i hope i'm not too late they made a turn here toward the river pray line lisa is that you again mad one come to tempt fate i see i do not die this day can you say the same ah yes you've proven once already how you like to strut around unencumbered by fear perhaps the salah did not give you an adequate taste of it enough of this blithering hand over what is now mine or shall i just take it to no fear we must be subjected to it when i am through with you i will take aces willfully will be complete then believe me you will know fear and pain just like your son too much of a pretentious asgardian air [Music] seeing what was undone full and true ugh why is certain collecting hookahs what does he mean to do with the salah tell me why do you aim to finish my work ask yourself how much you care to suffer in these final moments do your worst you are wasting your breath he will not tell you and he won't have to his secrets are known to me now you want them move aside move aside or i will destroy it traitor traitor it is you who are slaughtering your own kind what i do i do for suitor such devotion requires a strong huger all these moosebuilt sacrifices you need it only look inward was he right about you wanting to complete the salakar will not trade my son for something he cannot use so you will see it through to what end how many lives would you take for boulder i would drain all nine realms even asgard the words of a dreadful king and a selfless father it is the one thing that separates you from my own you wish to reunite with your son i wish to see my father's plans lie in ruin no matter the price can you see both through i can but i will need your help the cell the car still requires the hooga of a suitable yoten cold i never found one i must get hunting do as you will in the meantime i'll join my stepmother wherever she may be i will try to learn how the salakar fits into my father's plants under the guise of a contrite step daughter of course keep it i will need a way to find you when it is time to confront my father you and this marvel share a bond i set out to use you to my advantage it ends with me in your debt if it were not for you i would have never known what my father was capable of he used our people turn them on each other for his gain i cannot forgive him and to that end i am your ally in asgard an ally is a friend let us not get carried away will reveal itself i should return to the shelter perhaps the dwarfs there can hate me worthy of the salah how are you and these folk getting on lady better now that i see there is an asser among us you'll free us from the clutches of that red witch won't you who do you mean she has taken our people please all father you must help us enlist all of our scar tiffany please what else can you tell me about this acer only that so long as she is out there we will remain down here help us speak to brahman if he is still able to string a sentence together that drunkard [Music] i'm busy what can i do you forgot [Music] something else we'll speak again come back another day [Laughter] my pleasure [Music] came to humiliate us some more help me and i'll compose your soccer so exalted it will endure ragnarok itself but first i need a name and a place for what for whom the mightiest yotan in all of sparta fame we know the one right hand of sutanga uh male vigor here because of us she is worthwhile gave your son vida quite the beating allow me to introduce fiala and gala the ones who killed suit and his father i heard something about him trying to out drink a couple of dwarves and after befuddled tripping and breaking his neck sultan god wasn't happy held us responsible but luckily we required some meat in exchange for our lives except afterwards some thieving [ __ ] went slowly loki most likely it's always loki whoever it was suit anger didn't catch them so he decided to take it out on us instead sent malviga to hunt us down been incognito ever since can't trust this lot not to sell us out still she hasn't found us yet she will alviga's dangerous prey even for you we can help balance the scales our old house north of here sunk in a lake inside upstairs on a table you'll find a cup of grape potency cup you know the cup oh yes the cup has the power to do wonderful stuff for instance so i bring you the cup and then we show you how to use it against mouth figure it's a deal no one wants to hear us [Music] she will regret having ever followed her father into swat alphae i can say looks like i'll be getting my toes wet [Music] this wondrous cup of theirs should be on the table over there nothing perhaps someone has already been here and stolen it assuming there was a cup in the first place hello uh leave one of your enemies alive so they can tell of your greatness everyone knows of my greatness perhaps there are one or two who have not yet heard just tell me where mal vigor is what what's in it for me i do not know but i will tell you this the longer you make me wait the worse it will be moldbeaker is at the dam to the west and now will you spare me until next we meet there will be no next you can be sure of that so we'll find more vigor at the damn west of here she is a worthy foe loki told me we'll find mole vigor at the dam west of here she is a worthy foe loki told me how she and anger brother once came to blows it did not go well for angebola if the celica rejects melviga then it has a false tool and suture pins his hopes in a worthless toy ah [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] so these rugged views that remind me of when i once roved the land with freak the cool knights spent together beneath the stars she enjoyed the solitude as much as i the trouble and danger even then came the war with the vania taking freyja as my bride it helped in that strife but it ended many other things too what trickery is this where is the dam this tempest yes so the traitors have been betrayed they had hoped that by serving you up i would show them mercy clearly a misapprehension yet here i am served up if i were here for you i won i would have brought an army no sutengir will have his vengeance but not here i know why you have come i have a bone to pick with you after what you did to my son neither i must be there put up an honorable fight that is not what i heard do not believe the stories on his return to weak to stand he squirmed like a worm caught in the sun [Laughter] you should have seen me my acolytes had to carry me home on their backs no your boy fought well is that why you spared his life it is but you aren't here to avenge vidar's honor you have come to steal my hooga and i intend to stop you how do you know this esser yotum you and loki are both mad and hirokin is just as bad and thor is so stupid he might as well be mad you spread chaos wherever you go yet you are all known quantities to us is not he rarely emerges from mooseball heim and when he does he shares little with us thus while here i have sent my spies to learn what he plans beyond wiping out the dwarves like he did the elves of alvain what do you know of his plans i know that he found a powerful elven relic and that his minion calder was tasked with finding the hookers necessary to sustain it that calder is now trapped within said relic and that you would have me join him i must trade the salah for my son you the one who almost killed sutangat for his meat we'll hand over a legendary relic take your son and leave just like that [Laughter] put your mania aside heavy work with me together we will foil sertra's ambitions i cannot take the risk with each breath balder is a step closer to death i was a parent once but we must look beyond ourselves for the good of all we have spoken long enough so or die trying should i prevail uh ah nicely done impressive uh ugh [Music] that was floppy heavy you are the greater warrior but this is not the right result do what you came here to do get on with it blind one end my misery oh true father my body comes to you sent by the same imposter who claimed your own as for my hooger do not weep for me i do not deserve this no you do not i've seen nothing of her since my arrival that leaves evil yes that is the place [Music] you
