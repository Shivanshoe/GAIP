[Music] is this one free you permanent jump bricks suppose there's room for a passenger and the van look out the guy who's taking receipt of these guns is in a boat just off the coast while the man on my wing presents no immediate danger i'll do my best to oblige you [Music] if you'd read our latest shareholder report ron you'd know tp enterprises has been exploring a takeover of some lost mc business in the armaments and narcotics sectors for some time and that kind of requires someone to purchase our guns right of course [Music] recent events my impending departure included have only expedited things trevor phillips enterprises is a far superior organization to the lost leather club well we hope we improve revenue streams cut overheads and maximize profit all that i wouldn't expect anything less for one thing we won't be paying a bunch of idiots to stand around in cowhide sniff engine fuels it's important work you're doing out here god it better be drop your load if we fly low we ain't gonna show up on military radar [Music] shipment successfully delivered ron now remember if you beat me to the airstrip i'll butcher your carcass and wrap you in we're cheesecloth make some calling from that hardware boss tp enterprises are raising guidance and the lost mc are posting unexpectedly soft projections for the coming a vast quarters conspiracy like the lost mc shouldn't let a goon like johnny kay represent him he was a man i heard he used to be serious a few hard stamps to the head knocked the seriousness right out of him sure did but before that i mean back in alternate man was weak for crystal weak for ashley man was we shouldn't have spoken to me like that he shouldn't he was guy in the boat is oscar guzman he's in with the cartels if there's a market this could be a way to expand the business like i hadn't thought of that we might be able to buy into oscar's thing but leave that to me ron i'm sorry to ask this but this your contact pay well for this kind of shipment because i've got those lawyer fees for the divorce and my settlement costs oh he pays better than any in this story country we'll talk about the exact split when we're grounded okay if i think that was adequate restitution for my impotent rage statue that was a mighty fine statue trap that was a mighty fine piece of plastic [ __ ] but there is no price for emotional attachment i mean you might forgo your cut to uh alleviate my heartache i might yeah i mean i will good idea we don't have time to dwell on that now because we got more runs ron if there is one thing that they need south of that big fence it is guns trevor phillips industries technical expertise managerial innovations unstoppable oh that's right now go i need to meditate or masturbate or both [Music] um [Music] you sure as [ __ ] are one dumb ignorant white trash hillbilly wallace you're damn right chang spreadsheet let's head outside and talk terms quite in gentlemen i think i have proved

so this kid he could fly planes so he signed up for the air force to fly all day long and bomb villages and maybe just maybe drop the nuke and it was all going well until one day just before he got his wings an evil witch in charge of psychological evaluations told him he was unstable and grounded him for life that's terrible it was sent him into a deep pit of doubt and despair and just then just as he hit rock bottom he met a fat silver tongue troll under a bridge that's cool what's your troll's name mike michelle a lady troll yeah yeah tits like one but no no he was a boy michelle is a funny name for a boy well this was a funny boy he sat under his bridge robbing anyone who passed him by sometimes he'd go into town and rob the shops and ends and such and he persuaded our hero that maybe he should rob people too and you know what little trisha did rob people and little trisha was good at it and they lived happily ever after for a while until the troll met another troll in a strip club and they fell in lust and he bought her a pair of fake troll tits even bigger than his real troll tits so she could make more money stripping maybe a little on the side without call work but you didn't hear that from me wow and then she pushed out a pair of little trolls and the big bad troll under the bridge went soft hold on what so little trevor made a new friend called brad and he was thinking about cutting mike off when it all went to [ __ ] and mike got killed and brad went to jail did all the names just change or am i missing something shut up and then the fat ugly troll
