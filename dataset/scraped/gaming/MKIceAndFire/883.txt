oh me this is massive i never thought we'd get this kind of reach what do you mean it's [ __ ] stormzy you know bossy bop shut up bloody glastonbury the man sent us a message and he's asking for dead sec by name we're in the big times now mate we got some [ __ ] high profile contract right here brill i'll send you the message and for the love of [ __ ] god do not [ __ ] this up you heard mr olmsey dead tech has a role to play in this now backdoor albion servers and let's get this illegal show on the road there's a potential recruit you may want to check out pushing your location public approval of sir shot up today following counter-terror director malik's statement that the five eyes nations will execute a coordinated global response to the deadset threat mr malik what is the service doing to protect the people of britain right now well we're aiming a little higher than just britain soon we can know if anyone in any cts using country in the world so much as utters the word dedsec thank you sirs advises citizens that positive discussions of the dead sec terrorist organization or their actions may result in investigation [Music] i'm here what's our plan we're here to find some documents we're calling the malik dossier basically it's the paper trail that proves malik was behind the canada house bombings problem is these documents won't be on one computer they'll be on dozens scattered across the country what should we do well that's the million dollar question isn't it let's have malik take it thurs uses a super computer called filament to process information drawn from the ctos network it's like noodle if you could use it to search every document on every civilian government or commercial device everywhere in the united kingdom instantly top job bagley break in and connect bagley to a filament administrative terminal he'll do the rest as usual [Music] ugh oh oh [Music] i'll shoot is freeze [Music] taking an albion mandated timeout you're up i can take over let's get a move on ah [Music] you're brilliant uh-huh so oh ugh what the [ __ ] is that thing in order to access the filament admin terminal from your optic interface you'll have to align the sirs satellite network with my packet stream from bloom tower well done now i should be able to stream myself into srs's nasty little snoop computer head to the basement and hack the filament admin terminal there's an intruder in the building security systems i don't sorry channel is being hacked i've taken control of building security but i'd prefer to end this bloodlessly if you're willing to listen to reason don't [ __ ] listen zero day took over parliament security right before the bombings this is their m.o what are you talking about i want dead set gone but no one else needs to die you've proven yourselves very skilled and i could put those skills to use join me you can still make something of your lives join zero day it's gonna have to be an e for me mate zero day no i mean sirs they've practically been working for me anyway and besides we have a lot in common we both use violence and manipulation to shape london into something better the only difference is i know what i wanted to be strong stable unified safe this is what i value what about you um not blowing up canadians fine if we can't convince each other then i suppose killing will have to do that central server is filament's admin terminal connect me to it to gain access so well [ __ ] we've been locked out oh and it seems malik deployed the microwave drones wait what microwave drones one of filament's novel intrusion counter measures they use little microwave cannons to selectively destroy compromised hardware sort of like chemotherapy for computers the server room automatically seals itself while they're deployed what should i do try hijacking one of the microwave drones and use it to shoot the other ones down stand back to this [Music] shoot you back up here someone shoots it right weapon out beginning the investigations [ __ ] [Music] drones down server room unlocked and buggery [ __ ] malik has locked me out he must have a hard line to the server what should i do a full power cycle will reset his connection and give us enough time to complete the intrusion but filament uses three quantum processors with independent power we'll have to reboot each individually so unplug it and plug it back in all right got it close enough [Music] do [Music] so [Music] me [Music] could you do something about this drone it can't seem to take a [ __ ] hint [ __ ] off you stupid drone this isn't a picnic and i've got any jam [Music] could you shoot this drone down i'm asking for lightning to go away but i'm afraid i don't speak [ __ ] would you look at this a chain of custody documents for 40 kilos of semtex it ricochets through a dozen shell companies but ultimately ends up registered to an address in southall and would you guess who lived across the street from it for 30 years victoria and imran malik parents to one richard that doesn't prove a thing well this one is heartwarming and incriminating it seems that the areas of canada house immediately around the bonds were evacuated in an unscheduled drill i have an email chain here between the facilities director and an enormous sirs account funny that didn't make the news you think it's incriminating that i tried to minimize the loss of life come on that's so spinnable and motion sick this microwave drone has been hanging around so long i've given [Music] no i am not your new daddy this microwave drone is starting to be a real problem over here look at this it's an unredacted mission report for two sirs agents instructed to plant explosives as part of a training exercise and it's signed and dated by the home secretary himself seems it's a bad day to be the secretary please stop this microwave drone exciting did you know that the head of security for canada house had a daughter stuck in a cairo jail and that she was pardoned the week before the explosion why he would certainly owe a very very big favor to the srs officer who pressured the egyptians wouldn't he i suppose he would seems that malik's given up having the microwave drones destroyed compromised hardware now he's got them targeting you the effect will be about the same though [Music] what do we have here straight from your own laptop case bars on all these little side ups you've been running honestly you might have titled this evil bomb conspiracy that's enough you can't do this you mustn't do this i won't allow it [Music] independent power has been rebooted return to the central core to complete the cycle wicked now let's get malik and get out of here with pleasure so i'm fully integrated with filament and it seems malik didn't quite have time to cover his tracks i believe i can trace his position do it all right let's find you too old too young too ugly too female ah there he is hello malik you've been disconnected is it just me or does he look constipated right wouldn't be a briefcase wanker without his briefcase oh look seems someone's locked the door on him don't worry there's no way that's going to oh no it worked guy what the hell mate well that's a wrinkle isn't it is he seriously going to try to get away in a car a car connected to the city spanning network of automated surveillance devices that eye control auto drive now enabled [ __ ] hello again you know for all your scheming you don't exactly think quickly under pressure this can't be normal what now i sent the malek dossier to every media outlet from the gbb to the abaris with sheep farmers gazette it may take some time to sort through but it ought to clear dedsec's name at least for this particular thing what about malik made the mistake of getting into a self-driving car that owed me a favor it's taking him to a secure location i say we send that car driving into oncoming traffic or a fire or something i mean why not believe me i'd love to but he might be part of zero day i just don't know how this all fits together but we need to find out you hear that malik you're going to help us for real this time bloody hell you insane robot slow down hell yes you see all that [ __ ] i'm good at being a dead sec you wouldn't have been recruited if dead sex thought you'd be killed that easily you trying to be nice bags oh thanks mate don't don't listen to him bikes can come across a bit rude sometimes but he's really sweet well done i've been monitoring the drone network mary kelly has finally sent out the invitations to her slave market sale this is your specialty have one of those drones and get the location where she's selling those poor microchipped people let's put an end to this responding to the situation no vision now target ending pursuit over malik has been secured at the safe house all right now that we have him we should talk to him find out what he knows about zero day just don't get too close to him all right as long as he's alive he's a threat all right dick we know you did the embassy bobby and probably the other ones so just spill it yeah the earlier bombings what are you oh god i've been captured by morons i didn't do those bombings i tried to stop those bombings i am a patriot and they called me a crank even emma but that's when i knew that intelligence wasn't enough to save the empire i would need power and fast no you knew about zero day before you came to us i'm a spy so yes i knew a few details about the biggest terrorist attack in recent memory truth to tell i really did think zero day was you that's just occam's razor but if you insist on a conspiracy albion stood the most to gain but you've really not thought of this or even if you're not zero day you've still done plenty you aren't going anywhere oh i doubt i'll be here long these walls will fall along with all of you soon enough this radical cooperative you created is doomed to fail like they all are i've seen it a dozen times in a dozen places you will tear yourselves apart you won't even need zero day or albion or whoever a single unified ideology a single strong leader these have been the characteristics of power for all of human history democracy and pluralism were anomalies blips on the timeline that's what you are dead sec a footnote in the history of the empire but now the page is turning and you are not ready for what happens next um what's good chief i'm sorry for not being there irl but there's no way i'm coming out of my hidey hole but i'll keep an encrypted connection open to your safe house i was having a chat with your mate richard malik just a former service agent in a former albion drone talking shop anyway he pointed me to this audio recording you should give it a listen it could be something big go on then let me hear it and when you got a moment give malik a smack across the chops for me will what the you do you mean there's no open investigation are you the police or not we are and i mean exactly the way it sounds my friend was a journalist she was working on a story about sirs kidnapping people off the street and then she goes missing you don't find that the slightest bit suspicious look the decision not to investigate happened way way over my pay grade do you understand way over you're [ __ ] in on it jesus christ i'm hanging up and i'm recording this the journalist mentioned in that call seems to run afoul of sirs and seeing as they've taken 1984 letters a dire warning and more as an instruction book she may be in trouble she needs our help agreed let's get this done i've marked a last known location on your map you should hurry though it was dated recently enough that sirs might not have caught up with her yet you
