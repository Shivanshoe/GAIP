[Music] [Music] [Music] tonight's episode springs the man before you is a champion of light he is part of a conflict between darkness and light that is both ancient and eternal he is chasing a dangerous quarry the herald of darkness is even doppelganger known only as mr scratch i'll catch you eventually maybe but what are you gonna do then by then i'll have my hands on everything you love uh the man has been brutally spat out from the darkness that surrounds the shores of our reality he has come to fight a decisive battle in night springs [Music] it's gonna be like that again huh in another life the man was a writer he still practices that art forging weapons of war out of ideas but the violent currents that brought him here have scattered the pages he has written my name is alan wake and i'm a writer i didn't become one overnight like most writers i struggled with it a short story here an article there then i got lucky and spent a year as a staff writer on the night springs tv show it wasn't the great american novel of my fantasies but it taught me discipline and craft and the difference between wanting to be a writer and actually writing at the oil derrick the wheel had been jammed in place and turned until the oil gurgled and flowed thick and flammable the warning lights were blinking in a fast rhythm bright and steady powered by the battery the kasabian cd was playing in the boom box all distorted guitars and intense beat high above some piece of orbital junk or another collided with the satellite knocking it radically off course trailing debris it screamed down from the skies at an impossibly steep angle all that high-tech engineering reduced to nothing more than a bullet that would destroy whatever it hit [Music] the lights of the motel promised safety the man senses that the solution to his predicament begins there somewhere within the earth space itself has been pierced and from dark depths runs a steady flow of monsters the man recognizes the hand of his evil double in this he knows he must put an end to this madness i can't stay here now hello [Applause] hey it's you there you remember me right emma emma salone i think you might have something that belongs to me really a typewritten page oh yeah that's weird i did find a page like that i don't even know where it came from it was all this weird stuff about the oil derrick and a satellite yes that's what i'm looking for oh well i don't know how you knew i had it but i i guess it's yours listen what's this all about there are these really creepy guys hanging around the oil derricks there's something really weird about them they're dangerous i'm gonna deal with them try to stay out of their sight okay and stay in the light they hate the light just to be clear you should know that we haven't actually met before sure we have mr wake remember you stayed at the motel here no the guy you're talking about just looks like me even if he uses my name he's behind all this trouble oh i thought um now that you mention it i guess your aura looks a lot nicer than his actually i'm very sensitive to things like that there's a bunch of stuff i need to find the things mentioned on that page well there's a lot of old crap lying around this place great thanks i think you should be able to find everything except the satellite obviously are you gonna tell me what this is i don't think that'd go over too well why don't you let me be the judge of that fine the page is a formula for rewriting reality either i use it to close a strange portal to a place that isn't in our world or shadowy serial killer monster things keep pouring out of there yeah you were right the first time you can think what you want about me but there's still bad guys around be careful well you might be nuts but i've seen the way they move the way they look i'll buy that they're called taken they aren't really human not anymore and they're climbing out of the oil well what do they have secret headquarters down there or no that's just where the point of connection is it's a hole that leads to well it's a really nasty place that's why i need to close it and the guy who looks like you opened it because he was hanging around the oil field before he gets around unfortunately thanks for helping me oh i wish i thought you were just a nutcase actually i kind of expected you to me too but i feel like this is how it's supposed to go isn't that weird not really i get that a lot in my line of work what do you do anyway i'm a writer obviously what was that you said about my aura oh i'm very spiritual you know i can see auras but i only use it for healing and helping people i'm like a wise woman you know i give people insight and advice look just because i say crazy things doesn't mean i believe everything don't be like that maybe you should take a few crystals with you if you're going out there it might be dangerous they soothe your energies and focus your mind it's fantastic and they helped me take out the bad guys oh well no not as such yeah okay i think i'm more i have some wonderfully potent herbal detox suppositories yeah i'm good i'm good the champion of light recognizes the page he got from the woman it is a weapon of his own design custom engineered to destroy the dark portal if he recreates the conditions of the page a great power will be unleashed oh hell this isn't going to be good is this on how can you tell i'm sorry i'm not very good with gadgets that's more like it [Music] i'll be right with you i just gotta do this one thing [Music] i like it quiet i bet you're wondering why this is happening why am i doing all this why am i so hell bent on ruining your life you're cramping my style you've got money fame everything you could want but you don't know what to do with it i do i'm getting all the things you never had the balls to go for having more fun too [Music] do you know the real difference between us i'm not afraid to be the center of attention this poor slobs just collateral damage really i mean get some information out of them earlier but this part this is just for kicks [Music] so quiet i know that when i arrive the clarity of vision i have now may disappear i've made my plans i prepared for this but i know the transition from the dark place will be hard on me and not just physically it may affect my mind my memory these pages should help me remember and focus that's worked for me before even if that fails i think i will be able to trust my instincts i'm navigating my own story i'm hoping i'll know where to go and what to do even if the details elude me well here you are about to enjoy another cool arizona night with me eddie rodman the host with the boast hey any of you guys remember old gods of asgard man i actually saw them twice back in the 70s i was just a kid then but my dad worked at this club and he'd sneak me in to see bands all the time you know talk about an education anyway great band couple of great albums solid fan base and then they kind of dropped off the face of the earth well now almost four decades later they're making a comeback let me tell you these boys have seen a lot of road there's some serious rock and roll veterans because they weren't too young even back in the day well now i've got odin and tor anderson two of the original old gods in the studio with me along with their manager barry wheeler nice to have you guys here oh hey great to be here ready yeah hello now boys let me just come around and say this all right spring chickens you ain't i mean you guys you make the stones look young you're only as old as you feel [Music] now your last album was 1978 in the valley of my shadow and then you stopped playing altogether after that why and what made you do a comeback after all this time well it was a sad thing see the original bass player for old gods fat bomb balder passed away in india bob had little poor yeah after that we didn't feel like playing no more long story short i ran into these guys up in washington and it was obvious to me that they still got it so i figured hey let's make some music right they went for it now barry you were a literary agent before this right uh-huh yeah and you were very successful you represented alan wake i believe who disappeared under mistakes yeah that's hey i just want to talk about old gods tonight is that cool can we do that oh yeah sure sure listen why don't we take a little break and then later on in the program we'll hear the new old god single stay tuned folks well at least barry landed on his feet i guess it's about time i went full auto to change reality you nudge it into the right direction your version of it is there waiting it wants to come true all you need to do is help it achieve its potential the devil is in the details you change the details of the scene to match those on the page if you get the details right if you achieve that critical mass the shift will come and the rest of your new reality overrides the existing paradigm the lie no matter how outrageous is now the truth oh wait wait that's one thing down um hmm that's two just one more to go some of the taken are protected by the darkness like their comrades instead their aversion to light is so extreme that they literally split into two when they encounter strong light it leaves the two halves weaker but of course their strength in numbers it's a disturbing development the dark presence i faced two years ago was powerful but it didn't have much in the way of imagination clearly the same cannot be said of mr [Music] the reality we take for granted is softer more adaptable than we think under correct conditions you can reshape it turn it into almost anything you want when it happens almost nobody notices it's not that we forget it's that after the change there's nothing to remember only those who have been directly touched by the powers that can shift reality are aware of the changes many are driven mad by it others can cope i'm one of those people and i know how to wield that power to rewrite reality the enemy tears itself in two to avoid the hated light it becomes weaker but more worse such is the arithmetic that was just messed up something tells me i'm that's everything the man has found the battery but it is empty it will need to be recharged oh i need this battery charged no problem here you go thanks listen i don't know what's gonna happen exactly when i do this my memory's a little hazy i don't even know what that means all i'm saying is you don't want to come anywhere near the oil field all right this thing could get out of hand in the middle of highly flammable materials great i'll do my best to contain it just please don't turn out to be some kind of crazy terrorist guy okay okay i'm gonna go now wish me luck wait a sec i want to ask you about something first what did you mean with that mind memories of a little hazy thing i had a pretty rough time coming here it was like being caught in a tsunami i blacked out for a while it's hard to explain there's a barrier of sorts that i had to break through i was lucky to make it here with my wits as intact as they are so you might have brain damage you're about to do great things with a magic piece of paper and you came here from another dimension no i'm from new york i was just visiting another dimension oh yeah okay my bad [Music] so oh time to make some serious changes [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] i'm here just keep your head down yeah i think i noticed that's the last one we're what good hell was that easy i got him you're safe i need you to tell me what you know about him the guy who looks like me he there was a there was a party in one of the rooms it was pretty wild i am i'm not sure which room it was in you didn't attend i no i wasn't there but it got way out of hand anyway i i heard that he went to the diner and there was a fight there or something maybe you could find out more from there i i got some keys that you could maybe use you just happen to have the keys huh fine i'll take a look stay here like hell i'm getting out of here as soon as you leave so i could close up this place and go home emma you really want to stay here in the light yeah thanks for the advice but i'm not sticking around just go already okay are you okay i guess thanks for the help were those the what'd you call them the taken what are they it's complicated short version the darkness can take people over that's why i had to destroy the oil derrick otherwise they would have overrun the place wow i didn't think you'd actually do it i mean i didn't think it'd work that's crazy let me just try one more time at the risk of sounding like a broken record it's bad out there i don't want you hurt you should stay put yeah while you turn this place into an inferno run around shooting things up and play some kind of weird games with your psycho evil twin don't get me wrong you're nice for a weirdo i'm impressed as hell by all of this but enough is enough i seriously just want to get out of here okay the strands of webbing glistened in the beam of my flashlight fine almost ethereal they were fresh and right in my path i held my breath and waited irrestraining nothing i moved on concentrating on the task at hand just get what i was looking for then leave that's all i keep telling myself for a moment i actually thought it might be as simple as that then i heard too many legs skittering across the ground a poltergeist its existence is one of rage and hostility and its very presence turns ordinary objects into deadly projectiles oh [Music] the scene traces of violence a callous midnight snack a room key left carelessly behind the man recognizes the enemy's handiwork i think these are keys for the motel rooms emma sloane was a believer in a great many things most of which were entirely fallacious emma sloane an innocent victim of his dark half more collateral damage in the ongoing war damned by forces beyond her control as much as [Music] damn [Music] michael faraby dead tortured dressed in clothes that bore the name of a local observatory a slim lead but solid enough it stirs something deep in his mind he knows where to go now i guess that'll have to be my next stop the observatory hot on the heels of the herald of darkness the champion of light forges on to see the stars an observatory a place for a man to witness the magnificence of the universe but such insights are not what the champion of light is looking for he has come to find a weapon welcome back listeners as you know i'm eddie rodman and i'm still talking to old gods of asgard who are doing their big comeback tour how's that been going for you totally splendid i'm having that time of my life you know i didn't realize how much i miss that and what about you tor ah it's okay you know well this must bring back a lot of memories oh yeah it's wonderful we'll be back on stage if it wasn't for my knee i'd feel like a young man again well speaking of that i hate to keep harping on this age thing but i gotta tell you i've heard your new songs guys and you sound really good thank you and uh this may be a touchy subject but to be blunt you really don't sound well old i mean no i mean the difference between your your speaking voice and your singing voice it's pretty striking what the hell are you talking about you're saying it's not us singing on that record what what's he talking about no no no i'm not saying that guys but i i can't help noticing the difference you're on thin are you calling me a liar oh hey let me just step in here for a moment boys yeah eddie they do sound different but believe me we're not talking millie vanilli here these guys are the real deal why don't you come to the gig tomorrow night see for yourself once they get on that stage boom things get real really believe me they play like they're present it's almost like magic but you see my boys play you see the old gods for real these guys project a lot of power they're not lightweights you know what i'm saying all right barry i'll i'll see if i can make it now let's take another quick break here and after that we'll play the new old gods of asgard single don't you go away [Music] um oh [Music] as a storyteller my first real love was crime and it was in that genre that i finished my first novel starring the perpetually miserable alex casey whose entire life was a wound that never healed the books sold as fast as they hit the shelves i wrote five more alex casey books and they all were best sellers i became rich i became famous success brought pressure and i didn't handle it very well so so foreign i've seen the enemy and it's me i faced dark horrors before things that live in the unimaginable pressures of the world beyond our own sometimes they masquerade as humans that's what ultimate lurks inside mr he's every mean-spirited tabloid story about me an evil caricature a creature formed in that vague territory of misconceptions half-truths and the dark imagination of people who heard a story about me an urban legend made flesh a serial killer my dark half brought to life by the power of cauldron lake the spiders aren't really the work of the enemy they're a side effect a part of the dark places less significant fauna that has managed to slip through the opening i made when i arrived less an animal than an idea that has assumed the form of an animal makes them no less dangerous but at least they're a little easier to deal with the darkness doesn't protect them like the taken and thus they can be destroyed by either light or bullets right away [Music] hello i'm dr rachel meadows and wait a moment it's you i can't believe you dare show your face around here again [Music] ah so ugh go away it wasn't me i just look like him are you serious that's what you're going with please i'm trying to stop him you saw those shadow things trying to kill me right i bet he got along with him just fine yes yes he did all right come on in thank you hey buddy i figured i'd take a moment to talk to you there's a party next door i'm feeling pretty good right now little beer a little fun you know it's nice [Music] listen this whole thing between us it's a little weird for me too you know i mean we don't just look the same there's a lot we share i mean up here i know you right so i was thinking maybe we could [Music] these guys are getting out of control look i feel like we're both victims of circumstance here and maybe we could make some kind of effort [Music] [Music] [Music] never mind [Music] god [Music] god just a moment i'll send the lift down to you i didn't expect to see anyone here tonight but i'm relieved to see an actual person that's assuming this isn't some kind of cruel trick on your heart of course doctor the man who looked like me what did he want here there's a strange astronomical event happening right now something i can't begin to classify but i think it's disabled our satellite there's a very peculiar signal that we're receiving signal that's what i'm here for well so was he but he didn't seem to understand it at all he got very angry sabotaged our imaging array and now we're blind i believe the event is still going on but we can't pick it up is there something we can do what he broke is essentially just a special camera but we can't use the telescope without it there's a replacement in my car if you can get that to me we're back in business consider it done tell me more about the signal it's almost as if something's being transmitted to night springs it's the strangest thing it's quite elusive almost as if it wasn't properly there i don't know how to describe it so what was the signal like i wish i knew he appeared before i had a good fix on it he was very pleasant when i was working but when i isolated the signal he suddenly forced me out of the control booth he said it was none of my business he seemed to to change somehow he he was very smooth and charming before that but suddenly he became i'm sorry i'm not sure i want to talk about it i have to ask do you always wear that to work i was at a party for a local art exhibition fascinating works when i was called away by my assistant michael was the first to spot this event i don't know where he is now actually he was supposed to bring us some food but he never showed up tell me about the event oh it's quite fascinating it looks as if stars were changing somehow or shifting positions it isn't really happening of course most likely it's caused by some kind of atmospheric refraction phenomenon but i've never seen anything like it did he hurt you no he didn't quite threaten me exactly but those shadowy things started to crawl into view and whatever the signal was he seemed to be extremely frustrated by it he just started breaking things and left i thought it best not to interfere you were lucky he's done much worse yes he showed me a knife and he kept talking he enjoyed the sound of his own voice a proper maniac you really aren't anything like him aren't you believe me i try very hard not to be good luck and try to be careful it's a very expensive part and we don't have a replacement oh dear that sounded more callous than i intended uh be safe the pressure of success got to me my wife alice was the sole thing in my life that anchored me suddenly it wasn't enough i couldn't write anymore i distracted myself with wild parties in whatever trouble i could scare up i wallowed in the drama of my life sure that alice would stick with me even though she didn't sign up to be the lifeline of a tortured artist it was my dumb luck she's not the type to give up this must be your car ugh so huh i found it excellent i'll operate the platform directly below the telescope so you can install the array don't worry it's very easy hmm brilliant you've got it i'll just run a quick diagnostic on it yes it's in perfect order all right we're good to go let's take a look at the skies so [Music] there's a problem with the automated coolant system somebody just interrupted the flow so now what well you could go and open the secondary coolant flow valves manually i know it's dangerous there but well i got it please come talk to me if you have questions just remember you need to release all three valves it doesn't matter what order you do it in [Music] um [Music] uh so i've carried a flashlight and a gun for so long that i feel naked without either it's all too often that i need them the darkness protects the taken shadows crawl over their forms like living things protecting them from harm blows that would injure or kill a human outright mean nothing to them as long as the darkness persists but light makes them vulnerable light burns the shadows away the darkness that drives them is still in them but now they're vulnerable flashlight and gun sometimes it feels they're all i have left okay that should do it [Music] one [Music] i released all the valves doctor is it working just bear with me a moment yes i believe you've got it sorted it's working again nicely done that sounds like trouble i don't think they're happy with our success look out they found a way in isolated so are you all right that was intense i'm sighted in now i still have no idea what i'm looking at but it's very strange very strange indeed oh where are my manners please come on up i'm sorry i was distracted huh are we receiving the signal now oh yes it's coming in loud and clear it's amazing i'm not sure what it is yet let alone where it's coming from but it's interacting with our system somehow like it was intended for us but i don't understand how that could be maybe that's just how the story goes what never mind is there a way i can hear it or however this is supposed to work i think the signal is incomplete somehow but you should be getting a print out of it now what do you mean it's incomplete it's almost as if we're only getting a fragment of it i need the whole thing this is important i'm sure it is but this is all we're getting did the man who looks like me get the whole thing he locked me out of the booth so i have no way of knowing but i can tell you that he didn't really seem to understand it so what's in the sky it doesn't make any sense the stars are just they're wrong i thought i'd be able to see something but it's like i'm looking in the sky that's just it's not the right sky but that's impossible i consider myself a rational man doctor but this isn't a thing you can measure or explain i've seen impossible things that have taught me just to roll with some punches it's either that or go insane i find it disturbing that you sound like you're speaking from ample experience a printout of a signal it too is a weapon created by the champion of light in its words stirs a new reality but it is incomplete and yet it provides a road map for the man to follow a course that will lead him to a place where he may confront his enemy the drive-in once the site of lurid celluloid fantasies it's now the site of an art exhibition and yet it's the search for closure rather than culture that brings the champion of light here [Music] because i helped oh it's you um that's fantastic are you okay go away no i want you but you'll get angry if you're here so you gotta go you know i'll do what you want okay i i love you so much did you know that love hurts are you gonna hurt me now cause you should lady you got darkness on the brain i think i can help you if i can get the lights on in here you can't turn the power back on it's not allowed you said so where shouldn't i go so i don't turn the power back on accidentally it's the big building on the other side of the drive-in but it's locked where's the key just so that i know to avoid it it's it's on the wall next to the cash register but you can't you can't don't be bad hey no problem i'm just gonna go do some other stuff scout's honor just try to stay calm i've seen this kind of thing before i think you're gonna be okay why did i why is it so hard to think you've been touched by darkness it's i'm hoping it's not permanent remember when you were here before and you kissed me and then everything got all dark that was the best listen this is very important where did he i mean where did i go can you tell me that baby you don't need to go anywhere you're here now and you're in my head you should be in me you should touch me again not with a 10-foot pole lady hey just in case there's a part of you in there that's freaking out right now it's not your fault i promise i'll do what i can to help you okay i i don't please go away don't sweat it i'm just saying that in case you really need to hear it i've been there i i think there are spiders in my eyes i think you put them in me yeah i'm just gonna go now and we're back with old gods of asgard and their manager barry wheeler guys you're on your comeback tour and you're playing a lot of your classic material but you've also got a new single out right how'd that come about was it hard to go back into the studio after such a long time are you kidding me they were chomping at the bait they were just itching to stretch those creative muscles now it had been a while because uh you know they spent a lot of time in uh retirement we were retired we were yeah no no no no we were at the lodge and um and we escaped we were at the retirement uh thing retirement thing yeah yeah so you know really once we got in the studio things started happening now the music has changed a little bit and the boys were a little rusty so it took us a while to find the right gear but hey once we got going boy they kicked ass and it's an awesome song it's called balance slays the demon and seriously i think it's their finest work and hey i should know i produced it oh really i didn't know you were a producer well this was my first time i mean they needed a little bit of guidance you know what i mean i mean don't get me wrong these guys are the best but it's the 21st century man things just sound a little different these days so you know i kind of stepped in there helped to make it sound all cool kind of jazzed it up that sounds like a challenge oh no it's really easy man i was just you know like hey give it a little zing you know let's take it to another level so it really rips uh you know let's just throw some really sweet sins sin like that you know just kicked it up a notch but it's totally old gods well listeners you can judge for yourselves here's old gods of asgard and balance slays the demon oh yeah the man has encountered this before people whose integrity has been subborned by the insidious touch of the darkness he has experienced it himself but most of the light burned away the darkness brain oh look mr heroes here you ready to save the day you are gonna yourself when you realize what i've done shut up so oh hmm [Music] foreign [Music] ah alice my wife the best thing that ever happened to me she smiles and the darkness lifts for her i've tried things i otherwise never would i've never really minded if it's made me feel like a fool she's a photographer and the world she sees through her lenses is unique and beautiful she has the vision she sees things others don't and knows how to make them visible to everybody she did it with me too she teased out things i was only vaguely aware of she always saw me in the best possible light [Applause] [Music] okay i should be able to figure this out [Music] [Music] you have no idea how badly you're screwed it's gonna be a blast to watch you find out you don't wanna get hit by those oh wait wait i can smell you out there [Music] no don't oh it's not it's you did did you help me looks like you're feeling better now yes i am thank you so much i don't know what happened there was this guy before you say anything i know i look like him but i'm not don't worry you just don't feel anything like he does he was in my head i feel like i need to take 50 showers where is he that wanted to get into the projector booth he was talking about fixing things so the sun never comes up god it didn't seem that weird when he was saying it it sounded really good at the time you weren't yourself the projector booth that sounds about right i need to get in there i have the access code for the door here thanks i'm just glad you showed up now he said he'd be back after he'd arranged for some security do you feel up to telling me what's going on here we have an art exhibition here supposed to open tomorrow i'm the curator my name's serena valdivia alan wake holy it is you i didn't i mean i've seen you on the big screen i i know your wife you know alice wait big screen yeah we have a film from her here what the hell happened to you getting back to alice oh god yeah sorry uh it's quite a coincidence that you're here she made this short film i mean she shot it years ago you're in it it's a part of the exhibition i'm in a film yeah it's like i mean it's just footage she shot of you at some point but she turned it into this thing it's a almost like a memorial of sorts because you know you're supposed to be dead or something how's alice is she all right she's okay i guess all things considered i know her pretty well you're really alan i can't believe you're here nobody knows what happened to you but there are people who say they've seen you that wasn't me it just looks the same like you know yeah but that guy's a lot more slimy the thought of him makes me i hate him but i there's something about him this god he's so creepy anyway you're not like him at all i hope you can stop him [Music] [Music] that's the security system foreign [Music] the champion of light can feel the fragment of the signal in his pocket the weapon that can change what will be it's incomplete but it's all he has [Music] [Music] oh hell this isn't going right you've been up to something haven't you too bad it's not gonna do any good i'm a better you than you ever will be and i've got all the time in the world everything you've got going to be mine your life your wife what are you gonna do about it the sun's never coming up now i could keep this up forever show yourself whatever you say buddy the rush of darkness is unstoppable time itself twists and tears sweeping the champion of light back with its dark currents again he enters the world but now he sees the trap for what it is a maze that loops back into itself i'm here again he sent me back in bright falls i was constantly under attack by birds that were more shadow than flesh and feathers but this is an evolution some of the taken were actually capable of turning into a flock of birds to escape my attacks and turning back into human form to make surprise attacks [Music] oh not birds again the hell i'm trapped in the darkness he has started appearing to me mr he can travel back into the world effortlessly and he loves to rub my face in it at first he was just an echo in the darkness a flicker beyond the edge of my vision now he started showing himself getting bolder all the time telling me what a great time he's having in the world while i'm stuck here and what he plans to do especially to alice all the moves i have left are dangerous and desperate i have no choice i have to hunt him foreign i don't make friends easily i know plenty of people but i don't let most of them close i've known barry wheeler ever since we were little boys with the time of our lives i'd get us in trouble and he'd talk us out of it things haven't changed that much now that we're grown-ups he's the most loyal and dependable person i've ever met and all the things that count anyway you could call a weasel and you wouldn't be entirely wrong you could call him a clown and i would reluctantly agree but he has never let me down emma you're here wow it is you i i guess all of it really happened you remember me kind of i felt weird all day like i could almost remember a dream i had and then just before sunset i remembered the page yeah i'm going to have to go get those things again not all of them i i went out and got them well most of them i felt stupid at first but then it was getting dark and those those things started showing up and one of them made off with the battery it ran into the railroad tunnel there was no way i was gonna follow him in there sorry it's good you didn't you should be careful i mean really careful yeah i kind of remember something something bad happened to me didn't it forget it it doesn't have to happen again okay just do what i say yeah okay god this is too weird am i going crazy here just go get that battery try to stay calm you're perfectly sane we're caught in a time loop that's why this is happening again i i believe you god i feel like i might just lose it any second now how come you're not freaking out over this because on my personal weird a meter this just doesn't rate look i know something happened to me before you're gonna be okay if you just keep cool okay thanks for getting this stuff for me it's a big help i hope so are you gonna make everything blow up at the oil field again i have to well whatever the hell else you might be at least you're not boring just the battery that'll save time [Music] okay so this just came up to me and said she's my biggest fan i know they all say that right and she's giving me the eye so i make a couple of moves we have a couple of drinks and then things start happening but i say i have to go to the bathroom first oh right she's got no idea watch this this is gonna be priceless [Music] that's nice i thought you'd like that are you tense you feel a little tense maybe a little i had a crabby day yeah don't worry that's improving real fast [Music] hey don't stop it's just getting good watch this yeah did you see that oh man did you see her boom [Music] but on a rare occasion imagination and reality becomes night springs doesn't exist it's a fictional town from the tv show i used to work on it was any place usa a place we used as a backdrop for whatever strange story we had that week one of the stories i wrote for the show involved a man the champion of light fighting his evil double the herald of darkness it was something i'd written back in the real world something i had a link to a framework i could build on i had adapted it into a new story this story this so now night springs is in arizona although not for long it's in arizona because whatever the town that has become night springs is really called is located near one of the thin worn places in the world where dreams and reality flow together and life is always a little strange perfect analogy for night springs i can't return to the real world i've tried but i'm operating on dream logic forcing the door open a crack so i can slip through i can enter the strange little town of night springs all i did was put in arizona for one night well this should be perfectly safe now i just need her to charge this up uh [Music] i found the battery okay i'll charge it here try not to get killed [Music] okay i'm gonna take care of this try to stay calm look what if i just what if you stay here with me please i'm sorry but if i don't deal with this no one else will yeah i guess it's just that this is getting really creepy i believe this is real but i don't understand any of it i'm getting scared i can't believe you're so calm i get scared but i've had a lot of time to get used to it that helps the guy who looks like me is the reason this is happening i caught up with him but he swept me back here back in time yeah it's a trap we'll be doing this forever unless i can break out of it how are you gonna do that i'm working on it i came prepared but things got kind of scrambled when i arrived i'm tracking down the things i need yeah well feel free to climb back into your delorean or whatever it is you do well here we go again better get ready to run huh [Applause] [Music] [Music] so so should be in trouble better hurry emma coming to me this is not the bad thing just keep your head down it's okay it's safe now okay people it's eddie rodman here with a few hours to kill and there's nobody i'd rather spend them with nobody else in the whole world oh boy that'll land me in hot water when i get back home won't it well just in case my wife is listening and you always are aren't you baby let me tell you you are the exception honey and the prettiest lady i ever saw in a boot but i'd really like to spend some quality time with you listeners because tonight's one of those nights you're sitting in the studio and you kind of forget how long it's been or what day it is you just sit here and go through the motions you might as well have been here forever you keep talking but you don't even know what you're saying it's like you're on automatic you can't stop the ride and get off it's times like these that i really wish that somebody would just call in and relieve my boredom how about it anybody come on i'll help you fell out our lines are open i got a really bad feeling about all of this i'm gonna need those keys to the diner now there's a motel key there that i have to get oh hey you don't have to do that i have the motel master key i work for the same company you know um what's at the motel well there's a dead guy he's got something i need to get into the mount red tooth observatory god that's awful hey um you wanted to know about the guy who looked like you didn't you the last time you said he had a party and but you didn't go i no that's not true i did go it was really great at first and and then i didn't see it myself but i hear he turned nasty he hurt a bunch of guys pretty bad and there was this girl he she died but i didn't hear about that until afterwards i thought that he was so charming and then he went to the diner that's that's right i wasn't involved i wasn't involved with that at all i don't know what happened fine i need to check out these motel rooms in the meantime you stay here okay i'm serious keep the lights on and stay here yeah okay you got it i sure hope you're right about this you're gonna stay here this time right because the last time i didn't and that thing whatever it is happened to me yeah i don't want you to get hurt again don't worry i'm gonna stay put i don't remember what happened exactly but i learned my lesson good it doesn't have to happen exactly the same way this time around you proved that much when you went out and got those things for me i think you're gonna be okay let's hope you're right this time she does as she's told it's not enough to save her my own face peered back at me from the tv screen for a moment i struggle with the sensation of deja vu how many times have i seen myself like this now and then there was that easy grin that never seemed quite as quick or natural on my own lips the dark malicious twinkle in the eyes and i knew who i was looking at as he pulled back and revealed the room behind him my throat went dry there was nothing i could do but watch alice and barry my wife and my best friend are easily the two most important people in my life and they've never really gotten along with each other i suppose both of them resent the other's intrusions into what they considered their domain after i was gone they maintained an uneasy truce my book stayed in print still selling the licensing machine churned away she was my wife and controlled the intellectual property he was my agent and took care of the business i wish they found more common ground than that it's said that nobody knows what the future might bring but for this man it's no longer entirely true a weaker man might simply give up but the champion of light is an expert on destiny sometimes the puppet and puppeteer can be one and the same mount red tooth it's top littered with man-made eyes that stare into the endless depths of space tonight the champion of light will depend on them to pick out a message from the ether as history repeats itself the man remembers the patterns he knows that he needs the missing part for the telescope i better find dr meadow's car that's where the camera should be so oh praise me you guys are coming through for me uh pretty little light just started blinking on my board here and that means there's a caller out there you know when the hours stretch into eternity like this but it feels like i'm stuck in a rut and just reliving the same endless night over and over again i feel genuinely touched by someone actually reaching out to me breaking the monotony i just want you to know that it really matters to me caller you're on the air did you know that this is my dream job true fact when dr rachel meadows got the call from michael telling her to hurry to the observatory she didn't waste any time it had been a nice party she had a good time but her social life would always play second fiddle to the mysteries of space michael never showed up of course he pulled over at the wrong rest stop she never even thought about him at the time the phenomenon in the sky above her was too fascinating the atmosphere in the projection booth at the drive-in was charged almost unreal despite that the air felt cool and refreshing this late at night it'd been a hot day the summer was nearing its end but it wasn't over yet so there are places where our world is worn thin and another reality brushes against ours one such site is cauldron lake near bright falls washington but there are others that other reality is dark vast and malleable always in flux in its depths dwell vast forces and alien energies they're dangerous but in one of these places if you know how you can channel the power of that place and use it to shape reality the darkness rose from the depths of cauldron lake and took alice it needed words it needed me to write its way into our world she was leverage a hostage i complied but with a twist i put in a loophole that gave me a chance to fight back i was hunted by shadowy enemies but i faced the darkness i fought it with light i drove it back i saved alice but it came with a cost i was trapped in the dark place below cauldron lake foreign stories come naturally to us we can't help it there are many different worlds many competing realities within our heads fueled by books television even barely remembered childhood tales there's an endless supply of fictional concepts more familiar to us than anything or anyone real we have a far greater connection to the fictional characters we know and love than the random people we pass on the street our destinies and inspirations are shaped by lies myths and fables it's you how dare you no wait it isn't you is it i i suppose you'd better come in i'll i'll unlock the door thanks i know what you're thinking evil twin supernatural powers but most of the time i just like to keep things basic i want you to understand that like this need to get your hands dirty no batteries no moving parts just physics that's technology can depend on it's a classic speaking of classics you need to be careful with this one though if the victim suddenly twists you might end up cutting yourself it's not really a workhorse but i'm a sucker for this style now this is more like it you've got slip resistant grip believe me you really want that traction once you wrist deep in somebody the blade's stiff enough so it won't open by accident in your pocket but still really easy to open with just one hand now that's a big thing for me i know what you're thinking it's too big too heavy but sometimes you just need the extra [Music] if you're talking intimidation this is gonna do the job also great for dismemberings and whatnot you know the messy jobs ah i can't tell you how many things i've macgyvered with this stuff okay now guns not a big fan i mean how are you supposed to really connect with somebody with a bullet i want you to understand that i take pride in what i do we can't both be worthless hacks can we have to forgive me but this feels very strange it seems like this has all happened before i have the replacement part for your telescope doctor hi all right um huh i think we can give this a go although i have this strange feeling but don't start it up yet a problem with the coolant system yes that's right i remember all right let me think if they're sabotaging it they'll be at the primary coolant pipe outside if you can secure it we should be ready to pick up the signal that is why you're here isn't it yes it is i'll take care of it before you go if you have the time i'd appreciate if you came up here and explained a few things all of this is very strange to me [Music] hello i don't quite know what's going on but i seem to remember having had this encounter before it's not deja vu doctor this has happened before we're caught in a time room that's utterly insane how could that be i can't really explain it i suppose i could call it magic i don't believe in magic neither do i but i can't argue with what i've experienced listen what matters now is the signal the last time we only caught a part of it i need the rest of it whether you believe me or not you want to look into this as much as i do right i yes all right i realize that you have trouble believing this that's an understatement i can't deny that what you say resonates with me on some level i don't pretend to understand but for all i know i'm simply delusional but it's not just you i've experienced the same thing as you doesn't that proves something at least maybe on the other hand given your appearance and the fact that you're trying to convince me that i'm not insane perhaps you're merely a hallucination that accompanies my delusions you're not having a psychotic episode doctor what it's worth i'm a skeptic by nature i completely understand your reluctance to believe me there are people caught so deep in their psychosis that they retroactively manufacture memories and beliefs that conform to the situation at hand sure but you have to stop second guessing yourself at some point if you want to get something done huh the taken may well be the tool the darkness favors over any other at some point they used to be human but whatever humanity once had is long gone now they're just shells covered and filled by darkness the taken mr throws at me are more grotesque and varied than the ones i first encountered in bright falls but i know how to deal with them i'd be lying if i said they don't frighten me but i've survived worse i can't let them stop me so oh [Music] ah doctor can you hear me i think we're good to go all right i'll start looking for the signal please head back [Music] i guess they didn't like that so  no way after my disappearance they thought i was dead i might as well have been i know it's been two years i know alice has moved on i've tried to find a way back to her back to my life but escaping the dark place is almost impossible time to strange things here but dreams and radio signals can pierce the veil between the worlds i catch glimpses and echoes of the world sometimes i send messages out i can only pray that they hear them alright [Music] [Music] ah it's working please come up here [Music] uh you find the signal yes i don't think it's quite the same thing we had um the last time still we're definitely picking it up are we getting the complete signal now i'm afraid not take a look at yourself i'm printing out a hard copy now i'd like to ask you a question or two before that though if you don't mind what's on your mind doctor most people would find these events extremely disturbing provided that they survive these creatures that is you seem to be quite adept at dealing with the situation why is that yes i was involved in it's a complex story i was in this small town and a horrible thing from another dimension kidnapped my wife and manipulated me into writing this horror story that came true i learned to fight it with light and i managed to contain it and free my wife but i was trapped in its world are you serious absolutely so i'm used to reality working in strange or even impossible ways and i fought these things not exactly like this but close enough for a good while now of course i have certain advantages was there anything else what did you mean when you said you have advantages at the risk of sounding like a lunatic reality is much more fluid than people think it can be influenced i didn't take you for a mystic i'm not i'm a writer and under certain conditions i can for lack of a better word rewrite reality change things that's absurd but it works assuming i believe this why didn't you simply i don't know write yourself some superpowers it's not quite that simple you need to follow certain laws of drama i suppose you need to think about consistency and symbolism often what you write isn't anywhere near as important as what you imply there are things out there that will take advantage of your mistakes you really believe in this don't look at me like that you've experienced some of this yourself i will gladly admit that something exceedingly strange is going on but this idea that you're somehow altering reality with your writing is ridiculous you're essentially saying you're controlling my actions leaving aside the rational arguments against us what gives you the right well it's more like having a destiny a path you're on you're not aware of it but there it is if somebody changes it what difference does it make it's what every writer does if you write something that affects one of the characters they don't really know about that i'm not a character are you saying that it's all right to take advantage of someone if they aren't aware of it look all i meant was that if you're genuinely making all your own decisions and those decisions lead to whatever destiny you have what practical difference does it make i suppose that depends on whether our destinies are determined by things like physics and probabilities or natural reality which is presumably neutral and impartial or by some kind of an intelligence if it's the latter that intelligence makes choices based on some criteria if we suffer as a result of those choices there's a moral and ethical element involved regardless of whether we're aware of its manipulations wouldn't you agree i you're taking this very well i thought you'd be angry i suppose i would be if i thought you could actually do this another printout another signal fragment the message is still not complete but it's another piece of the weapon he has built against his adversary mere words on a piece of paper but in the right hands they will hold back the darkness the last time the man came to the drive-in it did not end well he hopes to avoid that fate this time he hopes that what he has brought with him to this place is enough serena's probably out of her mind again but i'm gonna need that key so i can get the power back on [Music] to change the world you must craft a blueprint for the new reality any work of art will do as long as it's a genuine act of creation that's what the energies of the dark place respond to the results may be subtle and perplexing or far ranging and momentous my area of expertise the written word gives much more precise results than music or interpretive dance would for instance but words can be extremely dangerous what you define may become reality but so can that which you imply even if you don't realize you're doing [Music] so [Music] you again i'm really just here to get the keys so i can get the power back on you want to hold me down it's okay i know you like that yeah i'll just grab the keys i could be like your wife little wifey waiting at home for hubby or you could be the mailman or the neighbor i'm already married to someone who isn't crazy thanks i'm just gonna go and get the power back on look i may or may not be back i have the access code to the booth already so once the power is on you should totally come see me we could have fun you know we'll see how it goes you should sit down or something try to stay calm i don't want to be calm i want to be nasty i want to be nasty with you yeah okay you could do anything you want you can use mine let's not even go there i was hoping that you'd remember more but i guess that was too much to ask i was about to do the weather but i see we have a caller uh hey you're on here with eddie what's up hey eddie it's ricky you talked about fate before you think about that a lot not a lot to be honest but uh i take it you do oh yeah oh yeah any conclusions you'd care to share ricky well we've got free will right that's in the bible and everything yeah right sure so free will right am i right i mean if we can do what we want how can there be fate i mean you don't know what's going to happen next so there's no fate there's just people doing stuff well i don't know ricky i don't suppose you have considered the possibility that we're all here in the service of a greater purpose incomprehensible to us and that what we take to be freedom is nothing more than the move of a pawn on some cosmic chess board limited in scope subject to the whims of unseen players existing only for their entertainment or perhaps with just a twisted reflection of actual events that can happen elsewhere could it be that such is life in night springs um dude what food for thought ricky food for thought are you getting it yet genius huh ah so it's been two years since i came here being that long without alice breaks my heart and i know it broke hers i know she thinks i'm dead how could i blame her for that it would be a crime to pretend that she owes me anything she took all the stupid self-indulgent  i brought into her life and still stood by me still loved me it's no betrayal but i'm a better person now than i used to be i want to be that person with her i want to talk about alice just look at her she's really beautiful isn't she your wife well our wife really just my wife soon don't worry i'm not gonna treat her like the others she's special if i wanted her dad she would be i've been around for a while now so talented you haven't seen your new work of course oh it takes my breath away really she's that good did you know that i've got a wedding ring too without similar she's seen me a couple times you know i've let her catch glimpses she thinks she's imagining things of course she thinks you're dead it might as well be i mean even if you manage to keep surviving you'll be in my trap forever so i'll go to her it'll be an amazing oh my god you're alive i'll be the good loving husband for as long as i can stand it she'll love it and then one day somehow it'll happen maybe i'll slip up she spots something or maybe she just starts running her mouth and then i'll do it it's gonna be sweet my darling wife it's obvious that for all his power mr is an agent of another greater being the dark place he came from is full of terrible alien intelligences dark presences and none of them should be let loose in our world he serves one of them he'll open the way for them if i don't stop him but he'll do more he'll take over my life he already has my face he already uses my name he'll become alan wake in every way imaginable and corrupt everything unless i can stop him like a little hamster and a wheel go ahead and keep running for all the good it'll do you uh the dark place is utterly hostile to human life it eats at your mind wants you to succumb to madness your own thoughts can turn against you every shadow conceals a threat that attacks at the slightest sign of weakness you're under endless assault every day is a struggle for survival but i've learned to take care of myself i focus on alice our life together my need to be with her that takes me a long way in the dark place as long as i have my gun and the flashlight [Music] [Music] for serena valdivia burning the midnight oil was more of an exception than a rule a procrastinator and a perfectionist she often worked when she wouldn't be disturbed tonight was especially important the film festival would open tomorrow and there was still so much to sort out it wasn't that the work hadn't been done she just didn't feel like she had completely mastered everything yet [Music] uh if you die you lose if you quit you lose sucker [Music] so [Music] the champion of light knows that the time itself is about to end at least for him he can feel the dead end rushing towards him but there is time to act incomplete or not he has the weapon i don't have the whole thing but maybe it's enough [Music] [Music] [Music] it's not enough you're trying to be cute aren't you what are you up to it's a waste of time buddy you should just lie down and die let me take over this is the only thing you've got coming to you from here to eternity no matter how many times you come back time folds back on itself again his senses scream as the very impossibility of what is happening assaults them but the champion of light endures each time he gets a little closer each time another detail falls into place now the trap works against the herald of darkness [Music] holy what are you the king [Music] hillbilly tor and odin anderson old gods of asgard i still don't quite know what to make of them i know they used to be rock stars who modeled their stage personas after norse gods i know they're old i know that in their day they fought the darkness as i do i know they're demented and insane ravaged by age and self-abuse but there's something in them something powerful that took hold when they were touched by the powers beyond a thing that goes far beyond just stage names something godlike right on cue bubbling to the surface from untold deaths the horrors come the emerging monsters do not expect the warm reception that has already been prepared for them so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign next stop saving emma [Music] getting the andersons into the recording studio was a struggle and a half but once they actually picked up the instruments something happened they were two old men and they weren't they were daughtering bags of bone and they were barely contained power and there was music barry rubbed his hands together he knew how to pick a winner now all they needed was some direction on how to make things a little more modern barry had never produced a thing in his life but he knew what he liked he knew balance slays the demon was going to be a hit is it bad that this time i just went oh he's gonna be right along to save my ass as long as i show up i guess clear now [Music] so i've been thinking about barry i don't know what to do about him yet i mean i'm not going to keep him around that's for sure al al oh little parasite your best friend really that's the best you can do i actually kind of like the guy he's a blocky little butterball plays the clown that's a hard road to take but i don't need him sticking his fat face in my business [Applause] did you know he's been hanging out with the sheriff from that shitty little town they keep in touch bears about the only guy who insists that you're not dead how about that i might keep him alive for a while just to see him go to pieces when i fire his ass yeah yeah [Music] emma wasn't sure exactly when the man arrived at the motel but from what she could tell the party started almost immediately it was infectious spreading from one room to another he was mercurial almost as if he was flickering through the scene telling a joke here throwing an insult there oozing sex and violence and excitement she had never seen someone like this before he looked at her and smiled and she felt her heart flutter a little she knew he was the kind of man mothers warned their daughters about but she told herself it didn't matter well art lovers are you feeling neglected you shouldn't you know eddie rodman's got love for you which is why i actually hauled myself out of bed before noon just so i could record an interview for your pleasure enjoy now as i'm sure you all know the annual night springs visual art show is coming around again and that's a big deal for all of us that are in the culture business if you can call it a business that's a little controversial i know that's okay money makes the world go around no doubt about it and that's one of my guests here at studio serena valdivia she's a curator at the knight springs gallery of visual arts and she's in charge of the nsva film festival held this year at the old night springs drive-in theater hello eddie it's great to be here and let me just say that it's a wonderful venue absolutely and wither is one of the filmmakers somebody who's actually primarily known as a renowned photographer alice wake hello alice i've seen a lot of your work over the years it's very impressive my wife's a big fan actually oh thank you you've uh you've gained quite a bit of fame as a photographer but that's not why you're here right you actually have a film that's a little surprising for me too i really wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for serena uh you two are friends i take it yeah we move in the same circles so about a year ago i heard about all this footage she'd shot and i got to see some of it and then i started pestering her about actually putting it out there because it was really good i didn't really want to show it it felt too personal well yes i can understand that it features your husband and he's um well he's he's dead i thought he was missing it's been two years i this sounds awful but yes i believe he's dead otherwise he would have well you know yeah i understand well hold that thought and we'll be right back [Music] i have seen the darkness twist flesh into new shapes before but encountering these giants is an extremely disturbing experience it's as if the genre has been switched on me there's something out of pulp fiction twice as tall as normal men and stronger than forklifts their lumbering gait and slow-witted demeter brings to mind some kind of mean-spirited caricature of a feeble-minded hillbilly yeah thanks for saving me again i'd hate to die before i'm scheduled to be murdered i guess i have you to thank for setting everything up at the oil derrick yeah well i figured that if we were going to go over this again we might as well try to be smart about it huh i appreciate it you took a big chance doing that are you okay what do you think i've died twice i remember everything pretty clearly now you said i was gonna be okay i don't know what happened it's not your fault i think one of those what did you call them the takers i think they did something to the power and they got me that way i'm sorry i got the keys from the dead guy in that room and i'm not handing them over until you do something about this i'm sick of getting killed fair enough you seem calmer now i tried freaking out didn't do much good for me i guess you get used to the craziest stuff good for you plus i figured i'd take the edge off you know mm-hmm those herbal supplements are pretty good huh oh yeah i wanted to try to explain things to you now since you're calmer but maybe this isn't the best time after all oh yeah better not get all metaphysical on me now seriously i'm like two sentences away from thinking how we could all be like atoms on god's skin or something or figments of somebody's imagination um wow uh i'm just gonna try to chill out and not think about that or or getting murdered or anything if you're cool with that gotcha [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] okay i really don't think they can get to the power now thank you that's a relief um here's the keys that you needed thank you hey i have to tell you at the diner i went there with him the guy who looks like you okay i know i said that i didn't yeah i figured want to talk about what happened at the diner there was this guy from the observatory and he just attacked the poor dude smashed his face into the tabletop a bunch of times it was horrible i i didn't know that he was gonna do that i swear and i just ran i just left him there i didn't even try to help there was nothing you could have done it's not your fault well he's dead in that motel room now so excuse me if i feel pretty shitty about it anyway you shouldn't blame yourself i just didn't want to get involved i have this tendency to just drop everything and run i don't think i'm a bad person but i i didn't even call the cops i'm such a coward if you'd called the cops we'd have dead cops he's not human do you understand it's not your fault but i could have tried to stop him believe me if you had you'd be dead you seem to be doing a little better now yeah i guess it just got easier once i got this thing off my chest i just feel so guilty about it especially because i didn't pick up on any of the warning signs i just really liked hanging out with him you know he was smart and charming and funny and hot the way you could be i guess i guess what's the deal with this guy anyway he looks like you he uses your name why does he do this stuff i'm not sure myself maybe he's just evil or my dark half he does a lot of the stuff i'm trying really hard to get away from things that just messed up my life i guess all those murders don't help either yeah i could do without the murders in the end of the world listen i need to get going yeah go i think i'm good now i hope good luck if it all goes well maybe this is the last time we meet like this god wouldn't that be great just keep those lights on okay [Music] [Music] uh the fate of countless individuals hangs in the balance threatened by the machinations of the herald of darkness and yet for a moment the champion of light breathes a little easier he has saved one life for this moment it is enough and soon perhaps he can put an end to this returning to the observatory for what he hopes is the final time the man feels anticipation and dread in equal measure soon he knows he will have what he needs [Music] hello i was expecting you i've already taken care of the imaging array but you should still look into securing the primary coolant flow with some luck you may be able to light the area before these things even show up [Music] thanks for tuning in for the second part of our interview with serena voldivia and award-winning photographer alice wake now alice we were talking about your husband alan wake is that a sore subject for you well a little bit of course it is the way i see it we had our good times and our bad times and on the whole we had a lot of good times he really made me happy i don't mind being reminded of it so you're you're over him i don't know if i'll ever be that entirely i still think about him every day literally i still find myself hoping for well sometimes i think i see him just standing somewhere watching me i think most people who lose someone they love experience things like that but on the whole i'm doing all right two years is a long time to adjust and i'm not really the type to wallow in the negative well i know there are a lot of stories about allen they seem to have something of a wild streak um that's not really what our show is about though look all that stuff really gets blown out of proportion he had his problems but it's really frustrating for me because people like to talk they love to tell these crazy stories and they never really knew him at all well a character he created alex casey is a household name and the book still continues to sell there's been talk of a tv series a movie a video game must be nice to know that his work is still being appreciated by so many readers yes of course but i don't really deal with the business side i leave that to ellen's agent that would be barry wheeler actually i just interviewed him he's currently in the music business and he's also alan's best friend do you two keep in touch we talk regularly like i said he handles business side i think we should talk about her film yes yes of course you're right i'm eddie rodman talking to alice wake and serena valdivia and we'll be right back very good i believe we're ready to look into the sky right there doctor [Music] mix this this act of creation is exhilarating and frightening subtext and symbols loom eager to take effect causality and consequence become domino chains that stretch into infinity the more fundamental the change the more unpredictable the variables become reality is too complex to control completely ordinary questions become meaningless who created who what is really real everything is as real as everything else you learn to let go of the things you can't control and go with the flow or go insane the film noir poster reminded me of alex casey the detective's cool exterior never cracking even with the gun pointed in his face in the back room all the lights had been turned off except for the lone spotlight which illuminated the bright red fire extinguisher on the wall come on in this is what you look like does that bother you i bet it does i'm not just wearing your face you know it goes a lot deeper than that there's a lot of you and me all the best parts at first i was just an idea but they kept telling all those stories about you you already had that rep and then you disappeared mysteriously and then the stories about bad crazy alan week came true and here i am that's the best part isn't it when that happens you can always count on cauldron lake i'm just as real as you are and i'm the improved version no fears no doubt no weaknesses no self-deception here i don't let anything drag me down i know you like i know myself i know it bothers you that i'm like this that i use your name crawl my way into your life but only do it because i'm better at being you than you ever were [Music] but we can't complete the signal oh there i have it but i wish these things would stop lately violating the laws of physics in my observatory that's just rude are you all right i'll live i'm glad i'll send the lift down to you i remember our previous encounters very clearly now but technically if this really is a loop in time we've never met before i don't know why our awareness persists but is bloody fascinating doctor you know i know physicists who would give 15 years of their lives for a chance to experience something like this i'd imagine that being stalked by horrible axe murders would curb their enthusiasm a little clearly you've never met hardcore physicists i'm glad you're in such good spirits but signal yes it's completed finally if all goes well this should be the last time we go through the loop you know i just realized that i don't have any memory of what happens after you leave what does that mean i don't think it means anything if everything goes well you just keep going i don't show up here like this again no more bad guys things go back to normal let's hope you're right i'd love the opportunity to look into this in more detail looks like you've accepted the situation i'm a pragmatist if this is a delusion at least my first psychotic episode is anything but boring really mr wake at the end of the day i'm a scientist i love mysteries i love not knowing whatever else this might be it's absolutely fascinating i wonder how far this reaches is everybody in the world experiencing this who knows i think reality is probably pretty fragile right now doctor i can see you're very enthusiastic about this i'd appreciate a bit of discretion are you suggesting that we should suppress this no you can do what you like but i want you to leave me out of it but surely with the things you know the things you've experienced you can replicate any of these results we could let me be blunt if you drag me into this i'll deny everything i'll lie like my life depended on it and writers are damn good liars word of advice this is things man was not meant to know territory you get into this chances are you'll open up a door into a world of hurt believe me i know i see in a strange way he feels at ease he is armed with his own words and when the time comes they will be enough or they will not for now he's content to let the currents take him toward the final confrontation once more we return to the drive-in if he's aware of the absurdity of arming oneself with a few sentences and standing against a power that can pierce time itself he doesn't show it the man has his share of weaknesses perhaps more but cowardice is not among them oh you've got yourself a little plan do you ah [Applause] so oh man wow uh so you're never getting out of this wake never don't worry i'll take care of your wife and your life so [Music] uh so i don't know what you think you're doing but i'll send you right back what you think whatever it is you're gonna do is gonna make a difference this'll end up just like before there's more to fighting the taken than just burning away the darkness that protects them when i'm fighting for my life i find myself slipping into a state of intense concentration that makes the beam of my flashlight seem more powerful and focused i used to think it was just my imagination something brought on by the adrenaline and fear of death but now i'm not so sure i've been touched by powers that i can't begin to truly comprehend and they've left a mark i'm starting to think this might be a part of it around for a while now you know well you've been indisposed stuck in the darkness i've been busy i operate in the shadows not always literally you understand i'm a little more resilient than those i've taken but i do my best work in the dark and there's so much darkness out there it goes deep and the things that live in it are fast big bastards they don't mind getting a little bit of elbow room all that chaos and madness it doesn't really do that much down there it's like pouring a glass of water into the ocean right up here yeah you can really make an impact [Music] all they need is someone to bring them all the way through but first i had to take care of you you party pooper you're stuck in an eternal cycle now the sun's never coming up for you everything else do my thing in a bit of quality time with alice that's a little something for me and i deserve it uh oh [Music] foreign [Music] again the champion of light enters the final trap the new reality is almost here all he needs to do is change the details of the scene push it past the breaking point and the rest will snap into place [Music] [Music] oh come on buddy why don't you what what is this you can't do this all i did was take the things you always wanted and never had the balls to go for it's my turn it's my [Music] life alan [Music] is it is it really you it's really me [Music] a woman a man two lovers held apart for far too long enveloped in the light of a glorious dawn they both feel it he's home at last are these actual events or merely a dream a memory or a glimpse of what is to come one thing is certain this scene takes place in another time and another place far far away from night springs no now [Music] you
