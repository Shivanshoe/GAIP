dad dad are you there can you hear me [Music] jacob can you hear me what is this place it's a school i attended before judgment day why are we here you know why dad it doesn't matter come on it's your birthday of course it matters besides you're the one always saying that you're old enough to scavenge well today you actually are but we're not even supposed to be here the resistance said skynet was around here i wouldn't take everything john connor says his gospel what do you have against him i used to be a real [ __ ] we went to school together this school actually you've met john connor i didn't know him personally but everybody knew about him i guess this was just one of the schools he got expelled from i thought he'd remember it okay it looks safe you can follow me you're already on your way here aren't you i don't need you to babysit me dad just get yourself over here i need your help were you a good student not particularly why am i not surprised watch it hey dad i found some chemicals you have to dream bigger kid especially today i'm still taking them there you are now let's start searching this place what are we even looking for a time capsule what's a time capsule well it's a box filled with letters pictures and other things that we buried when i was a student here why did you bury it to preserve a piece of our lives i guess since it's been in the ground this whole time i'm hoping that it survived judgment day if i'd known that the world would end just a couple of years later i would have hidden something more useful in there again no one could have predicted that what would you have hidden i don't know a beer or something here lies history i think i found it stand back you know back in my day parents used to say that they wanted to give their children more than they had growing up and since that won't be possible for you i'd like you to have at least a taste of what i had okay let's see what we've got or something really a machine yeah we've got enough of those around here don't we what else is in there some uh baseball cards uh guess dad i i think we should go i really don't need anything how about this [Music] i know it's not much happy birthday jacob that's cool thanks dad ah look at this that's a letter i wrote to myself what does this say future frank that's me if you don't teach your son to mind his own business i'm going to be very disappointed with him very funny i'll hang on to it for later fine let's just go it's not safe here wait there's something else here now this one says that it needs to be hand delivered let's see what's so important dad we don't have time for this and it's not for you i doubt anyone's waiting for it how would you like it if a stranger read your letter are you serious i'm just trying to follow your rules you know what it's your birthday i won't open it unless we find the proper recipient it'll be our little project i promise what come here stay low as soon as it comes closer you make a run for it right now go come on jacob stay close right behind you through here [Music] are you all right i'm fine just go watch out [Music] dad dad wake up can you hear me wake up oh no i need to find a way out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] jacob are you okay dad you don't sound too good don't worry about me get out of here but dead i said get out of here i'll meet you there soon dad um [Music] i'm safe can you hear me if you can hear me please let me know where are you jake you're hurt they're coming we need to go we're going to be all right come on back move back dad jacob run sleeping on the job i see what can't say that it never happened to me oh there they are i knew i'd find them here are you okay you were talking in your sleep just a bad dream baron's looking for you we've got visitors that she wants you to meet visitors a techcom unit at least what's left of it just a heads up something's going on everyone's walking around nervous thanks [Music] i appreciate you taking us in commander i was sorry to hear about your team [ __ ] ambush i'll write it in the report that can wait new orders have come in for you excuse me you're moving out right away we just lost three men me and pharaoh need some time to recuperate afraid that's not possible northridge outpost has gone silent you need to go there find out what happened and what check if their radio's on you know that skynet's been jamming our signal that may be true but you'll still need to see to this personally what the hell is going on look it doesn't make sense to me either i could have sent a team of my own they'd already be there and we would know what went wrong so why didn't you because the order is coming directly from john connor he insisted it be you okay so what's the plan go to northridge find out what happened then escort the people there back to safety their withdrawal is long overdue where it is that you captured a new terminator model that's right an infiltration unit our top scientist is running an analysis on it as we speak does that have anything to do with this mission the last we heard from northridge was that they liberated a group of scavengers so that's certainly a possibility i see jacob rivers here helped us capture the new model he'll be joining you along with evans as per connor's request okay rivers so you can tell an infiltrator from one of us what else can you do [Music] so you're a marksman good we need sharp eyes out there all right check the supply crate and gather your equipment looks like we're moving out soon get ready we got a long drive ahead of us [Music] all set rivers open the gate we're moving out any questions before we leave rivers why do you think john connor selected us for this mission we must have his reasons he always does to be perfectly honest i learned a long time ago not to ask too many questions why he's got this uncanny ability of putting the right people in the right places at the right time that's a great skill to have when you're the commander of the entire resistance so when john connor vouches for you i already know you'll do your job well what do you think about this mission in normal circumstances i would say that the mission is straightforward but i would have appreciated some advance warning but these are not normal circumstances nothing is normal when conor's involved you're going to learn that very soon what do you think about the team corporal pharaoh is a good fighter i've been working with her for years you and evans i'll wait until i know you better but i'll postpone the introduction until we're on the road we're approaching northridge all right it's a good time to bring everyone up to speed this is a rescue mission as simple as it gets we go in secure the perimeter and prepare the evacuation i don't want anyone to draw skynet's attention we're not prepared for that we keep our heads down and evacuate those people to safety what if there's no one to evacuate care to elaborate corporal outposts don't stay silent for that long if no one's been reporting in i'd expect to find the remains of a massacre sir i think introductions are in order the eternal optimus sitting next to me is corporal pharaoh an explosive specialist sergeant rivers and i have already been introduced what about you evans what's your story i've read your file you're the sole survivor from the 113th right 113th i've heard about it how'd you manage to escape supposedly he took down a t-800 with his bare hands that's impossible that's what i'm saying is it true did john connor select us for this assignment that's right i'd like to meet him complete the mission and you just might we're getting close get ready northridge is up ahead evans give us the siprep no signs of any resistance soldiers at the gate not good 3t 600 approaching one o'clock t 600 they're still around let's not get sloppy we don't know what's behind that gate this is a techcom mission i want us to move fast i want us to be efficient understood yes sir yes sir now let's clear the area evans you want to start us off affirmative everyone on me target acquired to your right container there they are [Music] opening the gate [Music] we're [Music] where the hell is everyone there's no one here no bodies no keep your nothing oh [Music] let's move we need to get to the basement that's where they'd have taken their stand if anyone's left alive they'll be there there's more of them here keep firing let's move downstairs heavens you stay there and watch for reinforcements understood this way all right everyone get ready two in front down they go [Music] stay frosty we don't want to shoot friendlies if there are any friendlies left alive the doors to the garage are wide open what the [ __ ] is going on sergeant where is everyone watch the flag [Music] [Music] river you see that door on it step back i haven't seen that rubber face in a while [Music] that's the last one [Music] evans how's it looking on your side that's all of them then secure the perimeter what do we do now we need to report this find a radio station and keep your eyes open yes sir [Music] no bodies this doesn't make any sense [Music] [Music] no radio station here [Music] [Music] nothing [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh huh huh comms now this should be it sergeant found a radio station upstairs i understand you're not happy with the situation but for now you'll have to stay put at least until i discuss your next move with connor is that clear yes commander awaiting further instructions over and out all right looks like we're turning in for the night i understand that not everything went as planned today there are still a lot of unanswered questions here but for now get some rest tomorrow will be when the real work starts yes sir rivers do you have a moment i need to talk to you about your performance today sir you're very efficient reliable that's good that'll keep the other members of the team motivated hasn't been that way in a while so i appreciate your contribution even more that's it rivers keep it up yes sir [Music] [Music] sarge any new orders from hq not yet for now we're on our own i have pharaoh searching for any intel we may have missed yesterday we'll see what comes up what do we know so far sir i've been analyzing the intel that we have we've got some theories but nothing concrete i'm curious to hear what you think happened here where do you think those people went when people go missing it's usually safe to assume that skynet got to them i probably did usually i would agree with you but i've been over the area a couple of times there's no sign of a gunfight anywhere they wouldn't go down without a fight so there's little reason to think that they were attacked at least not in any conventional way as you can see there's a lot to unpack here and questions keep piling up at this point we just have to keep our eyes open speaking of which do you mind checking on pharaoh i'm waiting for a status report from her yes sir [Music] [Music] god damn it what's up i'm trying to get inside the armory but i suck at this i'd love to do it the usual way and blow this door wide open but reece doesn't want us to make too much noise can you help me nice job rivers huh bummer there's barely anything left looks like i lost the bet [Music] [Music] you mentioned a bed what do you mean evans has a theory that people here packed and left i didn't think much of it at first but an empty armory certainly is a head scratcher i guess we've got to keep looking speaking of which i'm supposed to do a sweep of the entire area but there's a back room on the ground floor that i couldn't get into it's blocked by a bunch of stuff that i couldn't move can you grab evans and see if the two of you can clear it sure i'll let him know what do you think about this whole situation i think it's obvious something [ __ ] up happened here i'm just mad at myself that i didn't see this coming how so well whenever rhys gets a direct order from conor something's off i don't know what the deal is between them they always keep their cards close so this happens a lot more than i'd like it to that's for sure i just wish reese included me since i'm always on these missions anyway what's rhys like you've worked with him for a long time you want to know what kyle reese is like he's like stone or steel nothing ever gets to him for better or worse what do you mean this is the first time we've been able to take a minute to ourselves since the failure of our last mission you know and he's been up all day trying to figure out our next move he's able to just disconnect work himself tirelessly as if nothing happened even if a lot of [ __ ] happened i'm sure it's because he cares for his people i'd say that he cares for the mission more than his people and here i am trying to hold it together thinking about the people we lost and not doing a good job at it well you wanted to know about reese not me that's what he's like rivers report to the communications room when you have a minute [Music] sergeant what's going on someone used an emergency broadcast system to deliver a message one of ours judging by how inaccurate the message is it's more likely sent by a civilian one of our missing residents that's what we'll need to figure out it's our best lead so far then we're moving out soon no we leave at dusk i don't want us to move around in daylight oh and rivers there's something else about that message that concerns me it's been sent from somewhere inside bakersfield isn't that just on the edge of the annihilation line that's right we're moving out as soon as it gets dark now's the time to rest [Music] yeah pharaoh mentioned there's a back room nearby that needs checking can you help me she said it's a two-man job just let me know when how did you know we wouldn't find anything in that armory i've been trying to work on the car but the garage here is missing some tools the only things still lying around here are what the protocol deems inessential equipment the things that are supposed to be left behind during an evacuation those people were packed and ready to go do you think it's safe to stay here that group of t-600s that we destroyed yesterday is a discontinued infiltration unit they tend to malfunction i doubt they're still connected to skynet so they couldn't give out our location we're safe here having said that i don't like the direction we're inching towards north yeah i'm ready let's go and see what's in that room sup is it true what they said in the car that you took down a terminator with your bare hands it's true how'd you do that i didn't even know someone could do that i was angry now focus we have a job to do this is it how do you want to do this oh check what's inside i'm heading back [Music] [Music] is this where you are sarge i've got a hold of some intel regarding someone who used to live just outside the shelter permission to follow the lead permission granted just remember we don't want to alert skynet to our presence here so i need you to move undetected copy that [Music] this doesn't make any sense resistant soldiers came to evacuate them i need to report this to reese i found something a note from someone who witnessed northridge being evacuated by what appeared to be resistant soldiers that's right that's what i was afraid of good job rivers now that we're certain of what happened here there's no other way but to follow the signal over and out huh [Music] rivers we don't need skynet's eyes on us right now [Music] we've received permission from hq to follow the signal next stop is bakersfield that's two hours away from the nearest resistance outpost so if it gets too heated there's no chance of support that's right anyone have a problem with that no sir i've got one thing sarge feral shotgun shotgun i only brought my rifle forget it this is it the message was sent from somewhere around here it wasn't accurate enough to give us the exact location so to cover more ground we'll be splitting into two groups i'll be spotting for rivers evans you spot for pharaoh what exactly are we looking for sir any signs of civilian activity no one's been in the area for a long time so report anything you see understood yes yes sir rules of engagement sir fire at will let's move out rivers let's go where do we start there used to be a non-military checkpoint at an old command center in this area that's where i want you to go first terminators 12 o'clock what do we do we could let them pass it's your call nice and easy [Music] the building over there is a good vantage point i'll be able to navigate you from there are you sure you're ready to do this on your own yes sir all right then just keep your radio close [Music] good luck rivers hk aerial flying by we don't have enough firepower to destroy it so keep an eye on it if it search light spots you you're out of luck i'm at the top i got a good view from here i can see that the hk could be a problem [Music] rivers i've noticed something there's a skynet antenna not far from your position i think that hk is part of its surveillance that's why it keeps popping up anything we can do about it it's too dangerous these types of facilities usually have their generators deep underground first you need a way to get down there so you're saying i need a rope i don't think you're hearing me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm getting closer to that checkpoint it's out of my line of sight building's compromised [Music] clear i'd like to proceed forward sir we need to be sure just be careful rivers [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] there's no one here take a look around see if you can find something useful [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] found a note about their evacuation plan it points to a location nearby it's worth checking out [Music] so so [Music] this is a place mentioned in the note proceed with caution i need help sergeant i hear a child's voice coming from inside the building a child here keep your eyes open [Music] where are you i'm over here can you hear me [ __ ] get out of there try to [Music] done so i see you're in one piece it was stupid i should have known something was up that's how the machines operate they use our humanity against us don't beat yourself up soldier just means you're still human [Music] found a rope so you're really going to go through with this word of warning get yourself some sound decoys the perimeter around the antenna is littered with silverfish i see a junkyard close by if you need some scrap metal to craft sound decoys that's where you'll find it [Music] the antenna i see it hacking it will grant us control over those surveillance turrets they're equipped with a second generation plasma rifle strong enough to bring down an hk that's exactly right uh um so [Music] [Music] how do i get inside there has to be a way down keep your eyes open [Music] so [Music] [Music] i see it i won't be able to hear from you when you get down there so good luck [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is it uh [Music] reporting back the generators offline move back rivers the antenna going gonna blow holy [ __ ] that flash of light was you are we trying to destroy skynet i thought this was just a rescue mission currently not for rivers evans we've got to step it up i appreciate keeping the morale up rivers [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i'm in the command center good take a look around and see if you can find anyone [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] nothing so far ariel two of them we need to clip their [ __ ] wings where are they heading i can see them touching down at what looks like a refueling station you can try sabotaging me if you're up for it i'm sure pharaoh and evans would appreciate that [Music] just another encoded message evans how's it looking on your end we just noticed some movement someone or something was heading your way we lost sight of it close to the cemetery cemetery i see it rivers i'm marking it on your map it's close heading there now so hmm hey you've got that hk refueling station in front of you roger that [Music] destroying those plasma containers will ground those hk's [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] that's the last one great job that'll slow him down substantially uh food [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at the cemetery the gate is breached approach with caution hk's down now repeat hk's down that'll give us some breathing space we appreciate that [ __ ] yeah we do [Music] huh [Music] sergeant there's no one here evans must have seen a terminator all right rivers time to pack up and go check if there's anything that we could use wait i hear something it's coming from a coffin be careful [Music] don't shoot don't shoot sergeant i found some [Music] are you the one that sent us that message yes yes i am i've been trying to reach you ever since i escaped from the convoy rivers we'll question him later we need to get him out of there yes sir move out i'm heading your way all right let's move [Music] they're coming stay low so [Music] it's safe now river over here follow me we need to get that man to safety i've set up an evacuation point this way terminators you stay behind rivers on me please no don't let them die the evacuation route leads through that building then let's clear the way let's go evans pharaoh we got the package you're clear to evac copy that we'll be heading out soon i'll just set a couple more explosives as a parting gift for skynet and we'll be on our way okay rivers they look just like you guys same uniform same weapons we thought we were saved but they led us to transporters that took us straight to a terminator factory with production lines churning out hundreds of them a day so our missing people are still there some most of them are in a work camp set up not that far from the factory where's that further north how far i couldn't see it was dark it was hard to tell you know what i'm asking was it behind the annihilation line yes yes it was [ __ ] i haven't seen anything like it before they torch everything in their path i snuck past it after i broke out of the convoy the ground was so hot it melted the souls on my shoe did i hear that right we're crossing the annihilation line that wasn't part of the plan it was supposed to be a quick recon mission i haven't decided on anything yet we're severely unprepared are you sure that's where they are hi what's up with him i don't i'm not sure sir we have to consider falling back i've noted your concerns corporal but ultimately i'll be the one making that decision now i need some time to think this through for now pharaoh set up the perimeter evans you're first on guard duty let's clear our heads is everything okay yes yes i'm fine i'm just tired i must be seeing things yeah that's right i'm i'm just seeing things rivers do you mind checking on the team i need some time to come up with a plan [Music] you don't sound too happy about what's going on why would i be you've heard rhys you know what it means we're crossing the annihilation line soon and what for to finish a mission that makes absolutely no sense did you hear that guy we're going after people that look like us isn't that exactly what that note said the one that you found in northridge we're in over our heads the team should always come first not the mission that's what the resistance taught me and i know i'm not the only one that feels that way you do too that hk in bakersfield was giving us a lot of problems and you took care of it because that's what a team does we look out for one another meeting connor is not worth all of this piece of [ __ ] i think there's someone else you should talk to first god [ __ ] damn it is uh everything all right this whole situation has me so wound up i'm shaking not good for handling explosives you're just tired you need a break i'd love to but since there's no one in 100 miles of here that can help i think i'll have to power through it's too early to start worrying rhys hasn't decided anything about crossing the annihilation line yet you know what else he's keeping quiet about how our previous assignment was stupid and bound to fail or how truly [ __ ] up it is that we're back in the trenches just hours after our team got decimated he hasn't mentioned brooks johnson or yang he hasn't mentioned them once like they never [ __ ] existed pharaoh i'm sorry i shouldn't be snapping at you like that let's talk yeah let's those were the soldiers that died during that mission weren't they yeah they were except they weren't soldiers not to me they were my family they practically raised me how so i enlisted when i was 11. i was assigned to this team of four guys who i was absolutely intimidated by i was trying to play the tough kid in front of them you know constantly trying to impress them looking back i must have been an endless source of entertainment for them what kind of things would you do i would make ieds out of everything i could get my hands on one time i turned johnson's flashlight into a pipe bomb and forgot to tell him he found out during a scouting mission i'm told he wasn't too happy about it with the four of them i was happy first time in my life i had someone looking after me that's what i imagine having a family must be like now i'm starting to think that if i get killed reese won't even care he can't look me in the eyes hasn't said my name this whole time it's always corporal like he doesn't know me what is your name it's charlotte anyway thanks for letting me vent sometimes that's all it takes rivers can i have a word with you sir i wanted to ask your opinion about what we've heard today what do you really think happened in northridge do you think that some rogue resistance squad cut a deal with skynet decided to deliver an outpost full of civilians in exchange for some special treatment or maybe you have a theory of your own regarding what's happened to me this looks like the job of terminators this is what the infiltration units were made for we're just now seeing what they're capable of i was afraid you'd say that i trust your judgment you had the most experience with him is that all sir one last thing we all know what the deal is with the t600s they're easy to spot and their rubbery mugs are not fooling anyone what about this new model i'm asking you because you're one of the few people that got to look at them up close and lived so do you think you would know if you were talking to a terminator i believe i would sir they may look human at first but they still act like machines that's what will always give them away it's good to hear i'll remember that that's it for now sarge actually i've been meaning to tell you something i think you should talk to corporal pharaoh it seems to me that she hasn't fully recovered from your previous assignment i understand unfortunately that'll have to wait there's still a lot of work ahead before we move out i don't mean to step out of line sir but that may be part of the problem i see your point but i can't lift the safety of my team preparations have to come first you can take a break now soldier you did a hell of a job today [Music] what's going on [Music] what the [ __ ] was that i don't know but we're not staying here to find out let's go on how about we worry about that later all right everyone on me rivers get that door open that thing was an hk century how the hell do you know that i saw them work on it when i was at that camp so another weapons has come online we're in deep [ __ ] there's more spread out armored spider 12 o'clock scratch that everyone focus next time that could be one of us [Music] time to go we need to get to the surface [Music] [Applause] fast oh that was close door everyone stay low and be quiet what the [ __ ] is that a firing squad they were waiting for us [ __ ] we gotta clear the way too many of them even more now drones i'm taking them out farrell focus on those spiders understand come out need some ammo stay low [Music] more drugs [Music] [Applause] there they are we're pinned down okay move watch out metal pull them off [ __ ] need some ammo here they are [Music] it's a whole [ __ ] army anyone have any pipe bombs left hi golfers [Applause] [Applause] get inside that building get a move on ain't good where's that extraction point about 30 seconds away we'll make it oh [ __ ] there it is do not stop this is it go go [Music] what the hell are we doing here is all this really worth it john sergeant i wanted to make an official request for a demotion there's no need for that pharaoh the anti-tank mines that i set up didn't work i feel responsible it's not your fault none of this should have happened because we shouldn't even be here in the first place easy soldier sergeant we're about to cross the annihilation line and i'd like to know why [Music] because you were selected for this mission that should be enough for you all due respect sir it isn't is there something that we don't know yet what's so special about those people we've been kept in the dark for too long is this how you all feel kyle there has to be more [Music] the last message sent before northridge went silent said that they rescued a group of civilians these people were kept in cages for years they were starved looked like they were barely alive and despite that skynet went looking for them why they mentioned a name a name conor wanted to keep his secret we didn't want anyone to be emotionally invested in the mission seeing how we're all looking over the edge now one of the people rescued was the father of sergeant rivers what that can't be true he's dead he died years ago conor got a hold of some intel confirming that's not true he's alive and he's in that camp does anyone have any more questions regarding the mission no no sir all right we move out in a couple hours get some rest that goes for you too rivers i'm gonna get some shut-eye before the mission [Music] i know this is a lot for you to take in but i can't have anyone on my team distracted not now is that understood [Music] you should have told me about my father earlier i couldn't risk you getting too emotionally involved people's lives depend on you staying focused soldier the success of our mission is everything it's all that matters so can you manage that yes sir so what's the plan and some will mention two targets we'll start with the skynet factory of course that means we'll have to cross the annihilation line first seems like a lot for a four-person team it is i want each of us to take a sector over the annihilation line once we're there our responsibility will be to cause as much damage as possible i want skynet to notice when it does it will send reinforcements from the factory leaving the place unprotected that's where we'll regroup before we get our people out i know that i'm asking you for a lot but i don't see any alternative we all know the risk sir and we're prepared to take it i'm sure you all do reverse but that doesn't change the fact that i'm the one that's asking you to cross the annihilation line it's a tough call and i'm glad i'm not the one making it i wouldn't be surprised if you're not completely comfortable making it either you deserve honesty rivers but if i were to speak freely i would have to say things that a soldier shouldn't hear from his commander get your gear we're moving out soon are you sure skynet will take the bait you have to remember that skynet is just a machine a program that works according to protocols and that works to our advantage they're predictable and that's going to be skynet's downfall do you believe these people are still alive sergeant the old man mentioned that skynet took them to a work camp if that's the case we're lucky what do you mean skynet won't start exterminating their prisoners until the camp's at full capacity or when their objective has been completed these people are valuable to skynet they'll keep your father alive rivers [Music] [Music] [Music] that's quite some news rivers can't imagine what's going through your head how are you feeling shocked to say the least and you it's going to get tough and i don't want to put anyone in danger i'm going to stop you right there i've been fighting my whole life and never really knew what i was fighting for now i finally have an answer that makes sense to me your father actual family that's something worth fighting for and we're going to get him back rivers the things i do to talk to my dad even if it was just for a moment what would you say you're putting me on the spot but well i've never met my father i guess that's not uncommon these days so i guess i would say hi nice to finally meet you but more importantly do you know what you're gonna say i don't know yet i hope that i can find the right words when i see him if i can recognize him that is don't worry about that it'll come to you have you talked to reese yet i'm not gonna bother him yet just look at the craziness he has to deal with i'll give him some space we'll probably talk when we get back from the mission this is about the team now we'll get them out rivers even if it means crossing the annihilation line [Music] we should be able to see it from that hill i smell something burning you're just imagining things or not holy [ __ ] it stretches as far as the eye can see and it'll continue to move forward that's why we need to focus on our objective we have to create as much havoc as we can i think they've got that covered we need skynet to take the bait once they do they will withdraw some of their forces from that factory and that's when we'll strike everyone knows where their sector is yeah yeah sir then let's move out everyone in position i want each of us to find a target something that will get skynet's attention and then destroy it yes sir let's get to work rivers one more thing there used to be a resistance shelter in your sector it was probably raided when our soldiers withdrew but it might be worth investigating what the [ __ ] is that sir i found a target but i don't think i've got enough explosives to make a dent in it take a picture i want to see it send in the picture now i see what you mean now you have to find out what they're using it for the computer in the nearby outpost should give us some answers and what about the excavator find a way to destroy it you mentioned an old resistance shelter i'll see if there are any explosives left that i could use that looks like your best option over and out so foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] so doors wide open sergeant i got enough explosives to bring that excavator down but there's still a lot of intel lying around here if skynet gets a hold of it we might have a problem [ __ ] they set a trap didn't go off huh i should set off the trap it's too risky to have these documents just lying around here the detonator changed [Music] oh [ __ ] [Applause] i got the explosives did you run into any problems no sir proceeding with the main objective [Music] mm-hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] so hmm [Music] [Music] so [Music] planning the explosives now i need to find determined [Music] explosives are alive it's coming down [Music] i love the job rivers evans you're hopeless now skynet will know how it feels [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] anything yet rivers nothing so far sir it could be a bogus lead keep your eyes open heading to the controller approaching the computer [Music] sir i've neutralized my two main targets all right rivers unless you need some time to finish any secondary objectives you can proceed to the extraction point we'll meet you at that factory all this will be over soon the intel i found mentioned that the construction of a nearby rail terminal is almost done you want to do something about it yes sir proceed as you see fit [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so so sir i've reached the terminal it's already in use there are lots of plasma containers here what do i do smash them don't leave any behind understood outstanding work rivers uh everyone's here good this is it that's the factory where they keep the prisoners looks like skynet took the bait they shifted their security forces what'd i tell you skynet's just a predictable piece of computer software we can use that against them the plan is simple we infiltrate the target building and secure the prisoners once we find the people we're looking for we leave rivers i want us to pick apart what's left of their surveillance mark the remaining terminis for evans to take out roger that i'm in position [Music] target acquired target down taking it down done target affirmative let's move this way the [ __ ] is that i'm gonna be sick wait does that mean no this factory's been in operation for a long time this this must be old rivers we need to get through that gate on it step back going in keep sharp danger ahead t47 up there rebooting [Music] g47 turn him out ah future oh that was the last one we need to get to the lower levels follow me [Music] down here cover two in front now [Music] we gotta keep moving they'll keep the prisoners deep underground terminators another turret actually done i know these signs we're close [ __ ] me is that the grinder yeah i never wanted to see it up close keep your eyes open [Music] there's no one here reese these cages are empty there must be more we have to keep going race let's go contact there's more foreign i've got here [ __ ] [Music] incoming evans cover we need to get off this catwalk stay low follow my lead holy [ __ ] how many are there they're still offline what the [ __ ] this is me i [ __ ] knew it pharaoh told that talk about conor he was on a [ __ ] mission to terminate him he got me out of that camp i wanted to thank him [ __ ] wait did you sabotage my minds the ones i set up at the hideout you won't get away with this this stops now it's all in here evans was not imprisoned he was in a research facility they used his likeness to create a new type of infiltration unit but but how do i know that from john connor i didn't want to believe it but so far everything conor has said has come true that's impossible [ __ ] it says in here that the implementation of cyberdyne systems model 102 is finished what does that mean that they no longer have any use for those people we gotta move they moved all the prisoners to that second location we won't find any of them here then why are we moving forward because we need to burn this [ __ ] to the ground [Music] the t-800 production line is live how about we focus on the ones shooting at us 12 o'clock how about we focus on the ones shooting at us 12 o'clock there's more of them on the other side filling up [Music] return i think that's it no it's not [Music] where to now first let's take out those drones we need to deactivate those laser barriers [Music] [Music] there has to be a computer that operates the laser i see it over there rivers get yourself up [Music] it's too there this is making me nervous behind you rivers get a move on contact reverse what's your status still looking radio in as soon as you found that computer yes sir [ __ ] rivers we're pinned down over here i'm almost there i can see the computer [Music] now get down here we need to go rivers feral set up the explosives that's one and another that's it right behind you all right we need to get some distance between us and that generator let's move we've stayed here long enough reese i think we're far enough do it detonating in three two one we're [Music] almost the making what a [ __ ] [ __ ] ship hey that's not helping anyone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this change is nothing so keep your head up how can you be so calm after everything that's happened i don't know maybe because if there's one mission that's worth pursuing it's this one it gives me purpose i was heading into a dangerous place after that last assignment like nothing was keeping me here and that maybe i was supposed to die back then i started to feel like i was living on borrowed time yeah i know how it sounds but now i know what i'm doing and that gives me hope sorry rivers i've got some things to do i need to apologize to evans he's all right and so are you thanks for always checking in on me rivers you're good people [Music] how are you feeling about all this about what the botched mission are becoming skynet's new face does it make you proud huh well skynet probably did hundreds of tests trying to find a perfect human specimen to replicate and they ended up selecting you so i should see it as winning the lottery yeah i don't laugh all you want but life after getting back is gonna look very different getting clearance from brass is gonna be an even bigger pain in the ass yeah imagine you're gonna get a lot of looks huh what what's wrong i've seen it already i saw that look the day they freed us from that facility i was locked in a cell cramped with dozens of people standing shoulder to shoulder and suddenly we started hearing noise blasts from a plasma rifle coming from the distance what did you think it was i was sure that they started exterminating cages one by one and it was just a matter of time before it was our turn then we heard someone yell it turned out it was a techcom unit and among the soldiers there he was john connor himself he opened the cage and we all started cheering and then something happened in a room full of people jumping for joy connor noticed me [Music] i don't understand you have to imagine it his eyes stayed on me just a second too long and at that moment i started fearing for my life again it was as if in that split second he was figuring out whether to shoot me or not not the entire cage just me all of a sudden the relief of being saved was gone he knew about you about the new model he must have that's actually why i wanted to meet him i wanted to ask him if i was just imagining things i guess i've got my answer never in my life did i feel so helpless i was boiling with rage so on my way out of there you smashed a terminator with your bare hands yeah it's a lot to process i need some time to think this through thanks for the talk rivers [Music] i can't believe it outsmarted by an outdated piece of [ __ ] junk a computer program older than any one of us we need a break sarge might as well seems that all this time spent on coming up with a plan is getting us nowhere you want to join me yes sir [Music] the dark years that's what conor calls it what we're living through right now at least i hope it means now if the dark years are still to come is he always speaking code i guess he does i don't understand half of the things he tells me even worse he makes me memorize things that make no sense to me messages to people i've never even met it feels like he's putting me through tests you know preparing me to be part of something some grand scheme so why do you trust him there used to be a simple answer to that question connor saved me taught me how to fight for a moment i was even naive enough to think that he prepared me for everything that's out there he gave me hope and i used to be enough and now now things are different i've lost most of my previous squad and i've put the new one in danger by crossing the annihilation line [Music] what the hell is all this for i envy you rivers you've at least got something to fight for [Music] i'll do everything to get my father out of there but i'll fight for the lives of the other prisoners with the same commitment how did i know you'd say something like that rivers that's not all sarge that terminator factory that we just destroyed it couldn't be a coincidence what do you mean i think connor knew what we would find there he knew about evans role in this whole operation he certainly knew about mine he sent us here for a reason it does sound like something connor would do i believe there's a place in this whole puzzle for every one of us funny for someone who believes there's no such thing as fate conor likes to watch things happen exactly as he intended to unfortunately those things sometimes come at a cost but i don't think conor would put you through more than you think she can handle damn it rivers it shouldn't be your responsibility to talk your commander off the ledge we all need a break sometime sarge you may be right thank you i needed a fresh perspective now if you don't mind i got something to do before we leave prepare gear enamel no i need that word with pharaoh it's been long overdue [Music] reese we're ill-equipped we're too few and there's no rescue team to come for us we're behind the damn annihilation line and i can't protect you from what's out there that alone is enough to free you of your duty if you want to leave just say the word but if you decide to stay i can promise that i will fight beside you through whatever happens so just take your time kyle we're staying no matter what that's as far as we can go grab your gear we're heading out based on the intel we got at the factory we're looking for sector a of the camp that's where your father is rivers something's happening are we late for the party what the hell are they shooting at we're about to find out 12 o'clock hold your fire those are friendly what's happening here there's been a mutiny at the camp we got together and did whatever we could to break out and now skynet's hunting us down which sector were you in sector b that's where the mutiny happened that's where we all came from what about sector a did those people escape too no sector a is located somewhere else at a football stadium football stadium all right we'll find it time to move hold on there's more the reason we broke out is because we heard that skynet started executing everyone and sector a was the first one to go what i'm not sure if there's anyone left to save we'll have to find that out for ourselves let's move there's an extraction point prepared for you just follow the path we'll do that hang in there rivers we don't know anything for certain yes sir watch out each day there's an evac point ahead focus your fire contact i don't got this are you seeing that hk tank in the distance we'll deal with it when the time comes contact go go go rubbers watch out for civilians i can't tell who's who [Music] we've got to do something about it keep firing what do we do about those people we can't just leave them i'll get them to safety you need to keep going are you sure don't worry about me just go you heard evans let's move good luck rivers i hope you find him hk we gotta bring those numbers down [ __ ] so that was the last one heavens how's it looking on your end the package is secured but that tank isn't going anywhere understood report back later this place driving the water away from that hk tank what's the status no signs of the statement so far it's starting to feel like we're running in circles pharaoh's right we need to get a visual of the target building more friendlies they're wounded bad reese we can't leave them behind you can't leave us here rivers we have to figure this out so this is what we're going to do me and pharaoh are staying here to make sure that these people are escorted to safety i need you to do a recon of the area and report when you find the stadium running around like that is getting us nowhere understood yes sir evans turn that car around my wife and children they're still in the camp i don't know what to do don't worry we'll get them out that's why we're here we'll see your family soon i'm all right rivers we're gonna be all right sergeant i'm three minutes out from your position copy that we're preparing friendlies for evac we need to find a good lookout [Music] evans what's the situation i'm under heavy fire it's getting out here too sir hk tank is heading straight for your position i see it get away get the [ __ ] away from us get out of here the resistance is preparing an evacuation go we'll do that thank you thank you oh i'll intercept you from the other side everyone let's get moving um uh so thank you huh ah there it is rhys i've got the visual of the stadium roger that reunite with the group we need to concentrate our efforts copy this can't get close sergeant that hk tank is in the way awaiting orders we need to take it down there's no other way wait for my signal yes sir barrel make sure those people stay pushed are the can grenades ready getting them now all right taking that hk down being barrel and going down i see you no pharaoh heavens rhys is pinned down go go go [ __ ] ariel [ __ ] hang in there i'm coming [Music] [Music] help me out fair house dead i know so is evans what do we do now we can't go back rivers maybe it's not too late maybe there's still a chance we have to at least try sir i know exactly where they are in the rivers thank you let's move the stadium is that way watch it silverfish there's too many let's take them out we're finishing this mission for feral and for evans yes sir stay low now slow and steady it's clear let's go keep your eyes open hk flying by i hear it nice and easy this is it t47 i've got a visual there's enough room to sneak past them careful clear follow me all right now how do we get inside there's a terminal i'll get the gate open got it the gate's open let's move contact open fire [Music] clear this way down here we'll find in rivers but first we need to open those gates that's the we can't beat resistance you've got to help us you're going to be all right we'll get you out of here that's the main computer on it [ __ ] i can only disable all the laser grids do it the barriers are down now let's find let's find your father rivers what was that centurion [Music] so oh foreign [Music] it's not over yet let's find your father rivers frank have you seen frank rivers is he a human your dad you're gonna be all right we'll get you out of here i'm looking for frank rivers is he

i found him my son he'd be proud i am [Music] i am [Music] today was in the final battle of this war instead it was the battle that showed us the parts we needed to play it reminded us that even if the world my father grew up in is long gone we still have plenty to fight for in this one we just need to find a purpose something that will keep us going even if it's as simple as keeping a promise made to a child pharaoh knew that evans did too today wasn't the final battle of this war rivers but whenever that fight does come i think now we're ready to meet it everything all right just uh trying to collect my thoughts sarge understandable once we're back in the shelter i'll put a word in with baron to ease up on you over the next couple of days you need a break we both do thank you there's uh something i wanted to ask you shoot what was in that envelope let me show you it's a message from john this is what he wanted me to have why i don't know maybe because sometimes i need to remind myself what we're fighting for [Music] you
