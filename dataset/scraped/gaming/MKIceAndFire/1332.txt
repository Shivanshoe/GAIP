way she'll ever hear you dad will be in there but it's okay [Music] I need you to grab his Shinra ID card and yeah I know I should do it myself but but I honestly don't think I'm up to it just do this for me okay Jesse what's this do your mom and dad sorry for not getting in touch sooner but I'm working at the gold saucer as an actress now it wasn't easy and I had a lot of help from people along the way but I managed to land the starring role and closed our two tickets to my play looking forward to seeing you both there Jessie raspberry as the princess my dad he was a maintenance supervisor at the reactor [Music] Thanks come on there's no time for this [Music] [Music] careful it's hot [Music] [Music] mission accomplished when are you going to give up on the gold saucer how long has it been since you even performed a lot of people really rely on Jessie as a stagehand though right you can be one of those anywhere so why not come home and get a job at the sector aid theatre I'll think about it you know I'd really love to stay and chat but we gotta go so soon yeah well we hadn't even planned on dropping by but what 100 some of your famous needs act so good sure I can't tempt you with some more maybe just a couple slices misses our watch hey I'm doing it for you guys you don't want me going to work on an empty stomach I'm planning on using a weaker blasting agent this time since I can't get in touch with my supplier our only option is to loot a warehouse owned by Shinra hey there that's it now comes the hard part I'm gonna use this to sneak into the 76 annex alright let's get to it sorry but you're staying outside only I know what to steal from where so it's gotta be me who goes in so we came all this way just eat pizza you think I'd let you off that easy you're gonna earn every slice helping cloud just do the thing where you draw everyone's attention away like you did at my parents what's the word again maybe I'm more nervous than I thought diversion yeah that nice one military man so what does this mean we're gonna ask some Shinra folks out to dinner ah you know damn well what she means well you're inside we make sure the guards are focused on the outside yeah exactly couldn't have put it any better when you see a flare go up that's your cue rush the front gates and make for the warehouse Plaza the more hell you raise the more time you buy me huh you're gonna run this guy into the ground aren't you how much time do you think you'll need not too much I'll be in and out I'll send up another flare when I'm done we rendezvous in the vacant lot up ahead hold on how are we supposed to get back to the slums wait for the first train no I want to be back before that don't worry I have something worked out now what this done well that diversion is not gonna create itself Jesse's dad was in there right yeah Marco poisoning happened while Jesse was doing a show with the gold saucer what do you care no I want to hear it Jesse always wanted to be an actress worked her ass off for years until finally she caught a break Top Billing parents were thrilled and then right before opening night her dad had an accident collapse from overwork and in the worst possible place Mako's storage lay there half a day before someone found him been like that ever since no change whatsoever that's what got her into planetology and led her to seek out avalanche how far we've come Jesse's got a theory about it thinks her dad's spirit is stuck now between his body and the heart of the planet so we don't shut down the reactor soon you'll get caught up in the floor poof what's so funny just that I understand how you feel I'm like most of the time you can see [Music] Mako's the essence of life itself of memory and hope it's not something you burn in a reactor just to keep it lights on oh oh don't tell Jessie about this little bit Chad okay when she gets pissed oh she gets punchy well no promises he's serious clouds shall beat the out of us not my problem this guy hey it's the lot Jessie was talking about we rendezvous here when we've got what we came for gotta stay hidden wait for the signal so quiet just need to get past this gate wait where are the guards [Music] looks like someone beat us here I don't think it was Jessie is it better not get in the way of our plans it worked don't see anyone the hell happened hey man the plazas that way where houses are further in Jesse's supposed to be circling around from the back right no need for us to rush let's scout it out first I can handle this solo what you're trying to keep us out of it now don't be a jackass we're in this together don't expect me to save you if you need to check your gear now's the time give the word when you're good to go you can use that vending machine over there to stock up guess there's a training center too it could go a few rounds before the main event [Music] you
