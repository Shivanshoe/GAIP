[Music] our work is finished Lucayan Lord Rayden I am merely Raiden now you have proven worthy to take my place as the new protector of earth realm once it is restored you honor me Raiden the honor is mine Lord Liu Kang the sense of time are now yours too shaped it falls upon you to architect a new history the faith of all realms in my hands Raiden I cannot do this alone I shall advise you for as long as my mortality allows but have no doubt you are up to the task then together let us begin [Music] see Liu Kang before you do my soul soon I hope fortune what are you your magic before the hour glass shatters even here at the dawn of time you spew lies and deceit we will not hear it in defeating chronica you destroyed her crown without it you can't restart history the hourglass will shatter all realms will be lost pooja is this true Crona cos every action was taken to ensure her crowns preparation she would not dare to restart history without it this Kronecker came to each of us for our help she offered places in her new era for refusing her we were banished to avoid beyond time we could observe the events leading up to your siege of the keep but we were powerless to intervene but then you cute chronica the void seal was broken open permitting no escape via the hourglass if you know so much about the hourglass how do you propose I reset the timeline with the crown the crowd is destroyed only in our present not in our past and while I cannot restart history without the crown you can send travelers back into the current timeline I see I must return to the moment before Crona cos defeat in that battle differently so that her crown remains intact that leaves too much to chance Chronicle must never possess the crown otherwise you cannot guarantee victory what do you propose sorcerer let you send me into the past to steal the crown from my Island before cronic ascends Centurion the claimant I'll then deliver it to Lord Rayden and together we'll defeat chronica with a crown an hourglass under our control we can restart history safely why are we listening to this snake because I am a snake who's toiled beside chronica learning her secrets I know them do you he has a point rated put it a word [Music] how is it you conspire against Kronecker did her promises of grandeur not suit you she wanted me to be her pawn not her partner she sculpted my entire existence to serve her to collect souls for her crown when my purpose was served she betrayed me casting me into the void your grievance does not fool me Shang soon then trust that we have a shared interest in breaking chronica stranglehold on our destinies inevitably our interests will diverge this alliance is temporary have no illusions otherwise I understand your misgivings but it is the only way but the risk Liu Kang will be rewarded say nothing's when I move [Music] we will proceed with your plan schenzel i must stay behind to operate the hourglass what night wolf and Fujian will go with you to supervise I welcome the assistance I will join you know ready I need your counsel here have faith in Fujian and Nightwolf if I have faith in anyone it is you brother [Music] I will try to send you back to the time merger you should have enough time to claim the crown before set Riyadh delivers it to Cronus your confidence is inspiring as the keeper of time I am still a novice may the Great Spirit protect us [Music] you'd suffer too long if these pretenders hands but I've returned and I will save you from his madness [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] where's this always been hiding now you've shown it before I have had no need for my leader my sister was an unholy monster exactly like you Father [Applause] one of them arrived immediately after the time merger yes the battle between : Schalke no look [Applause] it's much later than that this is katanas battle we shall come then we're almost out of time we must escape quickly changing this battles outcome could cause Centurion to claim the crown earlier than expected and guarantee our failure let's go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] we escaped the battle undetected right soon or not where have you been hiding you can sort with Earthrealm us now his business is none of yours collector my business is collecting what shall con once he will pay handsomely for you you're outnumbered collector am i these are indeed strange days how do our framers profit by protecting shank soup he shares our goal hanukkah's defeat you will be partners in death Thank You Great Spirit [Music] Kitana has defeated Shao Kahn he always had more ego than skill come let us leave while the crowd is distracted no we're already here later than we wanted to be let's go to your Island now and take the crown no detours a rather public arrival at the Coliseum makes that impossible chronicles out world allies while informal of our presence go to my Island now and could be ambushed by Centurion herself and our combined power won't stop her we need help but whose help we can't recruit any of our allies without altering this timelines events Sindel sandeul's a revenant who can be restored to life and who plays no major part in the battles that lie ahead we can safely recruit her without disrupting events it's a tactic chronica is unlikely to anticipate she was shao kahn's empress is equal in evil because he had her bewitched returning sindell to life will restore her original more heroic self and if we fail the cinder line you wiped out most of Earth realms champions in a single battle if night wolf hadn't sacrificed himself he would have killed them all naught is the power we need to assure victory against a tree on sindell is the key and I suppose restoring her will be easy anything but we can use earth rounds jinsei to heal Sidon Dells body but the break one cheese spell and revive her soul we will need access to Outworld soul chamber you have a different plan Nightwolf a better one one hint of betrayal sorcerer and we will finish you where do we start earth rum to acquire the jeante [Music] [Music] Shang Tsung Fujian Nightwolf all were seen in the Coliseum how is that possible it should not be those casted to the Freud do not return if Sheng saw were to I am aware Gareth take Frost and find them we must discern from when and whence they came

Nightwolf shang tsung come chronica is keen to question you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh Lika isn't the future frost we've seen it join us on the right side of history the only sign is chrono

the night wolves I have fought you are the fiercest it must be why the Great Spirit chose me to wear the mantle you are also anomalous no one has ever escaped the void but is that necessary to buy his time we must be rid of him before he recovers pudding summon the wind [Music] where did you send him chaos run havoc will keep him entertained let's get to the nether realm we're running out of time to find sin down no sign of sindell not entirely unexpected given that she did not aid in the keeps defense what was her role then if she is such a formidable weapon is it possible that were Great Spirit what is it my revenant [Music] the great spirit cannot save you [Music] [Applause] [Music] take them to the bone temple Nightwolf Shang Tsung Nightwolf Shang Tsung where are we Synnex bombed temple [Music] Raiden's violence against our Lord will not go unavenged Fuji prepare to pay for your brother sins send em if you look well death becomes you always the farmer shame soon I will enjoy

yes have you come from the future only to insult me I am no sword for hire this request is far below your present station your highness but defeating chronica depends on us reaching that chamber why because we must restore Sandin my Empress [Music] [Music] you've captured her revenant together Fujin and i can restore her to life why to make a slave of her as Quan Chi did so that she can aid us against Kronecker but you have my vow she will return free of all influence as I recall your blood bound to Empress Sindel I was her protector for life how it must have pained you when she died that was not your fault you could not save her then no you can then I know we must present this to katana Khan respectfully your highness if we approach katana shall cut Shang Tsung's head off katana never

did you abandon me I did neither katana after being forced to Wed Shao Kahn I ran afoul of Quan Chi he accused me of distracting Shao Khan then the miscreant murdered me and staged my death as a suicide as I had always suspected but all this time everything I've been told about you it's all lies how can I trust trust that I loved your father Jarrid trust that I love you [Music] Oh mother this reunion is a blessing but we have little time to celebrate we must leave for Shang Tsung's Island to finish our quest I would go with you fight by your side but out world needs its Khan I know rest assured katana I will come home [Music] Sindel has been restored Shane soon would only undertake such an arduous task if her aide promised a decisive advantage she is but one mortal and one of the few who can harm you I fear no harm they are at Shang Tsung's Island your crown Shang Tsung knows then our time for preparation is over go to the island now we cannot win their hearts so do not try do not permit your better nature to compromise you I understand mother [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] they couldn't go on I am touched by their difference I question their judgment have neither of you any compassion not for fools who follow you are we not following him now at least we do not follow that fool Raiden Henry would surely die [Music] you may run like the wind cabal but I command it you should have devised a better plan there's more to come [Applause] [Music] you will be returned to the void not even sheet house too slow I expected better Fujin now do I meet your expectations Satori on must be on her way Sindel and I will occupy her you to get the crown I must ask Sora how long before you betray us I find your lack of faith amusing when it happens we will be ready [Music] do me a favor Fujin and take one giant step back you too sorcerer makes sense we meet again down here will you catch me up beat me with an inch of my life the hell if I gonna return the favor how is so generous [Music] [Music] a new trick beyond amusing but insufficient you lost me at your temple food chain now cruelly guys made me even stronger you did not win that fight you ran away forums you should have fled this fight too [Music] the protocol promises cannot be trusted Jackson beyond Kano Shao Kahn look at the scoundrels she employs that's a card you can't play Fujin not when your buddy that would shank suit for its Kronecker will not heal your wounds Jackson dammit Fujin you know what I've suffered troller cause my one chance to prevent all that not just for me but for Jackie for Vera [ __ ] you're a god ain't no way you get how this feels you know the only time Raiden and I ever fought when I left the sky temple to live among humans do not become attached to them Fujian sentiment will impede the execution of your duty but warriors like you and I we are strengthened by sentiment we do not fight to kill enemies we fight to protect our loved ones that is why it cuts so deeply when we fail well I'll be maybe you do get it chronica knows your pain she manipulates you with it Jacqueline is on her way here chronica expects you to fight her worse even break her heart is that someone who cares one whit about you or your family [Music] you were to defeat me I am not finished yet [Music] applied chronic as will tonka Scylla or CC on Oh Alma ki Oh can you fight I'll do what I can chronica offered the future but instead you will have none blame only yourselves for this fate what it is your fate that should concern you set Rihanna [Music] [Applause] well shang tsung your strategy proved sound after all of course it did you to Sindel that hair so much as twitches ease up baby girl dad how did you get here we're all on the same side against chronica yes and now we must bring this to Raider is that a crown Crona cos crown without it she lacks the power to restart history about time we had some good news now that we have this we're in uncharted territory we've changed this timeline for good correct no one can predict what happens next not even me I must return to Outworld to aid katana Khan thank you for aiding us we will rendezvous at the sea of blood in six hours until our next battle [Music] sorcerer I'll go with the Briggs family to brief the Special Forces may the Great Spirit protect you as she protect you Fujian when Raiden lays eyes on you with Shang soon [Music] without the crown there can be no numeira this failure rests on my shoulders no I underestimated Shang Tsung's ingenuity to escape the void to return from the future I will face him again mother this time I will succeed I must go with shanks only possession of the Crowley's become far too dangerous and I doubt his new allies realize quite how dangerous he is your Shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if Karan does not help us is there any word from Grandmaster Hisashi no if we do not hear soon I will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get Raiden the fire Guardians they built the charade are you are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is Grandmaster Hisashi is dead and now you have come to finish us I understand you mistrust but I am here to assist you I find that impossible to believe what is he doing here we are not together if you are here to help prove it join me against the sorcerer I shall [Music] fortune Rayden thought you lost when the time line was broken but you stand with Shang Tsung we have urgent news her Aidan please that is past this maybe the Sorcerer's trick the fire gardens will not be defiled by his presence why you have joined shang tsung is beyond me Fujin what has he done to corrupt your mind perhaps listen before you judge Thank You footing the storm is not yet past shame soon we must speak with you brother we Fujin since when are you friends with this filth I'm here to save you Raiden we hail from your tragic future in it Liu Kang defeated Radhika but their battle destroyed her crown without this broken timeline couldn't be repaired only hope was to return here steal the crown and make use of its power now we can change the outcome of the fight against Kronecker we can defeat her and fix time I had never thought you gullible brother changed some schemes serve only to benefit him how could you fall for such lies be rational Raiden spread your falsehoods elsewhere sorcerer you will not deceive us Lord Raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out nell shakes the truth great stop this step aside Liu Kang put down the amulet it's darkness is taking hold of you you also betray me this is not the way shine song is not the enemy this time the realms hang in the balance and you form this unholy alliance enough of this madness if you both must die so be it my brother is my problem I will signal if I need help she knocks amulet inflames your anger and cloud your judgments have faith in me [Music] now listen brother we're running out of time I am a fool I have allowed myself to become a slave to anger I will not allow my temper to fracture our resolve further surely you jest Lord fujian not at all Liu Kang Raiden's power makes you a fire guard of course it does unfortunately I cannot transfer my power to Liu Kang yet first I must free his revenant from Quan Chi's curse we will face their evidence soon enough what else can you tell us about the final battle we must use every advantage [Music] Lord Fujian Shang so I trust you are enjoying your travels you have already been defeated once Kronecker of course Fujin how else could you have escaped the void if you know this accept the inevitable surrender but clearly my loss was not your victory Raiden if your future Savior had gained full control of my hourglass we would not be here this timeline would no longer exist I see no harm in confirming your suspicions even if you defeat me what then who claims the hourglass surely you realize that Shang soon will break your alliance we are prepared Konica are you have you wondered why Shang so you know so much about my crown because he did your bidding gathering souls to fuel it Shang Tsung is far too modest the crown is his design no one save me knows more about its power I told you we would still be marooned at the beginning of time bickering among ourselves you must decide Raiden who do you wish to keep time for all of creation me or Shane soon neither chronica you will be beaten and if Shane soon betrays us we will finish him you are a fool Raiden do not condemn the realms to oblivion [Music] [Applause] the Trump it is a mistake challenging at title now I meant your existence [Music] [Applause] you are vulnerable cronic [Music] [Music] brother are you alright yes what the crown truly my finest work I will instruct you in its ways what just happened Kanaka came here to retrieve the crown we forced to retreat we must strike while she is weakened let us join the armies massing at the sea of blood together we will storm cronikeys Isle and take command of the hourglass we will roam the ward the Isle

closer what all that grows closer is her defeat Garris [Music] thousand years and you haven't lost a step [Music] no SOCOM turns against us perhaps we should send the fleet no shell car and Sindel haven't wittingly given us back the advantage their army will battle ratings for possession of my crown weakening them both then we crush what remains of them with strength to spare the crown once again will be mine when it is the new era will begin [Music] captain kidd's reporting for duty sir I mean ma'am whoa they're 90s dad you've already got one bullet wound too many I'm healed Cassie

offer chronica I would have allowed you to wield great influence surely sir this is better than death I do not serve you were Chronicle time destiny are now mine to command every rail won't bend to my will ZZZ before you do muscle Lu Kang I thought your duties required you stay behind Ally something you know well I see now the hourglass showed that only I could wield the crown against chronica successfully you let me win and to ensure victory you sacrifice the lives of your friends now deliciously cold blooded down they are not gone Shang Tsung they will live again in my new era your new era you underestimate my prowess chosen one I am around I have absorbed chronic --is power you may have attained gauntlet but I am the keeper of time you are no match for me chronica said much the same Shang Tsung you will share her fate long have I had visions of this moment I will savor your death for eternity you are mad zexal your visions are nothing delusions of an adult mind [Music] deeply in your final moments chosen one for now your existence ends in shame all the power that was once yours is mine forever [Music] [Music] spring minions My Lord your will is done out world earth

more time lines will be twisted by your evil [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Kung Lao where did you who who are you I am Lord Luke a god of thunder and Fire God forgive my disrespect my lord enough kula you are humble not like the cooler I knew the Kung Lao you do a story for another time I have chosen you as my champion come on we have work to do you must be prepared trained trained for what [Music] OCP built me to serve the public trust protect the innocent and hold the law so when I found Kay no dealing arms to old Detroit's gangs I had one duty apprehended I never thought the chase would take me to a different universe let alone and in a fight with Kay nose protector Crona Khanna and when Kronecker went down something unexpected happened her power washed over me sweeping away the limits my designers had put on my program for the first time I saw the death of OCPs corruption it wasn't just a couple of greedy executives OCP is making a chili playing both sides selling two cups and I am bringing them to justice it will not be fast or easy OCP has too much cash too much firepower things up although it is a good thing this will be an interagency effort welcome to the future of law enforcement as the new keeper of time I was overwhelmed by my responsibilities who was I to design the destinies of mortals as their protector I had spent eons safeguarding them but while I had grown to appreciate mortals deeply I understood precious little about their daily existence so I use the hourglass to live hundreds of thousands of lifetimes and the possibilities of realm race gender and faith most importantly my super joy of ending each day a warm embrace a family humbled by my new wisdom I bend the arc of history not to my will but to the service of those who must live it while it is beyond my power to guarantee outcomes I will give mortals the chance to have better a lifetime of battle prepared me to conquer Kronecker but as the keeper of time I must be a creator not a conqueror I thought of the many sons and daughters I've lost in battle through the years imagined a better destiny for my kin a history with a show can build rather than destroy the results were catastrophic comfort and ease extinguished the dragon's fire that once lived the heart of every show Khan may became weak corrupted fools the time line had to start again war for all its tragedies is the forge of show Khan will my people will fight many will die but I will lead us to victory and in the aftermath the dragon's fire will blaze in choked on hearts for eternity [Music] Monica's power overwhelmed me such that I would have been driven mad had I not spent centuries mastering the dark powers beyond the grasp of ordinary mortals no I am the master of time and fate but chronic has fallen proves that even Titans can be defeated there are my new power lets me wrong infinite timelines and feasts upon the souls of billions I am gong to survive I must return to the shadows avoid confrontation and work my way to the hands of others more specifically through the hands of my fellow Titans own these monstrous beams applied easily by appealing to their greed vanity and fear through them every soul in eternity bends to my influence in my new era morality will be exposed as the illusion it is the cunning will prosper while the good suffer this is a word of shang tsung have a nice day before I was Nightwolf I was a fool named gray cloud born into poverty I resented my ancestors for giving up our future to colonizers Kano offered a way out promising riches if I stole my tribes most sacred relics I was sorely tempted but then I realized that by saving myself I'd be surrendering the last of my peoples dignity for the first time I defended them I don't gasp ride Kano was unimpressed but As I Lay Dying the Great Spirit came to me by rejecting Kano I had proven worthy of an ancient honor the mantle of Nightwolf legendary defender of the madoka now as i inherit cronic as mantle the way before me is split the keeper of time cannot also be my tribes defender which path do I choose even here at times beginning the great spirits wisdom guides me she calls me to restore history the Madoka I must leave to another to the next night wolf like all our sacred relics the night wolf mantle belongs to the tribe enema token can prove worthy of its power I enjoy imagining who will defend us next [Music] in the beginning Shao Kahn invaded a dunya murdered my husband Jack and forced me to be his bride that's the story but it's a lie one I told lest I lose the faith of my subjects or of my daughter katana the truth jeredy was weak destined to fail by betraying him I gained a better lover and the ultimate weapon a conqueror to unite all realms and put them at my beck and call then Kronecker upended history confronting a future in which I had been dead for centuries my so-called family had failed me in every way katana broke my heart worst instead of uniting the realms she sought to liberate them as if the wasteland savages could ever be more than serfs over the caring mother I had to discipline my little princess and after that I had to discipline the Titan now I have defeated chronica outgrown Shao Khan and katana I have no more family no more rivals no more gods I said above them all on a throne that unites all realms and all realities whoever you are wherever you are when you were before me kneel for I am Sindel Empress of time and you exist only to serve me what does it mean to wield the sands of time to be the chosen one it means making choices that break your heart for the protection of all I shared chronicles power with the people I trust and love most together we replace the Elder Gods that set Rhian had betrayed and became eternal guardians of the realms still my heart longs for a simpler life the kind one cannot have being the chosen one let alone an elder god what katana and I would not give for those simple pleasures [Music] perhaps in another time line yes [Music] Kronecker had manipulated me in timeline after timeline she stoked my anger and fed my arrogance turning me against Luke hang my nose rubbed in my own fallibility I was humbled how could I be worthy to accept the mantle as keeper of time I fought that to control time and destiny fairly I must purge myself of all human emotion summoning the strongest magic I burned away my fear and anger all that remained was pure logic but I learned quickly that the logical choice is often not the just choice unless tempered by compassion and heart logic leads to decisions no better than those based on anger or fear now I am once more at times beginning but on this journey through history I will infuse logic with love in this timeline I will finally achieve peace for the citizens of all realms this was my dream vacation I saw mayhem mutilation it was all the gasps for a while but these nincompoops they didn't really get me not even their pretty boy ninja mime concise sweet prince I'd finished just about everyone worth finishing in earth realm and out world even lovable old men around I was a lonely heart in search of new friends but as Mac would have it and oh the hourglass foiled me havoc and I are going to be bosom buddies and what's that my new pal knows an entire realm devoted to law and order and he exists solely to disrupt it well I say he and I need to get busy miss the League of misunderstood maniacs we're giving all the realm an enema and when we're done who knows where we'll crash next maybe we'll come to your house maybe we'll cut your favorite pets well maybe we'll just break your TV right now it was an epic accident that brought the Terminator here rather than to his owners past but it didn't take long for him to adapt they figured that terminating chronica and taking her hourglass gave him the best chance at achieving his mission objective destroying humanity so that the machines prevail turns out the hourglass wasn't the ultimate weapon no matter how many times the Terminator rebooted history the war between humans and the machines always ended the same took their mutual destruction he realized this war was a losing game the only way to win with so the Terminator used the hourglass to build a future where machines and humans don't fight they cooperate the Terminator knew that to preserve this future no one else could learn about the hourglass the information stored in his machine mind was dangerous it had to be eliminated that's why the Terminator threw himself into the infinite depths of the sea of blood no one would ever find him or unlock the hourglasses secrets if you could ask him about it he'd tell you he made the only logical choice but in my book that machine's a hero I'd snap down every devil in hell until NetherRealm and Vader showed up to piss me off it would have cost a lot of power fighting them long but they were being hunted by my new friends call them fire and ice they are constantly which is why I usually like to roll solo but when it comes to killing demonic [ __ ] these guys don't flinch I can get along with that the grandmasters tipped me off the collison said she was resurrecting some never realm God names shinnok but that's not happening on my watch Crona cos just as much as devil is now both make promises both tell lies both underestimate me that's why I'll make a new hell for them where they can burn together for eternity the nether realms locked down but they're still eight hills left to purge it's time to bring up the reserves I made choices in my life that sealed my fate I'm beyond redemption but even the Damned are capable of doing some good so all you devils are there making false promises and spewing lies we're coming and you don't have a chance in hell [Music] you
