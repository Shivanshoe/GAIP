politics good luck getting those abuelos of their asses we could use lamar's hub you know why clara never told you about us because to her we're just a bunch of kids playing with guns she loves to

benitez got to jump on us a couple of hours ago she's holding my people hostage on a cargo ship i'll go alone i don't get it consider us even for the meds save my people and i'll think about it people

how much time we have chorizo you saving our people right that's the plan i know a farmer with a helicopter who can fly you out to the ship follow me take all the rasool be nice to him that's a good horse easy you're with libertad i am i think it would be great if we joined forces yeah we've been fighting and we've been winning but admiral benitez will always have more than we do we kill one sword today tomorrow they get replaced with three more and when morale people die there is no one replacing them not yet on top of that these farmers and the people just trying to survive don't want to fight we need fresh blood real fighters what about getting their legends to join we i heard a lot of them even support castile you heard wrong well i don't see any abuelos fighting now i'm working on it so how do these farmers get a helicopter they built it from the parts of ones we show down these farmers are 100 on our side the other farmers are not some are some are with castillo you think we can get them on our side we're going to need them only when we're going to liberate a list maybe when they hear libertados fighting with us they'll join your good propaganda danny do you want to live to that boat let's do this get in my name's colleagues donnie i'm going to be careful and stay low i'll get you as close as i can what did you learn how to fly i did my basic service as a pilot a

when did you join la morale wait i was told you were with la morale i'm doing this rescue as a favor i'm with liberta what can you tell me about la morad you know that village they call it maltito that's the real name yeah some spaniards back in 1490 whatever a couple months ago admiral benitez decided to make it illegal to go to the water and fish the people protested benitez executed half the town so what does la morale do they tracked and killed every la soldado who did the executing and i'm not talking about gary ambrose jungle i'm talking about following them to their homes and sneaking their throats while their family is asleep assassin these kids are smart coordinated and cold blooded sounds like it we keep tabs on military convoys passing through there and report them to la morale seems like they run a tight operation these kids are on the board yelena is more organized than the military la morales got our back when admiral benitez started getting rough with our families la morado rocked back killed dennis oldada who dared to step foot on our lands pretty soon they stopped coming that's the ship i can't get you any closer this is great gracias piawigo good luck even
