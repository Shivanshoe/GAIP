[Music] what have you done another one guanxi was right who are you i am sub-zero surrender and no harm will come to you the lin kuei do not know the meaning of surrender fight [Music] cal what happened are you all right something's wrong my powers have been fluctuating ever since the battle with darkseid i came back to the fortress to try to discover what was wrong and sub-zero attacked what's happening to me it must have a basis in magic luckily i'm not susceptible to magic so he got what he deserved bruce believes he's part of an invasion force heroes all over the world are disappearing including the flash and our planet is merging with another possibly apocalypse then dark side is back i have to get back to metropolis i'll rendezvous with you at the u.n space station sub-zero who is behind this invasion you are the invaders wonder woman this is in chaos captain marvel isn't a president none of us can contain him my ring's almost out of juice i'll be there as soon as i can you'll be coming with me cap stop hal what have you done the rage will consume us all not if i can help it the rage it burns inside me i need you to be calm tell me what you did to green lantern why did you attack him ah i don't know the ethereal forces are all unbalanced shifting i reach out to the gods and don't recognize what i see the rage you have to help me oh you should have finished him your world must be different than ours here we don't kill our friends wonder woman to batman i found superman but we have a new problem we've lost green lantern when i got to the wuxi academy you were already gone i did find some guy dressed in red tights though i had a medevac to the infirmary then i followed your signal to raiden's temple you gotta stop running off like that sonja we're a team you can't take on the bad guys alone i know i'll work on it go get yourself patched up meantime i'll prep the portal for a jump to that space station we'll take him by surprise sounds like a plan but i have to warn you the portal has been less than cooperative lately nothing i can't handle she's right log shows the portal was having a hard time focusing probably a side effect of the two universes merging the ethereal matrix seems to be more stable now just a few adjustments and we should be back in business there that's more like it impressive what the hell allow me to introduce myself lex luthor perhaps you've heard of me or a little company i run called lexcorp this area requires top clearance and i don't remember inviting you to the party my technicians at lexcorp picked up a massive signal emanating from this space indicating highly advanced technology i'm the hands-on managerial type so i came to see for myself and i must say i am impressed a teleportation device maybe you and i should do business it's a portal as for doing business maybe it's time i gave you a demonstration of my impressive technology i'd prefer a handshake but if you insist what happened they found our base somehow he breached our defenses who's he called himself lex luthor he runs some company acts like he's gonna take over the world looks like you put a stop to that only one way to be sure let's take out that space station sonia sonia you copy we've apparently been sent to different locations on the station i think the portal still needs some work we'll need to regroup stay where you are i'll try to hold on someone's coming we've set up a temporary holding facility as requested wonder woman it should hold captain marvel until he's recovered my thanks if this earth merge continues everyone's powers may be affected i'll be joining you shortly with our newest guest affirmative are there any special security measures [Music] now this just got a whole lot more interesting sonia area secure what's your situation i'm fine we need to locate the main command center to the station's capabilities right stay where you are i'll follow your signal and come to you you're not going anywhere sub zero i take it you two know each other is jax a formidable warrior as you will soon discover well warrior i don't know what your universe is doing to mine or what you're doing to this station but true warriors don't use guns and if it's a fight you want you'll soon be joining your friend in a cell sonia you'll never guess who i bumped into sub-zero what's he doing up here obviously i'm a captive it would appear that we are now allies appearances can be deceiving true but you would be a fool to refuse my help what do you think sonja should we trust him better the devil you know than the w don't all right then sub-zero tell us what you know only that these warriors are unlike anything i have encountered i don't know yet who commands them any ideas the most logical assumption would be that shao khan has returned to finish what he started with this new army now i need to find someone a sorcerer who may have answers sorcerer i don't like the sound of that like it or not we need him when there is threat of invasion he usually knows something about it [Music] you
