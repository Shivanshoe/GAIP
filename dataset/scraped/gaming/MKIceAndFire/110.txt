[Music] understood have you been able to make use of demeter's functions yes i was able to mitigate most soil conditions and restore a temporary balance you should notice less rampant plant growth in the area maybe that'll give plain songs fields a chance to recover unfortunately recovery in that area is unlikely without the assistance of the utarus land gods i have discussed this matter with zou i believe we may have a workaround yeah i'm helping her out with that there's something i'm still trying to figure out why was demeter using flying machines to distribute metal flowers in its deranged state demeter was defending itself against a robotic swarm that would devour all plant life it thought the pharaoh plague was still happening it feared it would come again as part of its directive of receding earth's vegetation it sought to protect plant life at all costs and considering it had 20 years to proliferate i expect you will continue to find the fruits of its efforts for some time that's a good thing i have the code to dissolve the vines then the zenith gerard eric tilda verbena beta said they were some of the most powerful people on earth i think elizabeth knew one of them tilda did she ever mention her to you no elizabeth often spoke of her work or told stories of her mother and her childhood if she knew this tilde she did not disclose it with me what we can conclude from your and pages experiences is that the zeniths are ruthless in pursuit of their goal to protect life on earth they must be stopped beta's convinced we won't be able to capture hephaestus with that attitude do you really think she'll be able to build the rig in pulse generators it may take some coaxing but with some assistance i am confident she will i don't get her gaia she's so quick to assume will fail she's nothing like like what i thought she'd be i guess it'll be best if she stays here when we go to gemini all this data i've picked up in ancient bunkers and ruins i guess i never really thought that other people would be looking at it based on my observations your companions engage quite frequently with this material aaron has asked on numerous occasions about birthday parties he appears perplexed by the tradition of serving a sweet confection as it conflicts with the asaram tradition of serving sparkling stout ale he also suggested we host a party for you as a surprise uh yeah no thanks that is what i predicted is catalog getting along with everyone yes though he prefers to spend most of the time alone he appears to be collating data on war machine progression and significant battles during the pharaoh plague to aid in the creation of a war map of operation enduring victory i believe he aims to study the tactics of old world warfare i'd be interested in seeing that it appears to be a private pastime for him he has repeatedly declined my offers to assist his research [Music] so our plan to capture festus let's go over it again as you wish thanks to beta's test we now know that hephaestus will not respond to your alpha clearance which is why you will need to procure ted pharaoh's omega clearance right from his personal bunker while you are gone i will assist beta in building the transport rig and pulse generators when we get to gemini i will need to be installed on one of the facilities cores the second core is for hephaestus using omega clearance will allow you to trap it and then you'll be able to absorb it not quite you will need to manually remove hephaestus's malicious code before the merge how long will that take there are calculations i still must run but i estimate a few hours and during that time the others will create a distraction for us using the pulse generators right correct they will each take position at a cauldron door and fire off their device the energy surge should mask our activities until the emerge is complete and then we'll have everything we need to defeat the zenith sounds like a plan so now that you have ether demeter and poseidon how's the biosphere looking in the local region conditions have improved super storms have subsided water sources have been purified and soil conditions remediated these improvements will stave off environmental collapse for a few additional months well with luck soon you'll have a festus then you'll be able to fix the biosphere for good right correct i will be able to design and produce robotic agents to permanently reverse the environmental damage that has accumulated there's something i've been wondering how could ted farrow create a clearance level higher than alpha elizabeth made sure he wouldn't interfere with the project it is plausible he tasked his own engineers with creating a back door to the zero dawn system without elizabeth's knowledge my predecessor did not even know of its existence until he activated it to purge the apollo database it is in effect a blind spot one that will allow us to subdue hephaestus and fortunately thanks to beta's information we know where omega clearance may be procured right somewhere in san francisco so gemiini has two data cores i've never seen a cauldron like that but you mentioned something about seismic activity when my predecessor attempted to build the cauldron construction was disrupted by a series of earthquakes the data core had already been built but the rest of the facility sustained damage so she began again a second core was built however when more tremblers occurred she abandoned the site lucky for us are the quakes still happening no though they did also create instabilities in other facilities in the region so the facility where i recovered demeter used to be a feral agricultural research facility it's where they created the biomass conversion system but also adamantine wreath did elizabeth know they were working on that it is likely she was briefed on other efforts to combat the machine swarm though her focus was devoted only to zero dawn that makes sense but they actually got the wreaths to work if they've been able to deploy it against the pharaoh plague in time using the data you recovered on the project i ran several simulations and have concluded that it would never have worked in all scenarios the pharaoh war machines would eventually hack and deactivate the wreath before they could contain the swarm so zerodon really was the only solution there was a lot of data in the greenhouse facility about agriculture do you think it'll help the queen fix their homeland i will run a query complete the data contains information about novel crop production methods which may be beneficial to the tribe in the long term but new crops aren't going to save the world so i guess it's on us it is i found some data in one of the rooms you unlocked it mentioned that there are still functional seed banks beneath this facility why is it there my predecessor was tasked with reconstituting the biosphere with primary and secondary plant species had everything gone according to plan humans would have eventually been able to introduce tertiary species including new crops can we access them now unfortunately it will have to wait i require control over the machines in order to access and distribute the preserved seed stock and for that we need a festus it's something to look into later then see you later gaia until next time [Music] [Music] so we're fighting immortals from the stars now looks like it what's next wizards from the moon that's just i hear about you going west turns out we need one last thing before we can grab hephaestus because it would have been too easy otherwise you've been looking at any interesting data i asked gaia to find me something to look at a while back and she found the mother of all forges they called it sports turns out the old ones spent a lot of time tackling and punching each other for points in in one game or another are you mixing some solid food and fresh ale i bet half the claim would be long enough to watch how are things with kotalo you still scared of him oh she thinks she's funny actually i played strike with him i had to fill in most of the conversation myself but i'm still alive glad to hear it i need to get going i think i know the answer but are you sure you don't need any help gaia mentioned this uh other tribe you found the queen they sound like a nasty bunch i can handle them in the meantime vara will help you get ready for what comes next take care of yourself eloy i'm sorry eloy after all the trouble you went through you have to head west again well no one said this was gonna be easy you sure you don't want any backup dealing with the quinn they think i'm sobek or something like that they won't hurt me but i doubt they'll be so kind to anyone else if you say so let me know if you need anything before you go [Music] you better not be slacking off on your studies while i'm gone and risk zoe coming after me i value my life in fact i've been reading about ted farrow how he destroyed the world and crawled into a hole after killing those who saved it he definitely was a piece of work well beta and gaia built the rig can you get everyone ready for the mission ahead of course what is it nothing it's just that everything's about to change we'll get gaia and she'll help us set things right no more zeniths no more derangement it'll be a different world i welcome it but i wonder how the nora will react and the karja and well everyone let's just focus on fixing gaia for now you're right we've got an angry ai to take down if i get omega clearance and then we grab hephaestus we might finally have the advantage over the zeniths can't wait to see their faces as they stare down a bunch of charging thunderjaws better them than us for once i'll be in touch if i need anything i'll make sure beta briefs everyone on the pulse generators good [Music] eloy i hear you're going further west past the tanakh clan lands do you know anything about the area only hearsay the uttaru tells stories of an island that lies beyond the western coast they call it the isle of spires it is said the old ones built towers there that touched the sky so they could live far away from the earth that bore them as if they didn't want to be reminded that they'd one day return to it sounds like something ted pharaoh would do how much have you read on ted pharaoh enough to wonder how a man who worked so hard to heal the world once could let greed and pride condemn it so easily for one spirit to diminish in such a way i i'm not sure if i should hate him or pity him you and varl doing okay uh training i mean we're doing fine although i admit it'd be nice to take a small break from studying just the two of us but then who'd look after aaron there's always cataloo leave a loud asaram with a brooding tanakh what could go wrong what's everyone been up to i've been trying to share some of my meals with beta thought it might help her feel more at home maybe even get her to sleep up here instead of in that dark basement she would not be moved i appreciate you trying patience reaps the best harvest i'm not giving up hope yet any progress with your plan for the land gods is the reboot code ready it is but there is difficult work ahead gaia warned me that because the land gods are linked together in a network the code must be delivered to all of them most are in plain song but in recent years three of them wandered off so tea and dough we have to find them no we know where they are but they're hard to reach so wandered into a lake and sank doe ventured into a dangerous canyon and tea broke down amidst a herd of machines okay tell you what you go to plain song handle all the land gods there i'll take care of so tindo i'll need the locations plus the reboot code i'm sending the data to you now my people made shrines near where each land got faltered when you see them you'll know you're close and once again thanks for your help we're not going to let your people starve so i promise oh i should get going hopefully i can bring back what we need to capture festus after that i'm gonna need everyone's help we'll be ready got a minute as many as you need i have to travel beyond the western coast to the ruins shrouded in fog yes and i'm looking for a tribe the queen i encountered them once before they said they came from across the great ocean i was hoping that tanakh knew more about them hmm there were rumors of trespassers in the area but we thought they were just bandits picaro sent out a patrol or two but i don't recall them reporting back we've had more pressing concerns as you know i'm sorry that's all i can tell you oh it's okay i guess i'll find out soon enough there is something i've been meaning to discuss with you it's personal if you have a moment to spare [Music] you said there was something you wanted to talk about i've been speaking with gaia she mentioned that the zeniths bind metal with flesh to make themselves stronger i was wondering if you'd help me do the same you want to make yourself a new arm yes gaia insists she can help me build such a thing if i can get the necessary data and materials she believes these things lie in the place where beta hid from the zeniths their ancient research lab i am not as familiar with old world machinery as you are i could use your assistance it might be dangerous the zenith probably still keep an eye on that place we were lucky to get out of there alive the first time i see it sounds like this is worth the risk by the time we shall see it through found anything interesting during your training gaia told me where to find data on how wars were waged in the old world i knew the ten fought against machines much as we do now but it seems they were among the last of their kind later machines battled other machines on behalf of greedy leaders as they vied for lands and spoils at least the tanakh have the courage to put their lives on the line when conflicts arise there is nobility in that but maybe we just need fewer conflicts in the first place yes of course agaro would have it so as well [Music] what do tanakh do to relax you know to take a break from training we play strike your asaram friend aaron is surprisingly good at it although he has yet to beat me it helps one thing strategically hones the mind for tactics somehow that still sounds like training i should get going i've got a long road ahead should you need reinforcements i know who to call i'll call you when i'm near the zenith lab we'll get what you need for that new arm of yours thank you eloy so frustrating i don't get how she can be so negative all the time i mean we're clones of the same woman and yet she couldn't be more different from elizabeth yes you hey me again was there something else so do you have everything you need to build the rig and pulse generators gaia sent me the schematics the designs are modest without the capabilities of hephaestus but they should work not that it matters without a mega clearance i'll find it just try to have the transport ready by the time i get back so have you been upstairs at all not really laurel sometimes comes down here to talk he keeps asking if i'm okay i thought he only wanted to know about my productivity but it's almost like he actually wants to talk to me yeah i think he does have you talked with anyone else in the base i speak with gaia she asked me how i'm feeling and my opinion on various topics i didn't expect that from an ai that's all thanks to elizabeth she believed gaia had to care not just follow her programming orders i know independent emotional processing enabled the previous version of gaia to create you after all yeah i guess so [Music] so aside from var and gaia who else have you been talking to zoe told me how you met after your escape from the hades proving lab i had no idea you were severely injured if the zenith had killed you life on earth would be doomed my escape would have been for nothing but they didn't kill me and thanks to varel and zoe i was able to recover [Music] you said you and varial talk sometimes what about he told me about your tribe the nora and the proving ritual you did i told him if i was born into the tribe i'd never be able to do the proving it does require a lot of physical training but there are plenty of other roles besides being hunter i don't think i'd be suited for any of them well i guess it's a good thing you're not a nora then [Music] what else can you tell me about tilda she liked to talk about her paintings what about herself did she ever talk about her life on earth how she joined the zeniths something like that she never said much about herself and she hated it when i asked too many questions but i think back on earth she was an expert programmer given that she built a data channel the other zenith couldn't detect is there anything else about her that we might be able to use to our advantage she was the first real person who ever bothered to speak to me i wasn't really assessing her for strengths and weaknesses you said that tilde reached out to you using a data channel it appeared in my training interface as another assignment when i opened it there were a series of intermittent glitches i realized they formed a transpositional cipher instructions on how to open up a new virtual space when i entered it my training interface disappeared instead of the usual holographic teachers and files i was in a perfect recreation of her home and you're sure the other guinness never knew about it to them it looked like i was still in training toiling away alone [Music] so this secret virtual space looked like a house with an ocean view i could see white caps and hear waves crashing on rocks below and there were galls crying outside inside tilde had frames that showed off her favorite paintings changing at intervals to match the light there was an armchair she liked she'd sit there and gaze outside while i looked through her things we spent hours in that house i never wanted to leave you said tilda showed you paintings and let you access media files every time we met she showed me a new painting i i think she was dutch all of her favorite pieces were from their golden age in the 1600s portraits allegories ships at sea she had so many that didn't interest you i liked her media portal it had so much more than my training interface clips shows hollows my favorite was this one called second time around about a family whose kid comes back after disappearing during the hot zone crisis right but did this portal have anything about the zeniths themselves anything we could use no any information about them was redacted [Music] that's enough for now good i don't think that door had power before but looks like it's malfunctioning looks like some kind of maintenance space i wonder where this leads ourselves huh that did it uh a bunch of lights just turned on up here was that you oh yeah i guess it was i don't think i should take this upstairs was this door always locked vader requested the use of that room as her personal space i have locked it at her request okay looks like a power cell could fit here okay that console has power now i've got to be more careful jensen almost caught onto my plan while we were going over the diagnostic center specs i've got nothing against the rest of the team it's just i'm sure they've all got family they're gonna meet up with inelysium but me i couldn't even bury august there is nothing of him left besides my memories i won't let those blink out of existence too the vaults for us no one else eleven more weeks before we lock the blueprints then the rest will be up to gaia vault i found a locked door behind the vent in the basement i wonder if that's it for the looks of this data the fastest has been going to hack into the repair bay ah okay doesn't look like it's been able to i wouldn't have taught you the song so you like hearing me butcher utaru music i sure don't sound like a dying long leg you won't believe hey it's a long way to the coast if you need to resupply on route i suggest stopping in falls edge it's a lowland clan village southwest of the grove in the heart of the jungle got it thanks for the advice a buddy of mine told me about a karja expedition down south a place called jagged deep they think there's something special in the big lake down there old world relics of some sort too bad machines decided to spoil the dell for everyone sounds like bad luck george might have found something interesting down there he was checking out so said this one broke down amidst a herd of machines i better be careful i guess they were leaving offerings to the land god that looks like something fried them whatever did it might still be around there's the land but i'll have to deal with those machines before i install the reboot code i'll use that heavy weapon if i can tear it off [Music] hello oh oh ugh oh ah [Music] ah it's done got an opening i think that's all the machines time to install this code on that land guard storm bird must have been what killed those who told [Music] me wow oh so oh ah [Applause] [Music] assets okay let's get this code installed i should install this code on that landcard [Applause] let's try this again nice and easy one down two to go so see there i'm here i found tea and installed the reboot code fitting them that i feel thankful teas festival came in winter when all the grain from the harvest was stored away it was a season of gratitude and all the children would receive gifts the best was my first bow made of you strung by my father well he definitely taught you how to shoot well that he did there's one more thing i found two of your people uh stormbert got them but i took it down oh i'll make sure someone retrieves their seed pouches so they may return to the land all right then i'll hit the plane song and deliver the code to the land gods there there one of the land god shrines so said this one sank in a nearby lake the lion god must be down there somewhere i think the land god is underneath i think the land god is underneath that level we better stay away from that snap i need to get to that land god so i can install the legal code shocked and locked [Music] [Music] so [Music] that should make things easier let's get this [Applause] i can grab this from my stash later [Applause] [Music] this should help you get back on track that should do it another line got dealt with hey zoe hey how goes it had to swim a bit but i gave the reboot code to sew ah good we used to celebrate so in the fall at the beginning of the harvest with wine made from elder flowers when i was 12 i got tipsy on it and kissed a boy in the sage garden now he was so surprised he nearly fell into the mulch it would be good to see so again plowing the fields in the afternoon son how are things on your end getting there a few land gods to visit still okay i'll call you when i'm done with the last one thank you this must let's take a look gotta climb up to that land god it looks like this one's been here for a while i won't be able to install the reboot code with these vines in the way but or there's vines there's a metal flower there the flower if i can deactivate it the land god will be free from the vines there we go should be able to access that cave now [Music] treadwind carcass must have dropped the flowers and then crashed looks like i can climb up the side of the cliff might help me get to that mountain now i just need to get rid of these vines that's better time to get this code installed this will help you get better the last land god zoe can you hear me i can hear you alloy just planted the reboot code on dough he was a bit tangled up but he's better now good to hear doe always returned to the sacred cave at the end of winter so his festival foretold the coming of spring during those times i remember clinging to my mother by the hearth snuggling for warmth and listening to her sing of new beginnings which is exactly what you're going to give to your people i hope so when you can meet me at plain song and we'll send out the reboot signal i've delivered the code to all the land gods save one only law is left i'm here with her just east of the main village okay i'll get there as soon as i can an old world ruin i have something useful lying around i should take a look inside doing better than yesterday and you have dangers out there stranger what is she doing to love eloy you made it all of the land gods have been updated now to send out the reboot signal [Music] [Applause] what does this mean a new beginning gaia told me this would happen to all of them do t so and the rest she called it a reboot sequence but i didn't think it would be so beautiful soon the land gods will return to tilling the soil as they once did so the chorus wants a word of course they do do you want me to come no need i'll just tell them that our lands will soon bloom again who are they to argue find me later and i'll tell you how it went good luck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] around here that's where kotalo said we'd find what he needs to build himself a new arm i should let him know i'm around hey catalo i'm at the zenith lab ready to come over i'm on my way hey lloyd i appreciate you meeting me here i'm happy to help did gaia mention where exactly in the zenith lab we'd find what you need she mentioned the chamber where you found beta and the database that lies within she said it'll help us find the knowledge and components i require to build a new arm at least we know where to look we will have to be quick about it in case the zeniths are watching understood the lab's up this way you okay i got this machines we're scrapping the specters for parts should we dispose of them or we can sit past them i'll stop looking already [Music] i'm catching snowflakes on my lashes oh here fight me to the lab is by that tunnel come on the anime did this hard to believe but yeah [Music] enemies up ahead [Music] you the room we found beta in is up ahead either way okay you won't get the better of me is that it down there yep we better make our way down there this will break my fault we're here now we just need to find a way to access the database guy was talking about such a thing barely even to breathe [Music] [Music] i think i find what we're looking for let's hope it holds the answers we seek i'll download the database to your focus so you can search through it later what about the components they should be somewhere on the spectres fight with honor wow [Music] getting somewhere [Music] attack god me huh end them [Music] the zenith might send reinforcements we need to finish up and get out of here the components should be somewhere on the second floor i'm right behind you huh [Music] [Music] huh huh we need to search the entire floor i'll keep a lookout don't want any more surprises good idea event might be a way out of this room but uh the components have to be here somewhere [Music] [Music] please tell me the components are in there gotcha i should go back and give these to catolo oh oh you found the components see for yourself you have my thanks eloy something wrong i was just thinking about what it will be like after i build the arm will i feel different hold again idle thoughts they can wait until we're back at base you go on ahead i might want to take one more look around in case there's anything useful very well i look forward to putting what we found to good use walk with the ten falling gently [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] maybe speak you're back good before we talk i wanted to give you this for helping me heal the land guns plain song is in your debt thank you so you deserve much more for all you've done may the land always bloom in your steps and yours how to go with the chorus after we fix the land gods they were shocked when i told them that our lands would soon be on the mend i thought fain's eyes would pop out of his head but of course they had no choice but to take it as good news even if it meant all their preaching about meekly accepting our doom was exposed as wrought to be honest i found the conversation to be highly enjoyable i'm glad you deserve it they're lucky that you never gave up on saving them i assume you've been looking into demeter now that guy has merged with it yes it's been humbling to know that the seeds i carry in this pouch came in turned from the seeds saved for demeter in the old world it gives me hope that the cycle of life will prevail now just as it did before [Music] i should go back to studying it is plugging in that power cell downstairs must have turned on these holograms delano must have left this for me on her way back east i wish she could have stayed but i know meridian and the lodge need her what nothing you just look good that's all get back to study you were gone for a while how's it going with the arm it is nearly complete but i'm still adjusting the fittings soon i must test it looking forward to it i should leave proceed with caution did you come from you could show me [Music] going down going down okay grab the drone's data hey i don't do much me your actions are known across the lowlands eastern you've aided our marshals and our chief i for one i'm great so i'll tell you what what i see what i know i will share that way you won't be running blind in these parts i should probably tell you if you travel to the coast southwest of here you might run across a cauldron hidden in the jungle i'd stay away from it if i were you it looks dead and overgrown but where there's a cauldron there's usually some dangerous machines thanks for the heads up that cauldron might have machine overrides i could use i should check it out when i can [Applause] and head for the quinn ferry all blades against regardless an honor champion i'm knocko have you been out to the valley of the fallen by chance don't think i have why what's there my idiot little brother the valley is a test of endurance and skill from my clan the lowlanders but it's been closed for months commander's orders there have been reports of strange lights off the coast and the whole area is crawling with deadly machines but dax reckless and bear armed as he is when in any way never takes no for an answer convince two others to go with him too they've been missing for days and now marshall ever has been sent in to bail them out strange lights deadly machines and missing soldiers sounds like a lot even for marshall i'd go by myself if i wasn't stuck on transport duty i'll find your brother if i can where is this valley south of here towards the coast look for the climbing path on the cliffs it marks the start of the valley and if you see my brother knock him on his ass for making me worry strange lights off the coast whatever it is it can't be good i should look into it when i'm out that way in the wild [Music] sure [Music] got like a pass out of fences but it won't happen again walk among us be welcome it's carjacked i think it was left behind by marshall fashoff they say you tamed insurgent your courage inspired are you looking to trade the other day [Applause] i can send it to my stash hey that's strange well nothing's stopping me from taking a boat huh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh head for that beach [Music] [Music] no one's guarding this side of the ferry either where are the quinn landfall i guess i better go find it should be to the northeast [Music] you
