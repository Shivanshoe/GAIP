experimenting on you the gre the world needed you you seemed our only hope i'm sorry [Music] was it worth it me did you even come close to a cure we were close but the virus it finally reached the complex [Music] so were you involved in those experiments no the tests on children were all performed at a laboratory here we were gathering data and compiling research i was here when it all happened team members began to turn and things quickly spiraled out of control one by one we were locked inside hiding sneaking around through those dark corridors and ventilation shafts my he was here with me paul he was five back then too what happened to him i managed to find the shaft leading to the main entrance i told paul to wait for me i kissed him and i told him to wait until i made sure the entrance was safe he clung to me didn't want to let me go when i came back for him he was gone i was only away for 15 minutes i spent the next week looking for him and then the rest of my life crying

center look through all the names ah patient discharged all of them yes damn it no informed where they ended up or about this substance 13 1354 or something i'm sorry aidan [Music] there's more the substance was also tested on some infected at gre facilities across the city to no avail the project was run and supervised from x-13 it was eventually shut down as was x-13 itself is there anything more about this x13 in here i doubt it but i heard about it x13 was a hub of gre operations and the substance you know what it is there were so many tests in clinical studies aiden let me search the database for the research data something's wrong what do you mean it says a procedure's been initiated another procedure i'm looking lots of data started then paused 11 years ago resumed a few days ago in x10 there's also a map several locations are marked including the observatory what the hell does it all mean i have no idea but intruder alert intruder alert infected they must be here somewhere they must have followed us there's no time hurry take the key hide yourself somewhere and lock yourself in i'll deal with them aiden we don't know how many there are i'll handle it hmm monica you all right yes but i have bad news these locations on the gre system they appear to be targets targets for missile strikes missile strikes what are you talking about the fail-safe protocol we don't have much time listen this marks river end and garrison that's in the central loop people live there you have to warn frank okay okay i will hey frank frank your neighborhood is marked on some tactical map you have to tell people to evacuate there's no time to explain just clear everyone out of there frank [ __ ] okay just wait here i'll try to get through to them from above and take

on you're back thank god you really got to stop doing that you had me worried and i don't get worried keep away from me luanne wow i mean it's not like i expected flowers but for digging you out from under the rubble and carrying you here on my back a small thank you would be nice you don't understand the wine i you what i am i killed veronica what i killed her and not only that i'm turning i saw veronica's body it was torn as if by a volatile you couldn't it was walter's experiments back then in the hospital there was nothing in the gre database about me but about the drug oz was giving us it had the greatest effect on me one's told me that mia's dead i have to get away from here i'm a threat if i stayed not to everyone what if he lied to you and mia's alive and even if not you didn't kill veronica aiden that wasn't you i repeat that was not you if this transformation is because of waltz then we're going to make him fix it got it i'll help you wow walt created the inhibitors he must know how to counter their effects it was that come on probably another building collapse oh my god the butcher he's finishing what he started 11 years ago it's walter he used the key that's when this all started what are you talking about dylan didn't want waltz getting the gre key he knew the whole city would be at risk waltz took the key from veronica and escaped apparently he needs it for something else do you see now you have to stop him him and williams no matter what one i can't control when i turn any moment now i can when you feel something happening just get to a uv light i can't stop them alone aiden okay okay let's get him now you're talking like the aidan i know frank's taking juan and matt to the stronghold he wants to meet with the butcher what i had the same reaction but he says that after the bombing williams contacted him and that he wants to talk has frank lost his mind that's why i'm going to cover their idiotic asses you go to the fisheye maybe you can still talk frank out of this stupid idea if that doesn't work i won't be far aiden nobody can know about veronica remember i know it wasn't you who did that but jack the peacekeepers they won't give a [ __ ] they can't stop us they won't oh my god frank frank frank do you copy hey we have medicine and food for those in need contact us by radio or display a flag on your building the night runners are back oh frank aidan you're in one piece frank if you're going to the stronghold i'm going with you kid stop sit down and listen to me you saved a lot of people if it weren't for you i wouldn't be able to warn anyone but i don't think it's a good idea for you to come this isn't about waltz the stakes are too high wait what do you mean i'll tell you but this has got to stay between us got it just tell me there will be more missile attacks aidan williams says most of the central loop will be destroyed you understand is that a threat or a lie we won't find out unless we sit down to talk and what if it's a trap aidan listen at the start of the pandemic villadore was one of 20 cities to be isolated by the gre do you know how many of them survived so far none except for hours they were all blown up when the virus got out of control villador was saved because someone stopped the bombings and i think it was williams i don't trust the butcher or waltz frank i want to go with you if things go south you could use some backup okay i know i can't stop you you'll go with us but stay cool and do what i say is that clear [Music] oh [ __ ] there's something let me get him [Music] get the [ __ ] off me [Music] [Music] uh [Music] hey hey we can't wait any longer we need to get moving you okay open up renegades will be here any minute are you sure you're okay yeah i felt worse i had a drink you sure you're good to go i'm okay i'll be okay they don't know that another attack's coming no they don't are you gonna tell them if we work things out with the colonel i won't have to if we don't then tomorrow this place is done either way tonight they deserve a party let's go get one he's celebrating too whenever matt walks into the canteen juan gets up and leaves seriously this schoolboy feud isn't helping anyone where's matt he here or will he be fashionably late matt's upstairs waiting come on hidden buddy good to see you alive for likewise nicholas man wouldn't be if it hadn't been for you they say hell everyone here be dead by now later amigo i've never believed the night runners just fairy tales if you ask me [Music] man everything all right this is [ __ ] frank what if it's a [ __ ] trap we need to strike back at the [ __ ] before he burns his city to the ground see this is why we're screwed this fuckhead's just gonna make a bad situation worse enough william says there are more missiles if he knows that he might know how to stop them so seeing as he's graciously agreed to talk we're gonna dress up real nice and go to his island on our very best behavior now move your ass matt only if i can kick his walk to the slaughter [Music] watch yourself here in my opinion it turned out well at least uh hey aidan not going sure are a lot of them down there dollars to donuts man [ __ ] this up i guaran [ __ ] tee it got a plan b oh improvise what if he improvises but don't worry so much what else is there to do get ready stop the car stay with me frank you get after those [ __ ] i'll stay with him what happened what happened last [ __ ] renegade shot him where were you hold still catch that truck or you'll never get to the butcher [Music] i won't leave him the arrow was poisoned nothing you can do here i was right this was a sinkhole along take it there's a tracking device on the truck you can't let him get away whatever happens promise me you won't let anything happen to lawan i promise frank [ __ ] hell margaret the healer can help give this to her no way dude you let that truck go the butcher gets away with killing frank you want to say frank go now i'm going for the antidote stop the car you heavy stop it aiden you there what's happening the renegade's attacked frank was hit poisoned arrow if he he'll be okay i'm going to an herbalist for an going after the antidote i'm gonna kill that murdering son of a [ __ ] no the one go to frank he needs you now i have to leave the butcher and waltz to me take care of frank fine get them both for mia and for frank for mia and for frank [Music] help my friend he's he's been poisoned by renegades calm down show me the poison and shh margaret you sure the renegades did this yes why do you ask aiden do you have the antidote not yet but the poison's stronger than we thought frank won't last much longer i need this antidote fast pass me the jar the one with the green herbs inside do you smell it same smell the renegades use curari it is odorless not bitter smelling like this one just tell me what i need to find this is sacred violet you need aquatic herbs to neutralize it five pieces are needed to counteract the poison they grow beneath the waters nearby mix them with this before administering it so ah he's fading fast aiden i have the antidote on my way hmm [Music] you got it you have a promise to keep remember i won't break it frank don't worry i'm out of my way drink this okay come on come on frank frank no no no no no frank please fight you bastard fight oh [ __ ] oh jesus oh you're back frank it's all right breathe breathe okay okay i'll chop off william's [ __ ] and jam it down his throat [Music] the healer said something odd what she said the renegades don't use this kind of poison they do now yeah but why would they try to kill frank if williams wanted to talk because it was a lie i'm going to the stronghold and not with that wound of yours someone should stay with him luanne fine ask jack for help he knows a way into the stronghold aiden don't [ __ ] this up and that's a promise carl and jack juan told me you know how to get into the strongholds get on the roof you can track the signals from the van better up there i bribe the renegades driver he'll be expecting you he'll take you into the stronghold who is it someone easy to blackmail in control you'll see why didn't you stop him before i tried but the [ __ ] pannings after the shooting fortunately we have the transmitter get to the roof before the signal fades out that i've got a signal we can't lose [Music] all right [Music] jack i'm losing it this signal's fading again stick to the rooftop that band is our only chance to get into the stronghold oh there you [Music] get to the are and lower the bulkheads when the water level drops we can lead the team inside [Music] [Music] jack i got it the truck is in some building good job it's probably a renegade hideout find the driver name steve

what's up well i've got some bad news karine joined the renegades [ __ ] she was caught between two worlds and got torn apart in the process but i repeat [ __ ] nothing left to do aid now yes my own flesh and blood have brought me to this dreadful state my own kith and kin how can they be so unreasoning so beguiled by phantasms whoa beside them whoa are you gonna tell me what's going on my papa my dear papa departed this vale of tears a month ago and his siblings my clothes some aunts and uncles i spit at them went mad with grief they traveled dark paths and found an infected with the power to raise the dead ever since they've been offering valuables to the creature beseeching it to bring back my dear departed papa they really believe that yes they think their offerings will make the foul beast's grand papa a new life seems people need something to believe in whatever it may be and what does this have to do with your poverty it is all papa's valuables they've taken to use as their offerings when i tried to stop them they threw me out of the house i'll have nothing left only memories of papa and a gaping hole in my heart i'd go to that all to myself retrieve his belongings but i'm a frail man but you you seem like a stout fellow perhaps you'd go there and retrieve his treasures for me well if it means so much to you i can try oh lionhearted i will reward you a hundredfold they make offerings in the evenings so you have to go there under the cover of night you'll find his belongings in willowline chests you can wait here for the sun to descend from the sky i'll be waiting for you in my crib on lower dam air on the garrison the entrance is near the old hotel by the canal farewell farewell my blood the monster shrieked amongst the melted the city saved by the poisonous blood praise the city [Music] uh [Music] detected [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hmm all right i have everything serves you right you bastard you almost got my brother killed that didn't mean for him to get hot but he did because of you stop kahn and others to run your dangerous errands if i someone just get a whiff you pull this on anyone else i'm turning you in hey who are you another one of those fool's errand boys whatever i don't give a [ __ ] getting out of here what's going on here what was he talking about you see before the fall i was an actor not even a good one breath of the stage i i took my craft to the streets and became a con artist but not a very good one of those either and i'm still quite poor everything you said about your father your family yeah it was a lie i had to convince you to retrieve those valuables for me the legend of the creature is real well as real as the bandits who invented it to trick people into offering up their valuables they come by later and collect them i didn't dare go there myself and risk them catching me so i figured i'd have someone else go i'm a greedy lazy bastard what do you want from me well at least you're honest about one thing i try sometimes like now you survived the ordeal keep the spoils for your trouble as for me the curtain's going down to be or not to be that is the question whether tis noble in the mind to suffer the springs and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing in them to die to sleep no more and by asleep to say we end the heartache and well um well if you had a day job i say not to quit i need to get there somehow oh [ __ ] i have to get out of here uh anybody else seeing it should be fun [Music] [Music] jackass yep [Music] [ __ ] it's him don't go near you [ __ ] sissies after him okay [Applause] [Music] can't wait for me get out of here take me into the stronghold you are you crazy just drive what the [ __ ] happened back there one minute it's all chill and then suddenly it's all a [ __ ] war i should have never signed up for this if williams doesn't kill me matt will i'm so [ __ ] man i'm controlling the [ __ ] renegades man am i high just get me in and you'll be fine the butcher's got me by one bowl and matt's got the other another [ __ ] tug of war [Music] say everything is okay i'm here [ __ ] what's up you probably want to know what took so long you on the road um you are oh really i kind of because be right there it's good the password again this time we'll don't all blow your head off sweet i love you too what we only have idiot working for it what's the password three horns nope four no three three three yeah that's it you better get it right [Music] three three times for sure [ __ ] maybe it

dead aiden you saved him frank's out of the woods oh thank god thanks to you but something's wrong the bodies of the renegades are gone i wanted to search them for the poison the herbalist mentioned [Music] jack had his men haul away the corpses something's wrong here it didn't happen here [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] man hang on a minute i hate this creeping around [ __ ] oh [Music] uh me [Music] [Applause] [Music] where is he where is walt hey she's afraid of you play anna there's nothing to fear aiden right you've come to kill me have you i came to find waltz you see waltz and i aren't exactly on speaking terms these days where's frank he almost died what what happened your men you met they shot him wait sam you saw it happen you saw my men shoot matt did he saw my men i only sent one guy aiden only a driver hey there what's that man we can count bodies later you and waltz launched the attacks and ambushed frank i had nothing to do with that i stopped the attacks 11 years ago and i'm trying to stop them now waltz he's not here don't listen to him aiden lower the bulkheads you know what he wants right if you don't kill me he and his thugs will if you let them in you want to find walls aidan so do i you have to trust me all right fine help me stop waltz you're dead hayden i'll kill you both good choice aidan we'll see about that where's walt i know very little except he was looking for a place called x-13 talked about it as if it was his last resort last resort for what i don't know but this is why he turned on the power and in the process triggered the fail-safe protocol with fair-safe protocol the same one destroyed the other infected cities the failsafe has been reactivated and soon more missiles will fly i was trying to stop waltz but he took most of my men that's when i contacted frank who attacked the fisheye i don't know aidan i only sent a driver out to bring frank and the others here guy named steve the one you need to find the bodies of the renegades williams says he only sent one man one i'll look into it let you know why did you even work with that madman he's as brilliant as he is mad i wanted him to enhance my soldiers and he did but what i didn't know was that he turned them against me and used them to further his own goals what calls he didn't tell me okay now how do we stop the missile strikes the failsafe can only be stopped with the gre key that initiated it and waltz took it so there's no time to waste how can i get to x13 it's the main gre complex built when they isolated the city the most classified operations were performed there you can get there via the gre tunnel in the central loop and waltz is headed there that's why he sent renegade troops into the center at least it seemed that way based on the notes he left in his quarters go listen to them yourself his quarters are in the west wing meanwhile i'll arrange transport to x-13 you better hurry hayden one more thing i know that look son you were a test subject of his weren't you you're turning that's why i have to find him he's the one who tried to have frank killed i found those bodies cleared out on mass orders they were peacekeepers disguised as renegades matt set frank up where is he now i'm looking for him we've got his number now we'll get him [Music] anyone here he was working on something here what were you doing to us you sick [ __ ] hayden i've arranged transportation for you [Applause] come outside [Music] [Applause] report 24 2036 130th day of the year it's been six months since the funds ran out twenty since any improvement has been seen patient unconscious after administering the compound blood pressure increased slightly noticeable pupil movement the only chance for progress is to go back to x13 if the information can be confirmed and the gre key has been found by commander lucas there is a chance to further this research it must succeed at all costs report 13 2036 105th day of the year fund's gone an attempt to recreate the compound still unsuccessful patients react with uncontrollable aggression increasing psychophysical abilities as i no longer have test subjects i am testing the compound on myself report 20 2036 126 day of the year an old villador informant has reported that commander lucas has found it he has found the gre key this means that it is possible to enter x13 again i've sent a reconnaissance team under dylan's command to the old villador subway station i am waiting for a report [Music] [Music] [Music] that's right he's going to the tunnels near tower plaza drive gotta stop him before he gets to x-13 we're going there there aren't too many of us but the night runners stand behind you [Music] um [Music] [Applause] aidan the driver will take you to the tunnel entrance that should lead you to x-13 now go there's no time left soon the next missiles are going to strike the city [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] ugh did you guess we'd be following you this isn't the time to settle scores jack the renegades have just entered the cloud are you going to join them i'm going to stop walt you are nothing but traitor to me kill the traitor jack stop frank you look like you've seen the ghost jack hey frank oh you will all die and then your real face would be revealed if you told your man that you tried to kill me lies you wanted william's dead eye the evidence these are the lies of a trunk kill them but they're night runners that's wife williams i ordered you to kill him the army collapsed because they were shooting civilians peacekeepers formed to stop that happening again greatly i gave you an order damn it we follow a commander's order you're no longer fit to lead you're too blinded by revenge williams is right i need to get the key from waltz before he destroys the entire city okay and we need a search for wounded how come we'll go with you afterwards just be careful that cloud is basically a wall of deadly chemicals it's too late to worry about that frank looks like it's down to the two of us again hey pilgrim let's kick us some renegade butts i've missed your point in silly quiz hack hot oh you'll get bored with them soon enough i bet i'll bring some antis in it should come in handy okay i'll try and find the tunnels that waltz went through you stay on the radio at all times sir yes sir good i think damn there's nothing here heck on back on you there [Applause] yay there you are i'm coming for you it'll be all right will you cure her i'm doing what i can but she's weak much weaker than the
