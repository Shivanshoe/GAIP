[Music] master hasashi i am grateful that you've come speak your mind i do not wish to linger here you reestablish the shirai raju as i reform the lin kuei we both seek to shed our clan's dark pasts dedicate them to earthrealm's protection our common purpose gives us a chance to end old rivalries to start anew you'll confess what you've long denied that your clan's hands are soaked in shirai ryu blood in the blood of my family our honor is indeed stained please sit after you and i were freed from quan chi's control i sought out my clan i had hoped rebellion from within would have quashed the grand master's plans but sektor had realized his father's vision the lin kuei had been fully cyberized i pledged to kill sektor and his followers reform the lin kuei and restore our honor i am not interested in lin kuei politics sub-zero when i finally killed sektor i discovered the lin kuei had not sacrificed its honor with the cyber initiative we had abandoned it long before [Music] there will be no peace scorpion frost the lin kuei are still without honor master hasashi wait for what more treachery i will have your head our story ends here sub-zero what is this i did not bring you here for treachery frost is strong but lacks judgment she cannot see the wisdom of peace i will deal with her you spoke of the linquay's lost honor for years i had thought you would unfairly blame the lin kuei for the deaths of your family and clan but sector's cyber preserved memories revealed the [Music] the lin truth need to abide their agreement sector the grand master gave shinnok his word chinook's currency is lies as is yours payment is due i exterminated the shirai ryu i created scorpion from asashi's soul after he died we observed the agreement the letter not the spirit you are owed nothing [Music] satoshi had i known of my clan's complicity in the shirai raju's extinction our history would be different i killed your brother because i thought he guanchi is responsible for bihan's death sector was wrong there is a debt to be paid and quan chi will pay it your hearing is failing sub-zero i recognized your footsteps hanzo with sector i will not let him threaten my clan again the old cyber linquay factory was defunct buried beneath this quarry until the time disruption now sectors returned and reactivated it he's building an army by processing lin quay warriors kidnapped from my temple i can see why you need me we could enter through that tunnel but a frontal assault would be here bloody needlessly dangerous there's another entrance less populated and the rest of your plan we get help on the inside uh so we'll avenge your clan first cyrix is your inside man he was converted against his will if we disable the behavior inhibitors that control him he will turn on sector all cyberlinkway are linked to a common network cyrex can shut them down from within who is the woman i don't know focus on disabling cyrux he's the key we require additional candidates for cyberization once delivered how long before the next generation yet after all this you ally with sector he corrupted the lin kuei you corrupted our clan when you make peace with this shirai ryu filth with kronecker's help i will restore the lin kuei's honor keep cyrax alive we need him there is no future in which you are fit to lead the linkway you always doubted me sub-zero held me back cronica sees my true potential you deceive yourself frost [Music] help cyrex i'll discipline your former people i should have killed you the day sub-zero invited you to our temple you tried and failed not this time now you died can decide your fate so you're nothing but pawns we act to secure the linguai's glory in the new era take the others you've been enslaved cyrux first bisector now by cronica it ends today you will be freed i'll deal with cyrex [Music] never again no one should be a slave hurry before we face more cyber linguist you'll need a moment to initialize show yourself recognize me little brother be on [Music] offers me a new clan to lead you always mimicked me but you make a poor grandmaster i uphold the lin quay principles i thought you shared we share blood we are not brothers i've beaten your brother before vengeance without him you are weak my strength is more than vengeance [Music] no he ripped out my heart [Music] your soul is intact cyrux trust me i speak from experience is that you you look so old and scorpion we'll explain later for now know we share the same goal the cyber linguist destruction we need your help cyrex i can disable their communications network it will shut down this factory and every cyberlink connected to it frost warned me that you two have become allies i did not think you're capable of such dishonor sub-zero eight cyrax sector is mine i've taken your head once sector i will do it again the past you know is no longer set the cyber linguistics new era the cyber lin quay are finished i'll stop sector help cyrex you started this fire selling out your clan so quantity in satoshi i'm in i'll reformat the system drives and shut us all down goodbye it is not the end i will find a way to restore you anything is possible hanzo and i are living proof please don't bring me back as a machine i can't live like this machine or man you have a war your soul as long as i am grand master the lin quay will welcome you until we meet again um they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grand master hasashi no if we do

the deaths of both sub-zeros and scorpions families enraged sub-zero offered scorpion a chance to share in his quest for vengeance with a might of fire and ice combined they were a storm of vengeful fury as they cut down their foes once justice had been done sub-zero and scorpion disappeared into legend emerging from obscurity only to avenge the innocent the forces of darkness will never stop this deadly alliance you
