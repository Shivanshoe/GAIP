match is not one has come finally Slayer a health presupposition is stable now and his guardian is somewhere in a facility ahead it was not easy to fight an opponent worthy of the Slayer but I think you will be impressed was it not the same who brought the demons to us the carmaker has you to thank for the gift of Argent's energy it is you who are responsible for your peoples suffer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] welcome the Slayer [Music] I thought you would appreciate the century I chose the great hargadon hunters from the tellers realm the long thought to be extinct created on only the Slayer that is not such an austerity hug only Crusades some improvements on their design have been made enjoy what is undoubtedly my finest work [Applause] useless machines attack we are not done yet [Music] excellent [Music] the Beast that does as he not seek enhanced our gifts to aid him in his normal conquest perhaps in return for my our system is being corrupted this game [Music] I

knows the system well the final priest will be moved to a more discreet location so how well can continue without further disruptions the third hell priests ignol is no longer visible to us there is a 41.3% increase of demonic activity at the Nexus of the initial invasion that is the largest core nest on earth I will set the portal coordinates for the super gor nest now [Applause] please remain calm you may notice a slight child to the environment fear not it's all part of the Claire the super gore nest location is nearby this is the site where the invasion began the oldest and most corrupted location on the planet the ark fought hard but they were eventually driven out by the demons [Music] a comfortable one two more keys will be required to open the passage find them sometimes evolution just needs this is the heart of the nest it has taken root in this facility's main power generators reactivating the generator will destroy the nest but don't be afraid once your soul has been consumed your fear will cease to exist [Music] the generator is an enormous state to nearby control channels will need to be manually activated to restore full power unlocking the left terminal room now 50% of power has been restored the second control terminal still requires activation to describe the nest I'm unable to open the door to the second terminal at this time you'll need to find an alternate route ask not what we can do for you ask what you can do for us [Music] the hella fied barrier has opened this air shaft will provide access to the generators control terminal [Music] the

last priest and his guardian are destroyed we will require assistance in order to locate the final hel priest I believe dr. Hayden can help us with our search I will calibrate the portal to the Ark's around station this is the resistance Network in an unbelievable turn of events the super gore nest has been destroyed reports from arc personnel in the field say that they have seen a significant decrease in demonic activity across the globe many believes this is proof that the doom Slayer himself has in fact joined a resistance effort and has successfully eliminated key figures within the ranks of the challenged operatives working inside the UAC cultist organization claimed that the leader of that division priest daya Cranach was in fact removed from his office recently by the Slayer himself as key leadership within the mortally challenged continue to fall we're seeing a decreased threat from the demons on all fronts this has given the resistance a key advantage in the war for Earth the UAC continues to deny any knowledge of his existence as surviving members of the arc network it is the belief of this station that these reports are in fact true believe the Slayer has joined us in the battle against the Dean to anyone still listening to this broadcast know that there is hope and he is out there [Applause] dr. Hayden is just across the complex this industrial campus was once the headquarters of the resistance good news for the faithful did you see Samuel Hayden has fallen the arc is no more dr. Elena Richardson log entries zero to subject analysis of dooms lair January 24th 2163 there is no chance that the subject is a demon we have blood samples pulled from the Mars base event that show his blood type is b-positive he is male with a genome that makes him very much a member of the human race but the enhanced strength speed and athleticism would indicate otherwise but we can see from the blood samples that there are foreign bodies present of unknown origin I cannot as a contributing member of the scientific community agree with the assumption by some of my colleagues that he is for lack of a better word a god an avenging angel the right hand of doom here to save humanity from its sins but I cannot ignore that the timing of his arrival the identity of his enemies the fire and brimstone element to this catastrophe me currently find ourselves in as it has definitely shaken my scientific resolve this is dr. Elena Richardson log entry a 0-0 fought subject analysis of dooms lair February 2nd 21 63 maybe he is a god maybe he represents humankind's rage their will to persevere to overcome that which would threaten our survival if he is uncompromising a relentless being of violence that knows no mention of the hesitation shown by our many leaders and politicians during our time of judgment can he overcome them alone if can't we as a species all species will not survive evolution is our destination when they arrive we arrive [Music] first target destroyed the second turret will give you the angle needed to destroy the remaining tentacle our transdimensional friends shall not walk on tainted ground earth must be cleansed [Music] [Applause] one moment override successful the path is now clear you can access dr. Hayden's outpost [Music] alena Richardson log entry 0:06 Fionn 92163 the only thing they fear is hammer we watched as the Horde overwhelmed the very best and most advanced machinery and weapons technology that we could muster against the opposition it was useless they moved too quickly they cared and offer themselves only sort out the blood of humanity they were willing to sacrifice their own to get to the heart of all world we slaughtered thousands and millions more followed but then he came he can't throw them like like a sickle through a field his fury surpassing their own he is faster more relentless I believe him now to be more than just a man he is doom this is dr. Elena Richardson log entry is 0:07 March 3rd 2163 and with him lies our salvation for as he gains and strength so do they fall in numbers the priests command the armies to the north and south but he controls the fight the inner circle of death is where he resides plunging them at the far reaches of the earth and beyond I am a believer now I feel it is in Doom that I have faith the Slayer is the spear that stabs at the heart of our attackers and those that would seek to harm us should feel warned for there is only one dominant life-form in this universe and it carries a steel barreled sword of vengeance all hail the coming of the destroyer the Slayers time is now [Music] dr.

eyewitness reports say that he was spotted inside a command center and then proceeded to fight his way through the mortally challenged and onto the deck of the BFG 10k this can't be confirmed but many

will persevere many of the survivors believe the Slayer to be a god-like figure in what was a battle between good and evil of biblical proportions as humanity struggles to understand what happened to them and why many look to the Slayer now for answers but his whereabouts remain unknown [Music] you
