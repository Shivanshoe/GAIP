[Music] [Music] i think he's saying something's over there [Music] do you sense one of your friends what's going on why did the weather change all of a sudden the snow's gone and it doesn't even feel cold anymore just what's going on what is this place i see something big farther in is that a zukul no an owl poodle doesn't seem too wary so it's probably not hostile let's go see what's up then stay sharp [Music] so [Music] i don't get it why has it suddenly started giving us things [Music] hey is that owl beckoning us over i think it is it's the owl we rescued before then maybe that's what the gifts are all about it's thanking us for saving its friend [Music] this one isn't just bigger than hoodle though something about it seems almost regal don't you think what if it was the king of the owls would that make the other one the queen you think so yes they're clearly a pair [Applause] [Music] is this some kind of owl sanctuary it's such a big place though i wonder if those two were living here all alone until we rescued that owl i thought no other owls existed but here they are and a king and queen by the looks of them you never know what other ones might be out there until we look for him it's not like you were searching the whole world over yourself right rinwell that's well i mean yeah i guess you've got a point hey hoodle [Music] how about we find more of your friends and tell them about this place [Music] it can be a little side mission on our trip if that's okay it's fine with me we'll find as many as we can thank you oh rinwell it's nothing don't mind me ready to move on [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] oh [Music] here [Music] so oh [Music] i think is an owl around here [Music] so the guys we saw back in macia were snake eyes and your group fighting them is the silver swords heck we even have members working within the snake eyes gathering intel for us sounds like it involves a lot of double crossing it does but it keeps us alive and one step ahead calaglia wouldn't have been liberated without those double agents why are you looking at me like that are those mage clothes that you're wearing so what if they are the large hood is cute and it's big enough to hold hoodle too huh and the way the fabric is cut into strips is really unique i had no idea this sort of fashion existed on dana [Music] quit staring did i say something to offend you no i think she's just not used to the attention as if this place wasn't cold enough it's also pitch black i'm amazed anyone can live in this realm seriously having all this snow everywhere makes it harder to walk or get anything done and not having any light to see by makes the uneven terrain even more difficult collagely is no walk in the park either it's dusty and there's rocks everywhere and it's on fire all over the place yeah you're right now that you mention it all those fires are a pretty weird phenomenon they were always so annoying to navigate around out here fires as important as water to our survival so are the trees we use for firewood is it that rare to see the sun here not just rare until i went to calaglia i'd never seen sunlight before i'd only heard about it i couldn't believe just how hot and bright it seemed to be but i guess in most realms it's just a fact of life they're used to it it's pretty interesting isn't it the way the sorts of things people take for granted change from one place to another [Music] could we talk a moment [Music] i think it's time we go to sleep [Music] come on guys we've got lots to do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] wait there are way too many little help they're surrounding us how could a girl ever say no these little ones are hardly worth our time less talking cut them [Music] together that wasn't even a problem wait there are way too many snake eyes up ahead [Music] ah [Music] handle it [Music] here [Music] oh [Music] you're saying we should check the owl forest so [Music] [Music] this will be a delicious piece of cake how about this raging this one's mine [Music] all right [Music] i'll be saving this one [Music] i won't rest until i'm the best i can be still striving to be on par with the lord you simply can't be too strong when battle is a part of your everyday [Music] [Music] i found some equipment let me take a look at it [Music] [Music] this will be a delicious pizza i'm not done [Music] i'll bring you back from [Music] [Music] let me help first [Music] i feel stronger i mean a bit good we're counting on you rinwell on me well i'll do my best [Music] so [Music] hey you're in well what are you doing here if the snake i spot you here though so you did make it back alive man am i glad to see you safe barely when we all got separated i thought they're fine they all got back in one piece well a zoogle took a bite out of two of our guys but what matters is you're safe so you're gonna introduce me meet alfin and shion i brought them with me from calaglia you mean you made it to calaglia wait this is it just the two of them where's the rest well it's kind of a long story it's best if i fill everyone in at once your call rinwell but everyone will be dying to know we better get back as soon as we can use this passage whenever you need to go in or out of the city stay away from the front gate whatever you do [Music] how do the randons not know about this secret route of yours sis loden's an old city it's littered with pathways that people have long forgotten but keep your voice down we don't know how long this route will stay hidden so huh [Music] [Music] [Music] i think it's safe to rest here now so this is cisleton capital city of sislovia be careful you never know where snake eyes or their informants are working we are basically walking into a zukul's den here oh [Music] on a permit basis as long as people don't get reported on and sent to work the floodlights economic activity is allowed here all this talk about reports and permits this place really is different from collagen [Music] you're saying we should check the owl forest [Music] [Music] it's good to see you who's this there with me if you say so come on menix waiting we can talk in there the name's medic leader of the silver sorts and i wish i could extend my warmest welcome to you all but if my eyes don't deceive me you appear to have a renin in your midst if she is your prisoner that's a rather loose leash you have her on she's not a prisoner so why do i get the feeling there's a rat about the house no offense intended see i've grown comfortable with the likely outcome i'll be stabbed in the back but stabbed in the front we risked our lives just to get here sir if you want to send her away fine but you'll lose me too i see trust is in about as short supply as light around these parts and mine more than anyone's but i'll choose to believe you forgive my manners you must be tired after such an arduous journey but to business we need your strength the snake eyes grip on the city tightens by the day our people are suffocating out there hence the scouts i sent to find help we're at the end of our tether here that's why we're here to help we've got the firepower to do it too but first we've got some urgent business to take care of [Music] i see so your leader is in need of rescuing it's none of your concern we get that but it's coming to our aid that got you into this mess in the first place you can count on us just as long as you help us with our problem afterwards if he's been arrested by the snake eyes as you say then there's a good chance he's being interrogated over at their headquarters either that or he's being put to work over at the floodlights first priority is finding out where he is [Music] if you're planning on tagging along rinwell will show you the way just make sure to keep a low profile remember it's not just the snake eyes hostiles lurk among the villagers too this leader of yours he must be quite the inspiration for you to go to such lengths for him i look forward to meeting him someday [Music] [Music] go [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right let's head into town and see what the fuss is [Music] looks like we get to sleep with a roof over our heads [Music] so that's where those beams of light have been coming from right any danons accused of dissent against the slovia's lord are rounded up and brought here then put to work it's a fierce deterrent and you think zephyr might be in there with them i want to see what the lights are all pointing towards take us there [Music] you can see where the floodlights converge from all the way over here i want to take a closer look there's something i need to confirm what could possibly be worth the risk of us all getting spotted you'll find out when we get there have you and manic known each other for long renwell no not really i haven't been with the silver swords for all that long truth be told he's a smart guy but he's also deeply suspicious of other people i can understand since that's how you get to survive around here really i could tell he was wary of us at first but he seemed to warm up to us pretty quickly once we talked to him yeah that's pretty unusual for him i think that's a sign of how desperate things have become in my case it took a long time for him to start trusting me but then again i kind of get where he's coming from you never know who might betray the group or when the snake eyes might be watching what made you join up with the silver swords in the first place this wasn't your hometown so was it the snake eyes who no it wasn't them i just actually we shouldn't stand around talking people will start to suspect us let's keep moving be careful if anyone's even a little suspicious of us they'll report us immediately right it's not just snake ice we need to watch out for but other dennins too still there are a fair amount of people out on the streets isn't it safer to stay at home that's the thing if you stay cooped up too long people start to suspect you're hiding something damned if you do damned if you don't so people feel like they have no choice but to turn others in so they don't get in trouble what a miserable way to live at the very least we should probably go someplace where there aren't so many ah we already stick out here like a sore thumb as it is so i think it's better if we just walk confidently out in the open don't look anxious just walk firmly and look like you have a destination in mind what is sticking to the plan too much of a hassle for her this is why runnings are the worst i don't know if it's a renin thing or not but she does have a point anyway we're not gonna get anywhere just standing around let's follow after her [Music] [Music] [Music] everybody walking around looks so depressed can you blame them they live under the cover of darkness day and night that's bound to wear you down not to mention all the snake eyes roaming around laughing talking too loud or just about anything that makes you stand out can get you killed [Music] so hey [Music] no [Music] ugh [Music] hey hmm [Music] why you huh [Music] why you [Music] sorry [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] a spirit vessel i thought as much so they're pumping it full of light no not light astral energy of course no wonder this realm so dark it's as though there's a pall over the sky even during the day except it isn't dark not really the light's just being diverted diverted suck up all the light and all that's left over is darkness what's the difference darkness exists as an actual element of astral energy just like light does didn't you know that let me break it down for you astral energy exists as different elements there's earth water fire and wind as well as light and darkness but dark astral energy only exists on rena and light astral energy on dana so dark energy isn't harvested as part of the crown contest she's right it's the same reason why i can't wield dark energy and similarly why no rendons can use light energy either the only exception to that rule on the renin end is likely the lord here who has the light master core whatever the case it looks like they're collecting light here the same way they were fire back in calaglia from what i hear there used to be a proper day and night cycle in ciscodia ages ago but apparently over the last 300 years the darkness spread from sisloden and covered the whole realm that's crazy i can't believe the renan's found a way to steal even our own damn light we shouldn't linger let's keep moving before someone spots us [Applause] [Music] wandering around blindly is getting us nowhere the snake eyes have the information we need but we can't just ask for it so what if we sneak in and take it instead i wasn't aware you knew how to be sneaky hey look over there [Music] that's zephyr's son law i don't know something doesn't feel right about all this are you kidding he's practically gift wrapped for us hey what are you [Music] i remember you what do you want we don't mean you any harm we just want to talk quietly deal make it quick [Music] where are you keeping zephyr we're here to rescue him why what do you mean why isn't he your father oh yeah easy to forget that after he abandoned me abandoned it's the truth all my old man ever cared about was sticking it to the bright eyes he never even made it to mom's funeral so you become an agent for the local lord you got a problem with that you're not exactly one to talk keeping company with a renin woman you think you know her but wait until she has a choice between you and her people i may have become an agent for the renin's but at least i'm here trying to soothe the agony of my people from the inside what's your excuse i don't buy it no you're running because you're scared you think you're the only one who's had to suffer what the hell do you know you what the damn you word to the wise people like you make me [Music] look i don't know what happened between you and your father but what i do know is that when you fought back at the village he wouldn't raise a hand to strike you i've never seen zephyr back down from a fight but he could never hurt his own son and when he said he was staying behind [Music] i think it was because he wasn't willing to abandon you [Music] if you know anything then tell us please [Music] i i don't know where they're keeping my dad now all i've heard is that they're going to publicly execute him in the plaza in front of headquarters execute [Music] thank you you did the right thing why are you so determined to help my father zephyr is the reason i took up the sword he taught me how to think for myself [Music] and i want to learn more [Music] if they're going to execute him in the plaza then it'll be too dangerous for us to go alone let's ask menik he should be able to sneak us in sounds good to me let's have a chat with him so i get that you perform a certain type of astral arts but why does your magic look so different from what renin's use is it a different source or something i'm not exactly an expert on how renin's cast magic but we both manipulate astral energy to create it we just channel that energy in different ways like how you chant your spells whereas they throw out those weird symbols yeah and just like how there are different ways to use a sword there are elemental differences between us too for example light is only in dana and darkness is only in rena ah all right that makes sense so let me ask does that mean you can't use any dark magic at all or that they're just more attuned to it basically not at all since i don't have any dark energy inside my body there might be an indirect way to tap into it but i wouldn't know i didn't learn everything that my family knew about magic so it's hard for me to say for sure fair enough thanks for teaching me all that i really do appreciate it sure thing [Music] so you made it back in one piece no promising leads unearthed on this end i'm afraid it may take a little longer we got our own lead but it's not good they're planning to execute zephyr in the plaza in front of the snake eyes headquarters and soon they're going to what i've never known them to move so fast they must believe he poses a grave threat we have to break him out we could really use your help not gonna be easy but i'm sure we can think of something if they're staging it in the plaza there's bound to be an announcement beforehand which means if we can [Music] snake eyes they've got us surrounded yeah i knew we shouldn't have trusted save it in position everyone repel them use us menik we've got your back no you need to get out of here now rinwell you know what to do underground waterway to the rear on it but no discussions you didn't make it this far for it to end here we'll be fine we just have to buy you a little time i'll send word later now get going already so this passage runs beneath the whole city huh pretty clean for a dan and sewer are you sure it's safe down here ringwell it's our emergency evacuation route so it should be you sure it's as secret as you think we can use this chance to clear the way for menic and the others when they follow let's go enemies show up the moment we do are we the reason for it we can puzzle over it later we gotta run as if it wasn't weird enough getting into the city through that hole why are there so many passages like this around sisloden and it doesn't seem like the snake eyes use them to get around without being detected either yeah i don't look like ruins do you have any idea ringwell these passages are sewers they're underground so the water doesn't freeze but they're not really unusual in big cities like this one really is there nothing like these back in calaglia not as far as i know in calaglia anything they wanted to get rid of like waste or garbage was simply burned including the bodies of dead slaves i'm not sure why they did that maybe it was another way of getting astral energy out of them huh sorry that took a dark turn didn't it [Music] got it [Music] if you spot any what's happening if you can't i can fight [Music] all right [Music] a freezing storm [Music] i wonder if we can make new weapons with this [Music] [Applause] [Music] no choice [Music] 1000 this is barely target practice then why bother fighting them because i certainly won't run away from a battle [Music] right here goes head ignites [Music] thank you [Music] nicely done [Music] hey new equipment [Music] [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] let's keep our eyes on the prize [Music] [Music] huh [Music] don't i'm quite aware without you reminding me [Applause] [Music] i've used a bit too much healing [Music] [Music] but opponent like this should be easy [Music] come on come on nor am i don't worry i'll help you keep a whiteboard [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shianne [Music] [Music] this will be a delicious piece of cake [Music] i should probably do something about that i'm quite aware without you reminding me you are in tip-top how could a girl ever say no i'm only getting him i can feel my precision improving should this really be here [Music] made it [Music] so [Music] i won't forgive you [Music] foreign how could a girl ever say no these little ones are hardly worth our time less talking more pummeling there's more where that came from [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like we found our mystery resident the snake eyes must have kept it here in case of intruders we can't let it slow us down let's finish it i wasn't expecting something so big they want to make sure we don't leave [Music] [Music] your mind i'm only getting started [Music] right keep calm and take them down shut them down okay here i go not today say no more [Music] not too old and they done bring you back from death abyss [Music] not done [Music] um [Music] you picked the wrong fight birthday this one's mine here let me help [Music] [Music] fury fight [Music] take it you picked the wrong fight in your dreams [Music] [Music] come on let's hurry [Music] [Music] you okay bregen what are you doing here when i heard the snake eyes that attacked i figured you'd probably be headed this way sooner or later come on it won't be long before they sniff us out we need to find safer ground what about the others we left behind minute can handle himself have a little faith come on follow me [Music] i feel like somebody's watching us maybe there's someone around here who needs our help hmm [Music] hey [Music] hmm right [Music] [Music] [Music] how many of these hideouts do you guys have exactly enough you can never be too careful these days we even keep some of them secret from each other so long as you don't let anyone tail you you're welcome to use them as you please so what's our plan of action we're still going to rescue zephyr right that goes without saying if only we knew where he was we could hey you're to want to see this found guilty of all charges the collagulan dissident will forthwith be executed in witness of his excellency lord ganna belt clause 2 of the special curfew act has been initiated with immediate effect throughout the realm all denons not involved in special duties or corrective labor must remain indoors until further notice and watch the execution broadcast any citizens found in breach of this protocol will be arrested as dissidents this is a direct order repeat this but i thought but lost said i thought we had days not hours looks like it's been brought forward just hold on where do you think you're going we don't even have a plan yet screw the damn plan if we don't leave now zephyr zephyr's going to be murdered alvin we've got to go the clock's ticking they've all got to go someway i guess we'll join up with you afterwards we might be able to create a diversion good idea let's go we have to get to the plaza [Music] what's going on why did the execution get moved up calm down we don't know enough to say what's going on here we've got no way of knowing what happened to manic and the others damn it hey zephyr and the others will be okay right let's just get to the plaza and fast [Music] what's this thing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is the execution in there hey you locked trespassers i think the curfew doesn't apply to you huh uh oh now what doesn't seem like there's any other way in i say we fight our way through wait i recognize them they were with the dissident no choice then look surf everyone zephyr's still okay the sooner we take care of these guys the sooner we can rescue him if you have time to talk maybe you could focus on the task at hand how about you stop telling us what to do not today [Music] damn there's just no end to these guys zephyr attention citizens subjects and slaves of sislodia i lord ganebelt valkyris to formally open these proceedings behold the brazen worm who would dare threaten the peace and order of our fair city as if his scheme weren't foolish enough he then made the mistake of thinking he could hide it [Music] take heed dannon's and engrave this edict into your souls such fool's right to life in sislovia shall be forfeit now embedded you should listen carefully before my final verdict i am prepared to offer you an unprecedented chance at mercy where are your comrades give them up before those assembled and i shall spare you your life fine time i have if you're so tremendously determined to suffer for the sake of your allies then i will see to it that you do well feeling the urge to tell everyone yet just what do you want me to say first tell the people about the mistakes you made then the whereabouts of your friends mistakes huh we're here to start i've made so many in my life that i've lost count all my life i've had to fight but i've known nothing but loss i was so caught up in the struggle to survive in this world that i ended up neglecting my own family i have lost so many good friends i even lost my wife and my son i'll never be able to fix these mistakes not a single one it sounds to me as if the greatest mistake of your life was never learning to stay down when you were beaten a good man once told me if i take up this fight i'd have to pay a price turns out he was right after all the very people and things i was fighting to protect the most were payment [Music] i don't regret keeping up the fight for a second but still not a single day goes by when i do not think about what i have lost not telling others how much they truly meant to me before it was too late that is your answer that's the greatest mistake of my life [Music] do yourselves a favor and never become like me don't continue to make the same mistakes until it's too late to fix them ask yourself what it is you couldn't bear to lose what do you want to protect with all of your might then hold on and never let go it's quite enough listen to that voice deep inside of you together no one can hold you back and the same goes for the ones the lord made you build inside your own hearts [Music] [Music] you still hanging in there dad oh you saved me damn you i i've been such an idiot [Music] my son i need to now's not exactly the best time to catch up there's still a lord in need of beating yeah you're right about that so you're the son are you i thought i'd ordered for you to be relieved of your duties until all this was over i'll see too if the person at fault is reprimanded appropriately what oh well you've served your purpose more excellently than anyone could have hoped if it isn't the infamous alphan of calaglia and he's joined by his fellow conspirators the likes of traitor and a danon witch they're not conspirators they're friends and they're not alone oh medic you finally made it your rain is over right now you hear me cannonballs it's a master core is acting up what is it medic i was hoping to drag this out a little longer but that's a master core what no dad so the master cores react to each other i see how interesting you can drop the act it's over all this time it was really you every second you stand before the lord of cislodia ghana belt [Music] you're not the only one skilled in the art of deception you know a mere side vocation in my own case but sufficient in bringing the glazing [Music] that's a special poison ordinary healing arts will do you no good i wouldn't fret about it friends you'll all be dead soon don't even think of escaping dissonance we need to hurry otherwise we're not getting out of here without a fight no no alvin homer [Music] here i hold nothing back scarlet inferno [Music] damn it they got us out gunned and all while we're on the defensive dad dad come on stay with me all this trouble to buy yourself a few extra seconds before you die you bastard [Music] they fled they'll be back though draw up a welcome party we'll be ready when they return did we lose them looks like it for now come on even if we did lose them they'll be after us soon enough besides we have zephyr to worry about the sooner we get back to the safe house the better [Music] zephyr let's get to the safe house quick [Music] you
