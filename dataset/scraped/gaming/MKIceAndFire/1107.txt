I'm trying to say get away give me your hand do it [Music] it's open ghost it's finally over I thought catching ghosts would be the highlight of my day but catching a glimpse of pepper as I stepped onto the Helicarrier put my heart in the clouds sounds like I missed quite a party I'll tell you all about it over dinner I love that we have something else to discuss oh really transferring executive power at Stark Industries involves a lot of paperwork paperwork we could be up all night that's not that much hmm now you're turning me on look no offense but the reason I made you CEO is so I wouldn't have to do people the Board says you made me CEO because you're better at running your mouth and you aren't running a company hello sir oh thank God it's Friday the prison has been placed in her cell if you wish to say goodbye now's your chance we'll be right up pepper we can avoid talking about this another time wanna meet the ghost sure I love chatting with people who try to kill me well it's a big part of my job oh look it's the ultimate power couple why'd you do it Stark I just saved me today after all the lives you've taken to spare mine you need to pay for your crimes I'm still paying for yours I'm broke [Music] I'm sorry for what happened to you the others Tim shine who was he a real hero of the kind of Cour is inside a metal suit he spoke truth to power and for that your company had him killed stock industries never fun she's a funny one so this is justice they throw me in prison and throw you a parade actually I don't think the City Council is too happy with me you'll never change Stark even if you tried it's too late your past has caught up with you in one of these days it'll take you down I want to be there when that happens if you're not I'll give you the play-by-play when I get to help see you on the other side then that sounds familiar see you on the other side something your friend needs to say Tim Sean Paul really back in the day Stark Industries would we would arm both sides of a conflict we called it hedging our bets soulish what about it Tim show me - shown is he gonna throw knee Tim Chung the name it's an anagram for gunsmith what the hell's the guns over here now starke orbital lasers someone's reprogramming them given their trajectories they'll be over the world's largest cities in the next five hours I know a coordinated attack when I see one just never seen one on such a catastrophic scale ghosts do this not likely living laser not possible new enemy then or an old one I might have created an artificial intelligence with diabolical ambitions that sounds familiar this one has my personality Nick good I think your eyes twitching director fury what sir the other carrier [Music] how many crew aboard none sir it was down for repairs from the previous ghost attack then why did they hit it old-fashioned stark showmanship just a taste of what's to come oh hey boss you know it's funny me calling you that since I don't work for you anymore but you know what they say guns only do their job after they're fired which got me to think how do we convince Stark Industries to make weapons again how about a massive global attack so rally the world against a common I think I need to tweak your logic settings a bit I figured you'd say that well if you want to stop me you know where I live don't slip out sir I've been booted off the home network Tammy sue oh no wait Dan Smith helped build your suit Neil just hack it use it against us we need an alternative Friday was right the gunsmith had tailored my suit to his own toxic specifications but I had an idea in the back of the closet past all the skeletons there was this and despite the dust in the years of neglect it was clean sure or it would be soon enough I pulled the mark one out of the cave and put it back together aboard the Helicarrier rewired it reloaded and finally to improve it my favorite copilot what's up game pan sir gunsmith won't go quietly that's for sure but if I can hear ace this quantum neural Nexus I wouldn't be a party without me first don't encourage himself are you seeing what I'm seeing so your home appears to have been encased and told a mausoleum for soon-to-be-dead here Friday what are we dealing with analysis indicates that dome is a mixture of hard light and vibranium can it be breached the dome appears impenetrable sir bet you wish all those cities I'm gonna lay waste to add something like this they don't hostiles inbound the Iron Age is over it's my time no wonder you gave the company bylaws here in the ride she'll get a slag [Music] have your stuff or was anyway it's all mine the same damage said what piece of month stark weapons offer peace of mind [Music] a peace of mind if not all it suits like shootin cans

widespread evacuation as we will find a way inside the mansion you just clear us a path okay Friday you can sir more enemies on Route one - no suit sir Moorhead's will rectus old armor Friday what's the mansion stats no it appears to be rearranging your mp3 players on I just alphabetized pocket you're breaking him down a little slower aren't you boss I should have destroyed you when I had the chance but you could cuz deep down you know I'm the best part [Applause] me you're not making a dent in these drums that was I'm detecting some sort of kill switch gunsmith he's gonna fly it uncharacteristic Micheel found a way through the storm not yet sir tell him to hold off I got an idea sir who do we know that can walk through walls oh this sounds like a terrible idea steer clear the match our enemies down but not out Tony this is a terrible idea maybe but it's a move the gunsmith won't expect yeah because Tara she blew up your buildings put pepper in a hospital and put countless lives in danger all to kill you you really want me to take those cuffs off her no I'll do it hey I'm as surprised as you so you need my help or my attack he needs your help I want to hear him say it if I had another hour I could probably recreate your town in your dreams what it's basically just a quantum tunneling system chest just a quantum tunneling s-- shut up Boban are you doing this cuz if not I'm taking you back to yourself you can't change the past he's offering you a stake in the future I want to speak to stark alone we're heading back prisoners stay hope you know what you're doing [Music] last time I broke into your home you weren't too happy about it how do you know I won't leave you high and dry and pass up a chance at revenge so that a new energy surge radiating from the mansion car be stand by Friday if I do this if I help you we're not friends once he's gone so am I so be it I need help finally something we agree on nice moves how do you manipulate your photons glady Emulex overlapping acoustics now it's all wait for us shouldn't be using palladium then don't tell me what to do [Music] there's bonus [Music] how do you like to you know because I'm so gay okay I'm in the mansion I'll try to bring down this dog or get the dog help me bring down this giant idiot don't push him Stark the weapons are insufficient against his shielding's code is the next level and I am seeing some innate vulnerabilities in this armor defects defense no no no that's my design there are no details if you say so stand by expose the vulnerability these elements attack back Glassjaw of his dark this is my party boss and I didn't save it for the plus one especially not her their first armor versus your legs and progress marches rights over all of the sustained damage so [Music] [Music] dating my cutter heroes in a world without billy's with are not what you had in mind Oh ghost you've been great I made myself and now I'll unmake you movie points are up stark he's protecting them with shields take those down first stop wasting time shooting the hard life yeah shield is down of course you punch it [Music] she will not leave me in that trash the mansions actually not that bad tacky binder talking to you [Music] [Music] when we're done I'm done you Friday - is it always this dramatic when a bad roommate moves out to more vulnerabilities for you to target Stark you're welcome you're soft in that g-force your heart bled all over [Music] [Music] [Music] you think I was dangerous making like this with you [Music] I built this target to survive it worked and it'll work again [Music] [Music] and plate represents your ego Hey that's fair actually it's the arms without arms he's breaking down start is that encouragement [Music] you're struggling I mean really how can you trust she trusts me and I teamed up here trust is a stronger word that I use dynasty Sutra he's losing it he lost it when he couldn't make weapons anymore don't believe you're gonna change the world it's dark I'm running out of ulnar abilities to expose change your plans why melt seems like I can crush them under these giant for an AI could be anywhere it was these chosen to change yourself to this quizzical food it's an idea in his hand he goes all in I can relate [Music] all these were painted my neck well done sir all of you against me I'm still standing well none of you even deserve to stand on my shoulders ghost any other defects although I do detect some kind of foreign object in his Hardware something distinct from the armor he's huh new projector I thought he got rid of that maybe you can't let go of the past I can relate whatever it is it's directly behind his chest plate can you expose it I think so but you'll have to get in close you know I can't see the world I'm the true iron Mary Jo sharks insensitive [Music] sorry pal real heroes have heart [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm loving the new jet Tony let's hope she holds together better than the last one sir miss Potts may I remind you both that the entire governing body of Stark Industries is on this light the boards on board we know then perhaps you should avoid making reference to the incident involving the previous star jet they can't hear us Kenny hey Nick what's up surveillance satellite one of ours yesterday it started making its own orbital maneuvers today it quit talking to us all together yeah the kids call that ghost I called it suspicious check it out will you Tony you got it [Music] pepper change of plans let me guess you can't make the company retreat in Maui actually we can't I could use your help pepper I'm sorry repeat that for a second there I thought you asked for my help Friday explain to the board members that miss Bronson I have an official super business student pepper ready where to space space space space oh you don't have to go with your nation [Music] [Music] my spot seems to be enjoying her nice suit perhaps a little too much Friday reduce the thruster output a pepper soup by 30% but be sneaking soon considering first second my spots happiness [Music] [Music] welcome home sir thanks Ryder you seen pepper I believe she's putting out a fire again literal or figurative she took off in the rescue armor she need my help does she ever okay then what fun can we get into today Morgan Stark here welcoming you back to stark-raving where we are stark raving mad about stark stock which lately is jacked up like my quads after a squat session why because some people noticed my cousin dropping some mondo firepower lately and it's led to rumors that he's back to making weapons but you might be surprised to hear me say this don't get carried away knowing my cousin he's got exactly one client for these inventions himself wait that sounds selfish what I meant is technically his client is the world as and he uses these weapons to save us all don't get me wrong stark stock is a great blue chip investment but we don't want to create a bubble based on idle speculation unless he does start selling this stuff in which case feel free to bubble like the champagne I'll be bathing in okay apparently no one's interested in getting rich as as stark because all my colors want to talk about today are the giant laser beams that blasted the Malibu coast near my famous cousin's home now look I realize coastal elites get their ascots in a bunch when their yachts are capsized and the powers knocked out for a few hours so their caviar goes bad boo-freakin'-hoo first of all you know my cousin has this under control right he's Iron Man secondly I'm sure there was some collateral damage to the environment but can I remind you that Tony was fighting a criminal psycho who would have gladly carpet bombed bel-air if my cousin had his zaptor with that mondo laser this is why he lives in such an isolated location in the first place because he's a target for these wackos so get a perspective and go swimming in your money bins you 1% parasites okay today's show is for all the trolls who email saying Tony and I aren't really close all I've ever done is squander my inheritance and Tony has no time for a loser like me to you I say ah because my guest today is Tony Stark yeah I really do have to take another call soon Morgan of course you're a busy man so let's cut to the chase you took down that giant like David laying out Goliath what kind of insane terrorist supervillain faction created that freak uh well I did actually you see there was st. amour I get it you're a brilliant technology misused by wrongdoers once again that's not your fault it's like if someone runs you over with a Roxxon SUV is it Roxanne's fault and let's move on to the anarchist nihilist terrorists known as the ghost she's in custody right well no she sort of disappeared because Stark Industries is in great shape with you doing your thing and pepper at the helm hey what about the reports of a partner who's been spotted with Iron Man in a more feminine Li proportioned iron suit it's pepper isn't it Pepper Potts is the Iron Lady you can use Iron Lady for free by the way family discount no thanks look when I said I'd come on the show you promised there'd be another guest I did indeed so let's bring him on and get ready for a savage finance bro-down as my cousin Tony debates our old friend me darío agar Roxxon CEO oh I wouldn't call it a debate given the active litigation Roxxon has against Tony I can't say much but I do want to offer my heartfelt condolences to your shareholders for all the money I'm going to take you for also Tony because I have a heart of gold I wanted to give you the opportunity to beg me to drop the lawsuit having met you agar the only thing I'm going to beg you to do is ease up on that disgusting Bulgarian Cologne and as for the lawsuit you should be getting an email right about now with footage proving that I was fighting ghosts and that palladium mine so your case is as over as your haircut do how how did you get this you would have had to hack into rocks on security cameras that's illegal actually it's footage from ghosts drones which we obtained when she was in custody all super legal Nick Fury is gonna email you the warrant so we can go to court and you can explain why you didn't turn over the security camera footage you just admitted you have that's my preference by the way or fine I'm dropping the suit I'm sorry can you repeat that louder and more obsequious any drop in the suit but you made an enemy today Stark not the kind of where's the stupid costume the kind that will take everything you have in the world but Morgan let's cut his mic before he gets himself into even more legal trouble done and oh my god that was so freakin awesome now I really do have to go of course oh but before you rush off how about cutting a promo you know should you just say mrs. Tony Stark in you're listening to stark raving the only financial advice I follow I write my own material Morgan here's the best I can do this is Tony Stark Morgan and I are indeed related [Music] you
