i'll wait for your guy in here and thanks for your help there's no doubt about it this whole operation is meant to harvest organs clan kelly's chopping off the parts they want and burning the leftovers this is straight up murder maybe kelly's stealing organs to fund a bloody empire i don't need to read that i can't help it man the stem [Music] oh my days what happened to their faces bags do some facial reconstruction take a picture and i can run key details past various databases negative this is evil just [ __ ] evil we need to take mary kelly down hard unfortunately i must confirm that this is indeed angel lopez [ __ ] good eh he knew the risks i did too but never thought dedsec would get caught up in this mary kelly is preying on london's most vulnerable she's a [ __ ] monster taking her out needs to be a dead sec priority now we need to find caitlin lowe's case files on mary kelly and see if my conjecture may be correct could mary kelly be in zero day well done you got the files the inspector will be impressed now get out of here before someone decides to turn you into minced meat chop chop i'm no [ __ ] kidding but i know i uh wanted to thank you i'd be nothing but an anatomy lesson by now or a pile of ashes you'll be happy to know that inspector now has been escorted to a nearby refuge and is getting her wounds treated i'll be fine still a little flighty from whatever they gave me and frankly a little stunned that we've joined forces dedsec working with the police never thought that happened well you're not really in the police anymore but still we're in we won't let mary kelly put more people through this exactly you have an organization i have information and some backing from powerful people pool our resources and we might just take her down mary kelly's no petty criminal bags man we need to debrief at the safe house look over these files and figure out what to do next i'll synch with inspector now and prepare a briefing i found a potential recruit for you dropping a pin on your map [Music] let's wait around and see if this weapons dealer shows up our potential recruit has been trying to take down a nearby clan caddy weapons dealer you could hack their optic to download incriminating data on them i've downloaded evidence of the illegal weapons sale i'll send it along to our prospect and let them decide how to deal with it now that you've helped them they might be willing to talk to us [Music] how would you feel about mixing things up a bit hey you're dead sick aren't you great timing i need a hand with something we'll see what

or anything but my friend is kind of an ass it's very possible they weren't asked with the wrong people relax dead sex on the case now [ __ ] we got bad disappearances across the city how do we find this one person well we could knock on every door in the city and see if they've got any abducted people on the premises but it'd probably be smarter just to snoop around their last known location true say submitted these right now this is where our missing person disappeared from if they were abducted it would have been captured on ctos surveillance cool let's get some data that's it of your music volume it is illegal to distract others with disruptive noise [Music] that's the ctos up there is come on you [ __ ] quick what the hell uh i definitely heard got your footage well they were

we're ready for the briefing mary kelly heads up the most powerful crime family in london clan kelly which should at least be easy to remember under her old man they were a bit player then he died and her rival started disappearing her enemies her friends her family they call her bloody mary for a reason early on mary abandoned cash in favor of cryptocurrency and brought the kelly's criminal business online it makes weapon smuggling drug running money laundering all a lot easier without a cash trail the woman single-handedly modernized organized crime in london she considers herself to be untouchable case in point from my files you retrieved darla covington 19 sasha haddad 28 radik stockkovic 24 all disappeared it's difficult to find good health these days isn't it love most people

finished here this was a courtesy oh give my regards to their families it's horrible losing someone you love nice meeting you caitlyn as you can see she'll never respond to interrogation but there is one place she feels comfortable talking the sandstone residence inspector lao thinks a police bug in the kelly's headquarters may have the evidence she needs to finally convict bloody mary sandstone is their center of operations i know the data on that bug will take her down get it for me and i swear i'll put her away forever pushing the coordinates to your optics [Music] you
