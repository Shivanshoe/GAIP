[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] read all about it bill williams [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well i for one am grateful mrs bush that they are finally bringing civilization to this savage land i could not agree with you more my dear my daddy settled this land and i know he'll be looking down on us pleased with how we helped the nadines yes they've lost their land but they've gained access to heaven [Music] but father do you mean unless an innocent receives communion they're destined to go to hell it hardly seems fair what i mean to say jenny is that there is a great deal of difference between an innocent and a savage i never thought of it that way yes they lived like animals but they're happier now [Music] not only do people now have motor cars father but i heard that pretty soon we will be able to fly no only angels can fly jenny no no apparently people can fly didn't you hear out in kansas a man even got a car to fly i hardly think so jenny apparently mr johns wants to run for governor which is why he's so concerned with cleaning up the state nate johns yes his family is nothing but hillbilly trash that came here after the war i don't want to be judgmental but this state should not be ruled by such a disgusting family a family without class apparently the john's family have made a lot of money and he has a lot of friends in politics mrs bush money isn't everything there are many things that money cannot buy it seems that money can by voters though [Music] what you must remember my dear is that we have been brought here to spread the word and the word and civilization they are the same thing they are the gifts it is the opportunity we have the chance to live among people who are decent and who do not kill each other and who let you worship in peace it it's so confusing father sometimes i find it impossible to make the distinction between a loving act and a hateful one i mean they often seem to be the same thing yes jenny it is confusing but you only have to ask me if you need help indeed well here we are mrs bush armadillo [Music] hey there mr martin mr marvin over here [Music] you must be john marshall sometimes i'm jake your friends from blackwater hired me to guide you hey my friends but pleased to meet you jake i got the horses saddled up and ready out front [Music] you ain't gonna find sturdy or horses in these in all the new offices they can flow on the way out of town no need to kick off a lot of dust yeah easy so it's fart mercy you want to visit that's right ain't taking nobody up to the fort in a long time strange place for a decent seller to want to visit if you don't mind miss van who said i was a decent fella it's been abandoned for years now folks say it was built during the mexican war what kind of soldiers around back then why'd they leave well i ain't entirely sure i heard they had to go up north to fight indians or maybe they got tired of being soldiers and went looking for gold you know how things is so what are you doing up at the park i'm looking for an old friend well like i said you ain't gonna find many folk around those parts these days knows you do fight about a sociable as an alternate affects you i mean i ain't one to judge a man by the company he keeps but well he ain't been friends for a long time are you planning on spending any time in armadillo mr marston i doubt it i ain't planning on staying very long well if you're fixing for some female company you can do a lot worse than armadillo fine as cream gravy they are not like thieves random dang those girls ain't even fit for a drinking man to hole up with i'm a married man i'm afraid ain't we all yeah oh it was the marshal who hired me lee johnson do you know him i think i heard his name says he got a telegram from some black water big bugs asking for a guy i guess it's none of my business that's right you ain't very talkative are you nope i'm just chewing the dog mister that's how i am i don't mean nothing by it trust me there's things you better off not knowing i tell you mr marston those coyotes eat better than i do not far now you'll see the fort when you get to the top of this hill listen mister this here is what's left of fort mercer some gang rolled in and took the place over so i understand this is where we part ways friend you have yourself a good time [Laughter] let's go bill bill i've come for you bill williamson come out here right now go away now john don't make me kill you nobody needs to kill anyone bill you must think i was born yesterday you always did think i was an idiot that ain't fair bill you were as my brother i've come to try to save you oh do i look like i need saving bill please they want to kill us all i can help you well you never tried to save me before you only seemed to save yourself bill i implore you think about this you implore me you implore me you always were one for fancy words oh well things are different now john now i'm in charge no more dutch and no more you employee i i implores you to go back and tell them to send someone just a little bit more impressive next time well [Laughter] for you [Music] ah [Music] [Music] well you're alive so it would seem so how do you feel i don't know the polite word for it i do stupid is the word we use around here what were you doing i was oh i was doing something stupid well you'll be okay once you didn't die the doctor said you'd be fine he got the bullets out a couple days ago good it cost us 15 i'm sorry madam should've left me there to die did you want to die i mean was that it was that why you went straight out to fort mercer and picked a fight with the worst bandit in the county to die mr er mr marston john marston bonnie mcfarlane miss bonnie mcfarlane well you may be right miss mcfarland i don't know huh so what were you doing trying to give mr williamson a chance for old time's sake you know bill williamson knew him long time ago well what was he like dumb just like you thank you miss you seen my hat i have and uh what will you do now now i'm gonna take my time and go after him the less kind way well that sounds very fun mr marston quite heroic just like in those penny dreadfuls my brother used to read meanwhile if you'll excuse me i've got a ranch to run of course if you're feeling better why not take a ride with me later help me patrol the perimeter you can earn back some of that money we wasted on doctor's bills of course and thank you for saving my life i mean next time mr marston i strongly recommend you don't try to lose it quite so earnestly i'll bear that in mind mr marston back in the land of the living i see figured it's about time i started paying back that fifteen dollars well no time to waste the horses are saddled up over here there's the foreman's office it's also where we lock up good for nothing outlaws such as yourself i'm happy enough with my current quarters right now miss mcfarland i picked out a fine horse for you let's make a tour of the ranch so you can get your bearings [Music] to your right is the general store you won't find parisian high fashion but it's good for the essentials very convenient i don't think i've ever seen a ranch with its own store before [Music] and here's the corral this one's for the horses what do you think i'm no expert but it certainly looks like a fine corral i suspect you've stolen more horses than you've broken now where'd you get such an idea first impressions are hard to erase that's the train station things sure have changed since the line finally got finished bringing in all sorts of new folk like yourself is that such a bad thing change is only good when it makes things better on boy that's the barn over there paul built it himself when i was just a little girl and here we are back at the house let's stop for a while before we head out on patrol you'll get no complaint from me miss mcfarland come on [Music] hello what are you waiting for come on i don't fight how about a cold drink mr marston thank you ma'am getting shot then riding a horse seems to take it out of you i could use a rest sure come on in i'll show you the house and then you can sit for a while thank you mr marston miss mcfarlane remember me telling you about the trouble we've been having with wrestlers and other undesirables i do will you help me keep watch on the property line this evening sure i want to see just who is trespassing on our land this is a fine weapon come let's head out the country is really beautiful at around this time come on then let's mount up and take a look around right follow me keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious thank you mr marston i feel a lot happier someone's along with me i feel a lot happier now i got a rifle well with your trigger itch and my feminine intuition we should make quite a team god damn it these rabbits are at it again come on let's get rid of them once and for all let's see that rifle i want a couple of these for the pop you're better at shooting rabbits and outlaws i think [Music] [Applause] little critters now back up you should check out the rest of the range we should keep moving there's still a ways to go come on easy up now if it's not the rustlers stealing our cattle it's the rabbit stealing our crops it ain't never easy living off the land like this maybe you should move to a big city become a lady of leisure damn coyotes are back we can't afford to lose any more livestock kill them mr marston [Music] coyote won't looks like that was the last of the coyotes just a shame we had to lose any of the chickens let's go i'll take you back to your room you know you can actually handle a rifle it's something i've had a little experience in maybe bill williamson did get lucky after all luck didn't really come into it miss you're a useful man to have around the ranch that's for sure but don't think i've forgotten what brought you here we'll do whatever we can to help you i sure appreciate that miss mcfarland this is you mr marston [Music] [Music] thank you for your help mr marston makes me kind of happy i saved your life get some sleep and i will see you in the morning good night ms mcfarlane i was talking to some blackwater [Music] parade [Music] [Music] great oh mr marston how are you doing today i'm well miss mcfarland thank you how are you well i'm fine thank you so uh how are your ribs fine a little sore but apart from a couple extra scars it'll be as nothing happen good uh come in come in you know you never did tell me how you met that bill williamson or what you wanted from him no miss i did not well why not if you don't mind me asking i certainly don't mind you asking if you don't mind me not telling see it's a complicated and somewhat pathetic tale and by telling you not only would i be putting your life in danger but also threatening the lives of some people that i hold very dear well i apologize if i seem to be prying and i apologize for my reticence hope you believe me when i say that it's simply out of respect for you of course mr marston i understand that a city dweller such as yourself likes to have some exotic secrets so us country folk are impressed i'm no city man miss yeah but i saw you get on the train at blackwater you with those gentlemen and bowler hats i'm still no city man but i'll bet you can't ride mr marston i hate to take money from a lady miss oh you won't be i'll race you right now if it makes you happy we'll see all right i'll show you how we ride around these parts come on on the count of three three two one go i trust you're not gonna be a gentleman about this you don't know me at all miss mcfarland come on you ain't getting away that easily should i wait for you to catch up i think you chose the wrong horse miss mcfarland this is gonna be close i thought you said you could ride yeah see you at the finish line this shirt beats milk and cows let's go would you like me to slow down yeah i bet you're starting to regret your brave words miss mcfarland how you doing back there are you saving the best for last come on come [Music] go come on whoa that was fun sure you know you should go pay the marshall a visit armadillo sometime i'm sure he could help you deal with that nice mr williamson yeah i might just do that miss mcfarland you do whatever you think's best mr marston [Music] so [Music] oh mr marston how are you good miss mcfarlane how are you i'm well would you mind riding with me to armadillo i've got to get some supplies and i could do with the company of course you can take the reins it wouldn't do for a terrifying bounty hunter such as yourself to be seen driven around by a woman take the driver's seat come on you're looking much better considering you were almost buzzer food a couple days ago i have you to thank for that  so do you tell me have you needlessly risked your life since we last spoke no miss i have not well that's relief perhaps there's hope for you yet i wouldn't bet on it oh there's always hope mr marston you can't be a rancher in this kind of country if you don't believe that an admirable attitude miss i suppose so i can't think of any other way to stay sane to be frank what about you have you ever given up hope all together hope hasn't really entered into it it's not really something i think about a peculiar outlook i can't really say i understand you i can't always say i do either oh don't be so deliberately enigmatic i'm not miss yes you are you are being deliberately obscure as a substitute for having a personality i just know there are two theories to arguing with women and neither one works i'm not even going to dignify that gibberish with a response i think it's kind of funny i found you dying on the side of the road and now you're driving me into town you have a strange sense of humor well you must admit it's an unusual start to a friendship i didn't realize we were friends mr parliament oh please now who's being funny listen i know that business williamson is your business but i don't know you've been good to us and i don't think you're a bad man a little stupid perhaps but not rotten i just worry about you gallivanting around these parts like you're some kind of deranged bounty hunter like paul always says don't go i appreciate your concern for us lester mortals miss mcfarland i really do and if there was any other way out i'd take it i can assure you that load up so this is armadillo manhattan it is not but it does okay for us most important thing for you right now is getting yourself into dr johnson's office to purchase some medicine the first one's on me thank you miss i'll pay you back i'm sure you shall the doc's a good fellow he saved your life so be polite to him meet me in front of the general store when you're done how would armadillo get by without me hello sir finally come to get that bullet out your leg much obliged be well come by anytime that mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble well thanks for driving me it was nice to be able to enjoy the view for once and a little company never hurts now and again you're more than welcome miss least i can do thank you for the medicine why don't you have a look around armadillo you can always take a stagecoach back to the ranch later i might just do that travel safely miss try not to get yourself shot i won't be around to save you this time [Music] damn you speaking the truth now i'm a i am [Music] sounds good to me [Applause] [Music] excuse me hey hey you got a visitor shut up you and what you want my name's john marston you wanted to speak to me i did apparently so why i guess because we're both in the business of the law you that fella from the train company no i'm from fort mercer marsher you them winning williamson boys calm down go on shoot em mister shoot em what you you gettin keep with me boy what's goin on here i got me one of them williamson boys i got me one of them idiots who give

and you oh i don't seen enough of your hide around here friend i think there's some school children down the way you can go and frighten oh hearty what are you doing here mr marston apart from frightening my deputies i'm here to capture or kill bill williamson [Laughter] okay can you help me he's outside my jurisdiction he's in the next county of course bill williams and his boys have tended to keep themselves away from my town so you're happy to have them out there quite happy but i also ain't suicidal my job is to keep this town safe not clean up to all of these three counties it's hard enough around here you know i hear you speak and suddenly i'm reminded of how some of the people i respected most of my life had a problem with authority what's wrong with you well i'm sure you and your fine friends have enjoyed spending your time running around pursuing noble causes my cause is to keep this town from turning into a living hell for the folks who live here whole world has problems mister and i'm here doing what i can why what's happening right now i got the railway the people who pay my salary trying to get me to turn the blind eye to them burning down settlements up there i got a bunch of cattle rustlers out near box canyon and each shutting down not forgetting the gang that keeps murdering homesteaders out in the back country and i got a bunch of hoods over in the saloon drunk threatening to shoot up the whole town that's all i got today but it's early yet give me a couple more days there'll be more all right tell you what let's go deal with them hoods in the saloon then we'll discuss williamson okay boy you're persistent little cuss ain't you only when things matter let's head over to the saloon who we looking for a bunch of two-bit hoodlums led by this fella called walt god damn road agents pray on the stages coming in and out of town drivers and armadillos spend more time with their hands in the air than on the reins these days and you're happy to let them drink in your salute happy no but the way i figure it better they're carousing in there than out robbing decent folk that's an interesting approach to law enforcement there's a dumb red bastard now let's follow him see what kind of hole he crawls into mount up marston walton's our man god damn it he's onto it get after him it was as bad as you say he is why don't we just beef him now while we got the chance because that ain't how the law works is that right marshall and alive he can still talk doesn't sound like he's a man to be reasoned with he ain't but a few days of my hospitality and he'll be telling me what i need to know palms gang's been growing fast how long's easy money for easy work goal of spring gap tooth ridge these boys get around walden's to start but there's plenty more where he came from looks like he's holed up at the old pleasant's house let's hold up a minute and find a spot for our horses looks like we got company boys [Music] damn take cover we'll work our way up this hill over here arson i got you covered move up to that wagon for you behind the crate person smoke yours [Music] [Applause] head for the great boy i'll cover you stay with me chase that fella behind the rock boy you should have skated [Music] hellfire take cover behind the outhouse careful there may be more of them [Music] [Music] let's see if we can take him alive [Music] not a bad shot mr marston why don't you check in with me next time you're in town i don't want to be no policeman marshall nor did i my friend i can promise you that i'll see you soon mr marston [Applause] [Music] uh ah [Music] so [Music] [Applause] hello mr marston i've been hearing about your plans have you missed mcfarland yes from lee johnson to settle here and build a laugh for yourself um i'm afraid those aren't my plans see i already have a life well i had one and i'm trying to reclaim it or maybe what you could say is i had two and i'm trying to end one of them so the other can survive you do so love the talking riddles mr marston do you do that i wonder as a substitute for having anything interesting to say probably miss mcfarland oh call me bonnie fool [Music] call me bonnie miss mcfarlane i'm married i have a son i had a daughter but she died years before that i rode in the gang we robbed banks trains helped people ransom we killed people we didn't like bill williamson was in that gang now if i don't capture my former brother in arms great harm will befall my family now i don't suppose any of this is very interesting to you but i hope it explains why i wasn't so eager to talk about it no i do understand i had no idea you poor man even in this new country memories don't really fade my father was an illiterate scot born on the boat into new york he never saw his homeland but to hear him talk about it you'd imagine he only ever ate haggis and wore a kilt and he hated the english for what they had done to his great-grandparents that he'd never met people don't forget nothing gets forgiven that's true especially when it comes to money and you know even now after all his labors my father's debts are still terrible i worry every day about us losing the ranch it would kill him my father died when i was eight years old his eyes were well let's just say he was blinded in a bar fight south of chicago my mother died during childbirth she was a prostitute and he was her well i don't know what he was so i was sent off to an orphanage and ran away and fell into the game my word what a difficult life you've lived the leader of the gang taught me how to read taught me how to see all that was good in the world he was a great man in a way i bet you killed people sure and i've suffered for it and that's the life i left or tried to leave ah said too much barney i'm an uneducated killer sent here to do all i can do well kill a man in cold blood so that another man may do his part to cut crime in an area and a rich man can be elected governor on the back of these promises civilization is a truly beautiful thing mr marston listen can you help me well i can try what do you need honey no nothing so complicated i need an extra hand to take out the herd to pasture sure point me in the right direction [Music] all right let's head over to the cow pen it's about time a budding farmer such as yourself learned how to herd cattle come on easy up now thank you for telling me all that back there it must have been hard for you i hope you understand now why i've been playing my card somewhat close to my chest i didn't know you had a wife and child then again i don't think i ever asked they're they're lucky to have a man like you i ain't so sure about that but thank you he's got it come on come on let's go whoa there oh [Applause] [Music] keep sweeping behind them [Music] [Music] let's go whoa whoa that'll work come on [Music] [Music] you're not mad with the herd branching might be your true calling mr marston either that or you were a cow in a past life thank you miss mcfarlane i'll see you later i have work to do back at the ranch [Applause] let's go well hello mr marston how are you fine thank you how are you i'm fine thank you did you meet my father john marston this is my father drew mcfarland pleasure to meet you mr marston please so my daughter informs me that you're here on some secret mission to remove some undesirables from the county something like that i'm grateful for the hospitality sir well you know we've lived here for 30 years now came here from the east the land had never been settled for 10 years we fought the indians tough men then we had outlaws and we had drought we had smallpox terrible winters cholera i bury more of my children i raised sorry to hear that sir i've seen strong men with her die under that unforgiven son that whole herd of cattle take sick and die but i've never once doubted my life here no sir when i hear about this so-called federal government sending out agents to covertly murder and control people then i start to worry i mean all right williamson is a menace and men like him are the plague but isn't a government agent a worse menace and all that symbolizes i mean you may be right sir well you're a brave man you're always gonna be welcome here but you tell your friends about east that we don't want to live like that out here and sneaking around and spying and secret missions right it's preposterous trust me sir i agree with you good but well we won't insult you any further come on bonnie we got things to do mr marston do you want to join us it's daddy's favorite pastime apart from political discourse that is what is breaking in horses come on i hear you're a pretty decent writer for a city dweller that is you're gonna need this mr marston let's see if we can put that new lasso of yours to good use that ram chance that there's a pack of odd horses nearby whoa yeah you sure have some interesting theories on what the government's doing sir ain't theories mr marston i saw the telegram marshall got from blackwater ain't exactly a state secret sent you well is he wrong i saw those men from the train the government can go to hell if you ask me those sons of and steal a coin off of dead man's eyes mr marston he's right now i don't know much about politics please paul can we just enjoy i know we're only as free as they say we are power's like a drink the more you have the more you want there are few men who can handle it there's certain things in this country a woman could do much better if you ask me i ain't gonna argue with that miss mcfarland oh there they are beauty come on go there nice and steady now hold anybody mr marston lean into it that's it calm it down let's see it boy tell me what you got boy come on come on let's go come on come on come on come on come on here we go nicely done boy let me take it from here you get back on your own horse i think that's the defectivity for the old timer like me i'll take this one back to the ranch see you later come on then let's see if you can get another one easy now what are you waiting for hang on to him yeah right let's see if you can [Music] that's it relax relax now nearly there relax on baby calm down i think that'll do it for today let's get back i like your father i'm glad he's quite a character you have a good life here the life i want for me and my family i mean we don't have a lot anymore you have enough it's one that gets so many folks in trouble it'll stop the spirit and make you poor but it's straight and it's decent there's no better night's sleep than after an honest day's work it's no wonder you look so tired then some deck must be shot at joker miss mcfarland who'd have thought you'd be such a natural in busting broncos that was fun i think you could be a fine rancher one day if you can bear to stop killing people for a living well done mr marston these are fine horses hey bonnie amos was saying some horses been spotted somewhere outside of armadillo let's go mr marston we can really do with those horses come on mr marston let's head for armadillo you never did tell me why you were never married aside from the snobbery that is you sure asked a lot i'm just surprised that's all you must have been quite a cat the fact that you're talking in the past says it all no that's not what i mean you must add some suitors that's all i'm saying i suppose here and there a ranch in the middle of hennigan's dead ain't really the place to find a husband amos he's a little well you know countryside where'd you get your heirs and graces miss mcfarland from a couple of cheap governances paul hired to save us from me and savages i'd like to talk about more than just cattle and chickens sometimes that's all and after my brother left it was up to me to become the man of the ranch he never admitted but my paw's a lot frailer than he looks you're worth too many man i know miss i'll try to take that as a compliment in many ways my wife is kind of like you miss mcfarland is that so she's always been a woman in a man's world you don't talk about her very much it's kind of painful but she's never far from my thoughts there's my boys come on mr marston easy come on let's grab them up the canyon where it narrows we'll trap them there i'll see you there miss whoa there hey whoa come on come on easy up now let's go oh there let's go load up now [Music] looks like we got the lot of them what magnificent animals they are [Music] [Applause] chase him down and bring him back come on [Applause] let's go relax [Music] easy hey whoa relax now i got you now whoa there almost got easy there you're mine now come on yourself thanks for your help today mr marston we got some fine horses you know why don't you keep that stallion as your own as a thank you from all of us thank you ma'am he's a fine animal [Music] come on come on let's go get him in there come on come on famous hey miss i got most of the horses secure and the chicken well thank you amos but it's the herd i'm worried about i know they're scattered all over the valley and beyond the weather is coming in real fast so what do you suggest damas we leave the herd out there to be scattered by the storm and ourselves left here to die without a livelihood can i help no miss if the men get caught out in that storm they're gonna die and if we lose our herd we'll all die you stupid man it doesn't sound like we're left with much of a choice then come on amos round up your men let's get the herd dang let's go we don't have much time come on that sky don't look good i'm starting to think somebody up there is conspiring against me are you a religious man not in any real sense sometimes i tell myself things happen for a reason like what brought me here was faith come and calling but nobody made my path for me we all need to look for answers somewhere some in big old books others and big old bottles of whiskey believing in some kind of divine purpose ain't gonna give me my wife and kid back past is who we are miss mcfarland there ain't no changing that faith is a luxury i can't afford we have two herds out praising different pastors we'll need to merge them and bring them all back i think we can handle that the cows get real ornery in bad weather it's more work but i'll show you how to deal with them it's going to be difficult to talk in this weather stay close we don't want to lose each other come on whoa let's go drive them over to the pasture by the old oak tree we'll merge them with the other herd [Music] i haven't seen there store like this for a while we need to be quick slow down whoa whoa come on come on easy up down um [Music] oh yeah come on oh my god they're running for the cliff let's go go [Applause] [Music] come on good work we lose them all let's round up the rest easy [Music] slow down whoa whoa let's go come on [Music] come on the weather's getting worse gotta get that hurt together [Music] you saved the herd back there you might make a decent rancher one day thank you miss mcfarland come on [Music] hello hello it's armadillo731 what is it with these things hello it's a new line hello hello sounds fun what's happening i have no idea if it's important they'll send someone down like they did with you suddenly the world is full of days yeah i remember when we first got here we used to consider people from dade county to be exotic now guys can get here from the midwest and they can do it in six days things have changed they've gotten away from me hello i don't understand it no more boy honest goodness i'm not sure i do marshall marshall marshall i just been up in the canyon spying like you said i think i seen me a couple of them rustlers i think it was the ballard twins and a couple of mexicans they up there right now well it was a group of four men rounding up mr gulch's livestock and none of them looked like any gulch's hands so yes sir right now that's sarcasm's most unbecoming eli it's gonna hold you back in life even worse than your lazy eye all right let's go you ride with us again marcin will you help me i will try it'd be my pleasure he's just [Applause] how long you been working for the government marston i don't work for the government well i got a telegram from some federal clouds in blackwater that says otherwise are you some kind of vigilante you don't look like no government boy i guess it's complicated i came because it was made impossible for me not to you sure are a tight lip some mister i guess i am i ain't gonna dig this hole no deeper ain't you all proud and superior don't forget you need us more than we need you winston folded you up like an empty person last time if i remember correct her down jonah listen to your boss jonah there's a good boy otherwise i'll put a hole in your hillbilly head and watch your tiny brain drain out i'll be honest with you marston i ain't for all this government interference believe me marshall neither am i i try to keep the federal boys happy i mean we need all the help we can get but what does a flannel mouse city boy who's never forked a bale of hay in his life know

are the mcfarlands john they're holding on but that ranch is in trouble but we dealt with the wrestling problem for now yes but that ain't enough they got greater forces working against them drew's a rancher not a businessman railroads motor cars telephones opening the world of new opportunities apparently try telling that to a farmer with no head for business or a blacksmith whose customers can buy tools for half the price out of a spalding's catalog given a man too many options will make him unhappy taking too many away or forced him to do things he shouldn't it's wrong to assume change is always good vultures might just be a dead critter marston take a look eli you too yeah [Music] no survivors here marshall man this don't look too good somebody was so busy killing people they went and dropped their gun [Music] come on keep following this road how could somebody murder innocent people like that kill a man the first time and it haunts you for days keep killing and soon and don't haunt you no more at all but you still gotta sleep at night a good bottle of hooch you'll see to that keep your eyes peeled we're looking for any sign of them abandoned four vultures this don't look

then some robbers started chasing him down like wild dogs i thought you were supposed to protect us marshall you foggy men you ain't nothing you're just a man on a government payroll taking money that

what the hell you talking about some people i have the displeasure of knowing want him dead why does that involve yeah we used to run in the game together he was once like family if this is how you treat your family i'd hate to see what you do to your enemies that was a lifetime ago but bear in mine wait who's that up there you just walk away now john i didn't kill you before but i sure as  will now get yourself down here bill you know you ain't man enough to stop me you know i don't want to kill you but i will you always did have a high opinion of yourself john dutch always said you were an

know the ranch hands have been out looking but so far they found nothing well come on let's go look for them thank you mr marston i'm sure it's nothing but i worry about the old fool come on boy come on i've got a bad feeling about this it's not like him to be away for so long don't worry we'll find him he's not as young as he used to be what if he's hurt himself your father can still handle himself just fine miss mcfarland you feel like an oak you're probably right but i can't help willian he's all i've got don't you have any brothers or sisters miss mcfarland i had six brothers but five of them died either from sickness or foolish choices and the other one he left for the east and never came back must be getting on for 10 years ago now he's a high and mighty banker in new york according to his last letter he should be here helping you and your paw i don't want his help he can live his life any way he wants but when i see those city fellers coming in on the railway all dressed up like a sore toe i fear a little for his soul he switched his saddle for a tie and that's fine i just never met a man in a tie i could trust look i think i see someone whoa there daddy what happened nothing nice wrestlers i guess maybe the baller twins that bunch and you head back to the ranch right now bet your wagon yes sir martin you watch after her i'll do that sir what could have happened to those poor men and their horses were dead too i think we should get back there as soon as we can stay with me i've got a bad feeling about this who could have done something like that your boss seemed to have an idea who it was let's just do what he says and get the wagon those damn rustlers i've got a good mind to head over to pikes facing myself i don't think that's a good idea and you're no better how many men have you killed do you really want to know it's disgusting you never met the men i killed i heard the way you talk about that gang you were in like there was some twisted morality to what you did we all have a code only some of us don't really outlaw with the code how wonderfully romantic the reluctant murderer the noble criminal there's no look mr marston the barn is on fire let's go come on try and get in through the law firm climb up the windmill get a move [Music] this thing's working [Music] somebody get them horses out [Music] he got the door open [Music] okay backpack hello you sure know how to handle yourself thanks marston yes john thanks you well you saved the ranch if you'll excuse me i i've got chores to attend to hey hold on a second over there sincerely john thank you well did all i could miss mcfarland sorry about all the damage that gang seems to really want you out of here yeah well my father fought indians i scarcely think we're gonna be frightened by some white trash white trash can be pretty frightening well they don't frighten me good john my family owes you a great debt i think you got enough debt you saved my life all i ask you is this if i get back home and get my farm started back up you'll sell me some cattle i prefer doing business with people i know of course mr marston it'd be my pleasure um well you get some rest i've got to go see how my father's bearing up the voice [Music] he's i don't have a clue all right there's gonna be something to do with that government boy we'll talk to him find out what he knows is where is he marston who who my daughter you scum where's bonnie i don't know i haven't seen her since after the fire why why because she hadn't been seen since yesterday afternoon you know i don't think i can cope if i lose another child now nobody's lost anything yet i'm sure she's fine oh mr marshall mr marshall come out come out wherever you are the hell's that hey buddy even better good day mr mcfarland get down from that horse boy or i'll shoot i wouldn't recommend that mister not if drew mcfarlane wants to see his bonnie back in one piece hey mr mcfarland there's a nice girl you got there get down from there you know part of me he's got to thinking i should just marry her myself give her a baby in that what do you want that's better i want norman deak i want him set free then you'll get your daughter back mister we don't do deals with outlaws boy yeah you do let's not waste each other's time pretending otherwise old government themselves ain't much more than a bunch of crooks this is the land of opportunity mister and i'm giving you the opportunity to get your daughter back before 15 friends of mine take out all their anger and their loneliness on her where the hell is she where is she boy bring dick up to tumbleweed in a couple hours and don't get no funny ideas or i will slit that horse throat myself you boys have a pleasant afternoon yeah what do we do we do as he says you and me marshall mr mcfarland i'll get you your daughter back i owe her that please do i'll teach you some respect for the law hurry up boy let's go quick as you can deputy make sure he's tied i'm good stay with me marston i won't let anything happen to her sir come on let's ride hard to tumbleweed come on see this is what happens when the federals interfere in our affairs are you happy now no i ain't happy at all and i already told you i ain't with the government now you say that john but the only thing i know for sure is who sent you they made me come here they gave me no choice that's your federal government mr johnson they come down here dressed as cocky as the king of diamonds talking a lot of flannel about helping us about spreading peace and civilization to the west but they brought nothing but trouble and taxes i agree with you wolves in cheap clothing all of them rob you that make you pay to have someone investigate the crime on your behalf people around here have been fooled into feeling protected when they're worse off than they were before the fellas i know don't care about people all they care about is light in their pockets why is this sorry son of a so important to them norman deke williamson right hand man in other words a glorified air reveal wait marshall i'll be back for you those standards have slipped we already filled you with blade once you love the best the kind of man who's beat enough to be second in command but too cowardly and stupid to ever be a leader don't ever use that line near your deputies you know for his sake they'd best not have laid a finger on miss mcfarland come on what is this place we're headed double weed a lonely god forsaken place some people say it's haunted it was quite a town back in its day then they built the railroad to armadillo and went clean past tumbleweed and that was that pretty soon everybody at up to the left now it's just thieves smugglers and bandits it's come like deke here oh popular spot for legends too let's try to avoid that if we can marshall i just hope you're not taking advantage of the mcfarland marston they saved my life gave me food in bed when they had no idea who i was i owe them more than i could ever repay that's just they've been through a lot well they're both vulnerable different ways i wouldn't have been running in and out of a burning barn to save their horses otherwise i know you helped just like you helped me but you got your reasons for doing it it's no secret why i'm here marshall i told you the very first time i walked into your office i trust you it's just all this business with black water and williams i don't know sometimes it's hard not to have doubts i understand i never planned to be in the london business neither how is this mess supposed to turn out sending an outlaw to do the work of a lawman that's madness ain't much difference between the two as far as i can tell there have to be rules marston even you must understand that it's easy to make up rules but there ain't much use if people don't understand why like my son if i tell him not to do something he'll do it anyway just despite if i punish him he resents me for it but if i show him why it's wrong at least he has reason not to do it again that's nonsense without laws we're nothing more than animals you're looking deep here man has worked hard in civilization your boy steps out of line you whack him he does it again whack him harder you're a good man marshall and i respect what you're trying to do from what i've seen since i've arrived here the law ain't really working criminals are like weeds marston wicks you stomp one out another one sprouts up in its place so nature replacing you know that as well as i do the problem with laws is everybody ain't get safe and watching a bunch of rich university boys in the east get to decide how a man and armadillo should live his life well maybe you're right about that kill all three of you myself i swear i can't wait for you to meet the boys come on boys over the bridge come john you'll be exchanging the prisoner for bonnie in the middle of town keep your eyes open i sincerely doubt these scum plan to play fair fair my ass you bet besides norm here is going to be my shield ain't you normal it'd be my pleasure marston lead deke into town make sure you keep a gun on that son of a i'm sure it's been nice for the boys to have a board to play with i hear those rancher girls like it in the rear maybe she won't want to go home she's been so good what are you waiting for i'm tommy feelers where's bonnie i thought we had a deal [Music] is nonsense [Music] just walk away oh my gosh [Music] we're coming [Music] you're all dead [Music] get away from her [Music] don't you lay a finger [Music] i love it bonnie are you okay i'm fine now mr marston thank you thank you what the hell took you so long stupid man well you weren't exactly helping me if you think i'm gonna lower myself by making a joke about being all tied up you got another thing coming come on let's go [Music] and i can tell you with no uncertainty that miracle cures are no laughing matter i bid you a good day sir [Laughter] mr marston good to see you how have you been keeping i'm well mr mr west dickens nigel west dickens of east sheep london new waverly new york and armadillo new austin at your service at my service yet everyone's service at the surface of science knowledge of life how you wounds much much better but then they would be would be i know a cure for all ailments mr marston ah i'm sure you do and i'm sure for just two dollars an ounce i could live forever oh but for you sir i'd do a bulk discount rate of 195 an ounce as long as you buy 100 ounces or more that's a lot of immortality ah give it up old man that's mr wes dickens to you boy give it up old man um listen marston i'm broke but this stuff is good it works i need a healthy young man like you come along and let's ride over to my newest customer at ridgewood and i'll explain while we go okay all right john let us make haste a ridgewood farm i heard about you mr west dickens and die about you get back on the road we'll have nothing

explain the fine factor in which you find me last time you saw me i was knocking the death door you should thank the doctor for that i reckon you were acting it up worse than it was i can't john a more convincing fellow there has never been and so should you eat there iago or cassio i don't like the sound of that marketplace our product must stand out and how does this involve me we're going to use your god-given i'm really starting to regret that who off at the outskirts of ridgewood that way it all looked like we came together once i'm set up saunter nonchalantly into a cloud that is sure

are you sir i'm all right i met up with your friend seth oh seth of the dead yes interesting fellow you don't meet many men these days with the moral fortitude to cut straight to the chase like that do you thankfully not mr west dickens yes a contemporary society is remarkably harsh on professional exhumers but did you know that in ancient egypt it was an art form valued more highly than literature i believe seth comes from that school of thought how very interesting look you're talking more about our plan ah your plan dear boy your plan i am merely the help not mercifully the arbiter of wisdom what you are dear boy is the man whose life i've saved twice now a man who sells lies and deceit to unwitting people a man who if he doesn't help me i won't think twice about putting a bullet through his skull feeding to the vultures myself how you see mr marston you have the exterior of a violet man but the soul of an angel and that is what i think i cherish most about you that's what i thought but before we can attend to your particular problems um we need some extra lubricant to oil the machinery of business and this being america that lubricant with which we concern ourselves is money money what are you talking about we need weapons plate for the wagon extra hands and i need some danger money so let's sell some more of these cures some cures around here do you want to see me lynched no the sport of kings racing my friend the sport of kings a noble activity without reproach exactly the kind of activity where a lying cheating degenerate like myself can

help me you'll be sorry friends [Laughter] sure somewhere between the threatening stare and the soldier's arm to the teeth yeah yeah you had me welcome to mexico amigo [Music] let's call me drink and then we'll talk my name is capitan vicente de santa john marston my country is in pain john master terrible pain the rebels have seized the people by their throat and destroy a way of life i'm no politician sir and i am no soldier but we are both beholding to our time a brave man perhaps you have heard of him coronel he's trying to preserve the order in our province to keep our civilization alive it is tough the people are confused and usually swayed sometimes in the service of what is right you gotta do terrible things it breaks my heart i also am no moralist sir i wish i enjoy your freedoms mr marston i'm trying to find a man an american an outlaw named bill williamson i believe he came here to seek protection from another outlaw named javier esquela you're no mortalist but you hunt outlaws so seen you heard anything of these men i am the government or what is left of it outlaws seek each other they are possibly hiding with thieves and killers who pose as freedom fighters in the hills around here they're united under one trailer named abraham reyes where could i find this race if i knew i would be there hunting him with everything that is true within me reyes finds you like cholera [Laughter] something like that but it's possible though my men are trying to lure him into a trap possibly you can ride with us and if everything goes okay i'm sure the coronel will help you okay mamamoos are you going to ride with me [Music] hold on tight we're in a hurry you did not expect such a warm welcome from the mexican army i can see i didn't know what to expect i hadn't even crossed the border and i was being shot at you will hear a lot of words like thailand fresh here words are the peasants have been taught but do not understand meaningless words the army is suffering a crisis of reputation even i've heard about the colonel down here he's not famous for his compassion this is the point how do you make corona do you know him no like a papaya he just repeat lies you heard baby allende is a good man a strong man he carries the weight of a million problems on his shoulders am i supposed to feel him you gringos are so quick to touch you not to talk badly of other people because it makes you feel better about yourselves maybe you should look in the middle you're the one talking about this and i ain't here to make judgment on the way of your government i've got enough problems with my own right now this isn't america's in your mars we are poor dryness must take a different point what is better warm cowboy in his mexican friend bill williamson's a fella i used to know and javier esquela well i knew him too what do you mean you know these men we was friends once part of a past i can't seem to get rid of the past is all that's real my friend they cannot be erased that is the problem with the people here they spend too much time dreaming about imaginary futures i know i can't change the past but i'm sure gonna do something my country is full of american criminals mostly in the service of the rebel police mexico is an easy place for men to lose himself whether he wants to get lost or not hopefully not too easy i ain't got much time to find these men there must be a high price on their heads the highest price can i ask how much i'm not getting paid it's it's a long story we're being made to do this i will never understand you americans we need we have a system of law in mexico senor and we do not tolerate people who think they can run with their own however if you help us we help you no one hides from colorella for long this rebellion it is a disease that is killing this country don't the people have the right to stand up for themselves the right the right don't you throw silly ideas at me what do you know about the rights of the mexican people very little i'm just saying there must be something behind this rebellion although you was behind us in your mouth nice insidious lies the peasants are stupid and like cows they can be heard it only takes a few men to move many maybe they've just had enough of being called stupid you're talking about things you don't understand if you ask me something i'm gonna give you an answer are you a revolutionary is that why you're here i was once i suppose in a twisted kind of way i thought i could change something if i fought harder change what i don't know maybe that was the problem evolution's always selfish there is nothing for greed and ego individuals putting their own needs above those it is people fighting for change when they have no idea what change is if you're a poor man who's been beat down all his life any change is going to seem good what you think that overthrowing the government is going to make a poor man rich if you're not helping them it's only natural they're going to look for someone else who will for a tired revolutionary you are very naive what do you want us to do walk around giving out money to every poor person and make what a terrible idea first they need to look at why they're poor then they need to go out and do some work rather than sitting on their gurus talking about freedom who's this man we're looking for the leader of the rebels he's a traitor a lion a coward and a sinner a hero who has done nothing respect for the i looked this morning than i ever would with a pathetic warmth that's a nice image he is from a rich family a man born in a golden cradle who pretends to fight for the poor he's taking advantage of the ignorant and the weak mind you must be telling the people something they want to hear of course all that bastard does is standing about don't giving speeches it is easy to make promises you can never keep it takes more than a few promises to build an army reyes wants power nothing else he doesn't care about anybody by himself listen up for now are you ready ready for what we will lure the rebels a trap there's a train leaving to parosa soon we're going to escort it they will think it's a supply train they have no supply son very clever we must throw the rat around if there's some bait they can reduce come on i hope you know how to use so so hello there's more on there coming from the east uh oh it is that's why you ain't gone so then so we did it so [Music] very pleased is [Applause] you're gonna have to do something what you have to go out there and start the train before it crosses the bridge the train is getting away come on oh uh wow [Applause] [Music] the man i spoke to you off a friend of mexico hello sir hello ringo so you are the bounty hunter huh have you found your prey yet no sir ah perhaps you come to hunt me huh your country loves to make trouble in mine perhaps but it isn't so ah perhaps i should tie you to a horse and let it drag you around town or let the dogs fight you huh then see what you say i'd say the same thing i'm here to bring two men to justice nothing more your politics or ideas of entertainment are not my concern let me ask you this sir do you know anything of the men i'm looking for escuela is from this province his uh father was a borracho a drunk worked as a laborer on land cultivated by my uncle men like that are natural allies for reyes my people have lived and worked here for a hundred years we brought civilization and these people these monkeys they're spicers we brought them god and they turned their back on him now i fight to help them from themselves to save them from themselves i see in their faces that they would kill me if they could they see only a tyrant that is the way it is these people need a ruler well sorry to hear that sorry i'd be sorry it is a way of mankind a fight between two forces okay what will be will be but i know one thing said no marston force force must be used if you are to have your own way i'm sure now perhaps you can uh do me a favor while i find these men for you after we find the men then i'll help in any way i can ah that's that that you are no position to negotiate now a bunch of desirious men are fighting at the soro assual now you head there and you lend your support follow me we must hurry so i finally met your great leader he certainly lives up to his reputation why would you know about leadership only that most can't handle power it is easy to criticize power when you have never had it yourself maybe it is because you have never been in the presence of a strong man before i have seen the pictures of your country in the newspapers men ringing and decorating themselves like women vanity is the legacy the british left behind look i don't know the fella just say it that's how he treats his own men coronella controls any situation he's in because he knows that situation can never be allowed to control him it is what a leader must do in any case you had not noticed we're fighting a war we're all under a lot of pressure pressure to find young girls that colonel needs recreation like everyone else he does not have time to court women he's waging a war on ignorance and it's impatient for victory he's trying to inspire wisdom in those more stupid than himself my men left some time ago we're ready late come on let's see if you can write [Music]

an american in tow a big american emilio estaba cone uh grind the americano jono say no again i got that but they do have his sister emilio's i mean she's a fine young woman a teacher a human being not the clothed vermin so many people seem to have turned into tell them i'm sorry when a man's family is involved you need a little more enthusiasm than mere apologies i have enough worries sir this man's problems pain me but they're not quite my own those who sit on the fence make a choice in their own way don't you think mr marston of course and what about you ricketts a man living in the past man who ran away from home what choice did you make i'll tell you what choice i made i'm a fighter sir and i'll fight to the end i think we should get going i'm gonna take the train you can come with me or right ahead to el matadero i've been hearing some things about you john marston really that perhaps you're more in need of my help than i thought is that so that some recent encounters with this bill williamson fella haven't gone exactly in your favor funny how everyone seems to know my business but nothing about the men i'm looking for it isn't easy getting the locals to talk so it's the only way to travel so they keep telling me we'll get off at casa madrigato and ride from there when we get there [Music] there should be some horses for us across the way come on first stop helmet to daryl we need to find a man called carlos i was told he could help us we'll ask around when we get there but we don't want to draw attention see if you can keep your gun holstered for once you're the hero around here mr ricketts not me what does the army want with this luisa girl anyway she's a rebel and apparently close to their leader reyes she's a pretty young thing that's normally reason enough for olynyk so i've heard she's a good woman a teacher if they lay a finger on her i swear i'll feed those bastards their balls here we are looks kind of sleepy don't it all right let's find his carlos guy carlos see we're here for luisa she's still being held up in the caves yes she's still up there who's the cowboy we're here to help you i can distract the guards you and the gringo can get

on boy poor girl's barely alive right let's see if we can all get out of here in one piece [Music] foreign i need to get out of here hurry before they send more guards why not no jets looks like carlos left us some horses come on let's go before any more of them show up come on so [Applause] come on [Music] big day looking bueno [Music] yeah i hope he's coming i don't want to wait longer than we need to [Music] there he is talk about cutting it fine lisa gracias thank you for saving me you're good man friends of the people of this land was someone named harvey esque one of the men holding you no i don't know i don't think so but i remember that name from prison bad people spoke of him i told you johnny's still in mexico okay then i guess we'll keep looking [Music] [Music] what's going on here captain to santa just a little recruitment nothing for you to be concerned about you boys using women's soldiers now our costumes are none of your concern apparently not santa concito fantastic i love patriots ah he's like a muslim you're here to fight the war at least i'll make a picture of you yet i hope so anywhere those men oh yes i heard they were riding with reyes i wanted to talk to you about it tell him what i wanted his excellency el coronel would like to employ you in escorting a train down rival country the job is dangerous well you'll have the honor of man another patriot of knowing that you said mexico in her fight against forces that would destroy our society how much you offer 20 000 pesos and information as to the whereabouts of javier okay then mexico loves you listen she has a funny way of showing it hurry we must go ah [Music] oh it looks like it is me and you again gringo and there was me thinking my dance card was full what do you mean you just said it's a pleasure to see such a noble patriot at work your sarcasm is childish and pathetic this is an important assignment our orders are to deliver these munitions to chuparosa they will help to finally crush the rebels i hate to break it to you captain but i think you're gonna need a lot more than this i know most of the supplies are already in chupa rosa we will deliver them all by train to our base camp in yes coronas our forces are close to establishing control in that region why didn't decide to come with us why do you think because he is hardly a soldier i'm sure he has other important business like mailing letters and sweeping floors and flirting with firemen he fought with me that pathetic little errand boy i did not see him fight without me we would have lost the battle he knows less than nothing on how to lead men yet he's the colonel's second in command that is a good job you are a funny man gringo is santa licks the colonel's boots and plays with his waiter friend that is all i am one of the few men he respects is that right you and him have something special do you the colonel needs a bae a woman he cannot am i right gringo fun burning people's homes killing innocent people that's your idea fun a woman picks up a rifle when a child picks up a rifle they become soldiers those are the rules of war they my rule so you would allow a woman to shoot me that makes you an idiot not a gentleman does it seem quiet do you i don't know you tell me we have not seen a single rebel yet i'd say that's a good thing wouldn't you come on it's gonna take more than one oh that was close i don't know this doesn't feel right to me we're on our way to escort a trade through rebel-held country an ambush feels about right to me i knew i had not seen these men before they are new recruits people have been talking about the rebels planning a large attack if these supplies are so important why have we been given so few soldiers don't ask me you're the captain i thought you were supposed to be fearless i am fearless but not brainless there is something wrong i feel it maybe you just need to take a piss or something the colonel told me that the santa had praised my actions in torque and called me a hero he asked for me to be given this important assignment why would he do that the cabral hates me yeah but doesn't everybody hate you maybe we should turn back poor rebels you ain't gonna leave here walking fred yes it seems to be on schedule at least one thing is going right for us i agree we ain't off to a good start you shoot well gringo tell me something what is your weapon of choice what do you mean oh my friend your belt is full of weapons which is your favorite for attacking a man you ain't right in the head captain do you want to know what mine is not particularly truth you're ridiculous truth nothing hurts a traitor more than the knowledge his enemy fights for something true and noble we are close to chuparrosa now i still have a bad feeling about this tell me why are you here what did they promise you 20 000 pesos in javier esquela that is a lot of promises do you know where israel is you think i am going to tell you that before you have fulfilled your obligations do not take me for a fool i've given you no reason not to trust me you must understand why we are suspicious of you most american vigilantes come here to help the rivers it is strange you have chosen to work for the army i'm not working for you how many times do i have to say this call it what you want gringo we are exchanging favors then i ain't seen many favors come my way yet abraham reyes is trying hard to recruit gringos to fight for him his propaganda is everywhere he promises women gold and of course you've got money and the chance to interfere in business that is not your own how can any american resist i've done everything you've asked of me if belinda doesn't give me escuela and williamson after this i think it's best i go ask the rebels directly is that the threat beware you are only alive right now because of me here we are at last [Music] [Music] i do not think we have seen the last of the rebels new recruits can't win a fight like this i need you to mend the gatling goal i ain't the soldier here captain do not question me gringo just do as i say [Music] your position now i hope you know how to use that bond can't be that hard just point and pull the trigger water we will all pick you don't worry captain i've used one of these before for a cold-hearted killer you're an anxious son of a ain't you we have already been ambushed our spot is made up of new recruits and the two men that hates the most i think it is right to be anxious yeah well i wasn't exactly expecting a pleasant picnic by the seaside myself so look do you see them keep them away from um he wants it we are nearing the town now oh from the rear god so so um god [Music] i think that's all of this we do not have to go the base camp is just at the top of the hill that was madness you did well from patrick very well whatever i get that promised you in return you have earned me i don't think the santa expected us to come back from this did you want to kill him or should i no until i find escuela he's more used to me a lot [Music] breakfast thank you for your efforts the escort was a success at least some of your men survived i didn't think to save myself my whole life i have dreamed of a glorious day vamos rapido these socialist pigs cannot be allowed to win [Applause] [Music] gentlemen gentlemen i thank you oh yeah hey mr marston how you keeping sir

[Music] [Applause] [Music] let us make it [Applause] [Music] me hey senor you want trouble friend tranquilo amigo [Music] mercy i knew you would come thanks for the welcoming committee i'm sorry we cannot be too careful the world is very dangerous especially when you greet it with a gun please mr marston my father was killed yesterday the army found him and accused him of treason they cut out his heart and fed it to their dogs agenda did this then he took the honor of two young girls i'm sorry to hear that luisa my father must not die in vain his death must mean something it'll mean that war is brutal and unnecessary and good people die and that's all it will mean that is not enough well you know i'll do whatever i can but i have problems of my own we all have problems this is about the people my father died for his people for these men and for millions like them that they may be free while there are guns and money there won't be any freedom louisa mr marston the movement is on the brink of great victory agenda knows this and has sent for reinforcements abraham reyes asked personally that you stop them reaching escalara they are coming by the old trail you must ambush them i have my own family to worry about mr marston i have lost my father my mother is in the united states my sister has fled i have no family just because please good actions make you a good man then i'm doomed but i will help you out of respect for your loss thank you mr marston thank you come on the army convoy is already on its way i'm sorry about your father his death must not be in pain now we shall fight even harder to win power for abraham i admire your devotion he is a true revolutionary a man who puts the needs of others before his own a man who fights out of love rather than hate but you know this already i heard about the battle at chuparrosa how he killed nearly a hundred soldiers to save your life it'll go down in legend i'm sure of that can i trust you mr marshall and what what you have done so much for me and my family but i still can't forgive you for helping ayendy for what you did to the rebels i'm here for two men that's it not to take sides and certainly not to fight a war that isn't mine it makes no sense you make a choice by not making a choice you know linda betrayed i saw him do bad things things that disgust even me one day i will cut his heart out me you him we're all shooting people don't really seem like we're so very different the difference is why mr marston the ideals we hold there can never be revolution without blood until people forget what they're shooting for and just enjoy killing for its own sake you americans forget too quickly that is the problem if it wasn't for your revolution you should be making tea for the english at least we knew where we stood it's more difficult to understand why your own people treat you like it is the same here we thought of the spanish we thought of the french we even fought off the americans finally mexico won its independence and all we've done since then is fight each other at least you're keeping up tradition it will end when abraham takes control when the spanish left we renamed this province new paradise one day it will live up to its name why do you doubt our revolution so much mr marston i guess i can't pretend to understand your country's politics but you think we are fighting for nothing take no notice of me i ain't got much faith in power just now that is exactly why we must continue to fight for change nothing ever really changed you are a man who has lost his spirit no doubt i once believed it was possible to make a difference i mean i'm chasing they did too then if we spilled enough blood we could change the way people think revolutions are always one with blood and after the fighting's done free them we ain't never free be honest with yourself and you will be free that must be what i've been getting wrong all this year thank you again for helping my mother and miranda to escape if only i'd sent my father as well you did everything you could they know nothing of my father's death they feel terrible but it isn't safe for them here anymore after we win they can return to a new mexico what about you i will stay and fight i am ready to die if necessary emilia too we are a close family do you have children mr marston i have a son at home and a daughter in heaven is he looking after your wife i hope so he's not much younger than you but i don't know he's still young we tried to protect him give him a gentler childhood than what we had guess i failed that what is his name jack jack marston i ain't been much of a father we tried to hide the bad from him growing up but he saw things he should children see more than you think it is not for now the army convoy will be coming from the east we going to steal their supplies no destroy them and kill everyone abraham wants to send a message you have experience with explosives a little it's been a long time good because we do not you will man that that's the neighbor my men are waiting there for us they will also need your help setting up the dynamite i'll do my best we will do this for my father john there they are [Music] these men will help you rig dynamite on the road please tell them where to place it i'll be waiting up above watching for the wagons okay follow me gentlemen start here [Music] and here wait we must do these now [Music] [Applause] another one here [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] good i am glad you are here to help us they are coming get ready john look they are coming [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music] thank you mr marston we are a step closer to power my father would be very proud i hope it was worth it i must return to campo mirada meet me there when you can i will do my best to return the favor john john thank god you have come that wretched animal that santa has been sent to oversee a massacre come we must stop him and finally kill that vermin and all of again this other followers go now my men will show you the way i will stay with the town it ain't right what happened to her father she's a brave girl she can fight as well as any man she ain't the only woman i've seen fighting for reyes yes women even children everybody must become a soldier if we are to win this war that's a lot to sacrifice i just hope it's worth it it is better tonight free and leave as slaves were you a soldier once a soldier no i was never much good at taking orders so where are you i guess some banks ain't easy to get into on weekends it was impressive what you did at the bridge destroying that convoy the army is getting weaker by the day i'm sure there's more supplies where those came from we will destroy those two again they stare at making mistakes we are closer to victory than you think we will speak when we get there we must save our energy all right let's hold up here a minute [Music] tell your man not to open fire till i make a move we don't want to give him a chance to escape and leave desanti to me i need him a lot we will wait for your list come on quick [Music] stop joking around [Music] [Music] get back here you snake [Music] [Music] you're angry i can understand that spare me and i will make you a rich man please we can come to an agreement you oh pig go back to your country where is javier a squad wait wait okay all right hurry up and kill me oh just let me go okay can we kill this piece of now senor or would you like to pleasure yourself you are the better man do it compadre he's all yours fellas i got what i need hey it is done come on now we find your friend are you crazy we cannot stop now yeah thank you compadre it should really have been you no keep moving i

army is with our leaders we must move on again now before it's too late first you need to help me find javier esquela we was friends once long time ago not anymore old friends make their worst enemies you're telling me is known in this province he was a revolutionary one but then he went to your country now they say he kills for anybody who will pay that sounds about right [Music] come on come on what are you doing this place is deserted is it always this quiet no but maybe the girls are all occupied [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] hey you lady where's javier esquela javier escuela he hasn't been seen around here in months you shot up this place for him huh i wouldn't spit on him if he was on fire i don't blame you but captain desantis said he was here and you believe him you must be more stupid than you look go shoot up some places thank you where is abraham reyes here amigo here well well well look who it is the american bandit term bounty hunter who is about to win the mexican revolution i don't know about that mister no but i do mr john marston i do a man like you or me with with just a few such men i tell you i could rule the entire country hey set my people free [Applause] [Music] their energies is like food to me i feel i was sent for them and they were sent to me good for you when i ruled these people i shall be fair and judicious and wise how so you ask very simple i know these people i know this lang in short i can make them better it must be pleasant to be a man so it won with his destiny i you know i don't do it for myself john marston i do it for my people well exactly sarcasm my friend should be beneath a man such as you don't you think very little is beneath a man such as me okay well well in that case i assume a little robbery will be a pleasant day's work all in a good cause of course come my brother let us strike while the iron is hot follow me we must hurry let's go you must tell me marge young are my sources correct have you come to mexico to murder your two best friends not exactly we were friends once a lot's changed since then now that we are friends i hope you will give me some warning if you get a sudden nurse to kill me you'll be the first to know when i kill you i promise so where are they who williamson and escuela i'm not sure exactly where they are definitely in mexico that much i know already you told me you found them and i whip oh watch what you're writing if i find out you're lying to me reyes you'll really see the man i used to be i will give you your friends i promise just give me time so how did you meet this willian song in escueja we ran in the same game together under a fella called dutch we were all bad kids lost angry and forgotten he kind of saved us and turned you into criminals dutch didn't see us that way we robbed banks stole from the rich and we gave the money to people who needed it more so he was a revolutionary too like me i suppose he saw that the system of power was rotten the good people had been crushed for too long and he believed that change could only succeed if it was brutal and relentless make america what he felt it was supposed to be i like this guy i don't know but i gotta find him once i'm done with them too in the end he went insane lost faith in everything and everyone you have quite a story john marston i really am a little jealous jealous of this poetic potential i mean it won't make an excellent corridor a bullfight a musical tribute to a heroic man and their great deeds there are over a hundred reading about me remind me to stay away from men with guitars in a country where most people cannot read the newspaper song is a powerful means of communication we do what we can to battle the lies and propaganda of the government i know i've seen your posters in the capital they are already talking about my legendary escape from el presidio how i fought off a thousand mexican soldiers with my bare hands finally the people have the truth i have to know what did you think of agustin i saw enough to know he ain't a good man it is bad enough he beats the people he's forced to protect but it is worse that he enjoys it something must have made him that way coward this made him that way my friend that and sanchez of course ignacio sanchez our country's kind and generous dictator everything comes from him it is like a father who pisses some and then his son takes his dog outside and rapes it that's a very specific example how do you say uh a puppet everything he does is controlled by sanchez in america they told us sanchez was making things better here pinche propaganda he talks about economic reform about how this is a new golden age for mexican people but look around you the people are poorer than ever agenda is nothing more than a perrito but what a little bit that you're slowing down not for now ahead we must hurry the train will be leaving soon what's on that train that's so important i received the information that the army is transporting a vast quantity of supplies to distribute to their forces do we have a plan i will explain when we get there but those supplies won't be arriving i figured as much today again they will pay a high price for his treason [Music] so listen this train is filled with valuable supplies we need but it's also filled with government troops we'll set up a very loud distraction you can board the train and then you can disconnect the army cars huh okay okay but listen we've got to get this done before the train rolls out of the station you make it sound so easy well did i not promise you fun times amigo there are too many soldiers we must surprise them here take this knife you can use it to kill the guards quietly wait until i distract them then get on that train as fast as you can john [Applause] is uh [Music] um [Music] you want me now donald trump [Music] listen on to the next one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] you move like a cat onto that train magnificent go ahead and blow the armored car and take whatever you need my brother come on john get those explosives we must hurry [Music] will be sending more soldiers [Music] hold on [Music] [Music] maybe agenda has another gift for us so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh not a bad day of robbing the establishment to give to the poor hey mr marston very noble i'm sure but i need to know where williamson and esquaila are hold up all in good time amigo i'm off to deliver these goods i see you back at the ranch oh my spies tell me they soon will have the information you need [Music] [Music] what would your most loyal follower luisa say about that who louisa the girl from campo morata all right a gentleman never tells but she was a most wonderful er i just say she was incredible let me tell you something i strongly recommend her you take her when you have the chance my brother she thinks she's your wife my wife these peasant girls they believe everywhere a fellow says so naive it's really quite charming i love peasants don't you love persons i love them they have such purity are you gonna marry her marry a pesse my dear boy don't be absurd i'm going to be the next president of mexico my wife will meet ambassadors kings other great men the very thought that i would marry some peasant girl with a tight gun and the hands of a farmer well i really don't think so my mother get your luck with it with turning her grave interesting mm-hmm but come on let's run i've got an amazing present for you my brother i guess the man you seek together we will bring them to justice let's go let's go john today we will both have victory oh my brother i just received word of your fight with agendas finally the santa is dead why did you not kill him yourself when my man gave you the chance i could see they wanted it more than i did santa had given me what i needed or i thought he had a lot of young boys will sleep safer in their beds now santa was only following orders he was dumb and loyal to his awful master but that's all he wants where are they abraham they are at a presidio junk can you believe it the place we first met the scene of one of my greatest victories over agendas traders you could not write a better story it's a story i want to finish it is a story we both want to finish my brother if my rebels can take a presidio then we can move on escalate the revolution is happening john are you sure they're there escuela ann williamson javiel escueja is there that much i am sure of i don't know about williamson escuela will do for now i am told they paid agenda to hide them they have been in his protection since you arrived in mexico you see you should have trusted your brother around then you can start making me feel bad immediately after you thank me for everything i've done for you amigo i knew i had heard the name before he is from this province they tell me he was once a notorious bounty hunter and also one of the early revolutionaries that sounds about right all before my rebellious urges took hold of course i think i was too traveling in europe at the time i was living in madrid with the ambassador's wife that sounds about right as well escuela was always a torn man cynic who desperately wanted to be a romantic whereas romantic who wants to be a senior bob here would die fighting for what he believed in he had a lot of passion but no love although he really admired dutch of course but then we all did he was the leader of your little group of fortune hunters when dutch started falling apart and hit javier harder than any of them he went crazy it was like the one thing he'd ever believed in turned out to be a frog you talk about him only it ain't exactly the fondness he was close once but he never cared for me or anybody else not any of his so-called brothers he left me to die and he had a chance to save him and didn't he teach you any spanish during all this time you were together i remember capron being used a lot well now you get to pay that coward a surprise visit i ain't here for revenge i just need him and williams so who was that girl back there another loyal supporter a free mate you want a name you can't even remember the name of the girl you're married have you ever known power junk i'm a semi-literate farmer and hired killer i ain't in the power game and you will never have the knowledge that any woman will bear your child and for her it will be an honor i've known about enough bastards without making too many more of my own a man like me cannot be with just one woman it would be an injustice to the people i have devoted my life to serve you have an interesting way of serving the people kind of like a national jiggler i owe it to the future of mexico to breed my brother if i can get nobody flowing through the veins of peasants can you imagine how great this country can be an army of reyes of kings i wish i'd never asked it ain't exactly been a vacation why are you talking like this is already over i don't know one way or another this might be the end what do you think of the mexican people i ain't sure some of them been kind but a lot of them tried to kill me come my brother i know what you americans call us racers sun greeners pepper guts or land of immigrants you don't like foreigners very much i don't care who a man is what he does or where he's from if he treats me right i'll do the same it's that simple for you isn't it you will make a fine socialist what about the chinese workers here i hear you ain't exactly made them very welcome that is different they are an inferior race you have all the makings of a great leader abraham [Music] the revolution is gaining momentum do you have any idea how many times i've thought about the day i will march into escalera and storm allende's mansion i think i have some idea soon it will be me sleeping on those silk sheets and the colonel lying with the cucarachas and what i've seen of olyn day you might want to wash those sheets you might be right my friend do you really think a revolution can work do you have enough men revolution begins with one person junk one person ain't gonna defeat the mexican army the poor are many and together we are strong they are ready to fight if it does work it will if it does work and you take down a linde what then i will give the greatest speech of my life but after all the fighting and all the speeches are over what will you do i will march on the capital and take on sanchez himself all right when mexico is yours you have all the power you desire what will you do with it like any great leader my brother i will delegate i have to say i'm not usually in favor of american interference but it will be sad to see you go i ain't going nowhere till i have bill williams what will you do when this is over i want to go home work my land and grow old with my wife that is hard for me to imagine it's hard for me too but i've pulled this trigger too many times now i'm getting tired well get ready to pull it a few more times and the presidio will be heavily guarded oh i think i got a few more left in me maybe one day you can return to mexico like lando ricketts a famous outlaw come to die in the sunshine i can always use a cynical american renegade on my staff i'll bear that mud let's not talk for a while my friend you should take some time to think about what it means to be heroes this is our time my mail will launch a ruse attack on the side entrance today four meanwhile jew my american friend will drive this wagon at a front gate and jump off when you're close he's been packed with five crates of tnt that sounds crazy how long's the fuse yes like i say fun times it's plenty long enough i think i see you in there [Music] good luck my brother we will be right behind you um [Music] [Applause] we will deal with this yes come on i just want to talk hello old friend it's been a long time hello brother it's uh good to see you i

dutch torches in colombia i can take you straight to him hmm you left me to die to save your own skin and now you expect me to care about you you got it all wrong brother i've always loved you even

[Music] i'm here to see mr ross 107 109. edgar ross 113. upstairs on the right 1 14 115 116 117 mr marston so glad to see you how was your journey where's my wife and son being well looked after well looked after i want to see him mr ross wants to speak with you we've had some important developments you want me to take out a gun and blow a hole in your head right here right now you want that mr marston you want that mr marston i ask you to calm down why why i did what you asked i got you williamson and escuela it's over stop playing games with me no one's playing games with you mr marston but if we were to play some games there'd be some interesting ones we could play thanks sir like hanging you for murder or confiscating all your property like that little farm of yours or or having you put an electric chair those are the sort of games we could play but we choose to play a different game so calm down and play along with us where's my wife you know i forget but i hear it's very nice this time of year mr marston please i've never insulted your meager intelligence do not insult mine we've done this little deal for your freedom in exchange for all your men from your old gang you gave us williamson and escuela we still don't have vanderlin but now we know where he is then go and shoot him no sir i want you to shoot him for me and then i'll let you be the last thing i want to do is make martyrs out of all these people he could be killed by some petty squabble by another lowlife we believe vanderlin just holed up with a group of renegades near the wreck of the serendipity riverboat another group of renegades obviously the first group your group has shall we say been disbanded anyway mr florida mr marston shall we go oh mr marston your wife and son are doing well let's both try to ensure things stay that way okay after you sir oh mr marston one more thing this is for you you're too kind see i have nothing but your best interest at heart let's hope it doesn't go off by mistake 343. i have a patent for that sir this is an outrage ah mr marston you're alive hello wes dickens i thought you were headed to peak king um so did i so did i in a long story but now it seems i'm being put under arrest and charged with narcotic possession or some other such nonsense ross haven't released this man why because he's a harmless old fraud the kind of man that built this country and because he helped me get williamson did you hear that officer the man's a hero let him go come on marston moral degeneracy waits for no man let's hurry along 344 345 347 348 three all right mr fordham onward isn't this something lawmakers and lawbreakers working together for the good of civilization like you always say sir the higher the stakes the smarter you have to play the game i can't imagine i ever said anything quite so right in any case i'm not sure mr marston would agree with us unfortunately mr marston isn't broad-minded enough to appreciate the unique opportunity we're offering him son of a best watch your damn mouth and it's strange you should say that mr marston because according to my files you are the fourth son now what else can i recall from the files let's see you killed hundreds of innocent people you've robbed at least 40 banks that we're aware of they told us there was a prize when you got to 50. i'm glad this is all such a joke to you i want my family and i'm sure all the men you murdered one of their families too come now you're stupid but you're not that stupid we both know how this has to be and it could be all over today as soon as we find dutch vandalism you can go back home and play being a farmer again or whatever else you've been pretending to do for the last few years first it was bill now it's dutch after dutch it'll be somebody else where does it end it ends when we say it ends you're in no position to make demands like you will you don't just walk away from that buy a few chickens and make it all disappear you should be dead or riding in a jail cell by now we are giving you a chance of new life a chance at redemption you can't erase your past mr marston but we can she's running well sir such an elegant way to travel what do you think of this automobile mr marston slow but so convenient and reliable are you comfortable no you see this mr fordham the brooding cowboy there aren't many of these left you know a bit of a cliche admittedly but still a dying breed like the buffalo just as dumb but not quite as noble they move most cows by rail these days i hear know where i'm from they don't but you aren't from anywhere a new dawn is breaking mr marston this is the age of the machine and soon we'll all be living on the moon maybe this is the future anything is possible finally this god forsaken land is entering the 20th century prosperity has arrived in the form of like you i don't understand you people the trappings of progress are here for the taking and you're too stubborn to take them it's not far now the old serendipity wreck has been used as an occasional criminal hideout for years we were informed that vanderlin and his gang are making camp we'll stop on the cliff above and you and agent fordham will go on foot i'll stay with the vehicle and keep watch then you'll do as i say marston don't try anything stupid oh i think he knows what's at stake don't you mr marston let's play dutch and finish this come on then marston you're with me [Music] keep quiet and stay close yes sir vanderland is the priority we go in take him down get the hell out of here quick and clean you leave dutch to me we don't want you getting that suit dirty if you step out of line even once well i hope you're aware of the consequences seems real quiet don't you think you tell me maybe dutch caught wind of things then inform it better not have been lying to us keep your eyes open they are open i don't see nothing yeah it doesn't feel right this place is usually teeming with low lights [Music] someone up there you go investigate i'll keep watch here [Music] go on those screams are coming from somewhere [Music] over here i found him good god that's her informant what the hell's going on here it's a trap  marston you'll have to carry this man i don't think he can walk we need to clear over there [Music] stop shooting at me my word i guess this ain't gonna end well for someone surrender now let's keep moving unbelievable [Applause] this [Music] stay with me [Music] come on follow me [Music] [Music] [Music] who's this what in god's name is going on marston lift this fellow into the back seat put him in the car so we can get out of here let's go there might be more of them christ alive what the hell happened down there it was a trap they were waiting for us and who is this savage a prisoner this is the informant sir do you speak english uh yeah yes he does sir he's the informant gnostus get snarky with me fordham we found him tied up on the boat and they jumped us nice you help us out hell of a plan sending in two men to take on an entire gang of outlaws especially when one of them's an office clerk or social secretary or some sort you shut your mouth [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on not now what's wrong i don't know the motor just gave out well fix it you fool we need to get this man to a doctor of course sir it's touches men monster we'll hold them up he'll fix that damn engine stay with me [Music] foreign [Music] i can't see any more fordham are we ready yes sir i think so come on let's get back to blackwater damn that was close we're lucky to be alive i'm beginning to see why mr marston here has made it to such a rifled age you'll make me blush with all these kind words so much for this automobile yours but this is the future god help us all it's not the automobile the bad workman shouldn't blame his tools perhaps if mr fordham maneuvered it with a little more finesse i was trying to escape an ambush sir even if it was running fine then still caught us i can walk faster than this piece of crap give me a horse any day so what now do i get to see my family where is dutch vanderlin i don't know in that case oh boy no you don't get to see your family it's a fairly simple agreement mr marston even for a man as devoid of intellect as yourself if you'd like me to explain it to you again i'd be more than willing no you said enough we'll find vanderlaan soon enough for now however i suggest we call it a day so how does it feel taking a man's wife and child brother does it make you feel good how does it feel to kill hundreds of men in cold blood you're a cow you're a murderer actions have consequences mr marston come now try to look on the bright side the bright side there ain't no bright side your family is enjoying a much needed vacation and in far more luxurious surroundings than those to which they are accustomed i assure you soon you will be able to start a new life together absolved of all your sins i can think of far more upsetting alternatives we should take the ending to professor mcdougall see what he can get out of them good idea sir i just can't communicate with them here we are thank god for that so this is the office of an anthropologist named mcdougall he was thrown out of yale for a degeneracy we should tell you something indeed but he's been helping us deal with the natives in this area they see him and they presume we're all idiot academics huh give me a hand here marston ah mr ross mr fordham good day good day what i know what's going on here kid got shot in the leg beat up pretty good we'll send a doctor now mcdougall um need information from this fellow about dutch vanderlund can you see what you can find out for us do my best make sure you do professor mcdougall has been a good friend of the us government mr marston just like you why don't you see if you can help him in his study of the native problem in this county that's a [Music] what's good on with you what a pleasant surprise mr marston an informer just told us some interesting news our mutual friend mr vanderlin is about to pay call on his bank manager what do you say to having a little financial discussion with the fella this way let's get up on the roof we'll have a clear shot at them from there that door is the only way in and out of the building so cover it tight you see those horses to the left by the building across the street dutch's voice hits them there they'll have to run that way to make their escape don't start shooting until they're out in the open if we spook them they might retreat back and hole up inside don't shoot till i give you the signal keep your sights trained on that bank door don't shoot till i give you the signal don't shoot that man is a hostage they shot up there they're coming out gun them down [Music] [Applause] in the windows first place [Music] let's go you have to run out the door kill them [Music] [Music] head into the bank with hopkins and manny get dutch be careful there may be some innocent people there we can take them let's move they'll cover the windows from up top [Music] over here marston shoot the door open [Music] [Music] again people get out of here head to the town hall come on give yourself love oh it's nice to see you john hello dutch how's abigail well i hope ain't seen her for a while cause you've been chasing me let the woman go dutch of course of course how's your little boy he ain't so little now no he must be what 15 16 gun time fly don't adjust it's over man of course of course i surrendered john you're the master now i've been my master since you left me to die we all make mistakes john i never claimed to be a saint but equally i never took you for an errand boy just trying to help my family dutch by making compromises we all have to now let her go it's over you want the girl john you always wear the romantic sword you know gentlemen this man here oh he married a used to ride with us we all had her oh but he married her and you know that makes him a better man than us he's a better man have the girl cow easy dutch she's a parting gift from me god damn come on we can catch him if we hurry i don't see him what the hell happened in there this is your fault marston you got a gun too sheriff you waited too long next time i'll just shoot the girl get on your horses i just saw dutch make a run for it ah abraham yeah hey what happened in there we saw anderlin escaping from some men he stole off with the bank manager in an automobile let's just say dutch ain't gone and got himself saved killed some poor woman there's an old logging camp further down this road it's been abandoned for years my guess is that's where they're headed come on follow me so that's the great dutch what a role model the man who made you who you are i guess so has he changed no still the same crazy bastard he turned into how was it seeing him after all this time did he talk on your heartstrings it kind of reminds me of you a violent piece of  who went confused himself with god isn't that sweet of you now you must kill him your side is chosen my side ain't chosen my side was given i'd kill you a hundred times before i kill dutch if it was an option hallelujah i think we're finally reaching an understanding mr marston who the hell are you fellas anyway lawmen or army we are neither mr marston but i have the authority over both look that's dutch's car hurry you can't have got money uh come on now [Music] what do you think [Music] now on to the next one [Music] [Music] if you don't stop [Music] [Applause] i like your clothes [Music] where's dutch marston he got away scared to shoot him too much to handle when the opportunity presents itself i'll put a bullet in them don't you worry won't like myself for doing it but i'll do it ah good man good man you know at the end of this you'll probably get a medal i know i shall [Music] [Music] incredible simply incredible hello professor oh hello sir oh mr marston sir good day good day how are you well my family's health and well-being are being threatened by some unscrupulous government agents and my own hard-won freedom is under duress but these problems aside i suppose i'm fair yes the problems of civilizing nomads tell me sir are you from norse stock not as far as i know i was raised in an orphanage my father was scottish unfortunate you'd make an interesting case for my theory of natural population characteristics really well yes a white man obviously but but with a savage spirit uh trust me so i mean savage in the best possible sense natural nobility but also simple they're pure that i've been looking at some blood samples through my microscope and you know what no well of course you don't it's a remarkable breakthrough i've been looking at the blood of both natives and white men of corresponding height weight and age and you know what again no they're exactly the same it's remarkable it completely refutes my last book but i'll tell you what sir this sabbatical in the field may have been somewhat forced upon me by circumstance but my scholarship has benefited enormously would you like to partake of a syringe of cocaine i've quite enough for two not right this minute no oh so it's a remarkable drug it entirely restores the ego it takes one back to a primal state it helps my thinking enormously oh come on um come in sir would you like to take off your slippers or skin a rabbit i know we cannot see the stars but still my heart is pure and we meet as equals these savages must be spoken to simply in metaphors no sir i grew up on a reservation and attended school oh lovely but i can show you what you want to see i know where the group of bandits you seek are hiding both of you vanderlin has attracted a following of young men on the reservation they are turning to bad things the savage heart cannot be conventionally civilized i was right all along where's dutch vanderlin based in the hills in cochine let's go i know a way there that is not guarded marvelous it's simply marvelous [Applause] time to do our bits for humanity mr marston follow me come on so i understand we have a mutual interest in mr vanderland you gotta kill him too good god no what is it with you people out here no vandaling fascinates me a white man living among a civilized mind turns savage it's reverse integration or regressive acculturation uh i don't know i i haven't found a name i like yet it was never that similar ah but of course edgar ross mentioned your unique history with the man although i was away with the fairies at the time i must admit surfing great waves of euphoria ah well anyway yes as some kind of robin hood oedipus communist tale of naivete and betrayal if i remember correctly we ran in a gang together professor i wouldn't try to read too much into it it's my job to read too much into everything dear boy look mr marston buffalo what a noble beast i see him the white man will soon be the end of them what on earth are you talking about the stars too much hunting sir your whole society is based around hunting but we hunt to eat not for sport soon there will be no buffalo left who teaches you this nonsense extinction is a myth refuted by darwin species don't die they evolve hunting in time will make the buffalo stronger these trees are quite foreboding the stars are are you sure this is the right way yes sir it's rather dark it's this way mister ain't you never seen trees before i thought you were a brave cultural explorer good lord no i rarely leave my room i explore with the mind mr master enjoy it while you still can soon you will have cut down all of these trees or are you making a sweeping statement about the white man in general there is no respect for the land anymore i'm sensing some hostility mustache some anger talk me through this primal emotion where it's coming from don't worry about it professor there's the cliffs we'll leave the horses here and climb the rest of the way [Music] remarkable i'm afraid i don't really have much of a head for heights more of a head for highs well anyway i'm sure nastas will help you i must be on my way i've got work to do thanks for the help goodbye gentlemen enjoy yourselves let's get moving mister so damn see if you can find another route mr marston i will have a look around ah there's a cave over here might go through or up the mountain [Music] yes look at this a mining shaft this way [Music] [Music] dynamite get out of here we can do i'm hurt pretty bad i don't think you should go any further i'll be fine but you go ahead i don't want to slow you down you sure you're all right just need to take it slow go on i'll catch up or see you on the way down don't worry about me go look for vanderlin good luck go on you don't want to miss your chance i'll be fine hmm ah [Applause] this will fetch a good price [Music] last still huh ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh ah what were you eating huh ugh ah huh [Music] so [Music] um [Music] so [Music] [Music] mr marston mr marston mr marston here you go mr marston put that stuff away you banged your head nastis and i carried you down well uh nastis uh heard the shots and he hurried up to rescue you and he carried you down i improvised an escape plan i'm more of a planner than a man of action thank you gentlemen friends of mine are with vanderlund we must try to reason with them sir vanderlin's gang contains several natives we must meet with them and try to save them from disaster my people have already endured many disasters before this was all our land and now we have brought you civilization sure it hasn't been easy but it hasn't been easy for anyone nastas why i knew a man in yale whose father once shot 18 natives in one afternoon out in wyoming oh the man was quite quite traumatized he took to lying with choir boys for a wise man you are a very stupid man mister gentlemen i'm gonna leave you to figure out right from wrong you are simple-minded sir thus i do not blame you for not understanding reason then again [Music] good to see you all bean good to see you and you too professor forgive me i am in a state of remarkable agitation and partly due to standard narcotic impulses but also due to the fact that i have finally solved the riddle that has tormented my mind these past eight years what's that the nature of the savage soul what makes some societies great like ours and others uh yeah not worse i would never use it but your decision is worse with but but lesser meaning meaning what makes these beings less human than us closer to beast on the continuum between animal and god you know i argued with fortescue with yale about this it caused a minor scandal but i shall be proven right sir i shall mark my words i shall sell them all what civilization is all about the redskins and the knobs that yale come sir i have a way to save both our desires i will bring you vandalind and me the evidence of savages reverting to type kamsa follow me i asked the stars to bring the horses around front get quick man quick hear me hello professor mr marston this is it years of research what were you talking about back there where are we going to set up a meeting a powwow i think they call it a meeting of mines of souls indians and whites academics and criminals coming together to find a common understanding this fool's making no sense some of vanderlin's men have agreed to meet with professor mcdougall up at bear claw cabin why the hell would they want to do that i think they are interested to find out what conclusions a white man has reached on hundreds of years of culture and society from the comfort of his hotel room wonderful do you think i could ask for a skin sample from the soles of their feet i don't think that's a good idea come on i'm actually a little nervous i have to say a touch of the old jitters no kid there's no small relief to have the two of you along with me it's a bear for the love of god kill it are you crazy what's wrong with you oh my god that was terrifying did i say we leave before any of its friends turn up my goodness i'm still shaking signs of animals if we hadn't shot first it most likely would have ignored us and moved on all very well for you to say that perhaps you have some kind of private bond with these animals but i sir here we are stay close mr marston i'm a little out of my comfort zone no harm done hello gentlemen we come in peace those words mean nothing coming from people like you look at what you've done to us look at us we live like animals scrambling in the dirt like violence isn't the answer maybe you live in a different america than we men like vandalism will lead you to disaster i think we've already experienced disaster the likes which you could only imagine put your hands up we come in peace but that was success boston you call this a meeting give me you're damned with me this is not what we agreed you shut your mouth you treacher sneaker holy damn dutch professor get down now you better kill the stars austin you have to get us out of here stay down keep [Music] hell out of quiet whatever you do please don't leave me in here [Music] i don't know about you professor but i say we get the hell out of here don't think you'll be wanting this no more friends [Music] [Music] come on come on we should move quickly there's plenty more where they came from god i feel terrible my head is pounding getting shot that'll do that to you i'm completely drained it's like my body has aged 10 years stop moaning and ride i guess i'll make a good man after all come on just drop the gun it ain't worth it that was the worst experience of my life i wish i could say the same black water ah i will never talk ill of you again civilization in all its glory mr mcdougall and am i glad to be back i'm in dire need of a syringe something to clear the mind restore the spirit so you ain't planning on sleeping there sleep my dear boy i'll probably never sleep again [Applause] come on safe and sound thank the lord so much for a meeting of mines thank you mr marston i could be boiling in a pot right now if it wasn't for you get some rest professors [Music] professor oh dear boy come in come in and shut the door what's going on you leaving yes sir yes i am sir do you know you know the thing the thing that is vital without which scholarship cannot proceed sir no i don't not having a bullet in your flipping neck sir i am not cut out for this not cut out for this at all nope they're savages savages i think we all are not mesa i'm from connecticut i'm a professor at yale i write books i do not deserve to die out here where's my tincture you okay professor is that you john hello dutch i think that's what they call two for the price of one out here in this wonderful place maybe so dutch you and and your friend there the professor we're going to kill the both of you why you want to do a thing like that i don't know sport i guess fair enough why don't i come out there we fight let the professor go and send your boys back to their families well that that sounds like a beautiful plan john only problem is my boy's here they already lost their families a long time ago we aren't thieves john we're fighting for something a bit like you only we're fighting for an idea not just for ourselves that's beautiful dutch you always were a fine speaker i was now would you kindly send that academic out here so we can show him what we really think about the art of anthropology lisa what are we going to do i'm going to hand you over to him and watch him tear you limb from limb what i'm just kidding we're going gonna run across the rooftops get you back to your ivory tower oh thank you thank you thank you we're still here come on [Applause] here sir what is the meaning of this this outrage you two stay down and shut up come on we can get to the roof this way [Music] do something he's going to kill me one more move and he's a dead man sucking what do we do now they've got to spin down on both sides unbelievable oh [Applause] i'm going to die [Music] [Music] oh i think that's most of them the coast looks clear come on then let's make a break for it the horses should be in an alleyway down here [Music] [Music] slow it up come on let's get the hell out of black water come on right to the station i'm not staying in this place a minute longer this really couldn't have gone more horribly wrong at least you got some good material for your next book you know i dreamt of documenting the last days of the old west the romance the honor the nobility but it turns out it's just people killing each other it always was professor in the old west ain't quite dead yet oh i know mr marston believe me i know please i'll leave and never come back idioms come on let's go [Music] hurry there's more of them [Music] just let me go here we are finally the one-way ticket to civilization ah my research is complete much as i thought there's no civilizing this savage land i could have told you that for nothing ah but they'll give me a prize in new haven for this well they bloody better well goodbye mr marston best of luck dear friend so long professor so long sir what do you want marston my family i've done what you asked no you haven't this is the land of opportunity and i gave you the opportunity to save your family and you failed how could i possibly reward you marston you're a public menace we should have had you killed i wish you had but since you didn't where's my family spare me the noble savage fall on the sword tripe will you oh boy it's nauseating you don't wish to be dead you're an insignificant creature desperately clinging on to life like the rest of the scum in this town yeah i know it's tough you like dutch he's a charming fellow he makes sense he's like one of those nature riders from back east only he takes things a tiny little step too far rather than just loving the flowers and the animals in harmony between man and beast he shoots people on the head for money and disagreeing with him he's a goddamn killer now i'm not a great intellect but the metaphysical leap from admiring the flower to shooting a man in the head because he doesn't like the flower is a leap too far so i know it's easy you see we me and archer we're the bad guys we enforce the rules now while the rules may not be perfect they're really not so bad exactly what's the alternative yeah see i'll tell you what the alternative is it's not complicated it's about one man and his gun versus another man sure civilization may be dull but the alternative mr marston is hell in the way you enforce this civilization this freedom for men to like or not like flowers or whatever in god's name you were just talking about is to kidnap a man's wife and son yeah i know there's contradictions i'm not gonna lie to you yeah as i said i'm not a great intellect now after the debacle with the army and the bank we have to put mr vanderland to rest ourselves will you help us do i have any choice now that you mention it no then what was that pretty speech you made of i don't rightly know but it sure felt good saying it shall we mr marston let's go keep your finger off that trigger until we get out of this blackwater have you seen this he's got a gun on it and all my more days i've never seen this one they told this killer machine of yours seems to be turning a few heads our armed forces have no equal we have made incredible progress the past few years is that what you could do much more than a simple prototype you should see what they're working on in virginia soon there will be no more we can't win the army has made camp a little way outside town they put word out a large cache of ammunition and food is stored there vandaling's gang needs constant supplies so that should be enough to draw a man no mistakes this time hear me marston i thought you were talking to ford hear the cow look they brought the machine gun what's the word captain we spotted one of dutch's man about an hour ago i think he took the bait let's get in position then have your men ready to run them down if you have are you ready to finish this mr marston i guess so hold your fire until i give the word target's on the horizon fire at will next time now them up keep them back now build up don't let them get away [Music] christ this thing's a lot bumpier off the road it's gonna be a mess if we have to follow them into the woods this is insanity i can hardly hold on just shut up and drive boredom what is it with these people keep going [Music] that wagon's out of control um well mr marston it seems like your mentor dutch no longer looks quite so that man is insane so it seems i think we need to get him before sundown as you say captain otherwise he'll be gone again and what if i say no now before i shoot you myself let me just point out the obvious the one person we have left that can appeal to mr vanderlin is the last person we know who knows him your wife that won't be necessary mr ross captain let's go hey so you're the one who's gonna kill him dutch yep that's what they keep telling me but if you feel like doing it please be my guest this is suicide if you ask me my scouts have seen that four to hiss i wanted to wait for more men but them city boys back there weren't having none of it and you answer to them unfortunately it seems that now we do they said you was in a gang with this dutch vanderland i was once a long time ago don't seem like the kind of fella you want to run with unless i completely misjudged your character of course when he turned crazy i left at least i tried to leave until those suits back there came and knocking trying to kill my wife and son if i didn't go after him strange times we live in partner strange times it's a funny business army government men criminals with all due respect you're telling me too many hands on the chiller if you ask me this is how mistakes happen my boys don't know who's giving the orders no more take it from me mister we get up there it ain't gonna matter it'll be every man for himself look at this no we

gang though that way's over railroads and government and motor cars and everything going down away with all that and he ain't gonna marry no orphaned working girl running with a bunch of hucksters neither if he meets one like you i hope he'll marry her stop for an illiterate gunslinger you sure know how to make a girl blush god damn crows john you have got to go deal with them they've broken into the silo again and they're eating all the corn out from it of course my angel get out of there all right all right come on sketch uh [Music] uh [Music] partner john we got a telegram from some lady friend of yours a bonnie something or other something ain't telling me bonnie mcfarland she's a friend saved my life when i went after bill and nearly got myself killed again oh now you two's in the habit of sending each other letters how very nice you weren't nothing like that what's it say i don't know i can't well you know i can't read give it here you read that thing out loud i ain't hiding nothing dear mr marston stop need corn sacks stop emergency stop weevils and moths ate entire county supply stop can you help not exactly the most romantic request now is it i guess not she saved your life you say yes ma'am well then you're gonna have to help her and her family out we've got a plentiful supply of corn sacks over near the silo by the one thing uncle didn't manage to have stolen while he was gone okay hurry back john and john what's she like well you know a little bit like you i guess she's a woman in a man's world [Applause] john wait [Music] i changed my mind i'm coming with you what are you waiting for we better hurry yeah i don't think i can let you go off again without me fair enough i'm glad of the company you only had to ask i was waiting for you to ask me i thought you would keep an eye on the boy you were awesome with cowgirls in the next county i don't think so john marston you only just got home that jack has seen enough of me for a lifetime so is she married it's bonnie mcfarlane no what does she look like i don't know pretty normal normal what normal like me no normal as in two eyes mouth no that kind of normal besides ain't no warm and fine as you a little flattery now we're finally getting somewhere if you find yourself in a hole the first thing to do is stop digging you heard what she wrote it's just some corn she saved my life and she was decent left me bill never did lack surprises how was he same as he was when we left angry and dumb taking his revenge out on the world he was only frightening if he was afraid of dumb fools bill worked so bad but when he does went crazy bill took it hard for a while we all thought we found something right better way to live but it was just a lie so you saw before they did maybe but there was still kind of a family a family that left you was dead you knew the truth john they can't have been too far from here though they treat you right it ain't the first time i've had a gun in my head john you're forgetting your marriage proposal no they learned pretty quick what would happen if they laid a finger on me you came thank you so much we lost the entire harvest miss mcfarland i'd like you to meet my wife abigail oh thank you gentlemen all of a sudden it's a pleasure to meet you mrs marston likewise thank you for saving my husband's life and for teaching the miserable goat manners among other things i didn't teach him anything i know better than to try to change a man you should meet my father oh people can change miss mcfarland john and i have to believe that more than anybody this is a decent first harvest for you dunk you should be proud that's good land you got there how are you feeling mrs marston from what your husband told me it must have been awful for you i've been through worse and i knew he'd be back for too long he can't cook a meal to save his life abigail in my darkest hours when i was most homesick just the thought of one of your rat meat stews kept me pushing forward well about as amusing as a weeping saddle sore hey mr farland if you're gonna start yammering about women's work john i'd say you might be in the wrong company i'd say so too i never felt so outnumbered ma'am so that was the famous bonnie that was her all right she's pretty she's normal like i said well you've clearly had one too many clothes in the head very i don't know john how many times can we start again an outlaw and a working girl we ain't exactly farmers we are now forget that right do you really believe that we have to it's the only way we'll ever have a future we're back together ain't we until they decide you owe them something else sometimes i think i was the stupid one for believing i could get out maybe dutch phil and javier were just being honest with themselves you ain't perfect john better than they are than they were maybe we can't change but we gotta try for jack's sake even if we have to start again a hundred times it's better than going back to where we were upset he's been through a lot i hope he's gonna be all right it's gonna take time for a while his world's safe normal even then it got turned upside down again but how do you explain any of this what do you say when he asked about both phil and uncle guts they were family when he was a little boy he hides away in those books of him wouldn't you it ain't like the real world's done him many favors he's just been kidnapped he grew up with the gay that's no lie for a boy we did our best to protect him come on john he saw things no boy should see we did good today john i guess i better go fix us something to eat uh get up old man i i am up get up oh oh there i'm up thank the good lord you're back nothing worse for an old man than sleeping in the warm afternoon sun you want a long sleep uncle that can be arranged it'll cost me less than food you always was a hard nasty man john marston you always was a useless conniving thief and where's them cattle did you take them to pasture he's coming around to that when exactly it's easy to pick on the elderly it's easy but it ain't dignified come on old man do this together up hey all right you stay front whoa whoa there come on let's get him out for pasture easy come on easy up now stay tight go come on let's go come on oh you folks okay i think we're safe thank you i thought we were done just helping out now

no thanks you got your pound of flesh from me today [Music] what are you looking at old man there's some mustangs and some such out there behind that ridge wondering if it was worth getting you and going around some of them up fair enough we're nearly out of money ranch is in turmoil we may not make it through the winter what could we possibly want with some good quality horses come on that tone of voice ain't so becoming on you makes you seem all pent-up and angry like some black water would-be business tycoon with a bad case of hemorrhoids i'll give you a bad case of someone just shot me in the head if you don't hurry up are you gonna man up kid all right let's get after them come on why you gotta act so piggity all the damn time what happened what were you gonna do just look at them horses all day well god forbid i'd do anything around here without checking with his royal highness first yeah you're real good at watching that's about all you're good for apart from bending your elbow i can't do right we're doing wrong you're an ungrateful bastard you know i did my best when you was gone your best is like anybody else's worst come on getting old i gotta start taking things easy you've been taking things easy for 40 years let's go look there they are easy i got you that's it there you go relax now come on come on [Music] shut the hell up come on baby calm down there you

right there double your lip for christ's sake let's go [Music] [Music] i got you now that's the fight [Music] lean into it [Applause] now i think that's enough for now let's get him back to the ranch look at these here horses finest green gravy it sure will be nice to have some money in our pockets any money we makes going straight back into this ranch not down your gullet oh come on i ain't working for free here you ain't working at all that's the problem old man what about today and all them cattle i heard i'm always sucking hindsight around here you got food in your belly ain't you a roof over your head you're so tight you get out of bed to turn over so it's not to wear out the sheets don't push your luck this little bottle wouldn't hurt though something to ease and old man's aches and pains this is why they say you should never hire the people you drink with go come on make sure there's enough fresh hay we need to keep them strong all right damn a little gratitude wouldn't kill you not a bad day's work [Music] oh what's the book boy nothing sir what's it about well it's an adventure sir um set out in the west and it tells this amazing story of how people killed the savage redskins and how this man this brave man hunts the man who killed his father i'm glad you're enjoying it talking of adventure how'd you like to learn to track out really big ones in the valley this time of year we could use the meat well i i know you'd rather read your adventures trust me this can be very enjoyable in its own i suppose maybe it's a little less dramatic so let's go come on you may get to see me get gored by some massive wild beast then you can write a story about that very funny paul i've forgotten how funny he was grabbed [Music] [Music] all right now stay close to the dog son when he finds something you stay back and i'll show you how to make a kill whatever you sure you're ready for this i guess so now the trick to hunting is calm and patience you got to think and move like an animal to catch an animal rifle help doesn't it health don't stand still son i wouldn't know this is the first time you've taken me honey there's lots of things i ain't done with you and i'm gonna try and make up for that go there come on you don't seem too excited about this what do you want me to say paul if he are you sure you're all right i mean i know all that business must have been hard on you it wasn't nothing i'm not a kid anymore well it won't happen again it's over until the next time you mean there won't be a next time don't wait no more promises paul i've heard them all before look he's picked up a cent come on let's go you know one time i hunted a bear up into tall trees you never seen a bigger animal in all your life i read this story about a girl who was raised by a wolf and she hurt goats with that and everything that sounds like a tall yarn to me taller than a boy being taken from his home locked up in a dungeon i'm just saying maybe you spend too much time with your head in those books i thought you all wanted me to read we do as long as you're not well hiding from the real world jack there's one up ahead yeah i see it this one's mine stay with me son okay come on come on i'll show you how to cut the meat i thought it was gonna get away that was great pop you just gotta wait for the right shot not rush it that's a big one this

smooth ride thank you did you hear about oscar that's good thank you just apparently okay all done let's head home come on how much did you make never you mine enough to keep rufus out of the stewing pot for a couple days and what about me what do i get you get to eat son but i did half the work that didn't fail what can i say i'm another corrupt landowner i'll be rich one day then you'll see i sure hope so and you can look after us when we get old what do you mean get old you are old we ain't old uncle's old well he should be in a museum yeah preserved in whiskey for the next thousand years

trying to look out for you good just decide to be a father what are you doing slow what about the rest of the time come on jack that ain't exactly fair come on we can't stop now one minute you're telling me to be a man the next you're telling me i'm just a boy it's going to take a while for things to get back to normal normal was it normal but it'll get better son i promise easy i'm sorry paul you don't need to be i don't mean to be moody i'm glad you're home i i really am it's just every time you go up well i were you're not coming back i swear if it was down to me i'd never have gone

can't be tired already stay on me now what was your father like i didn't really know him he died when i was just a boy died or what what do you want to know what you're gonna land us both in the dirt it really ain't that in a bar fight at least that's what they told me gods are women i ain't sure probably both definitely liquor drink like a camel after a long walk oprah says most spots are caused by poker or women well he'd know that's for sure tom is uncle really your uncle no at least i sincerely hope not he's probably lots of people's father though look son he sniffed him out don't give up now let's keep moving come on watch yourself now son [Music] stay alert now come on rufus where are the others boy come on we can't stop now whoa there you can't be tired already yep it's always more

some good shooting son so can i go out hunting by myself now hold on there cowboy you ain't ready for that yet one step at a time oh please we'll go out again soon catch something nice for your mata cook i reckon i could kill a bear no problem i ain't gonna tell you again jack you don't leave the farm without checking with me first you here yes sir i hear you can i ask you something of course were you a murderer what that place where they held us i shouted out of guard one time and he yelled that you were a murderer maybe but i live my life believing there's a difference between killing and murdering not for the person who's dead no and i guess i've been broke that's how it goes we all do what we have to to survive and sometimes it ain't pretty and in the end we pay the price for what we did like those wrestlers exactly look when i was a kid things were different rules were different but that's all we did was kill a few wolves that was his name i'm happy with my two arms if you don't mind just imagined it though john and jack wanted men in the west and what about your mom yeah i mean we still come huh you live in a dream world it ain't like they tell it in books and it ain't no way to live life it was ugly and brutal all right i was only joking around you'll have a farmer your own  reading right don't waste your life son don't live like i had let's go [Music] go yeah you're turned into a decent hunter son but try to stay out of trouble uh john john what is it old man it's jack the kid the kid well i just saw not in the valley it seems your tails are hunting got the better of them he said he was going up to the pass tracked down that grizzly that's been seen up there kid can't hunt a grizzly thing will eat him alive i know i tried to stop him but you're

come on now hold tight you all right yeah i think so you're lucky to be alive you stupid boy what'd i tell you about going off by yourself i go off by myself plenty you just don't know about it you're never around so this is my fault you disobeyed me i was trying to prove myself prove what by getting yourself killed you're always telling me i read too many books that i'm not a real man i never said that i just thought if i could do something you'd like maybe you wouldn't go away again son i ain't going anywhere and believe me neither are you for a real long time [Music] what's your mother gonna say i'm sorry paul please don't be angry i ain't angry i'm disappointed don't you ever run off on your own like that again all right all right i told you i was sorry what would have happened if i hadn't come along i don't know i'd probably be dead you'd be a pile of bones right now what would you care i'm just a nuisance to you anyway that ain't true jack i do anything for you you know that i guess there's only room for one hero in this family trust me son i ain't no hero i'm just glad you're safe going after grizzly what were you thinking you've only been hunting twice i'm not a little
