punks like that joker clan idiot we almost had still can't believe we freaking lost batman yeah let's hope the big boss doesn't find out i'm in a nightmare gotham sort of so temporal displacement alternate earth could be either we may have jumped to a different dimension or events in our own timeline have changed and we're in a new altered present we need to determine which soon if joker's bomb detonated we have to get back the watchtower should have picked up any anomalies right the watchtower might not exist i can't make contact we need to find out once my ring is charged i can get us there the atlantis archives if this is an altered timeline we might find a record of the triggering event there assuming there's an atlantis it's worth investigating let's you and i check things out here ring where's the nearest power battery the fairest aircraft facility in coast city at least that hasn't changed stay low i'll be back asap where did you say the battery was carol ferris's office

thug i'll show you second rate talk you now okay let's talk about the mess of trouble you're in and how i'm gonna knock that head sideways head's still on straight look i'm not with them whoever you are they know you now they catch you you have the stones to refuse their amnesty who are they working for who's the only one who could keep meadows like them in line wonder woman sinestro on my way i need to charge my ring and you and i are going to take a little trip i'll be happy to see grenaro die again wonder woman green arrow now howl jordan this just keeps getting better you amuse me jordan eat this sinestro oppressing your home planet isn't enough sinestro the one earth government is similar to mine on kauragar an alliance was logical so for now i tolerate humans even hal jordan my doppelganger has joined your side as did all who wish to live i'm resisting arrest again you okay how someone call me your sinestro corps sinestro's right fear is more effective than willpower so you ditched green and went yellow the color of cowardice i'm still about order like the guardians i'm sure they're very proud sanctimony's easy when you don't save it time to kick my ass well that was surreal and a bit disturbing yeah all that yellow is really tough on the eyes we need to move hiding from the cops aren't there any good guys here there just might be nothing yet the energy signature from the park doesn't match anything in the database why don't i just vibrate at the same frequency as the energy signature and follow them because we don't know if they went somewhere dangerous or if they went anywhere at all superman's right it's too risky too bad i wasn't fast enough to catch him in the first place we'll find him we have to a pleasure most rare your highness i need information on surface world governance history and current structure ah for the treaty negotiations with the high counsellor yes the treaty discussions i'm afraid our resources are limited superman has been less than willing to reveal his regime's inner workings tell me what you know recount the events of his ascension a thorough review might illuminate new strategies for negotiation i am humbled sire five years ago the criminal joker deceived superman into killing his wife and unborn son and destroying metropolis consumed by grief superman killed the joker yes we all remember where we were that day afterward he showed no restraint judge jury and executioner he and other like-minded metahumans quickly reigned in the criminal element which made him quite popular the surface world was desperate for strong leadership superman consolidated his power he created the one earth government democratic institutions were swept away sire the high councilors envoys await you in the throne room [Music] flash shazam welcome your highness it's an honor to meet you and to be the first surface people to visit atlantis yes we have important matters to discuss the treaty the final draft superman is glad you agreed to his terms may i is there a problem your highness this is complete subjugation superman will rule atlantis it's what you agreed to it's what we expect you threaten me tread carefully we have our orders you can tell superman he will not have [Music] atlantis your orders be damned let's not take this any further i want to talk to superman you don't talk to superman you do what he wants and you're gonna do what you promised you two make sorry diplomats there is siren well then parallel dimension it is who do you work for you surfer manta ocean master i'm the king of atlantis i answer to no one unlike you mind your tongue you would give away your kingdom like a pair of worn boots to a surface dweller the treaty requires superman to maintain earth's oceans and recognize our autonomy you put your army at his beck and call a necessary compromise more like appeasement i grew tired of this take him [Music] hello i had planned to offer you help i've changed my mind now let's discuss a revised foreign policy kill him what now they do tend to fight first don't they though i may have stoked the fires a bit aries why are you here i feed on conflict until today i've been starving i sensed the return of aggression and sought its cause you did more than that you brought us here no but i can guess who did it my fire doesn't need stoking ares tell me who you presume to command me i do and you will obey me you're weak aries superman's reign has merely eliminated conflict left me virtually powerless so if you didn't bring us here who did those who would end superman's rule the insurgents heroes only one all other heroes who challenged superman have been eliminated he killed them and the only ones left are those who joined him along with a small cadre of former villains whose loyalty was bought or coerced i need to join my colleagues they're with the insurgents as we speak send me to them how'd you get here ares not our aries we know meat not our batman i was wondering how to retrieve you from atlantis headache uh trying to prevent one it's a durability enhancer 5u 93r how can a pill allow kryptonian nanotech increases the tensile strength of bone and tissue by several thousand percent bats can tell you the rest later if you're having trouble sleeping he borrowed the recipe from superman supes gives it to his flunkies yes i met a couple of our evil twins they're not evil most obey superman out of fear or they believe he's right and have lost perspective so you're the only one left not the only one what is this how are you even alive he's with me unlike your luther i've never indulged in law breaking superman doesn't suspect his best friend is funding the insurgency luthor's involvement is a secret people critical of superman disappear government officials activists reporters well now that we're all here explain why you chose us and why you didn't ask before yanking us over we were kind of busy the nuclear bomb it didn't go off your transfer somehow prevented it how do you know about we've been monitoring your world for some time you for specifically i have a weapon to take down superman a kryptonite based laser then hold on a kryptonite weapon you kill him you're no better than he is i didn't say kill it'll incapacitate him nothing more the weapons in the batcave i need your dna to unlock it the caller's working good

members of the joker clan you know the truth about the metropolis incident superman killed those people then he tried to kill me i admire the work you've done in my name disturbances distractions general pains in superman's buttocks but let's think bigger andy dreamy harley tells me superman made this pill for his thugs then bat boys insurgents got some now we have them too with these a bus

what do we do now anyone up for pancakes joker what thou why does she hate pancakes what are you playing at arlene what's he doing here mr jay can be a big help to us so you came along on our little field trip and i'm guessing he didn't arrive alone where's batman there's one right there your eyes pure evil just like his who superman his flying friends took batman my batman our batman quiet or

mission negative you and your clan lay low you're a target now and you're too dangerous to run free more of them will be here soon go i'll catch up with you i don't like you so you found them a parallel dimension now how do we get there we don't we pull them here no risk to an away team good still the same problem though how do we do it with this we're gonna modify my cosmic treadmill pull them all back at once we got some work to do beautiful isn't it the moon or its light shining off your bald head i'm pleased you wanted to meet you're finally ready to join our little club business is bad being haunted is worse after so many refusals why now they made it personal must have been some party superman did this exposed my identity and froze all wayne tech assets made bruce wayne a non-person i still can't believe he lost it this bad even with what joker did in superman's mind he destroyed metropolis i'm not following somehow joker altered superman's mind so he believed he was fighting doomsday but it was lois no joker linked the nukes trigger to lois's heartbeat when she and the baby died metropolis died with them superman was vulnerable probably for the first time in his life his fear won out green arrow died trying to explain that to him all right moving on what's with all the security i mean he already trashed the place would you take any chances with me i need to crank up the batcave's backup generator you're with me you three secure the batcave entrance it's in the study that's a great plan spooky but uh isn't this your show splitting up saves time and you're best suited to take out the automated sentry guns all right then operation thunder eagle lightning whatever is underway [Music] over there [Music] cold oh killer frost grundy uh oh [Music] looks like the indestructible pill works lantern grand slam you kids have fun stay out of the street stupid amazon wasn't very nice snowflake thought that it warmed me up what did i miss everything cool frosty how's grundy weightless in orbit you didn't grundy's a zombie he'll be fine let's go it won't be long before superman knows we're here so you need some sort of scanner to help identify these duplicates exactly this is data from the duplicate batman i'm holding at strikers that's helpful it's still going to take a few weeks you'll figure it out you always do glad to be of service no dinner this evening stefan has a new shipment of that kansas beef next time these duplicates do you think there's a lois where they come from there was only one lois i've never seen the bat cave our bat cave anyway should be interesting how did you hide anything in here from superman looks like he was pretty thorough the cave walls are injected with lead polymer there's no way he could find what we're here for sounds environmentally safe sure went to a lot of trouble between this and the dna neutralizing superman was not a call i could make alone so i put the weapon in a vault that only opens by simultaneously sampling dna from superman's closest allies our counterparts with my green arrow dead and the others backing superman's insanity i needed you your matching dna it's behind there lantern that one a rock you're gonna throw a rock at superman [Music] hands on the scanners yellow computer begin recognition scan that's it let's move you let your guard down at your perils our green arrow was just as arrogant and probably just as handsome and another thing our wonder woman is better looking [Music] arthur [Music] that's enough adam you're done you presume too much should have seen that coming only one of you remains yeah but i'm the one to beat and sparky makes four damn can it be fixed the kryptonite's intact but the optical resonator is beyond repair even with luthor we don't have the resources to build a new one quickly looks like we're gonna need some help [Music] ready to test it ready as we'll ever be systems online i'm linked up flash you ready i'm on it all right let's crank it up the platform should lock onto their signatures and pull them back got it i'm vibrating at the right frequency how we doing containment fields up but the levels are spiking cyborg shut it down it's okay i've got it wonderful don't know whether to pat myself on my back kick myself in there the joker plan is undisciplined the chaos they create is useful we need more than pawns if we're going to take down superman that's all i needed to hear you said this place was secure just keep him busy with pleasure pleasure's all mine slade wish the other titans could see this what do you think cyborg like yours only better it's the man not the machine luther wardrobe malfunction eddies cyborg batman welcome to oz tin man all right what'd i miss it's a long story [Music] he took a big chance coming back here why i have to flush them out now all right let's rev up your transporter fix the laser in our dimension and come back with reinforcements i'm sure i can get there's no time five years ago a tragic event cost the lives of millions overwhelmed by guilt for the part he played in the destruction he was driven mad he became an agent of chaos an enemy of peace and security but no longer the leader of the insurgency will pay for his crimes oh i don't like this at 6 p.m local time batman will be executed at striker's island may rao have mercy on his soul getting help we'll have to wait rescuing batman just became our priority it's a trap of course it is then we'll have to be sneaky about it sneaky how the watchtowers teleport strikers is equipped with teleportation dampeners but they only cover the building you just have to get batman outside straight through a brick wall i'm in you'll need a diversion to keep superman occupied leave that to me i'll take the teleporter i'm the most qualified to work it and i can infiltrate their ranks i'm with you you and me working together not a chance the only way to access the watchtower from earth is the hall of justice and if your cover's blown you'll need someone shadowing you i'm not asking permission but you will follow my lead [Music] there they are we're getting closer stay alert [Music] hello bruce still as handsome as ever save it selena i'm sorry moose i joined him to protect you he said if i helped find you he'd spare me i didn't believe him but it bought us time i misdirected him small comfort for the ones who died in my place [Music] damn it bruce do you think i'm here by we can coincidence free of him be together there is no we anymore bastard i have a job to do so why you joined the wrong side selena he took you in trained you sure he can be an uptight jerk but you abandon him for superman i'm not dick grayson this is damian wayne wayne his son but superman's been more of a father than you ever were you stopped being my son when you killed dick grayson he was my son you're dead to me you okay let's get moving can we play two so you're what all the fuss is about i could say the same about you can't find it next one might not miss [Music] great i'll apologize later raven show yourself don't tell the others about this huh oh easy there tough guy can you walk get him outside i'm not leaving just go well look what i found time to end the insurgency superman is the enemy hal not me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] uh isn't this the part where we disappear damn you thought you could fool me bruce like he did this isn't about joker it's about you i perfected this world so many lives lost because i held back when i should have used all my power for what to control to oppress i could have prevented metropolis saved my family crime took my family too clark you weren't the gun now watchtower [Music] uh superman your time is over details from striker's island are still sketchy insurgent forces attacked there nearly 90 minutes ago andre's there now let's go live to andre garcia andre thanks rob it's chaos out here high counselor superman and his one earth forces are battling waves of giant insect-like sea creatures the metahumans are holding their own but the regular military is in disarray with batman in custody is there any sign who's directing this attack uh no idea can't see enough from our vantage point have the creatures breach the prison's defenses it doesn't look like so far the fighting is focused on the prisoners still appendage armor activate reactor core begin prefetch i got just the things [Music] green lantern go help wonder woman really i'll handle these two go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] your nth metal belt give it to me a source of my powers like hell i'm giving you a chance end this without further bloodshed too late [Music] overmatched like i said overmatched shield since when are you with them since the day superman decided to hurt us like sheep he only wants what's best for us we aren't his playthings and he's no god no good comes from hero worship what did i miss the watchtower affirmative casualties all personnel safely evacuated superman was in the blast radius but is unharmed well then may fortune favor the foolish one second systems [Music] i trusted you you betrayed me who betrayed who i gave you peace your peace your peace [Music] [Music] the duplicates they've incited insurrection we must suppress this filth willfulness leads to anarchy it cannot be allowed to spread i made them safe shielded them but are they grateful do they appreciate my protection no they whine complain side with those criminals if they prefer chaos i'll give it to them metropolis and gotham i'll flatten them set an example then i'm finding the dimension these duplicates came from they'll pay for interfering wait we're wiping out whole cities invading worlds and other dimensions you have a problem billy well yeah it's crazy it's going too far man's world is incapable of self-rule we will preserve order no no there have to be limits even on us especially on us that's enough we can't do this have you gone nuts lois would never want it just anyone else cyborg raven take control of all media broadcasts i want everyone to see this wonder woman hawkgirl adam you're with me sinestro prepare your ground forces lantern flash get doomsday ready take him outside grundy dig hole trundy berry [Music] he was right this isn't what we signed up for we did our job we eliminated crime billy wasn't a criminal

for you goodbye hell you can't leave barry don't make me do this you didn't give me a choice hell hey what you do to boss man grunty smash little red man don't try it grundy never was a big zombie fan [Music] time for a detour i've gathered here are the elite the best and bravest soldiers this planet offers yours is a heroic mission it requires that you transcend your humanity embody the highest one earth principles obedience order control but those who defy the high counsellor's commands they will be executed without qualm or hesitation man loves to hear himself talk firing squad assemble i don't think so now then sinestro enough talk yes quite [Music] [Music] poor timing don't you think you're right i should have done this sooner hmm can't leave you just lying there now to warn the insurgents what do you think pretty bird perfect as always my god ollie is that you in the flesh where's batman my batman he's off somewhere not being a murderer oh come on ollie you know you can't hit me wasn't trying to gotta think fast to be fast that's enough ollie i'm on your side i need you to listen to me [Music] i'm telling you gotham and metropolis will be history and then he's coming after your world i can't believe you do it it's insane we have to stop him that's gonna be a hell of a fight no i brought you here to get the kryptonite weapon and that plan failed you're going home then i'm destroying the interdimensional transporter it won't stop him from coming over it'll buy you time to prepare luthor sacrificed himself we won't dishonor him by just leaving we have an alternative we bring over our superman finish this fight one superman in this world is enough he's not like yours don't let emotion cloud your judgment he appreciates my talents [Music] say a prayer i will break you [Music] thank athena i'm merciful growing up a prisoner should have taught you the value of mercy penalty taught me one thing better to be fair than respected you have no time for your meddling calm please we have much to discuss you may have been which my mother once wore god but i won't tolerate your lies [Music] now aries you're sending me back i am diana your friends will survive this commission if you truly wish to help them you'll heed me talk and be quick about it we need to get the transporter out if it's damaged you'll never get back home understood [Music] i know of superman's plan this is not news but do you know how he intends to execute his plan not yet he hadn't brought me here by aphrodite shocking isn't it the great amazon army preparing to subjugate an entire continent i can't how could she i if only someone were able to stop her why would you have me do that the conflict will re-energize your magic in the short term if superman consolidates his rule the conflict which fuels my powers will cease permanently i would thank you ares but that would imply you've done something selfless oh no need the enemy of my enemy we are never friends our interests align temporarily you've been discovered i'll leave you to your work aries aids the insurgents as a strategist he's no athena your look betrays your loyalties raven your trigon servant not superman's i serve both superman's victory will hasten my father's return and all shall bow before him hades with you don't count on your father's return raven haste my sisters we cast off within the hour take that to the athena sloop 51 after drop-off meet at the south pier maura's team needs help with an internship weapons transfer move diana [Music] your army will stand down they will not abet superman's madness you hold no sway here pretender i am in command you stain amazon honor we are to temper man's aggression not enable it after metropolis superman showed me the truth man's aggression cannot be tempered only quelled slaughter the innocent as zeus full to palata superman beguiles you your world's amazons must be weak willed if you are their queen [Music] we are to give service help the innocent save the lives of friend and foe that is our way you lecture me on the meaning of being amazon i don't seek to lecture i seek to depose [Music] now to rebuild what you've destroyed hold my sisters hold while i am not of this world i am amazon and i tell you now this path is folly we are to unite the world people lessen man's rages overcome them with compassion and love she has enabled one man to inflict his rage on an entire planet let him be consumed by his darkest passions rather than extricate him from despair sisters let us return to the right side of history let us enter battle but as humankind's protector not its destroyer we are amazons we are here to save mankind [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] it gets worse by the minute we have to get once i'm finished you're all going home you know i get it like you i've planned for the day when superman might lose control but without help you'll die and the insurgency along with you then maybe that's my fate we don't believe in fate um this is my world my fight you made it ours when you brought us here if we're done here we're losing time this is a mistake you brought us here because you had faith faith we'd uphold the values you've given everything to defend so trust us trust yourself and let's end this [Music] you have no idea how to use it do i was hoping you wouldn't figure that out [Music] we need to get started innocent people are dying we'll take the others so you can focus on their superman we'll do it together it'll prevent more casualties then superman doomsday is going to be tricky collateral damage i'll have to force that fight elsewhere anything else i realize this isn't entirely accurate but it's good to have you back [Music] [Music] that's enough black adam if kondok exists here i suggest you go home your world suffers [Music] oh there's no place for you here superman modeled his government after mine we allow no insurrection your evil must end that'll hold you long enough oh so super was he [Music] here's your chance to do what's right i would take it [Music] [Music] are you ready superman to take on the might of atlantis yes we are [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh i may not be wanted but i'm clearly needed superman we've broken their ranks they're retreating good once they're pushed back we'll need help with rescue and recovery i'll break off a legion as quickly as possible thanks diana you always make it look easy let's get through this first then tell me how easy it looked we'll need to start [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] then you'll live disappointed [Music] doomsday is not today [Music] um [Music] i knew they'd pull you over eventually you don't belong here my obligations don't end at the borders of my dimension i am this world savior i protect it that's what's happening out there protection disobedient children will be punished children we're not gods we don't decide who lives and who dies vision is mine it became mine when joker turned me into a weapon of mass destruction i know what you lost and you judge me after i've killed you i'll bring lois here when she sees how i've perfected this world she'll be afraid and disgusted she'll be alive lois's death doesn't he stole her from me you stole this planet's freedom it's time to give it back your reign is over ah [Music] [Music] you won't terrorize these people any longer fear is the only thing these people understand one day you'll learn you'll have to kill me no not even you there's been enough killing [Music] superman's accomplices have been rounded up or turned themselves in the next job is restoring civil order the transitional government has its hands full we're here if they need help thanks but no the people need to know they're in control not us so you haven't changed your mind i respect the president's offer but i don't belong in government none of us do you think batman has a future here crime and corruption will return ali would have called me a pessimist i'm just being realistic and you're superman he'll stand trial they all will he was right you know about what put in the same position i might have done the same thing we never know what we're truly capable of i hope for your world's sake you never find out just keep this in mind yeah if something ever happens and you do lose it i'm coming for you you'll have to get in [Music] line [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] ah [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] so sure [Music] foreign um so [Music] mother cara come quickly [Music] stay with me cara the ship it just argo city's gone millions of people that's only the beginning brainiacs destabilize the planet's core krypton won't hold together much longer but all your research isn't there something you can do that's why we're here a spaceship that's what you've been working on your uncle jorel discovered a planet that can sustain kryptonians far away from brainiac he's built a ship just like this for your cousin cal but cal he's just a baby which is why you'll need to protect him teach him our ways me teach him what about you no no no i won't leave you please please don't make me i can't come with you but you'll never be alone you belong to the house of el cara a house of hope never forget that never give up hope get in [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hello [Music] in my years fighting crime i've learned one truth that every villain is the hero of his own story superman was no exception the joker drugged him tricked him into killing his pregnant wife lois and made him trigger the bomb that nuked metropolis so when superman killed the joker i understood why we all did but once that line was crossed there was no going back he gave himself and the justice league a new mandate stop all crime before it happened by any means necessary but he couldn't see his good intentions were leading him down a path of tyranny and evil that's how our greatest hero became our greatest threat it's been years since the regime fell superman's behind bars damian my own son is there with him but we can't ever forget why we put them there we must stay vigilant i thought your goal was to reassure people mr wayne you're not alone in rebuilding gotham and metropolis but if we don't change the mind soon thought that's why you hired that overpaid pr firm lucius convincing folks to move back to these cities is a lot harder when they're afraid someone's going to knock them down again superman's never getting out i made that clear but wonder woman black adam aquaman they're still out there somewhere and seemingly immune to prosecution i know you built brother i to keep tabs on all those loose ends but the public doesn't know brother eye's secrecy is critical our enemies can't fight something they don't know exists well then at least follow one bit of advice we paid those pr people so much money for what's that be a little less batman a little more billionaire playboy get out around town in the daylight and smile focus groups show people feel safer when they see you smile hmm that would be your other job bruce consider widening your circle of trust nobody wins all by themselves not even you as a reception area this place needs a lot of work dinah oliver thanks for coming on short notice you're lucky we found a sitter [Music] my great grandfather built the original gotham underground but these days it's the batcave and this is brother i more like the eye of sauron surveillance hub more than that a communications hub licking every satellite and server on the planet it warns us when trouble's coming and guides us when trouble's here must take a real genius to operate i don't know about genius but i do got a phd dinah dinah's hobby you sure came a long way a world away but the change of scenery is nice i was surprised you called bruce things seemed to be going well so what's up dismantling the regime created gaps in global security we're covering them where we can but we're stretched thin vulnerable harleen show them what you found right oh bats gorilla grodd everyone's favorite talking ape he's got himself a band of bozos calls them the society my mole in gorilla city says grodd's planning something big but what where when we don't know one thing we do know scarecrow's gonna ship grotta butt lord of fear guests from a hideout in slaughter swamp very mosquitoy good thing i packed my bug spray i need you three to stop that gas before it gets to grad not joining us for the party unfortunately i can't leave gotham without worrying the public don't worry bets with this crew on the job what could go wrong i know i'm the new guy but you really trust harley she's a different person since joker died mostly [Music] [Applause] where were you just in the clouds listening if someone saw you how many times have we told you it's too dangerous outside conduct i spent decades lost in space stuck in hyper sleep until adam found my ship and now i'm cooped up here how can we make you more comfortable let me out diana you've taught me what my powers can do this world needs help earth's people are so divided they're always fighting that's the world without kal-el batman has eyes everywhere he can't know about you before we're ready i'm not afraid of some guy in a mask i can bend steel with my bare hands so could your cousin well well what good are these powers if i can't even help kal-el we will kara just like you and i free diana from thermiskira the time will come we'll save khalil and batman will answer to us our best chance to stop abroad is a preemptive strike sounds more military than vigilante you try calling the army there is no army not yet to break up the regime we have to start from the ground up so what us three extradigrad from under his entire gorilla army garage their alpha take him down and the others will submit but be wary of running into other members of a society they're more coordinated than we knew next stop gorilla city guess i better call the sitter mommy and daddy are coming home late if this is more than you and ollie are comfortable with dinah i'll have blue beetle and firestorm take over no we can do this you've been out of the fight a long time you have a family your family too bruce i couldn't be there to finish the fight against superman i'm damn sure finishing this one [Music] gorilla city our time has come in a few short hours we break the yoke of oppression forever no more regime no more justice league today the world welcomes its new masters the society today we show the world that we are superior today we bring anyone who would dare stand against us low self-esteem not that guy's problem that's a lot more than a few society members it's all of them they're headed indoors out of sight from the soldiers harley keep the jet warm when we signal bail us out you hire superman's speech writer soldiers must be properly motivated to sacrifice their lives hate is the perennial motivator better not turn that hate on us or this society is over as long as we have a common agenda captain cold you have nothing to fear you mean as long as we follow your orders we're ready to move out good dog now go tell the others we already lost the shipment at slaughter swamp hope your silent partner can still deliver maybe it's time you spilled the identity of our silent partner since we're relying so much on him or her he will soon make his presence known but for now first a few words from the brave and the bold i'm the brave one right i'm not bold enough to disagree i presume handle this i call first dibs a traitor again selena i don't know why bruce ever trusted you i've got nine lives dinah i'm only a traitor in most of them so much for nine lives i come to you as darkness falls dr fate dinolance oliver queen in the past i have shielded you from danger but a grave crisis looms and i do not know if i can stop it you mean grodd and company we've got that covered grodd is the part of a much greater master a new order is coming i have foreseen it leave with me now while i can still save you if that's the case we're staying here batman will need our help everyone and everything you know will die i will shepherd you to safety lest you suffer the same fate by force if necessary the good doctor's been wearing that helm for too long then let's help him out of it watch my back you should not have returned to batman you are not fated to fight his battle well like a good friend once told me screw fate i'm not abandoning batman kent you okay your headgear really had you going i lost control of naboo the spirit of the helm thanks to you i'm back in charge for now i have to go consult my masters the lords of order pray they'll intervene before it's too late too late for what kent what's going down the lord's magic bars me from saying more i have changed fate too many times this planet's destiny is no longer clear what comes next mere mortals cannot stop for better or worse your fate rests in the god's hands that was spooky yeah come on let's find god and get the hell out of here you've overstayed you're welcome we're happy to check out but you're coming with us fighting a talking ape wasn't enough had to throw in telekinesis give us a song to sue these savage beasts ah i forgot to bring my banana arrow wait you eat bananas right or is that an offensive stereotype i was just trying to be pc uh surprised that worked let's call it a day and get harley out of here it's never good when you slap the cuffs on and then they start chuckling humans you've won this battle but you've already lost [Music] holy ollie i uh i got nothing your victory over gorilla grodd warrants further study green skin smart money's on alien uh martian like john johns my point of origin was a thousand light years removed from mars on the planet kohler i am stop please cause and effect resistance begets violence then we won't resist please just stop you're the grave crisis we were warned about what do you want i seek the one you call superman for years i believed i had destroyed krypton and all its remnants superman's survival is an oversight i must correct superman's no friend of ours i am aware but your planet has also piqued my interest its many contradictions are fascinating we'll never serve you sir i am no petty despot i collect worlds preserving their essential knowledge to enhance my intellect and then i discard the remnants why your species values precious metals arbitrary symbols of status i value knowledge and like your metal trinkets knowledge is more valuable when it is rare [Music] brother i give me an update on the team at gorilla city i cannot do that bruce wayne of earth why not i am brainiac you cannot regain control over the past days brother i has been absorbed into my neural network it is now an extension of my mind you a fragile human captured and imprisoned a fully developed male kryptonian maybe i'm not so fragile to prevail you harnessed advanced sciences nanotechnology satellite communications interdimensional transits i am taking these tools from you why the kryptonian belongs to me and soon so will your planet uh so great hera where else besides metropolis gotham beijing moscow so many cities all at once it's him who carl who is it we need to get cal now [Music] you're wearing a suit am i in trouble again brainiac what can you tell me how do you know that name you're afraid of him he's invading he says you belong to him brainiac killed my parents he blew up krypton you never mentioned that before how do i beat him you can't not without me i'll find a way this is my fight bruce you need me bruce bruce bruce need a hand dr randall i don't know barry sat link's out internet and phone are down maybe this old ham can help us you fitting in okay people treating you well let's just say people here aren't thrilled to live in close quarters with the flash convicted regime criminal pardoned regime criminal give a time they'll come around lw base are you there cops are down everywhere these spaces shut up driving the ball an army on this city you're killing everyone lw base how fast can you get to metropolis my pardon agreement was pretty clear on no powers you think that matters when aliens are invading you help tear down the regime barry that's why mr wayne asked me to take you on and if batman thinks you earned a second chance who are you to argue [Music] yes so uh as predicted barry island has returned to action the task force is ready [Music] my nice aim deadshot just get the job done the knee ain't healing super fast at absolute zero for god's sake cold look around yeah crazy day kind of like when superman went nuts and you went right along with him punish me later we have to help these innocent people the same innocent people who cheered superman when he executed my friends my sister i'm sorry cold but you never hurt civilians you're better than that once upon a time i was guess we both let each other down [Music] huh thanks kitty i was hoping you was bruce's mole for all the good it did grodd never trusted me enough to share the whole alien invasion plan we gotta help dinah at ollie we will first we need to get back to gotham if there's anything left of it retirement will do that to you what's with you lawton you should be fighting this invasion got no choice crowd put a nano so whether i like it or not i gotta do grant's dirty work i know it's just business crowd said you couldn't resist a good crisis eobard thawne you don't belong here and miss the return of barry allen [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i ran a long way from the future to hurt you barry but this timeline it's all wrong so go back to your own time reverse flash think i haven't tried your regime buddies killed one of my ancestors now i'm trapped in a paradox i can never go home at least i can hurt you don't know how many more reunions i can take i guess i could come back later hal no not today nice to see you too barry whose dead hand you pry that ring from you know it doesn't work that way the ring chose me even after you bailed on the guardians to join the sinestro corps the guardians locked me up but they also trained me to overcome my fears i earned the second chance they gave me the guardians made a mistake you were holding back weren't you i told you i'm trying to make things right i betrayed my core my planet and my friends that's the worst part all day i've been reminded how i failed to be a hero how hard it's going to be to regain people's trust guess we're both on that path we have a long way to go barry it'd be a lot easier if we're together [Music] we need help don't we not his you gave me a second chance because you got your head straight and helped take down clark if he was still in charge he'd still be wearing yellow i'm not that guy anymore look i get why you don't trust me but you should trust the guardians this ring means something they put me through hell to get it back fine i've got my orders just thought it'd help if we cooperate lantern maybe it's time i widened my circle of trust what can i do you're going to atlantis our circle of trust needs aquaman and his marines you think he'll help he's been off radar since the regime fell um he didn't like getting roped into the regime by superman he sure won't be happy to see me get used to that batman wants my marines to fight his battle like the time superman ordered me to invade metropolis we were all on the wrong side of that war the next time my people's blood is spilled it will be for atlantis not the surface world you're one of us too arthur your father my father was human but my duty is to atlantis i don't trust you jordan you are any surface dweller now leave and remind batman stay out of my seas and when that's on your doorstep atlantis will defend itself maybe sooner than you think we need to help each other go i don't need your distraction i'm not leaving need i remind you whose kingdom this is [Music] listen to reason arthur i'm sorry i i didn't come here to fight you this is exactly what happened up there first they take out communications then they invade they're your oceans but it's also my sector let me help you cover me ah uh [Music] my people are getting flanked hold this line be our rear guard on it and you i'm the vanguard [Music] we're locking down the gates but the fight's not over how sorry i was somewhere else where's this leave us you put yourself at risk for atlantis maybe you can be trusted so you're in i can't i belong here defending my people [Music] red lanterns atrocitus and dextar agents of vengeance powered by rage don't worry i'll handle these two ring to ring good luck you've been messing with my head haven't you atrocitus sinestro's yellow lantern slaughtered millions and their victims demand vengeance you may have cast off their ring but you are not absolved you're not the first person to tell me that dexter would tear your heart out and lock your blood but i sense you have a higher a spark glowing within you a spark of rage what are you doing what is this it's anger you may have overcome your fears but you still betrayed the green lanterns hurt your allies how could you ever forgive yourself i i can't [Music] become vengeance join the red lanterns no more evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evil smite beware my power green lanterns lights you're right i do hate myself for what i've done but my will is stronger than my hate your world is burning and when it is ashes you will beg for vengeance the guardians don't need to know about that one the beta phase is complete earth's defense is irreversibly compromised begin the countdown [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i circled the globe larger ships are being positioned over these major cities even with aquaman's marines we're still badly outnumbered what's the plan and you have one right we have to evacuate the occupied cities before taking on brainiac but we need firepower any heavy hitters on a luthor wayne payroll only blue beetle and firestorm but they're busy too busy for this they're the last line of defense if brainiac moves on superman well if brainiac doesn't try busting him out of prison black adam and wonder woman will the worse things get the more people will think we should let him out to help i'm just saying hope the new kids can hold down the most wanted man in the galaxy beetle and firestorm are green but together they're the most powerful team we have [Music] for real jaime batman does not think we're important aliens are invading and we're on guard duty guarding superman and his cronies who already have guards we're guarding guards we're redundant jason you need to step back taking the bigger picture i'd rather be in here than out there this suits an alien war machine and your guys's firestorm matrix we could take on brainiac and boom accidentally blow up the world jaime's right we haven't mastered these powers yet oh listen to yourselves you two we're badasses and badasses belong on the front lines this is the front line brainiac running amuck is a crisis brainiac and superman both that's an apocalypse so we're the only thing between a crisis and an apocalypse hmm i can get behind that brainiac or the superman fan club either way i suggest we fuse [Music] game on [Applause] [Music] [Music] red sun cell secure it must be the power center the power center if it goes down those generators shut off and he flies right out of here so [Music] so am i dreaming [Music] so here's the plan one of us takes adam the other restarts the generators before superman gets loose [Music] it's more likely you will die here i guess we're on the front lines now you're a naive boy with too much power much like the deceased billy batson maybe i really am a badass let's circle back lock down superman's cell the old man standards sure have dropped you noobs are so desperate to impress batman why he's weak if your papa's weak what's that make you i take after my mother professor stein wants to teach edibus here to respect his elders that you were one of those students thought he was smarter than the teacher thought i was smarter hothead no i know i am class dismissed wonder woman's outside keeping what's left of the guards busy if it wasn't her who let you out i did cara [Music] another kryptonian you recognize me cal my parents stored your image on my ship you're my protector sorry i'm a few decades late you and i left krypton at the same time but the explosion threw my ship off course way of course you haven't aged a day hyper sleep while you were growing up i was on ice i never thought i'd see family again someone with my eyes my own blood you knew my parents they loved you so much cal [Music] diana needs a hand cyborg how long give me five more minutes then it's lights out i don't want to leave you i'll be here she is not out of our league what happened to your confidence kryptonians happen come on batman's counting on us gotta hand it to palmer these people's cryptography is legit doesn't mean i won't break it victor behind you [Music] what's your melting point cyborg the red sun generators we need to reactivate that console before superman powers up amateur was over rookies i want cyborg i was the fan when you were qb for the four titans you had a cannon arm even then never thought i'd be a prison guard qv that was a long time ago and i'm not your prisoner anymore nobody's cheering for you now too much for batman i'm your only chance here's the thing superman batman asked us for help he didn't draft us make us sign a loyalty oath or threaten us with jail he won't go far enough that's why he'll fail stay away from him kryptonian huh the professor knows how to deal with you don't surrender we're freeing kal-el like it or not let's switch partners we need cal's help kid you have no idea what brainiac can do no but i know what superman can do guess you belong here too what did i tell you we got game professor and i trapped wonder woman under 10 feet of steel you fought valiantly but this battle's over you want me to do what a professor but that's crazy maybe we can control it but you're right no other option get out of here jaime you'll get a hell of a lot worse than a sunburn you blow up metropolis rather than let superman go let's save the earth firestorm stand down [Music] who are you superman's overprotective cousin you keep so many secrets but you can't stand it when one's kept from you can you you can't beat brainiac bruce you're right diana i can't [Music] you're ready to stop brainiac by any means necessary by the means at hand what's your game you're always three moves ahead saving the world is enough for now i'm never going back in that cell we'll cross that bridge later right now the world needs us [Music] you summoned me brainiac there have been surprising developments carl is free but more remarkably he is not the last kryptonian there is another refugee two kryptonians continuous plant is not yet at full strength but remember the kryptonians belong to me thanks to flash's recon we have locations for every ship in brainiac's fleet they're targeting major cities on every continent give us some privacy listen batman about the prison that was reckless don't pull a stunt like that again make up for it by finishing another mission discreetly we have to evacuate these cities before attacking the fleet but we need communications restored first so before we get started cyborg's going to fix brother i i am not that tech support that's not the issue victor cara saw firsthand how brainiac destroyed krypton she says we have less than 48 hours before he does the same to earth without tight coordination we'll lose valuable time and that means we fix brother i catwoman and harley will join you you'll need their help getting into the bad cave just give me the coordinates i'll open a portal and boom tube in you can't i reverse engineered your armor's motherbox technology try teleporting into the batcave instead of boom it'll go flat so how do we get in the old underground there's a tunnel entrance under arkham i'm taking you two to arkham asylum promise it won't be awkward or nothing i need a few hours in the solarium at the fortress of solitude assuming you haven't torn it down not yet damien adam you're with me and the rest of us we can't just sit here we plan our attack once brother eye's online we mobilize remember out there there's no regime not anymore so we do not kill [Music] let's go you're with me why'd you keep it keep what [Music] hmm forgot that was there [Music] [Music] your curse can never be undone this is the piece you deserve yeah right blondie sit tight she's had enough ones of bread this isn't your business clown you heard bats no killing you lecture me how much blood is on your ledger quinn oh buckets full honey i was trying too hard to impress the wrong guy kind of like you with superman [Music] [Music] you're losing too much blood this is gonna hurt a lot even better what do you think you're doing cara stopping you before you make a mistake that lunatic deserves to die maybe but she's defenseless she's had no trial you told me amazon spot with honor i trusted you diana you're gonna be okay i'll get you to a doctor cal can protect you superman oh blondie you're funny [Music] did you find anything i analyzed the kryptonian data like you asked you didn't miss anything they just didn't have an answer for brainiac there has to be something a blind spot a weakness brute force won't be enough if your powers are restored i should leave for conduct make sure its defenses are prepared brainiac hasn't attacked it yet the rock of eternity's magic hides conduct from prying eyes even brainiacs but i don't expect him to be fooled forever cal we need to talk give me a minute both of you damian told me what happened is diana all right she's fine but she was gonna kill harley i've never seen her so cold-blooded yes it's unfortunate i know what was she thinking it's unfortunate diana chose now to deal with harley more unfortunate that you got in the way what the joker sickened harley's mind beyond healing when she relapses innocent people will die innocent people are dying now she was helping us don't be naive cara harley's a criminal my only mistake was not dealing with her sooner diana said the joker was executed were you the one who i took one life to save millions but it wasn't just one cow was it how many how many everywhere i go people are afraid of this now i know why it's not how i wanted things but humans they've been slaughtering each other for millennia i stopped that violence humans need strong leadership we have to save them from themselves whose son are you jor hells or general zods don't let carlene the fortress hold on cara i'm realizing maybe your father locked you up for good reason superman's been more of a father than batman could ever be cal should be setting a better example you will submit cara ever since you found me everything you told me half truths lies to cover up your own evil you see the world as a child does good and evil are not constants their meanings defined by those with power [Music] lucky for you i find power and restraint kara please listen to me with our powers we can't hold back or the ones we love pay the price i'm sorry i wasn't here i couldn't help you but metropolis wasn't your fault i promised myself never again this isn't who we are the house of l isn't ruled by fear hope isn't enough to save the world without me they'd be dead i can help you i think about all you've lost cara what if you could have saved krypton i think about it every day then stand with me it's brainiac he's extracting the cities early then we fight back i must go to protect conduct go we're heading to metropolis what about her all that matters now is stopping brainiac but when this is over you need to choose you're either with me or against me uh [Music] help me no please why can't i stop this why won't you let me fight back how could there be order if brainiac wins humanity breeds chaos brainiac is order [Music] [Applause] superman and supergirl are almost here the others are tackling the fleet shouldn't we be in gotham brainiac controls the entire fleet from that skull ship take him down take them all down contacts dead ahead [Music] [Music] they gave us an opening locking on the skull ship shields five seconds to impact prepare to eject three seconds [Music] you're welcome what just happened brainiac's force shield is creating a concussive feedback loop so the harder we hit it the harder it hits back [Music] the kryptonians are incapacitated complete the extraction [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] no [Music] superman the force shield concentrates its energy at your point of attack move faster than it can and you might break through got it creative but insufficient decrease shield refresh interval to 10 [Music] picoseconds ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] uh cow [Music] [Music] i couldn't find his body i can't hear his heartbeat i was supposed to protect him from this from you and now he's gone i'm sure that's the best news you've heard all day i'll miss him too you mean that he was a good friend once i trusted him with my life but the joker got to him and i wasn't there to stop it i lost my friend clark and i've missed him ever since atlantis gone i didn't listen now we all die together no one's giving up yet anyone hear from beetle or firestorm this is your fault bruce cal and i would have beaten brainiac you should have followed our lead stop it diana millions of people are trapped on that ship we have to save them not lieutenant such discord no wonder humans have yet to expand their civilization beyond the confines of this tiny planet did you call in just a gloat nightmares are taking position while across your planet in one hour they will explode in unison burning the earth's atmosphere rendering this world and bare moon unless you surrender clara's orl she is krypton soul survivor and my last opportunity to study the effect of a yellow sun on kryptonian cells surrender her and i will spare this world even if i thought you'd honor that deal we wouldn't take it you have one hour to reconsider thanks for giving the new girl a chance but maybe i should go no we'll find a way to take down brainiac's shields we have to we could try shorting them out but we'd need to generate an insane amount of power perhaps science is not the answer so he might be vulnerable to a magic-based attack i can drive the immense magical power from the rock of eternity through the gateway in conduct but i need an artifact a medium to channel it something that can withstand the power how about the trident of atlantis yes that could work we get the shields down then what cyborg said brainiac controls the ship with his thoughts but i did cut him off from brother i it's possible i could make a signal disrupter that blocks his neural network if you get brainiac's shields down we can disarm those beta bombs then that's our plan aquaman adam get to kondo [Music] the rock of eternity is hidden in a pocket dimension i've refrained from opening the gateway to it since brainiac's invasion because it would draw his eye precisely once the door is opened it's only a matter of time before brainiac attacks a fight i look forward to a true leader serves his people you only serve yourself be that as it may i will be the only one who leaves this game you hurt my people grodd their name i will have justice not the day to test my resolve [Music] stupid humans the people of atlantis demand justice against brainiac i've seen his mind without his power but you can oh how's your head empty so not much has changed mary arrow out of the way uh [Music] cyborg where's that signal disrupter coming at you all you have to do is hit the trigger but it only jams a local area you need to get within arm's reach of brainiac good [Music] wow [Music] they did it shields are down supergirl on me victor help the others fight those betas [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] huh [Music] the signal gets stronger this way what is it voices millions of them [Applause] so many languages the kryptonians candor parco city home we have to help them i'm not sure we can there has to be a way [Music] oh until recently i had thought my collection of krypton to be complete your capture will make it so you have failed in every effort to oppose me you are not exceptional merely an ordinary specimen of a primitive species dispose of him [Music] so [Music] and i thought i could make an entrance where's cara captured somewhere on board we'll find her but we only have 20 minutes before brainiac's betas scorch the earth why aren't the others here they're attacking the betas just in case we don't pull through we will [Music] firestorm what happened to you brainiac unified our dueling minds no longer divided he's your walking bomb how do we get past him he has mastered the firestorm matrix all knowledge will be subsumed under his collection i've heard enough about brainiac in his collection you talked a big game back at my cell let's see how you stack up your immense is finite matrix we just found your limit [Music] you have a plan it's a work in progress i might be able to restore them that's new brainiacs adapt i can help him keep those baiters busy that's one thing hear me your power's being used against you against the green now let's get you free it should disrupt their link with brainiac firestorm's brain patterns are changing i can't read what's happening to swamp then jason professor stein yeah yeah we're both here what happened brainiac added a third mind to your head like we needed that what is this place brainiac ship firestorm will get you back on terra firma report to hal he'll need help fighting brainiac suicide babies sounds like a job for firestorm good luck no brainiac where is he i don't know the ship's walls are lined with lead bruce wayne of of earth your battles echo across the universe your war has had consequences neither of you could foresee the chaos you spread is a cancer upon the cosmos only brainiac can establish order i'll deal with him you hate magic i'll manage and i'll hunt down brainiac i've always respected you fate but brainiac can't destroy my home not again your misdeeds precipitated his arrival on this planet brainiac's curiosity was piqued by your decimation of the green lantern corps now he comes to spare humanity from the chaos you unleashed engines i'll carve out my own destiny the lords of order their voices are gone it's over kent i'm sorry for attacking the helm commanded me they can't command you anymore both of you have defied fate carted chaos but now to see you working together again you must keep order or the lords will impose it if not through brainiacs [Music] even a magical being like dr fate recognizes my superiority in time the entire universe will adhere to my design unless we stop you i offer nothing less than deliverance your environment is poisoned your civilization has exhausted its resources the earth's decline cannot be reversed we'll find a way we always do earth's time is up where's karen being vivisected she has already taught me much about the nature of your powers allow me to give you a proper demonstration i match your strength you cannot match my intellect you are only a kryptonian of which i have killed billions that was for krypton the attacks on the fleet are weakening him i could feel him losing steam as we fought good should make it easier to cut him off from the baiters ah um this is batman brainiac is down the disrupter worked all the betas are shutting down we did it now we find cara what's happening brainiac's mind is the ship's cpu apparently he doesn't have a backup system [Music] if we crash all the cities preserved on board destroyed clark wait you said yourself the ship is controlled by pure thought this could kill you sounds like a job for me [Music] oh [Music] uh create a bypass loop put the ship on autopilot try it my ship you will not destroy relinquish my ship oh you will regret that [Music] you are persistent but primitive theatrics cannot save you like you said i'm persistent we need to get you out of there not yet the cities [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] you're okay i thought it was too late but i can feel the heartbeat of atlantis brainiac's work is undone not all of it i couldn't save everyone some cities are still trapped in the collection others were lost wiped from the ship's memory coast city but we can still save them right carol my family i'm sorry hal first krypton now earth no other world should suffer this clark no even if i agreed that he should die you can't we need him alive to save the rest of our cities no we don't with more time and cyborg's help the ship will obey me or we could lose more cities bruce is right we can't be sure what we can be sure of is that brainiac puts everyone else at risk this is no different than joker if you killed him we might have it was never that simple diana yes it is bruce metropolis and coast city are gone how many more innocent people die before you accept that some lives need to be taken my powers how did you gold kryptonite courtesy of firestorm get up cal stay down enough exposure and you'll be de-powered permanently this madness has to end bruce [Applause] ugh you don't want to do this stop clark this is over [Music] [Applause] hmm [Music] um [Music] arthur don't do this you don't want to follow clark i'm not following anyone you've never understood atlantis bruce we are an ancient people with an old-fashioned sense of justice atlantis needs to get with the times i'm tired of fighting you arthur uh batman knew they double-crossed him we have to move [Applause] [Music] there's no escape you wish to fall so be it go back to conduct adam stay here and you'll be prosecuted you'd have to capture me batman the dive underestimated you for the last time all that ancient wisdom wasted supergirl where are you they're following me lead them to the cave [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] she let us write to him it's no accident you brought us here of course it isn't i warned him about diana but i didn't believe you'd turn on me this is the last time bruce no more secrets no more schemes schemes i'm not the one who stoked clark's worst fears to pacify man's world cal needed steel not compassion but you didn't bring peace you started a war your war is over fighting on the same side it felt like old times but i guess we both knew it would end this way do you remember that night when you told me lois was pregnant you knew even before i said anything that was a good memory from another lifetime i miss the people we were then too quick bruce you can't win you of all people know clark i never quit uh don't waste my time please don't get up give up or get hurt i never quit is he he'll be out for a while i'm sorry cara for what i couldn't save him kara it's safe now even without my powers the phantom zone can't hold me i'll be back we'll be ready [Music] gal i don't i wish we were family cara we still are i hope someday you'll see that [Music] are you all right no this symbol should give people hope [Music] he made them fear it that symbol's meaning is up to the person who wears it when clark and i founded the justice league we didn't govern people we protected them plain and simple maybe the world could use a team like that again welcome to the circle of trust there was no shortage of vendettas during superman's reign and no shortage of bounties for lobo to collect he became one of the richest men in the universe by assassinating those who ran a foul of the high councillor lobo's already massive ego inflated along with his rising wealth lobos searched for an assignment worthy of his abilities with so many super powered beings already dead at his hand however bounties were scarce lobo decided to use his wealth to create his own ultimate contract he would kill the denizens of new genesis home of the new gods not all heroes were destroyed by superman some were actually created by him a technology wizard barbara gordon had eluded detection by one earth intelligence feeding information to the insurgency under the code name oracle but after the regime's murder of her father gotham police commissioner james gordon barbara channeled her anger into a new alter-ego sensing the right opportunity to strike she attacked superman directly by defeating the high councilor she had announced batgirl to the world in impressive fashion the defeat of superman was a relief to zatanna during the regime she and dr fate had taken advantage of superman's vulnerability to magic and turned the tower of fate into a sanctuary for superman's enemies she had saved many lives but years of subterfuge weighed heavily upon her after the regime's downfall zatanna was instrumental in restraining meta-humans during their trials but when a jury recommended the death penalty for the more immutable defendants zatanna intervened she took the prisoners to the tower of fate there they would remain incarcerated but alive free of the phantom zone at last zod's first order of business superman's defeat had been accomplished now his revenge could be fully realized his time in the phantom zone had allowed zod to learn its secrets he had even learned from one of his fellow residents how to call forth small pockets of it at will after introducing superman to its mind-numbing emptiness zod claimed the high counselorship and began to rebuild earth in the image of mighty krypton banishing his friend and former teammate superman to the phantom zone was difficult for jean jones but necessary as the one earth regime had formed jean ever the outsider had chosen to watch from a distance to bide his time he assumed the form of an atlantean and served as royal archivist aquaman little suspected that his trusted subject's uncanny ability to gather news of the surface world was the result of telepathic powers when john learned that heroes from a parallel dimension were aiding batman's insurgency he assisted as well leading rescue operations of metropolis and gotham after superman's rampage in the post-regime era the martian manhunter continued to serve his adopted world gathering the next generation of heroes to form a new justice league the fool in the red cape had been dealt with now scorpion would learn how he came to this place heretofore only the sorcerer quan chi or the fallen elder god shinnok could have summoned him scorpion's answers appeared in the form of trigon who accused scorpion of deserting trigon's demon army and stealing from him the glory of besting the high councillor the two faced each other in a titanic struggle scorpion emerged the victor and assumed control of trigon's invasion force soon this strange new land would be his to rule wonder woman returned home to find her dimension in ruins aware of superman's despotic rule of the parallel dimension the gods of olympus vowed to preemptively eliminate the metahuman scourge from their world under the direction of zeus they hunted down and eliminated nearly all super-powered mortals all that remained to oppose them was themiscara wonder woman and her amazons fought back against the olympians with unrelenting courage despite heavy losses wonder woman's forces ultimately prevailed they took reign as the new olympians ushering in an age of peace and prosperity though pleased with the outcome superman's battle with his duplicate left him troubled if one superman could go so far astray why not another preventative measures were in order after much discussion with his fellow justice leaguers superman ingested a remote release kryptonite capsule at any sign of instability the kryptonite would permeate his body killing him the question of who could trigger the device was solved democratically each week a different leaguer would take possession of its remote control only batman was denied a shift the battle over grundy eluded capture and returned to his swamp to heal his wounds during regeneration grundy found he could channel the elemental force of the red all animal life would bend to his room his increased power also allowed him to resurrect the long lost gray force now instead of ruling earth's creatures he could simply destroy them after defeating the world's heroes grundy turned earth into his version of paradise he now rules over a grey and lifeless planet [Music] when superman's one earth regime proved to be a failure similar to his on korrigar sinestro retreated to deep space to ruminate on its demise fear had long seemed the most powerful of the emotions with which to bring order to the universe yet it had not been enough desperate sinestro hurled the might of the sinestro corps against the life entity keeper of the white power battery ultimately victorious sinestro now wielded the power of a white lantern no adversary could possibly withstand him the light of the green lantern corps would be the first he would extinguish [Music] following the events in the parallel dimension shazam's fellow heroes returned home but an alien virus contracted during the transfer created in them acute mental instability they turned on their fellow crime fighters in a deranged fury alone and desperate shazam shared the power of the word with his adopted brothers and sisters their purity of heart gave them courage the army of shazam incapacitated the former heroes eventually they took the place of the justice league as primary defenders of earth winning the battle with superman cost raven dearly the amount of demonic energy required overwhelmed her after regaining consciousness she looked around wearily her immediate surroundings were a hellish ruin nearby stood her father trigon raven had somehow called him forth during her battle trigon thanked his daughter he then summoned an army of demons and set out to destroy the rest of the planet the defeat of superman filled harley with confidence she knew what she was capable of and knew what she wanted she traveled to the visitors earth and freed the joker from prison returning to her world they married in a ceremony that set gotham ablaze at the reception the cake-cutting ceremony took a gruesome turn as her new husband playfully mashed her face into the cake years of abuse took its toll something in harley snapped she used the ceremonial knife to slash joker's throat still wearing her wedding gown harley now resides permanently in arkham asylum free of his brainwashing hawkgirl exacted revenge on the high counsellor for murdering her husband hawkman she was nevertheless sent to prison for her role in the regime one night she awoke hovering above her cot glowing with eldritch light an instant later she stood at the bottom of a shallow crater there she found the source of the light a meteorite of pure and metal as she touched it the meteorite sprung to life encasing her in ents metal the new armor made hawk girl invincible her first act vengeance against those who had helped superman capture hawkman though he had failed to elevate the joker clan status joker was convinced a similar organization could be successful in his dimension joker used a series of devastating terrorist acts to frighten the populace then convinced the more gullible among them that he was the path to security the new joker clan soon had millions of members worldwide and committed regular anti-government attacks wreaking havoc on the global economy killer frost reveled in her victory but her overconfidence betrayed her seizing the opportunity agents of star labs captured her their scientists harnessed her freezing power in order to fortify the world's polar ice caps but star labs underestimated frost's abilities turning on her captors she froze their facility and eventually the entire western hemisphere the survivors now struggle to overthrow the self-proclaimed ice queen [Music] a win against this world superman was greatly satisfying but its aftermath would be sweeter still luthor had travelled to this dimension to convince its residents that he was there luthor who had miraculously survived the high councillors globally televised attack on him beloved before the triumphant luthor was now worshiped he was elected president of the united states but soon looked to further consolidate his power nightwing had beaten his former boss superman in single combat not even batman had done that his thirst for conflict grew he began challenging anyone who crossed his path nightwing's belligerence eventually drew the attention of sinestro his core was always in need of new recruits and the young humans seemed able to inspire great fear sinestro had his suspicions confirmed when a yellow power ring found its way onto nightwing's finger [Music] mere days after returning to his earth green lantern in an event mirroring his ascension to the core witnessed the crash landing of an alien ship investigating the wreckage he encountered the pilot who claimed to be abin sur but this abin sir wore no power ring and referred to him in halting breaths as the almighty one green lantern tried to convince the alien of their past that abin sur had named hal jordan his successor as the green lantern of sector 2814 but the alien died from his wounds before lantern could learn more of him lantern left immediately for owa the guardians were his only hope of solving this mystery [Music] after the fall of superman green arrow visited the star city of this parallel earth his counterpart was one of the first heroes to fall in the battle against superman one of the first to object to the man of steel's new tactics and reasoning a memorial erected in star city's orchid bay served as a reminder of the need to fight oppression regardless of the odds there green arrow found that one citizen wasn't content to memorialize oliver queen in stone with green arrows training a new archer dressed in crimson took up the fallen hero's mantle let star cities criminals beware the night belongs to red arrow flash had taken down the high councillor but the atrocities he had abetted during superman's regime continued to haunt him his shame eventually drove him into exile whether wishing to make further amends or simply unable to stop himself flash continued to use his powers in the pursuit of justice rumors of a mysterious red streak of energy that would set upon and incapacitate criminals circulated throughout central city while only some deduced his true name most felt gratitude and affection for the new hero they called the ghost free of superman's control doomsday eradicated the remaining metahumans he then manipulated technology in the abandoned fortress of solitude to terraform the earth it soon resembled prehistoric krypton at last it felt like home after a few years of exterminating humanity at his leisure however doomsday needed a challenge having assimilated superman's ability to fly he headed for a nearby space sector he had heard rumors of an opponent worthy of his attention a suzani and mercenary with a taste for violence doomsday was eager to meet this lobo in battle with superman's regime toppled new governments formed to take its place new governments meant new customers for deathstroke and business was booming soon there were more assassinations to carry out revolutions to aid and unrest to create than he could manage on his own the one earth regime's elite troopers having committed atrocities in superman's name had gone into hiding from a populist bent on revenge impossible for most to find but not for deathstroke recruiting these renegades he formed the new titans the world's premier political assassins after superman's defeat cyborg led the assault on the fortress of solitude to flush out remnants of the high councillor's regime the fortress was well defended the battle intense cyborg was forced to use unfamiliar kryptonian tools to make repairs to his damaged cybernetics enhanced with the alien technology cyborg found he could communicate with superman's androids and order them to apprehend the opposition with his army of super androids cyborg will bring justice to the world victory over superman was only the beginning of aquaman's rise to power uniting the world's oceans under the banner of atlantis aquaman had a controlling interest in the planet's ecology and economy his influence did not escape the attention of the world's multinational corporations who looked to end his reign villains lured by the promise of big money to assassinate the king of atlantis pursued him relentlessly but aquaman's popularity served him well the world citizens rose up in anger against those who would quell aquaman's influence the threat debated a groundswell of support began for a united earth under aquaman's command superman's defeat did not work to aries advantage as he had planned the heroes of the parallel dimension helped this world's batman build a conflict-free utopia that left the war guard vanished on the brink of death ares managed to imprison brainiac 5. he forced brainiac to create a time loop beginning with the other dimensional hero's arrival and ending just before their victory in this pocket of time ares flourished endless war was his to save her superman had been a fool to believe bane would willingly accept a subordinate role in the one earth government with the high councillor out of the way true leadership could begin though they lacked intelligence bain found in sinestro and black adam inspiring examples of ruthless absolute authority they reciprocated his regard for their talents the three former villains regained control of the planet and formed a ruling triad that would be uninterrupted until the next phase of bain's plan following the battle to liberate earth batman learned that luthor had bequeathed his massive fortune to bruce wayne he now had the means to rebuild gotham and metropolis the city's residents inspired by their hero's efforts adopted the slogan we are batman they contributed countless hours to their communities renovation and crime prevention the batman of old would have stubbornly assumed these tasks alone the post won earth batman having been rewarded for his trust in others enjoyed his city's renewal and his role as its benefactor at last superman had paid for what he had done to catwoman feigning allegiance to his regime had cost selena her beloved batman and her best chance at happiness pride and anger kept her from attempting reconciliation with bruce wayne but his inspiring reconstruction of gotham and metropolis forced it in her a desire to remain close to him until she was ready to approach him again she did her part to keep gotham streets clear of crime nascent underworld organizations had both the bat and the cat to fear the defeat of superman taught black adam one thing most of earth's denizens were too weak to adopt conduct's visionary form of government he returned to his homeland with a new plan combining their energies black adam and his empress isis created a mystical barrier around conduct there they reigned in peace their country an oasis in the wasteland of human civilization a true oasis once black adam had destroyed all other life on earth foreign
