progress hey there hey thanks for coming with me Pete you're brave we're gonna have to be careful here I'm not supposed to be here after hours I hope it's better than the first time I snuck in that was not fun we're not sneaking in investigating weird things happen here after-hours stuff the doctor smites trying to get rid of he's a bad guy you know he wants to turn this company around yeah that's what the video says so what exactly is rotten in the state of oz hornz I think they're continuing dr. Conners work cross-species experiments come on whoa whoa no like making more lizards making more everything I'm not sure but we're gonna find out tonight Oscorp has the geniuses and the resources why can't it be a benefit to people that's why I came back and dr. Smythe wants to change those I know possible his brilliant research uh sure in a new era called humanity okay just wait a second nature do man man's a machine compared to our future well definitely safe out here guess we'll never get in keep your head down a guiding hand Wow look at all this I knew dr. Smyth was the nanobot guy but had no idea yet Bing BOTS - I can't believe you get to play with this stuff every day it never gets old [Music] well what is that okay you all right yeah thanks doctor what are you doing it's okay it's okay they're with me what are you do we can't when you know you're not supposed to be here after hours especially with a guest dr. Smith I am so so sorry this is my friend Peter Parker Peter Parker I've heard about you I'm hearing a lot about you tonight so why are you here I'm totally too plain doc I I'm amazed at what you've done with Oscorp hey when I heard about the changes you are making you know nanobots I wanted to see them for myself you've worked with Connors right funny finding you here now as I waste my time trying to dispose of these cross species so this is a cross species you promised me that all of Connors work was over but how many more do we keep here I told you the truth the experiments have stopped just not as early as I'd hoped no more humans turning into animals like Connors did but what you see here is what happens when an animal gets a nice dose of human DNA here follow me I trust you'll keep everything you see in the strictest confidence another one of these cross species this is crazy the lizard almost destroyed the city what rational mind would continue to create these things changing the ethics of a large corporation takes time now some scientists argue that these pathetic creatures have some benefit but they lost in that argument as of tonight these cross species disappear we're shipping them to our bio lab for safe disposal out-of-sight out-of-mind has this thing eaten today it always looks like that they went father with Connors work that we realized the species of this room are incredibly dangerous and highly contagious that's the containment units walking disease any direct contact with it leads to infection infection leads to death or becoming across species yourself I want to keep you human Parker let's keep moving is there a cure the world for these things no they were never human to begin with they were born in a petri dish for the poor humans it infects unfortunately not attempt to develop an antidote have been unsuccessful I don't want to seem cruel but you have to understand that thing is pure permanent creatures like this brought Europe to its knees in the play I think he likes me that's strange it only reacts like that when it's around of it I mean other handsome guys like me I'm used to it I'd like robots biological creatures are unpredictable I much prefer things I can control unpredictable huh what is that an iguana this has to be the strangest office tour I have ever been on don't worry partner our next stop is the nanobot lab once you see it hey excuse me dr. Smyth I need someone with special clearance to help me take this down to be sector I don't have time for this like when maybe it's a good thing you're here you can deal with some of this bureaucratic nonsense a punishment for trespassing go with him and catch up with us when you're done doctor I think I'll escort her you know make sure she doesn't get eaten I understand the Beast is as enthralled by beauty as madness meet me in the lab when you're done and don't wonder it's an order miss Stacy sure dr. Smythe come on Keith I'm great meeting you dr. likewise Bar it is that you gotta be kidding me that's taking things a little far isn't it the terrible legacy but dr. Smyth says we're putting it in the past I believe him what would you do i I didn't do anything Peter I think it I'll sign a waiver later I can help and I wanna finish it on my toes this can't be happening no look at me [Music] [Music] when are you okay oh I'll be fine baby give it to the poor 19 area I can help you save the other scientists from their robots looked like they want to eat me for watch programmed to defend us against cross-species which I guess you technically are so yeah watch out Pete [Music] oh yeah maybe you can web swing across these things get out of Oscar think about what is right now more robots watch out [Music] every robot has to attack me [Music] this cake when I'm a light packer to get out of here [Music] [Music] the doors can see it we need to find another way right Oscorp security system quarantines on the other side stay here Quentin come back to get you [Music] getting you to safety thanks Pete [Music] I need to get the others before this really gets out of hand hey I think we both know but this is already out of hand dr. Smyth will have some answers find him I'll try but when I have to ask what's gonna happen to you I don't know but it's not going to be good I'm infected Pete we all are you remember what happened to Connors this only leads to one thing but what about the antidote if it worked before Connors was exposed to an earlier strain you couldn't even call it a virus back then it's evolved mutated there's no antidote to cure this what if I stopped all the cross species there's no question they should be stopped but even if they are there's there's still a risk that the virus will spread Gwen stay calm I'm not gonna let anything happen to you okay we'll figure it out I'll find dr. Smyth and the others hopefully it's not too late wait Peter take the oven on the table no what it's the name of the Oscorp phone it's still a prototype but at least I'll be able to call you okay I'll get back as soon as I can [Music] you [Music] it's my fake it yes I got him and the other scientists to the quarantine but they're all infected and the cross-species where are they I tried to stop them but they escaped you caught me the lizard why should these creatures be any different uh you have no idea [Music] you
