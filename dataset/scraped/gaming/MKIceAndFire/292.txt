the castillo administration's pride and joy let us begin the architecture impressive today i am honored and excited to share with you the miracle of aviro a revolutionary cancer treatment 13 years ago the brilliant biochemist dr ed guerrez discovered a compound unique to yara that slows cancer cell growth but it is presidente anton castillo's full support that allows us to produce this all-natural drug come witness a breakthrough of innovation generosity and true yarn spirit follow me special for the inside tour you really make the reporter feel special anything for you nikolai it all starts with nicotiana yarana our native tobacco plant grown in our western farmlands our tobacco is world famous for its unique flavor wondering what made it so unique dr reyes studied the plant's properties and i don't mean he smoked a lot of cigars he found a compound that actually slows cancer cell division practically to a halt this way my lovely people ready for the next part of our video dr reyes found that natural tobacco crops produced a limited amount of the compound so president anton commissioned yara's best minds to work with dr reyes to design an all-natural fertilizer pg-240 sprayed on like a hairspray it uses gene therapy and nutrients to boost production of the compound if you look this tobacco has large red leaves this is from the fertilizer beautiful note uro organic or exotico no would anyone like to spray their plants come press this button it is so much fun this is the beginning of the viviro process using mckay to sidestep embargoes was considered quite controversial those critics only want to profit from cancer from death they see us as a threat so they try to ruin us this way por favor [Music] okay closer closer get into it i want you to hear me in central yara our finest scientists extract refine and package the cancer-fighting tobacco compound called yarantine found only in yaren tobacco dr reyes thinks yarantine is why our cigars are so smooth delicious and beneficial no i smoke one cigar a week and it keeps me skinny and strong it's true okay that's the tour our interactive stations are now available for you to enjoy when you are ready join me by the gate in the outdoor lounge for a surprise guest there are rumors that farmers exposed to pg 240 are actually developing cancer from it rumors spread by fools and belief by idiots is not true uh-huh right and packaged into the pharmaceutical products used to treat cancer and keep castile in power a country rich in technology agriculture and spirit one man combined these things resulting in an explosion of innovation in 2008 dr edgar reyes wondered why yaron tobacco was world famous for his unparalleled food flavor his research led him to guarantee a phytochemical alkaloid unique to the plant during this he discovered he stole the growth of cancer cells reyes enhanced potency through gene therapy delivered via a natural fertilizer spray called pg-240 future president anton castillo saw these innovations on limited potential to rebuild paradise in yara he joined reyes to develop an organic cancer treatment known worldwide as viviro as you watch this people in countries that recognize president castillo's vision are receiving this treatment which targets most known cancers gracias for watching this presentation on the natural solution 2014 pharmaceutical sciences and
