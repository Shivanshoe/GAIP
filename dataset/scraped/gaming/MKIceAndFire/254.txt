status i'm working with cash to get everyone back to gcpd when you're done return to the ship crocs not getting away so what took you ah you miss me the security door below is unlocked we can head deeper into the airship yeah would want to keep the giant man eating escaped convict waiting so we tracked the subject back to its den located beneath the founders island lighthouse it suffered minor injuries during capture fortunately wounds did not impede immediate testing the creature's regenerative healing factor is quite remarkable superficial lesions can repair almost instantaneously and the subject's hand is now fully withdrawn post-amputation further surgeries have been scheduled to see whether tissue growth can be accelerated human trials are underway stabilizing the recombinant dna is our next step we have lots of work ahead of us as an aside the subject's physiology is altering possibly as an adaptive response to sedatives trauma becoming less effective termination although undesirable must be considered the warden was experimenting on croc and the other prisoners trying to weaponize his condition looks like croc wants payback can't say i blame it we tracked the subject back to its den located beneath the founders island lighthouse it suffered minor injuries during capture fortunately we must be directly ahead i'll take the floor great see you on the other side features regenerative healing factor is quite remarkable let me go you made it worse fix me i can't your mutation is aggravated by trauma there's nothing we can do kill him whip his head off see if it grows back he suffers first like us yeah animals all of you let's show him what animals can do he will fix me i can't son of a he's lying i think he needs convincing to tell the truth you won't hurt

island well i presume it's the league sir the reporting officer's precise words were thanks alfred i'll investigate i miss scarecrow speeches the real halloweeny this is definitely funnier though both dead few people can kill two league assassins i should set up a crime scene injuries consistent with slashing attacks from a long sharp blade like our own sword same injury pattern different uniform they were fighting each other a third sword dropped in a hurry blood type doesn't match the other bodies someone got away whoever got away was injured badly i should search the other rooftops try and pick up her trail found it this should lead me to some answers yeah i batman once broke my arm in three places but the way i see it lightning ain't gonna strike the same place twice alfred the assassins appear to be fighting one another i'm following a survivor's trail civil war amongst the league how is that possible is not known for restraint when it comes to punishing dissent his body went missing after arkham city i thought the league had revived him but perhaps not sir if the league has a new leader or leaders they could be even more dangerous than rage i better take these militia guys be careful the bat's got a cannon on his car he's kicking ass don't worry i'll let you know when it's gonna happen well did any of you see where she went i barely saw her coming what was the city of thinking anyway you see a ninja you let the ninja pass it's common sense and basic courtesy [Music] from now on first an army turns up then giant plants burst out of the ground i thought gotham would be easy pickings tonight i can't believe the losers in this town spend a decade getting the crap kicked out of them by bruce wayne i could take them easy who's leading the militia now look i know he's dead through the duct into elliott memorial hospital i'll have to power down that generator to gain access remember your training follow our orders you are initiates you are untempered steel these battles will forge your minds and bodies into blades the league will wield the rebellion is weak rotten with disloyalty you will strike at its treacherous heart soon they will come when they arrive you strike at my command for the league for the league for the league strike two the blood trail leads through here but the automated door has no power i need to find a way to open it [Music] alfred i need to restore power to elliott memorial well let's see ah there's a backup generator located on the exterior of the building sir thanks alfred i need to stay within range of the remote control i need to stay within range of the remote control [Music] [Music] oh the demon's head must never rise again [Music] so the trail heads over the damaged floor into the morgue i need to find a way in so so [Music] [Music] [Music] she's dead blood loss i imagine sir looks like she was trying to press this booby-trapped must be more complex than a single button i should reconstruct her last moments she hit the switch here looks like she pressed the lower switch here she pressed the switch here she attempted to press this switch before succumbing to her injuries [Music] race you dare approach rachel ghoul you've brought him back too many times the lazarus streams all that's keeping him alive he will rise again seize your blade there will be no fighting here but war is coming traitors to the league conspire to stop the glorious resurrection of rey chalgool we will see gotham burn before we let the rebels hurt our master then let him die i want you gone by morning the rebels have found another pit a pure source a sample of his essence is all he would need i won't help you revive him then you'll face the consequences of war we know you detective you will not let innocence die yet you will not kill the demon's head to prevent their deaths you will do as we ask because your precious morality compels you to detective help me fortaria he will rise again [Music] sir you could restore his health and then hand him over to the proper authorities you know no prison can hold him alfred besides he'll outlive any sentence what are you going to do find the other lazarus pit stop falling into the wrong hands [Music] do as we command and return swiftly dark knight you live only by the grace of the demon's head alfred calibrate the batmobile sensors to search for trace lazarus particles in the city water supply it should lead me to the source absolutely sir sending you the real-time visual data now is [Music] nice driving idiot is right there just go you

does race know his daughter fights for the rebels the rebels fight for me and that zombie no longer knows his own name or the day of the week or that his other daughter died i'm sorry about talia she was a loyal fool i am neither you understand so long as my father's corpses strapped to those tubes there will be war in gotham what do you want nessa go back to him destroy that foul machine and let that thing that was once my father finally died i'm no killer he's already dead he has died a thousand times and every time the lazarus pit restored him he came back worse more hateful more crazed i trembled to imagine what he would have become if this had fallen into his followers hands but with him gone the league will be mine and it will shed no more innocent blood the assassins will leave gotham never to return how can i trust you i swear by the woman we both loved i swear on my sister's grave i will win this war dark knight it's up to you how long it rages for [Music] i don't care if the gas is gone batman still ain't one to fight deathstroke's back in town and i thought things were going to count down you said you were getting the smokes that's the whole reason we raided that damn place sir nissa was always the most reasonable member of the family but do you trust her i do and are you prepared to end the life for her sir sir if you don't mind i just wanted to suggest that given rishi's supernatural longevity and his current state of artificially prolonged existence not to mention the fact that he has in essence already died a case could be made that well um i swore i'd never kill he's a dangerous uncompromising zealot sir restored to full strength there's no telling what he'll do or who he might hurt is preventing some ungodly resurrection truly the same as taking a life what would you do alfred i don't know sir but i'll stand by you whatever you choose the loyalists have set up defenses against rebel attacks how considerate of them sir so you weren't a good man ray but you had conviction stop him kill him head kill them [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] father what a monster you've let yourself become how long does he have maybe hours maybe days it doesn't matter there's no way back for him now i'll take him to gcpd good the loyalists will scatter and i'll be true to my word the league has no business in gotham from now on nissa don't make me regret this or you will [Music] detective proud of you [Music] uh okay [Music] you
