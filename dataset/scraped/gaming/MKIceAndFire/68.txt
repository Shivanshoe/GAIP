he said you were retiring but might need some help on a movie only [ __ ] retire michael him and my son they want to put me out to pasture so they can turn this place into condos or a theme park or something but this place is a dream factory well maybe they have different dreams some days i don't blame them you know they always say never work with children or animals well i want to add to that list never work with directors or actors this picture is going to kill me all right so what's it about it's perfect set in liberty city meltdown it's all being shot on green screen right out back there we take a look at the financial crisis and then we boil it all down into a really simplistic battle between two yuppies lots of training montages so what's the problem milton mcelroy i cast him in the second lead because he's cheap zero talent incidentally well he's got this new agent rocco pelosi he's been hassling us about renegotiating the deal so now he's holding up shooting until he gets paid that sounds problematic it would be if the director wanted to shoot anton baudelaire ever heard of him that doesn't surprise me now he's having a mental breakdown pissing all over himself who knows where all right looks like you got yourself that new assistant but no happy endings i love you already hmm [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow hey solomon i'm just doing that thing good good now i realized in my excitement i forgot some details yeah seemed obvious you want this pelosi guy clipped no god no is that an option no no no bad idea bad idea no clipping anyone just teach him some manners he's also in my director's ear as well if you'd believe it so teach this punk a lesson and bring the talent back to set ideally in a more collaborative mood i'll see what i can do they all going to be at the club i'm told it isn't a club so much as a rat pit anton and milton are supposed to be there and pelosi's on the way to pick them up he's taking them to his lawyer to sign the contracts so if he hears there's someone from the studio coming he'll get him out fast all right i'll go in quiet i'll see you on the set boss no way [Applause] [Music] [Applause] gentlemen how you like this space it's gonna be an edm paradise there's gonna be sparklers stuck in models implants [ __ ] stamps all the real [ __ ] that's pelosi entertainment and give me a minute here just a minute i gotta go grab something inside johnny we nearly got the club we're finally a go and you take care of these guys no cold feet okay let's go it's hard to tell with these mob guys i don't know if he actually you've seen the movies right it's the kind of scam they run oh excuse excuse me you can't be here hold on [ __ ] this is just work and i can go [Music] day trips over gentlemen you're going back to set you get lost wrinkles who's this jackass hey you oh turns out these guys are in love with their contract so they'll be going back to the set with me can you believe this [ __ ] clown

business as well your fine wood career just ended before it began buddy i don't do stunts you meant to go with him you're more sensitive than you let out i okay see that wasn't so hard now let's get you back to work hey milton what i think you owe an apology to mr richards would i be in pain no you should apologize to me a brutal honesty bud you're not that good it feels folded you're lucky you're working at all you're kidding me right i am an artist dude i'm you're apologizing when you see solomon you say sorry for the misunderstanding sir and you will always always appreciate the opportunity he's given you now where am i putting this thing down when devin winston came to do a studio visit use the empty water tank all right and we'll do the same put it there the water tank

you not good doc not good at all well we spent a lot of time over the years discussing how negative actions lead to negative thoughts as much as the reverse because of the compounding of your classical low self-esteem with your assorted sexual hang-ups the desperate search for the easy answer in life and your profound narcissism reality will have a habit of handing you a repeated kicking anyway what's up well doc when you put it like that i'm afraid i ain't got much hope have you been acting out again michael things are bad doc really bad tell me all about it sharing is winning i'm out in the desert now doc my wife left me my kids ah christ we upset some guy but that wasn't enough we stole his wife now we gotta leave town i'm living in a trailer with my psycho old buddy trevor
