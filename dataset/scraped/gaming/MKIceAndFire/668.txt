agent 47 and diana burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ica unknowingly they have been hired by a shadow client to target a number of operatives of providence a secret organization working in the highest echelons of power providence's controller the constant approaches diana and makes her a deal eliminate the shadow client and learn about 47's past but when 47 discovers that the shadow client is lucas grey his lost childhood friend he and diana switch sides to fulfill an old pact destroy providence together they managed to capture the constant forcing him to reveal the identities of the three providence partners eliminate them and the war would be over however the constant has an ace up his sleeve look closer in the shadows behind the everyday world beyond the headlines and the suits of power a hidden hand [Music] a kind of company known as providence to it we were just assets to use and throw away to do the unthinkable the unforgivable and it never gave us a second thought until now after decades in the shadows we are fighting back me and 47 much has been lost but we are closer than ever we trapped the constant providence's chief controller and finally learnt the names of its three partners in their downfall we lay the past to rest and just maybe look towards the future it's time [Music] [Music] the partners are down there you know i never planned this fire ahead you never do i see someone got his memory back wait is that a beacon alexa carlisle's helicopter just took off confirmed target locations over diana that's the status right we have a situation carlisle has left the building and i think i know why the constant has escaped he persuaded one of the sailors into setting him free and since then he's been seizing control of providence assets and resources i can only assume carlisle is rushing to contain the damage if she slips away again we'll keep track of her make sure she doesn't meanwhile the plan stays the same your destination is the scepter the world's tallest building where the partners are laying low courtesy of their host sheikh omar al-ghazali marcus stuyvesant is 5th generation old money his family made its fortune in real estate and banking and were at one point the chief landowners in new york carl ingram is a powerful washington king maker whose family grew rich selling gunpowder during the american civil war and later established a globe-spanning empire in oil coal and steel both families long since retreated from public view but their quiet dominance endures to this day now the partners likely suspect that we're coming so mr gray will infiltrate building controls and disable all electronic doors and elevators stuyvesant and ingram are about to find they have nowhere left to run right this is our moment 47 providence ruined our lives with the flick of a pen today we return the favor happy hunting hey [Music] welcome to dubai 47 today is the inauguration of the scepter and the ceremony is well underway you will find marcus stuyvesant near the building's signature art installation while a paranoid carl ingram has ensconced himself in his penthouse suite security on

called us into another meeting so now we've got to memorize new lists and guest names passwords for the terminals and new special dietary needs i mean there's an actual limit to the amount of information the human brain can contain and i'm pretty sure i've hit it and to top it off they just told us we wouldn't be getting overtime payment because we just expect it to be here can you believe it god could this day get any worse oh blessed silence final thank you god [Music] look this is gonna make me look really bad sure it's around here somewhere don't you worry a colleague is also out

to punctuality i i was supposed to be ready to present my papers half an hour ago you met in the army with raw papers are you making fun of me that's so cruel do you do you know what a man is without his gun a man in his boxes crying like a baby you women will never understand and i don't think we ever win i think i can open that window remotely scan the lock with your camera and i'll have a try this is ridiculous someone else deal with this uh so hello sir reporting for duty about time our client has been going out of his mind waiting for you do you have the papers yes good i'll call him now

arrived yes sir see you soon okay wait here he'll be here shortly mumbai okay you must be my new escort i have very high standards and trust you will do your duty you have your credentials on you let me see here yes that looks good i like it a cutlery expert no less i have no idea what that means but your cv is very impressive this looks perfect come on let's walk i need to tell you a bit about what i expect from you i expect you to be by my side 24 7 and as i say otherwise bathroom breaks are of course permitted but only when i say so i have a very important and delicate meeting today in which i expect you to keep your ears closed but your eyes wide open understood now your papers were indeed impressive but i need to see what you can do with my own eyes my father used to take me hunting he was an avid hunter i personally hated it but always admired his skill with a knife and grew to appreciate what it takes to gut an animal have you ever tried to cut an animal yes good then you know it's not so easy as it looks like trying to stab a rubber ball bounce his back if you don't stab it correctly you're almost here you have to understand i didn't get where i am by blind faith okay we are almost there you see the shooting targets any fool can shoot a target but with a knife that's where the talent lies my father always used to say if you are good with a knife you're even better with a gun i want to see your skills i don't know why but i've always trusted a man who would throw a knife i'm sure psychiatrist would have a field day with that statement so show me what you got do well and you work for me fail you get out of here and i never want to see your face again that's just cookies half as good as you were only time will tell but i doubt you cocky idiot look at that not bad at all performance i like you i think we will get along just fine you've gained his trust what to do with all that take the rest of the day off you deserve it thank you sir it was an honor thank you sir you impressed me you really did please give me some space now you impressed me you really did but let's get to work some things you should know about me and this is very much on a need to know basis i'm here incognito so i want you to stay close but not too close especially when we are out in public if you see a man with a bodyguard it draws attention understood yeah of course you do come on follow me the second they're using the word catastrophic i stop caring about the actual odds look it's just a precaution i've been personally invited by the royal highness omar al-ghazali i should have clearance the name is zaina kazeem sir i understand zana kazeem aka the vulture one of the top agents working for crystal dawn the pan-african terrorist organization i almost hired him myself once but chose the maelstrom instead now what is his business here but you can't enter without being searched it's standard procedure this is ridiculous well that's how it is think about it and come back if you want i'll be waiting upstairs in the reception understood crystal listen i want to talk to the partners directly make them understand why all of this is happening and that terminal gives me an idea and there's a server room near the sheik's personal reception if you can gain access to it we might be able to recover useful intel from it you'll have to work together to hack the system but it's our best shot no you were being a now go away and binge eat some celery or whatever idiots like you do or i'll do something worse than blowing cancer in your face oh my god what is your problem you are sick you have no idea hello sir okay and she's getting rich on them what's up if you want to pass you need to comply to a frisk sir nothing to worry about it's simple protocol sir you're good to go sir thank you for your patience oh mr kazeem i'm glad you changed your mind arrogance can be a dangerous trait yes indeed it can mr ingram has been expecting you we have a conference room set up for you how you been please go in and make yourself comfortable mr ingram will be with you shortly thank you so mr kazeem a pleasure to meet you omar tells me great things about you i'll get straight to the point i have uh well let's call it a dispute which the royal highness tells me you're very capable of taking care of now i've worked with your organization before in morocco i believe so i'm a little hesitant don't be we do what's needed well only time will tell i have two assignments for you take care of the first one and then we can discuss the bigger fish now on to the first an acute problem has been brought to my attention keep talking i'll be candid with you no one is supposed to know that i'm here however there's a journalist down at the inauguration and he's asking rather intrusive questions about who's staying up here and that is a very dangerous problem for me now i want you to silence this little pain you think you can do that it's what i do best i like your bluntness this is his file hands looked bullets are winning free lance journalist he's good and won't give up until he gets the answers he needs and that can't happen consider it done good man and remember i want a picture i want proof so i can sleep tonight of course once this little assignment is completed come back and talk to miss toe then we can discuss the real cancer that needs to be removed i'm sure you can see yourself out hello yeah i just want to remind you about the how are you hello don't mean deprived but upstairs do you by any chance know who's staying there i i hear it's not just the royal highness i'm going to ask you politely to move along i don't appreciate your line of questioning well i was just curious but thanks for your time maybe not keep asking mr looked i hear you're looking for information oh really okay hey what's happening upstairs i know more than you could imagine but we can't talk here follow me great lead the way i hope it's worth it [Music] wait no no no no no no this this feels off i don't trust you i'm going to walk away no harm done okay talk to me again if you mean business yes that's it now ingram trusts you it's like shooting fish in a barrel greetings sir greetings sir kazeem welcome back so you have the picture yes here good our guest will be delighted please follow me he's waiting mr kazeem please follow me hello sir i hope you have had time to see the art exhibition his royal highness has a keen eye for the arts if you haven't yet i highly recommend it [Music] have you seen the view yet it's quite spectacular on a clear day you get a wonderful view of the arabian desert i just feel like it's a sight to behold the vastness of it back in china this would never be possible because of all the smog so mr ingram is expecting you mr casine so good to see you do you have the picture yes your problem is fixed omar said you were good let's get down to the important business at hand okay people clear the room i need to discuss some delicate business with mr kazeem perfect we have ingram right where we want him excuse me for a second 47. you know what to do have a drink see the view it's something to behold [Music] now where was i oh that's right my man here will stay for the meeting i assume that will not be a problem either way you have no choice in the matter it's interesting we haven't come across each other before mr kazeem well maybe not i usually have my people talk to people like you i can imagine i don't know how much omar i mean the royal highness has told you but my guess is very little so let me get straight to the point my organization has been hit by an unpleasant cancer that can only be removed by cutting it out of the gut if you get mine drift yes i do good this little turd is spreading his vile toxic cells and i want him stopped brutally chemo won't remove him only the knife i have his file here arthur edwards a sly little devil if there ever was one me and my associates well we underestimated the little worm we want revenge i think you and i share a common interest i doubt that but i want you to make him suffer this is not a horse that needs to be put out of its misery this is a rabid dog that needs to be put down am i making myself clear mr kazeem yes consider it done good we're now in business we are i'll have miss toe send you anything you need we're done here oh uh one last question i'm just curious you're nicknamed the vulture why i find it's best to wait for the perfect kill i think you'll be perfect for the job nice to meet you mr kazeem i look forward to receiving an update safe hunting god yes mr ingram please show mr kazeem out yes sir mr kazem please follow me mr kazem you need to listen to me follow me and don't get sidetracked do you know how much there's quite a bit of security here one moment you ready for some more fresh air 47 hello there's a keypad lock on the doors to the staff area one moment all right try this four seven zero six [Music] and off the server room should be behind one of the doors in this hallway why why are you [Music] hmm a calendar function we can use this to summon the partners to a fake meeting 47. all right i'm no hacker like olivia but i think you need to pull one of the racks here to gain access to the terminal damn it a silent alarm has been tripped security is on its way hide 47. everything looks just fine yes sorry about that 47 let's try again shall we ah i think i've got it we'll need a key card to gain access someone in maintenance should have one we can borrow for a spell hey it's me i thought about what you said yeah i changed my mind it was an insane idea to start with exploding golf ball i don't want blood on my hand i've never taken things right not that many of us have keys and people tend to stay out of that room anyways so no one will get hurt i'll take it home when my shift is over i love you too i'll be home as soon as possible bye that must have done something can you see anything different in the room good we're in now all you need to do is access the terminal and use the calendar option to summon the providence partners to a meeting good work the meeting has been booked the partners should be moving up here shortly looks like the lounge can be sealed off for private conversations handy excellent i see the partners moving you should join their meeting time to end this 47. building cameras are now disabled just keep calm please stay back the partners are alone now i'll activate the panel controlling the room's security features when you're ready use it to start the show now we'll just wait for the partners to be alone then you can activate the room's lockdown feature i trust his people will have multiple scenarios ready for us very soon which reminds me we need to discuss alexa what's there to discuss she left us at the most critical moment she abandoned ship that family has never been trustworthy and alexa just proved to us that she and indeed any of her heirs isn't up to the task i agree she displayed extremely poor judgment i hope omar is able to step up at this time in particular we need a solid foundation to rebuild from and someone to help us hit that traitor edwards where it hurts oh he'll get what's coming to him you know marcus my father taught me many things throughout my life loyalty respect dedication edwards has betrayed all of those i look forward to teaching him the most important thing my father ever taught me the power of fear i think it's safe to say this situation has revealed some structural weaknesses in our organization we'll deal with them as swiftly and as harshly as we've been taught by our predecessors now what's holding up the chic what's this carl did you do that i certainly did not i have no idea what's going on gentlemen what's the meaning of this you you're the one responsible for all this gray what do you want something that has been a long time few revenge revenge how banal you killed cobb navikov caruso the washington twins everyone at haven you broke into our bank and you outed providence to the world whatever perceived slight we've done to you is insignificant to the amount of damage you've caused us you've caused the world you're a murderous terrorist nothing more what did we ever do to you anyway you specifically nothing providence everything providence made me and that the flick of a pen providence broke me i'm just returning the favor providence has ruined the lives of countless people expecting and facing no consequence for its actions you take for yourselves and those who support you and you burn everyone and everything else to the ground from the comfort of the shadows no more you're delusional exposing us achieve nothing beyond moving a few pieces around on a board much more complicated that you can fathom the world believes we're dead what more do you want me nothing my friend however well let's just say he's a bit of an expert i'm just here to watch you die 47 finish it 47 finish it you you're the one responsible for all this grey where the hell is that security panel oh not a patient man are you finally stuyvesant and ingram are gone providence will soon be no more than a bad memory 47. thank you i'll meet you at the rendezvous on the edge of town [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's your winning face i'd hate to see you lose we underestimated the constant yeah he's the glorified desk cluck he's not just after the money he wants it all we caught him once we can do it again and well we're not the ones who let him escape you still don't trust her i don't like executive decision makers look you don't have to follow her you know soon this will be over maybe it's time to think about the future you have to face the possibility that there's no going back if the ica knows what you did she'll make it right she always does we have a fix on carlisle come on we've got a plane to catch i hope you like the rain 47. [Music] miss burnwood how did you i have everyone's number you really ought to know by now you planned this all of it don't be silly i just played the hand i was dealt we'll find you you had me where'd that get you we handed you an empire it's for the best the partners were complacent set in their ways but power is more than just security providence can be an agent of change surely you understand or you will soon enough [Music] she came home carlisle's lost an empire you fall hard enough you tend to be reminded of what truly matters so the end of the line you ready for this are you who will you be without a score to settle i guess the world's most wanted fugitive will have to do alexa carlyle is dead according to the funeral invitation that is so naturally it caused quite a stir when the late matriarch turned up at the breakfast table alive and kicking carlisle wisely sensing that her number is up has emerged from exile to tie up loose ends and secure the carlisle legacy she may be a monster but you have to admire her due diligence carlisle descends from an ancient line of warrior aristocrats her great-grandfather made a killing in the second opium war and established an empire in shipping railroads and newspaper publishing while largely unknown to the public the family still asserts its quiet dominance over global transport and logistics media and technology most senior of the partners alexa carlisle is cold as ice tough as nails and sharp it was her late father who first brought the three families together after the end of world war ii at this very house meaning that this gentleman is the birthplace of providence it began here and it ends here talk about poetic one more thing according to our intel carlisle keeps a case file on the constant information that may be helpful in his recapture so don't leave the estate without it right happy hunting 47. see you on the other side [Music] [Music] [Music] thornbridge manor the carlisle family's home for countless generations the revenant alexa carlisle and her three adult children younger brother zachary grandson and daughter-in-law are all gathered to conduct carlisle's sham funeral curiously carlisle summoned a famous london pi soon after arriving this morning but his purpose at thornbridge is yet unclear now the target knows that you're coming and her guard detail is top notch so mr gray will secure their nearby field hq and intercept all calls going in and out of the estate any appeal for backup is going to fall on very deaf ears good luck gentlemen this is a private area sir phineas whitmer private investigator i have an appointment with madam carlisle please wait mr whitmer is here to see madame carlisle you can go writing that is phineas whitmer the famous private investigator hired by madame carla this morning i'm curious why he's here maybe you should do some detecting yourself 47. a famous private investigator summoned by alexa carlyle has arrived at thornbridge manor if you take his place it may be an opportunity to get close to madame carlisle so mr whitmer thank god you're here can i take you to madame carlisle please do if you follow me i know i order the same thing but you're here everything's just so strange preparing for madame's funeral and then she turns up alive but then the awful business with her brother zachary and all this security i've never seen a place guarded like this and i dare say i don't like it at all oh by the way i told kate about this test what did she say well i thought she'd be mad at me i did a really good talk about it actually what did i tell you she's a sensible woman and that's stuff from your ex huh i just need to check one that's a bit exciting i know i think i know considering the fact that i guess i thought she was going to read into them saying i must have know what we're doing sir don't worry about that man caroline really did a number on you no no no [Music] mr whitmer thank you for coming on such short notice a great tragedy has fallen upon us and i need a quick resolution handled with absolute discretion results and discretion are my speciality very well i suppose you will want to start at the crime scene in my experience a thorough examination of a potential crime scene is half the job done good fernsby will take over from here i am mr fernsby the butler madam carlisle has asked me to assist you in any way possible mr whitmer i understand that you've traveled from london would you care for some refreshments or do you prefer to go straight to mr zachary's sleeping quarters i prefer to get started as you wish if you'll follow me sir i feel obliged to point out with current affairs surrounding madame carlisle are of a delicate nature you may be familiar with the recent announcement of her death you will probably learn that the staged funeral is scheduled to take place tomorrow madam's children were not informed until this morning that their mother was in fact not dead at all so please bear with them if they seem affected by the rather unusual situation i trust i do not need to remind you that there will be consequences if word gets out that madame carlisle is still alive i'll consider her dead when i leave before you inspect the crime scene i will tell you this the case concerns the death of mr zachary madame carlile's younger brother he was found dead in his bed this morning the door was locked from the inside and a suicide letter was found in his room however madam carlisle suspects foul play and will not accept that he took his own life i've prepared some information for you so please do come and see me when you finish your investigation of the crime scene this is mr zachary's room to my right a locked room murder mystery 47 i trust you'll get to the bottom of this zachary was shopping for new wellingtons last night not exactly what you would expect from someone suicidal zachary's suicide note also a sample of handwriting it could be relevant to compared to other samples to establish its authenticity why don't you use your camera to scan the dead body for d7 throat markings indicate a rare short-lived plant poison killed him spread shows time of death at around 10 o'clock last night you do know your poison's 47. a hidden door it's a secret passage this could explain how the door was locked from the inside hmm a photocopy of the floor plans somebody's been researching the secret ins and outs of thornbridge manor i believe you've done a thorough search of the crime scene 47 maybe it's time to see the butler i'm curious about the information he's prepared for you how are you sir mr fernsby i'm done with the crime scene did you establish a time of death zachary died around 10 o'clock last night that means the staff were off duty and madame carlisle and her security didn't arrive until this morning that leaves madam's family and myself as the only persons here when he died and before you ask no i do not have an alibi i was alone in my office at the time of death here's the material that i've prepared for you it's a list of the possible suspects and their quarters hopefully that will help you keep track of your findings please come and see me when you've solved the case and i will take you to madame carlisle this is very useful information 47 so how does one solve a murder mystery 47 motive means an opportunity i believe may i suggest you ask the suspects for alibis or perhaps do you prefer searching the manor for clues first yes i understand i'm sure we can come to some arrangement but you really need to talk to anthony he's the man with the papers listen you know who i am who my grandmother is was right just relax it'll be fine you'll get your returns don't worry give anthony a call okay patrick carlisle can you tell me where you were yesterday evening  it's that sneaky butler isn't it he ratted me out elaine give us some privacy would you don't tell mother okay she's really tense these days and the last thing i need is more hassle i took that pretty blonde um rosie uh for an evening stroll i mean how the am i expected to cope for an entire weekend in this i'm bored out of my mind if that's all i think i'll get back to my slow death by boredom what did you think of zachary creepy as hell no ambition imagine deciding to live in a museum you know father says zachary and alexa used to be two of a kind he had a great future ahead of him then suddenly he just gave up everything what an idiot thank god daddy chose looks and brains over pedigree when he married mummy i don't have to worry about the inbreeding's her customer in these circles so is that it did you see anything suspicious last night no i reckon zachary topped himself i know i would have or perhaps mr fernsby i don't like him he could have done it if you only knew what we face i wonder what you would do attack regroup close the gates and wait it out weird that is the door to rebecca's room so i'll have a damn good reason for not being here in person christ really don't have a clue do you i'm talking about that weasel arthur edwards can we get back what he stole from me so far it looks like we can't all the transfers of funds and privileges i've been through have been bulletproof he intercepted the arrangements our office worked years to put in place that's why don yates should be here he made the arrangements he should bloody well be the one to clean up this whole mess i uh i don't know what to say i'm sorry don't kill the messenger alexa please continue your efforts mr ford i can see from the log that rebecca was in a conference call from 9pm to midnight last night so oh [Music] [Music] this all confirms that arthur edwards stole everything from adam carlisle perhaps you should let her know how bad it is 47 i received the vote token patrick nunn bank did i understand correctly i should give it to rebecca in case you're there exactly she holds the other one i want her to have the file on arthur edwards if i die you're not fearful she'll be in trouble she knows she will start digging when she realizes things don't add up inevitably getting her in trouble i'd rather she knew who she's up against she's clever and resourceful who knows maybe she'll be able to hit him where it hurts but i don't want her to get involved prematurely hopefully she'll never have to get involved at all you faced great obstacles too i know we will persevere it is my duty to make that happen i've received more information about your situation mr ford we can't talk here go back to your office i will be there shortly what's the verdict mr ford undoubtedly some of my assets must be safe no everything is gone thornbridge manor surely that too but that's not possible i'll kill him i swear if it's the last thing i do thank you mr ford that will be all emmer carla can you tell me where you were yesterday evening surely i'm not a suspect i need to account for everyone well i spent the evening with my family but i got an awful migraine and had to take to bed everyone can attest to that i believe i went up when the boys sat down for a drink around eight o'clock is that all how did you feel about zachary i might as well be honest his presence was always awkward how do you have a meaningful conversation with a man who only cares about plants in my opinion alexa bears some responsibility for how this ended she supported his self-limiting behavior by letting him live here anything else you want to know [Music] have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary nothing special comes to mind except perhaps i did get a feeling that zachary was depressed not just sad i suppose he realized that he had no one with alexa gone even alexa must feel the pangs of guilt over that one letting him believe she was dead then again guilt isn't her strong suit right let's get started i want to keep this short i know you have a lot of questions some i will answer now the rest will have to wait first zachary's sudden death is a great tragedy but also a great inconvenience as it happened just now i'm dealing with the situation in a discreet and efficient way and i expect your cooperation in all related matters secondly the arranged funeral event tomorrow will take place as planned no one can know that i am still alive i expect you all to act your part last as you all know i have a lot on my plate and need to focus on sorting everything out so please do not disturb me with your petty concerns you are all adults and as part of the elite you will eventually have to deal with difficult situations like this it comes late for most of you but this is a chance for you to show what you are made of that will be all rebecca carla can you tell me about yesterday evening we don't really see much of each other my brother exit i suppose it takes our mother to you know i think he might be in some sort of trouble edward wanted to go as well but gregory convinced him to stay for a few drinks before they went off for a pint at the local at a quarter to nine i swear gregory enjoys edward's discomfort over staying here i had a conference call with my new york office at nine so i spent three hours on my laptop in my room and went straight to bed afterwards i don't know about emma she did act a bit strange you know i bet she was making lists for changes needing to be done once she gets her hands on thornbridge manor quite the shock she had when mother arrived during breakfast is there anything else you want to ask me tell me about zachary did he act strange last night you know now you mention it he was a lot more chatty than usual he wanted to know about my connections in the publishing business apparently a friend of his is writing a book which strikes me as very peculiar i didn't think he had any friends is that everything mr whitmer i do have a lot to see too anything else you feel like mentioning i may be wrong but i saw mr fernsby the butler leave zachary's room early this afternoon and he seemed a bit startled when he saw me in the hallway it's probably nothing oh and one more thing please be kind to edward he can only take so much ah my perfect mother good of thought you up didn't you staging your own death a major grandiose cock-up i'd say be quiet gregory it says you're only human after all i never would have guessed gregory carlisle can you tell me where you were yesterday evening oh you're wondering about my alibi mr detective well um i left thornbridge around half eight for a pint with edward i wish i hadn't quiz night at the inn on the other hand staying here with zachary my obnoxious sister and the wife sporting another one of her headaches would have been a fate worse than death the short of it zachary was very much alive when we left i stayed for the last shout and i was back here just before midnight anything else you want to pry from my intricate intellect tell me about zachary zack such a sad old sod a bit heavy on the bottle but you could blame him only company he had was his rare plants and mother who travels more than she stays here honestly i can't say which is the bigger ball he's better off dead is that all not very thorough are you anything else you'd like to tell me nothing really i'm just enjoying the show our perfect mother obviously up didn't she faking her own death you know she's explained nothing to us i think she's scared to own up to her mistake [Music] professor edward carlisle can you tell me your whereabouts for last night oh yes this dreadful business with zachary i stay at the local inn you see i prefer not to spend the night here at thornbridge manor my brother gregory came along for nightcap he'll never admit it but i think he understands that i find this whole thing upsetting and wanted to provide some comfort i believe we went to the stacks head around half past eight anything else i can do to help can you tell me about zachary's behavior last night i certainly didn't expect him to commit suicide sure he was upset by mother's supposed death we were but he seemed more engaged than usual you should ask rebecca they had a long talk did you know that he hadn't left thornbridge manor in nearly 50 years his plants mother and the staff all the company he had if that's all i have a speech to write did you notice anything else out of the ordinary you mean apart from the fact that we came here to bury our mother and she shows up alive and kicking zachary found dead in his bed this morning or perhaps the plan funeral is still taking place and i have to do the eulogy and mother will surely have strong opinion on it i can't breathe excuse me you always led by example rather than by words and meaningless gestures like hugs and encouragement just a single spontaneous caress what a difference that would have made right i clearly remember when i was five i climbed a tree and could not make my way down i was scared and called out for help of all people you heard me and when you saw me you climbed the tree i was relieved that help had finally arrived but can i help you in any way mr edward francpie thank you no i'm afraid not some fresh air may do you good it might but i need to finish mother's eulogy for tomorrow she doesn't think i can do it does she did she say anything to you mr edward your mother has very high standards i'm under the impression they are rarely met by anyone but herself oh god she expects me to fail tomorrow will soon be over and then you can put all this behind you i'm sure you'll do splendidly just wait and see i don't know i hope so that is the door to mr fernsby's office what's gonna come of it stick to your own kind you mean like chris he treated me like all he wanted to do was play his stupid video games never any romance i deserve romance madam carlyle is well and emma won't be moving in all things do eventually come to an end did all the groceries arrive no sir some of the delivery people were unhappy with the security of the game she never misses a step gossiping and work both fake funeral tomorrow zachary found dead upstairs today death is everywhere i never thought of it that way oh god it's such a big responsibility having a baby i have to protect it right how are things coming along outside will everything be ready for the funeral event tomorrow i would say so mr fernsby as long as the birds don't make too much of a mess may i add that the undertaker mr parsons is not happy about putting on a pretend funeral he's worried about his reputation if he gets out yes i expected as much he certainly are strange days i suppose we'll never get an explanation it's not our place to question madam carlisle no i know can't ever wonder i'm getting a headache from all the decisions i mean pram or stroller comforter or not should i ask her to marry me what if she says no i know this big funeral thing tomorrow it's the last thing i need i remember how it was with the first one the ones that come after certainly are a lot less of a worry rosie tell me what you did last night i'm in trouble aren't i i i spent the evening with patrick we met after dinner and i went home at one in the morning he said he needed someone real to talk to when he looks at you it makes you feel like the center of the universe like a real princess but now he just ignores her well he's under a lot of pressure he's an idiot that's what he is did you notice anything out of the ordinary any strangers outside the house no no we saw no one outside except patrick's mother emma we were sitting on the bench behind the greenhouse talking when she came out and um we had to hide you won't tell her about me and patrick will you she'd insist madame carlile fire me i'm sure of it too right she will she's always going on about how things will change once she's in charge of thornbridge manor how are things coming along inside is everything ready for tomorrow i can't deal with all this pretend funeral stuff just now i know i have to but i don't think she might be pregnant amy is a great and now a wee one on the way let's say you wouldn't look back his wife's outrageous behavior without batting zachary's diary this is big he was about to confess to the world that he and alexa murdered their older brother montgomery 46 years ago and apparently mr fernsby helped make the murder look like an accident and 47 the handwriting doesn't match the suicide letter in his room proving he didn't write it himself painkillers lethal if you use enough of them but not the poison used to kill zachary of course madame carlisle doesn't know that are you considering to frame the butler 47 mr fernsby clearly didn't commit the murder but i think you have enough evidence to convince madam carlyle he did maybe you should tell him you are ready to present your findings unless of course you want to do some more detecting 47. ah have you ever fallen actually so i should let you go yeah same that door leads to emma and gregory's room do i like him a keychain pendant for the greenhouse what's that doing in emma and gregory's room i wonder and why is the key missing so now this is interesting seven a letter from emma's mother stating that emma is the illegitimate child of alexa's late older brother montgomery and listen to this she claims to have witnessed alexa and zachary murder him the plot thickens so [Music] can't you tell me about it sorry so we don't have any extra fuses ethel looked everywhere you've got to be kidding me no power no portrait oh madam carlyle will be furious she expects the family photo to be done any moment now i need this shoot to happen okay and i need it to be perfect can't we just take a fuse from another fuse box so madame carlyle wants a picture taken if you were to assist with the missing fuse i'm sure the portrait would be one for the ages uh i i guess we could do that good i'll finish setting up and then we'll grab the fuse just before good i'll finish setting up and then we'll grab the fuse just before you call down the family good yeah that's a good plan [Music] emma carlyle in the greenhouse how curious damn it i need this to work oh you startled me [Music] i i was just i don't know thinking about zachary he spent most of his life in here with these plants not much of a life is it well anyway i'll be outside if you need me if you'd excuse me broken lab equipment it looks like it was recently used though this is a table showing lethal dosages for the poison used to kill zachary something is circled 47 female age 65 to 79 60 to 64 kilograms i'd say madame carlyle is next in line for a poisoning you have uncovered enough evidence to tell madam carlisle that emma is the murderer quite the detective 47 i'm impressed i said just you go tell mr fernsby unless you think there are more secrets to uncover so [Music] years zachary found dead upstairs today death is everywhere i never thought of it that way oh god it's such a big responsibility having a baby i have to protect it right [Music] either are there any gardeners outside you haven't seen before there are a lot of them on the grounds talk to mr fernsby he's in charge of the stars step inside your detective skills have gained you access to the lion's den 47 now go claim your reward so mr whitmer you've reached a conclusion take a seat please go ahead your niece emmer carlisle murdered your brother zachary my niece emma is not my niece she's my daughter-in-law and your niece emmer is the illegitimate child of your late older brother montgomery who you and zachary killed 46 years ago that's preposterous you asked me to find out what happened to zachary would you rather not know no no go on i found a letter from emmer's mother jane who was the fiance of your older brother at the time of his death she witnessed how you and zachary pushed him off the balcony she believed you did it to steal the carlisle empire from her and her unborn child and she raised emma to reclaim what she lost marry your heir gregory get revenge and secure the carlisle empire for her bloodline generations to come emma is the daughter of montgomery and that local girl jane she is well the girl got it wrong i didn't steal anything i did what was necessary to protect the future of the carlisles wasn't cut out to take over from father all heart and no balls emma used the funeral gathering to speed up her installment as the lady of the house seizing the opportunity to stage zachary's suicide she did her homework used a poison made from one of zachary's rare plants found old floor plans from thornbridge manor to gain access to his room through a secret passage that ski more than you think i found proof that she will try to poison you next well i'll have to take care of that thank you mr whitmer you have not disappointed i promised you i would reward you generously if you solved the case so what do you suggest i want the file you have on arthur edwards edwards the constant but how do you oh i see i expected you might show up but to kill me not help me and i've been wrong on so many things lately so why not this one i will give you the file on edwards you've earned it [Music] i don't suppose i could convince you to deal with my daughter-in-law now you're here i would like to see her dead no what a shay i'll have to see to it some other way [Music] then [Music] i need some privacy thank you good work 47 that's the file on arthur edwards secured time to take care of madame carlisle hello sir how are you gregory don't say more to that weird detective than you need to i was just having a laugh dear must admit he's pretty good what if he believes we had something to do with zachary's death oh please he's circling us i don't see him snooping around your sister i bet alexa said something if i could be bothered i'd be worried about your mental health emma but sorry i'm having too much fun enjoying the circles so oh and why not do a photo shoot because we're all gathered talk about messed up multitasking and who seriously needs to step into this century everybody needs to be ready for the funeral this was back waiting to happen [Music] [Music] so [Music] so oh sounds like the powers back up why don't you take a picture to test it it works i'm ready for the shoot perfect i'll call the family down now then excellent 47. madam carlyle is on her way down for the family photo shoot let's see if any memorable moments will play out in front of the camera so hi good afternoon my mother will have things back in order in no time and that's what she does create precise order in all her affairs never letting go into it touch her i'm the youngest i guess i just flew under the radar when it came down by the fountain i don't think so she really respects you if you just stopped craving her approval you're nearly 50 edward i know i'm such a loser but you're not you're a professor you're artistic you've got your music i mean that's really something it's not exactly expanding the carlisle empire though but thanks that does help a little i wish he'd hurry up this place is sucking the life out of me it won't hurt you to relax for a bit i expect you to be efficient i have a lot to see to today i'll do my best right get in position let's get this over with there's a puddle of water here i'll never mind let's just get this done shall we chin up edward no one wants to look at that long face you're such an idiot gregory i'm fine rebecca fine you look like a nervous wreck stop victory well mother you certainly know
