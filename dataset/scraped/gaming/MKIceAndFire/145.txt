so we're headed to the northern side of the island yeah new devon home to the founders of libertalia and that's where rafe is taking their brother the treasure's probably there just need to save sam before they find it look up there i borrowed it from your shoreline friends you slid all the way down from there yeah it was the quickest way to get down to you now we just gotta figure out another way back up yeah here so have you been here long on the island a few hours now did you see the colony i did from the air pretty incredible right i didn't get the full tour i was a little preoccupied with finding here right so did uh sully fill you in on the deal with this place yep henry avery 400 million 12 founders hundreds of colonists something like that yeah that just about covers it had some time to kill on the flight over wow is that an elevator sure looks like it i swear avery recruited the best engineers of his time he must have used it to move supplies up river yeah that's a fair bet huh there's your car just need to get up there well what do you think which way let's take a look okay that's too high let's find another way up there's got to be something around here there we go i can boost you up there great hey do you think there's another way up hey i see a path up here there's a way through over there see if you can find something i can use yup hey i found something hold on thanks uh uh hey nice jump not bad right where to go nate piss a girl like that off idiot come on i'll meet you around i'm okay sort of that everything's under control see if you can get back up here yeah yeah roger that nate can you find a way out of there looks like a dead end well maybe the elevator still works i doubt it 300 years old been exposed to the weather and who knows if it ever oh look it works going up next floor menswear the fact that this works it's kind of incredible jinxed it you know i'll just uh meet you at the top i guess ugh hey nice move nothing to it now then which way is the car it'll be easier to spot from higher ground right good idea now we're getting some exercise at least right look shoreline they found your car technically there are so let's get it back any sign of it nothing yet but she can't have gone far what oh no no so huh might be worth a shot okay i think that's it shoreline certainly earned their reputation let's go before more of them show up hey you see a way out upriver there's an opening by the falls [Music] [Music] wow check out that elevator it's massive yeah i'm guessing new devon's at the top then let's get up there so here's my question why does rafe adler want avery's treasure it's not like he needs the money what's the glory he doesn't want to be known as a guy who only got rich because of his inheritance walking away isn't an option for him well race is a good match for shoreline he needs their muscle and they need his money they do they seem pretty well stocked shoreline got involved in a couple of civil wars that didn't pan out for them nadine inherited her father's mess she's probably hoping that this will put her back on the map so far so good keep heading upstream i bet you could write a killer article about all this i could i doubt anybody would believe it oh you can take pictures too i didn't bring my camera so why do you think sam didn't come straight to you after rape that i'm out of prison i think he wanted to gather every clue that rape had on avery before bailing on plus he needed time to come up with that crazy alcazar story i mean fight just looked it up that is one crazy contraption it looks big enough to fit the car well here's hoping this one works as well all right let's look around [Music] what's that gonna do we'll find out [Music] well that didn't do anything stop the water wheel really help us though all right let's try something else [Music] uh there we go stand clear i got it okay looks like i can get up there now thank you okay nothing yet gonna climb higher need an elevator just to fix the elevator [Music] you made it is there ever a doubt oh hold on i'll stop the wheel [Music] okay ready that's my girl i'm gonna detach the winch now okay i'll bring the card the elevator good call here we go [Music] [Music] we did it well nate the elevator's moving get on quick crap i'm coming oh hi there hi um you know what maybe i need to oh never mind hey watch out stay down use the car as cover let me see if i can flank them get off my elevator elena you still with me yeah it's still here the car's got some holes in it though [Music] uh yeah crap double down hurry move it nate holy [ __ ] are you okay nate yeah well come on you drive you sure you seem to be doing fine after all that i need a break definitely so i was thinking all this engineering and architecture it doesn't come cheap do you think there's even any treasure left we're wondering that ourselves there goes nothing whoa hang on ah there i got control again we're getting there it didn't happen to bring us some spare clothes did you i did right there on the plane not great that damn i can't drive through the sluice gate here we go [Music] it's no good it's blocked okay i'll try the other one seen that coming and behind door number [Music] looks like this one's two nice work we're good what's wrong too muddy gotta go around [Music] hey maybe we could get up that way good call watch this hang on we did it it sounds surprised maybe a little [Music] and we're up [Music] so far we're two for two yeah which means we're due for some disaster the water wheel's working that bodes well hey give me a hand with this oh crap i'll hold it just get the car oh that's heavy okay here goes nothing three for three gotta love that pirate engineering wow it's like a postcard yeah libertalia come for the beautiful views stay for the life or death gunfights so what made you change your mind you said you almost didn't come back well i couldn't leave when you were clearly and over your head and you know there's that whole marriage vow thing for better or worse for better or worse here give me a hand with this all right okay you know even if you think that you're protecting me you don't have a right to check out everything no matter what it is you're supposed to come to me so that we can work through it together as a team i know that really i do it's just yeah you know we should stay focused there'll be time for this later next stop new devon [Music] hey elena hey we're here sully where are you hell in the air how about your shoreline vehicles heading north i guess we'll see them soon you two doing okay so far we hit a few hitches but so far so good all right good keep in touch will ya i'm not the no nose is good news we'll try over and out okay should be on the other side of the bridge on tight turn around we're heading for the falls i can't current's too strong nate nate there we can climb up those rocks on it i got it come on waterfall waterfall so great i'm okay the tree is not okay oh come on over here quick huh so much for the car come on i wasn't trying to protect you it's just i i made a promise that i was done with this life we both did yeah but i broke it i didn't tell you because i was afraid i'm afraid of what of losing you i guess i was uh protecting myself you know we have a lot of ground to cover yeah just keep moving this way at least we're on the right side of the river now yeah that would have been bad good call now how do we get up there slippery huh judging by the clothes they're colonists maybe it was a fight no i i don't think so look how they're arranged yeah you're right they're stacked they were just shoved against the walls they were already dead when they were brought here this is a masquerade nate hello who is this now look at the sign traitor it's one of the rebels that's a bad way to die here's another one sorry buddy no disrespect more gibbets oh my god well i guess that's one way to quash a rebellion i have to wonder if this was always the plan what to slaughter all the colonists no to lure them here in hopes of finding a utopia only to rob them of everything that they have we are dealing with a bunch of pirates well that is pretty diabolical even for pirates just need your help for a sec those things don't look steady they're not be careful excuse me all right yeah wow welcome to avery's neighborhood it's a nice place if you don't mind some structural problems and water damage yeah clearly some drainage issues a real fixer-upper opportunity okay so looks like somebody blew that dam and then flooded the whole place you know i forgot pretty good at this all right so which one of these do you think is avery's uh my money's on that one one it's still intact you're not so bad at this either yeah well you know i've had a little practice read a few books [ __ ] what what the front door sam he's still alive yeah for now come on all right keep your eyes open for shoreline types yep whoops you all right through here watch your head ooh someone had it in for this guy [ __ ] shoreline elena get down i see them they show up nothing but i'd better be nothing one man [Applause] uh uh oh um huh what's that what was that anything interesting hello hey you okay got a guy down over here huh jesus i think that's it you okay yeah let's push on might be a way through this cave yeah it's worth a look [Music] crap how many people did you bring here nadine she does have an entire army i think they found the treasure well let's hope not for sam's sake look something here it's addressed to richard watt signed adam baldridge they were both founders look we can climb up there yeah but it's too high ah refreshing nate hey i see some boxes and supplies up there great get one down for us look up below get a hold of it gum come the papa after you oh how sweet you want me to be your decoy no it was being gentlemanly there just busting your chops yeah well the chops are plenty busted already thank you um that wasn't too bad you okay yeah i'm fine you well wet again tired bruised i'm hungry i could eat other than that fine yeah okay come on let's keep going come on let's try cutting through this house yeah i'm right behind you [Music] you think the colonists supported this place well they definitely had the motivation uh you don't think it's them i just find it odd that all these houses are underwater except for one average exactly it's beautiful uh hey check it out these cannons look like they were retrofitted yeah improvised defenses guess they didn't expect they'd be fighting each other guess not ooh nice water feature time for another swim i guess whoa whoa stronger than it looks hold up i'll weigh it down for you great okay you're welcome thank you you make a great counterweight uh i mean okay as well you should uh i made it i'll find a way up for you too hard can't do this alone okay this should work all right stand clear there you go okay great let's move this out of the way yep okay hey look thomas two's sigil so we're in his mansion second in command going up the pirate hierarchy good lord looks like we found the party like we're a little late hey nate check it out it's another sigil oh my god what it's them elena these other pirate captains have founded libertalia what the hell happened here well i'm no forensics expert but i would say bad drinks apparently so what was this some kind of wealthy pirate suicide cult yeah not likely not these guys on behalf of lord avery i invite you to my manner at sundown tomorrow the time has come to abandon our animosities and reunite under the banner of god and liberty signed thomas too what do you bet thomas ii henry avery looks like our hosts didn't stick around to clean up their mess well that wasn't very gracious of them okay so so these guys sparked a full-scale revolt when they claimed the treasure for themselves now they took care of the colonists but then they had to deal with each other and i'm guessing things got pretty messy so avery and two invite them up here to um uh was it uh abandon our animosity abandon the animosities avery makes a grand toast for god and liberty our ahoy mateys and they all take a swig except these two and just like that all the treasure of libertalia becomes the sole possession of two men these are some of history's greatest pirates and they all perished in an instant at this very table it's incredible yeah i'm sorry i uh i'm sorry it's okay so since our missing hosts aren't here at two's manor we shouldn't head over to avery's yeah let's go so there for posterity hey up here slowly [Music] be careful i'm okay i got it i'll meet you up top hey hi and we are officially inside henry avery's house word of the day ostentatious so why didn't he kill thomas too was he like his right-hand man yeah that's exactly what he was can you imagine taking orders from a paranoid psychopath that sounds like my first job but the producer on your tv show no my manager from macho nacho you worked at a macho nacho it was a high school job did you wear one of those hats the point is my boss was a paranoid psychopath he was the manager at a macho nacho just watch it okay huh look shoreline barricaded the front door and left a bunch of muddy footprints behind let's see where they went huh so where are the shoreline guys i know right i expected to see someone by now you don't supposedly pirate ghosts more footprints hello ah huh footprints go through this door crap it's blocked from the other side why bother barricading their path unless they found something all right help me push this open yeah oh [ __ ] [Applause] sauce more common take up oh yeah we'll see about that watch it sniper jesus you all right yeah they were just waiting to ambush us yeah all right let's get that door open see what they didn't want us to find okay here we go ready oh hello there what is it it's a letter signed by avery really read it my loyal subjects as the sun sets on our glorious paradise we must endeavor to preserve its riches the traitorous too knows our secrets so we must act quickly destroy the damn cleanse new devon here we go uh-huh and move my treasure through the passage to my ship two and avery turned on each other are you really surprised i guess not here you go thanks let's go find that passage there's no more footprints they end here okay so where did they go pirate ghosts let's look around this is amazing what what have you got there it's a copy of the british proclamation to apprehend avery seems like he was proud of being the most wanted man in the world sam's lighter did he drop it yeah on purpose whatever it is we're looking for has to be somewhere around here there's got to be another way out of this room maybe that passage avery mentioned in the letter but where's the switch maybe this is a switch no nate yeah did you find something i think so [Applause] good thing they figured that out for us how did you do that there's a bloody fingerprint right here where libertalia should be and i pushed it nicely done so the letter said that avery was moving his treasure to the ship yeah do you think the treasure's still on that mountain i think uh i think it doesn't matter anymore here we go careful nate hey watch your head yeah oh looks like avery built himself a panic cave yeah i wonder where this goes crap guess we're gonna find out this place doesn't look very stable yeah look fresh footprints they must have come this way oh crap okay what the hell is that my money's on nadine's men they'll use any excuse to use dynamite it'd have to be pretty dumb to use it in here yeah they're pretty dumb whoa whoa hold up so some kind of death trap duh yeah but sam and the others somehow made it across we just got to follow their lead it wouldn't be so bad if it didn't creak so much just don't go where the footsteps aren't what i'm just a little preoccupied with not blowing up right now and unclench whoo lana look footprints stop here they must have made it through and it collapsed behind them hey just gonna move this out of the way here yeah [Music] i have to find another way oh no just hold on a little longer crap [Music] come on damn it hey you still have sam's lighter yes good idea [Music] come on come on come on come on of course he used it all up smoked like a goddamn chimney on the boat right over relax i brought some matches you did of course there we go oh sorry that's my head hello over here [Music] over here thanks glad you came prepared somebody had to come on let's find a way forward nice hey this looks promising boost you up yeah come on huh okay here we go okay come on up okay thanks watch your head yeah careful whoa what the hell is this the hands that stole from me wow avery's not even pretending to be seen at this point i don't like this place me either let's get out of here dead end [Music] hey look favorite had some gibbots left over gibbets what it's pronounced gibbets are you sure yeah well no one likes to know at all wait is that a mummy you okay i think so what was trap avery really didn't want any trespassers down here all right watch your step me you're the one that stepped on it fine oh damn it are you okay yeah so far so good maybe i just stay a little ways back yeah crap [Music] you okay yeah well now we know what caused the explosion we heard earlier hey nate i found a shortcut how do you know it's a shortcut trying to be optimistic here jesus damn it more mummies don't explode okay [Music] oh this can't be healthy to breathe fine i'm fine i wish i'd brought earplugs am i yelling well we're back on the trail the footprints go this way be ready for a fight oh i always am is that a in reference to me no would you calm down hey cuz these guys weren't paying attention there's no sign of sam we'll find them elena get down you idiots trying to bring the whole place down hmm oh jesus [Music] uh something well for once i appreciate avery's exploding mummies let's go get those flares good idea hate to see this guy's christmas [Music] route than the tree all right let's see if we can catch up so i guess this loops around guess so jesus this was one of avery's guys dead men tell no tales looks like the fight broke out yeah two's men versus avery's excuse me hello some kind of key what's that note oh right it's uh it's from two to his men we can use the key to get out of here that's good hmm there's some symbols on the back let's go find a keyhole oh boy crap ah i'm okay you gonna explode now huh no how about you this guy had some serious trust issues whoa oh god oh god oh god you're done nice moves thank you huh not quite as creepy as all the hanging bones it's still a little creepy yeah maybe three out of ten though i'd say four really four yeah definitely descending okay another death trap yeah no footprints to guide us so far so good yeah knock on wood better not it might be rigged yeah there made it in your face avery that's our way out of here oh god are those the rest of two's men gotta be we know avery likes to make an example of his enemies he definitely likes making exploding mummies yeah let's uh tread carefully in here keyhole key wait it could be a trap we really don't have much of a choice oh boy but i have a good feeling about this one huh do it okay [Music] you see well at least we didn't get blown to bits [ __ ] you didn't bring a knife by any chance did you no oh but that guy's got a sword here help me swing this thing ah goddammit nate come on go go thanks captain avery it's just like old times huh elena hey hey elena come on elena uh my hero oh no you didn't do that no that's not funny oh you have done much work you gave me a goddamn heart attack oh let me

idea romantic yeah yeah i may have heard that somewhere before good talk good talk that's gotta be sam come on at least the gunfire means he's still alive for now is that a galleon yeah sure looks like it uh ah holy crap it's a ship graveyard looks like we can get down this way yeah looks safe we're getting closer to them oh crap look that's sam he's surrounded yeah come on we gotta go get him gotta find a way to the beach hey they're behind you fight so it should be fun hmm we're late going out seriously yeah [Music] so oh the bigger they are harder they are to take down now we're talking oh [ __ ] come on we can cut through the ship's holes crap you okay yeah i'm okay enough now let's find your brother yeah hey we can squeeze through here okay now where did sam go we went this way huh

yeah it's all this guy you saved his ass again naturally how are you doing good good there was some close calls but um he covered me hey hey how's that oh bullet grazed my shoulder yeah you cliff side grazed my face so how did you lose rafe he led his crew right into one of avery's traps smart hey look the whole alcazar thing hey just we gotta say that for later okay which way on the beach other side of this town okay good i hope all that ruckus didn't attract any attention sorry what are we doing what do you think we're doing we're getting the hell off of this rock right we we could do that or we could head in that direction which is a shortcut shortcut to what to avery's treasure oh wow i mean rafe's got to go all the way around but we could just be brave hey victor with all due respect maybe just you just don't know when to quit look we're all here for the same reason right what we didn't come after the treasure we came after you and i appreciate that i i do but we're good and we've got the lead for now we can do this nathan come on huh look around okay avery scuttled every last ship on this island you know why because he was hell-bent on keeping his treasure exactly no matter the cost of the others around him because he didn't want anyone to follow him because he was leaving look at this okay i found his map of the island okay that's his ship right under that mountain that's where our treasure is and it is exactly where rafe is headed right now while we stand around here and argue like idiots what if he's already left the island and his ship sunk somewhere out there in the middle of the ocean then we find out where it got sunk oh boy how long we've been chasing this thing huh you wouldn't me no offense to these guys but they don't get it actually sam they do they really don't okay trust me they've seen this kind of obsession before what's happening we're not those kids anymore we're not and we got nothing to prove victor where's that plane right this way is it far not very just through this port town what if shoreline set up an ambush by the plane they didn't and what makes you so sure because they're heading to the mountain for the treasure this way there she is it's a long drop how did you get here i hop down a few of these walls but i guess we'll have to find another way around i jump down from up there it's too high to get back up yeah maybe there's something we can put under it give me a hand sam all right hey you need a hand no thanks we got it uh anyone see a way out hey guys through here whoa check that thing out it's like a sky rail or something i think it still works there's no controls but i bet i could pull the platform with my rope how are you doing kid uh i'm not sure yet maybe if you could get to that wooden platform down there huh yeah we're getting there i can't wait to sleep in my own bed again so close so far i got an idea nathan give me a hand okay okay victor can i borrow you for a sec sure all right go ahead nathan yeah we'll hold it down you jump across not gonna drop made it here we come got it all right hop on i'll pull you across okay we're ready yeah oh this is some impressive wow you guys all

up here maybe we can head him off i'm gonna save him and then i'm gonna punch him all right let's just worry about the saving part first what the hell is he thinking i mean after everything that we wasn't this enough let's just find him hey we can get over that wall with come this here we got you you ready uh all right all right see this isn't gonna hold dang go no i got it come on damn it now how the hell are we supposed to get up there we don't have enough time nate no not by yourself i'll come right back okay look he is not gonna leave without a fight well then i'll fight him if i have to but either way i'm bringing him back just get the plane as close to the mountain as you can and be ready for a quick getaway like there's another kind it's not fair doing the dishes we take turns don't even think about not coming back i love you same to you cowboy all right okay hey what's that footprints sam god damn it i'm sure he's a ways off by now just gonna head to the creepy mountain see if sam get the hell out of here yeah be laughing about the whole thing tomorrow here we go back on the trail footprints in here more footprints no you didn't fall to your dick still get a chance

stole our goddamn boat he's headed for avery's ship come on let him we're done we're done most of my men are dead rife and those who won't have already left can you see that the end is literally in sight that maniac pirate of yours has rigged this entire cave i'm not setting foot on his ship nadine if you cut and run right now the loss of all your men everything that we've done is for nothing we have millions engulfed right here i'd say that plus our lives is something no wonder so many of your men abandoned you excuse me we're on the verge of making history here and you're willing to just walk off with a pittance a fraction of what sam's gonna get from that boat if he can walk away from that ship alive he can have it he'll i'd say he's earned it god knows you didn't now look we can stand here and insult each other all day or we can finish what it is we're finishing it all out sorry man thing about mercenaries nadine their loyalty it's bought it's not earned now come on either we can finish this thing together or we can just end it right here let's go make history not a girl by all means [Music] uh [Music] [Music] let's see what you have in store for us captain avery oh [ __ ]
