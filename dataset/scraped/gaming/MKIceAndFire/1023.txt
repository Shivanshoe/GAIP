tokyo tower boeing alpha sierra 747 at runway 22 ready for takeoff departure to the east [Music] [Music] fun [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 747 continue for east departure tokyo tower boeing alpha sierra 747 frequency change tokyo center boeing alpha sierra 747 is type boeing b748 four miles southwest of tokyo request flight following alpha sierra 747 tokyo center squad 0-352 [Music] welcome to flight training i'm your instructor captain molina but you can just call me jess this session we'll get started with some basic controls sound good first things first let's get familiar with your surroundings don't worry i've got the stick while you get your bearings out your side windows you can see we have great visibility over sedona today this is red rock territory beautiful isn't it so see if you can spot the sedona airport the runway should be a pretty easy landmark to find there you go visual confirmation on the airport now that we're oriented it's your turn time to fly this bird the first control on our training list is the yoke i still remember my first instructor saying the yolk is like a steering wheel almost sure you can turn but you can also pitch for starters it controls the ailerons and the ailerons they allow the plane to roll and bank into turns go ahead and try rolling to the right nice now let's see you level back out good of course the yolk also controls the elevator and the elevator affects the plane's pitch right pull back on the stick the plane starts to climb give it a shot the most valuable things in aviation are speed and altitude but notice when you're pitching up your speed is decreasing you could add more power or for now let's just pitch down just like that your speed's picking up again as the nose pitches down as you level back out let's talk about another control the rudders at your feet rudder pedals control the aircraft side to side movement also known as yaw on the ground those pedals are going to steer the plane left or right up here they properly align us during turns try them out and watch the plane's nose skew to either side simple enough right before we go on let's bring the plane back to straight up light make sure your dashboard is aligned three to four inches below the horizon for a cruise attitude okay the last thing we're going to cover now is the throttle if you have the need for speed then the throttle's for you full control over the power output of the engine let's see what happens when you cut all the power surprise surprise our altitude is decreasing this might be a good time for a piloting psa always keep an eye on your surroundings because nobody likes a low-flying duck all right let's go ahead and throttle back up there you go speed is increasing and as long as we maintain the same attitude our altitude will keep climbing too you're really getting the hang of your controls before long you won't even need a co-pilot until then if you want help with the radio or checklist or simply flying the plane i'll be here you can pass me the controls when you're ready to finish your session or keep flying it is a great day after all all right i have control good job today we're talking about attitudes of flight how your plane is oriented relative to the horizon if you look outside you can see the cockpit is just about four inches below the horizon line we're flying straight with a decent rate of speed this is the crew's attitude let's see how it reads on your instruments take a look at the attitude indicator as the name implies it shows your current attitude the white line is the horizon with the sky above and the ground below that orange element in the middle aligned with the horizon that's your plane just like we saw outside our current attitude reads pretty much straighten level okay now let's see how much power the engine is generating check your tachometer looks like we're pushing around 2300 revolutions per minute combined attitude and engine rpms translate to aircraft performance which leads us to your airspeed indicator now last but not least check your altimeter to figure out your altitude you always want to read the small needle first that's how many thousands of feet up you are then on to the big needle for the hundreds with our current attitude and power output we're holding a speed of 90 knots and a stable altitude of 6000 feet but that's about to change take the stick when you're ready pull back slightly on the yoke to raise the nose just above the horizon line about two inches make sure you don't pitch up too much or the angle will be too steep to create lift and without enough lift will stall all right go full throttle and start climbing pull back slightly on the yoke to raise the nose just above the horizon line about two inches welcome to the climb attitude see how it shows up on your attitude indicator and tachometer according to your altimeter we're gaining altitude but we're losing air speed even at full throttle proving you can't avoid basic physics while making a climb okay before we go on let's get back to a cruise attitude ease up on the yoke and aim your nose just below the horizon then throttle back down to 2300 rpm nice job we're now set up with the same attitude and power we had at the top of our lesson next up is the descent attitude start by reducing your rpms to 1800 then drop the plane's nose a bit further below the horizon [Music] so [Music] as expected with the nose down attitude our altitude is decreasing well our speed is picking up why don't you get us back to a cruise attitude and we'll hit the last part of our lesson there we go now that we know how to cruise climb and descend let's talk about the turn attitude gently pull the yoke left or right to start rolling the plane if you take a look outside you can see how our attitudes changed but you can also check your instruments for the details as a general rule you always want to keep your turns under 30 degrees at the top of your attitude indicator there's a series of notches representing 10 degrees each use them to control your roll notice the more you turn the more you need to pull back on the yoke to maintain altitude when you're rolling out you'll need to do the opposite roll and push at the same time the more you know about the main attitudes of flight the closer you get to that pilot state of mind so keep practicing and whenever you're done pass me the controls thanks i've got control now well done [Music] there's an old saying i like a mile of road will take you a mile a mile of runway will take you anywhere taking off isn't hard but there are a few key points to remember first we always take off into the wind which won't be an issue on a calm day like today second before we enter a runway we always make sure it's clear everything looks good no cross traffic go ahead and taxi into position the rudder pedals should make steering the plane pretty easy so all right let's do this apply full power and i'll walk you through the takeoff as we go use your rudders to stay on the center line and keep pushing power until you reach 55 knots good now gently pull back on the yoke line up the top of your instrument panel so it's a couple inches above the horizon that'll pitch us up and set a good climb attitude and we're airborne focus on flying straight use your rudders to keep the runway heading of 210 degrees maintain 75 knots and will reach our target altitude of 5500 feet in no time ah 5500 feet a nice safe altitude for part two of our lesson straight and level flight first step here is adjusting our attitude we're in a cruise attitude pushing max power to stay level at our target altitude let's start by easing the throttle back to 1800 rpm you probably noticed to maintain altitude you need to pitch the nose up you could just keep pulling on the yoke to hold steady but that's not really a precise means of control probably better to adjust your trim wheel until you don't need to push or pull on the yoke drag the trim down when you need to set the nose up drag it up to set the nose down try adding trim to keep us at 5500 feet without increasing throttle if you feel our pitch slipping and need to get back to the proper attitude don't worry just pull on the yoke then dial in the right trim the way i was taught when you adjust the trim you make rough changes at first to remove pressure on the yoke then small adjustments to find the perfect setting to keep your desired attitude that's the key to straight and level flight it saves you from constantly pushing or pulling on the yoke and that gives you more time to enjoy the ride if you want more practice using the trim go for it whenever you're ready to pass the controls i'll be here okay i have control hope you enjoyed the [Music] lesson [Music] my first instructor used to say the best part of flying is landing in one piece the man was a terminal pessimist but he wasn't wrong today you're in charge of bringing us in for a safe landing we've got clearance for a straight in approach so we don't have to complete the standard traffic pattern and i've already set us up in landing configuration at 65 knots with 10 degrees of flaps and idle power we're on the glide slope now maintain speed around 65 knots change your pitch if you need to and keep your aim point on the runway number when you're targeting the runway number you want to keep it steady in your sights if it looks like the numbers moving up in your windscreen you're coming in low you'll need to add a bit more throttle to get back on the slope if it looks like the numbers moving down in your windscreen well then you're too high you'll need to add flaps to increase your rate of descent but you'll also need to push forward and trim to change your attitude and maintain the same speed so keep your aim point on the runway threshold when you're 10 feet above the runway it's time to flare once we pass the threshold shift your aim point to the end of the runway then pull back slightly on the yoke to aim the nose just above it okay we're past the threshold start the flare keep pulling back slowly let the plane settle onto the runway don't push it down but don't let it start climbing nice now apply the brakes to slow us down and bring the plane to a stop great job as they say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing but if you can use the plane the next day it's outstanding landings can be hard even for seasoned pilots trust me don't hesitate to practice after all that's what we're here for [Music] right [Music] let's be honest no one likes going around in circles unless you're a pilot training on traffic patterns sedona's standard traffic pattern follows a 1000 foot altitude around the main runway by the time we're through here you'll know how to complete the full run from takeoff to landing so let's get started so when we're up keep us aligned with the runway and climb to 5400 feet we're going for a left-hand traffic pattern once we reach altitude you're going to start turning left 90 degrees toward a 122 degree heading okay we're in the pattern get ready to enter the crosswind section good keep going till you reach the traffic pattern altitude of 5700 feet to make your left turn downwind when the runway appears at the halfway point of your wing strut you'll know you're at a good glide distance we've got the wind at our back now we're on the right track lower your nose to a cruise attitude and reduce power to 2100 rpm once your speed is in the white arc add 10 degrees of flaps to preface for landing now's not a bad time to check if the runway is looking good and it probably goes without saying always watch out for other planes entering or exiting the pattern we're gonna fly past the end of the runway here keep going until you see it at a 45 degree angle behind you that's your cue to turn left again onto the base leg so all right reduce power to idle to start losing altitude and maintain crew's attitude keep an eye on the runway as we get ready for our final turn that'll also keep our speed around 65 knots [Music] there we go the runway is in full view make sure to keep the plane centered on approach if you're too high add flaps too low add power to maintain the glide path so way to stick the landing now just apply the brakes to slow your roll and make sure you don't stop on the runway of course if other planes are looking to land we've got to move take one of the taxiways on the right good job as an old instructor said to me not only did you not die you're really learning to fly [Music] it's time your first solo flight i'll be watching from the ground in radio contact if you need me but something tells me you won't your goal is to complete sedona's left hand traffic pattern on your own remember what we covered in our previous session and you'll be just fine good luck see you on the other side so [Music] [Music] so so great job there's always room for improvement that's life right but you did it all on your own hmm you weren't really supposed to land there you're on your way to becoming one hell of a pilot [Music] i've always said flying is freeing open skies endless possibilities but to fully enjoy it you need to be prepared we're going to focus this lesson on navigation prep and procedures the fundamentals of getting from point a to point b step one putting some distance between us and the ground all right we're off now keep climbing around the airport until we reach 5800 feet it goes without saying but good navigation starts with good departure prep let's set up the aircraft for the first leg of your trip attitude check now for your heading when you need to set and maintain a heading you'll want to rely on your heading indicator compasses are prone to errors especially during turns or while accelerating or decelerating go ahead and position your plane above the airport [Music] oh one last bit of departure prep we need to validate the time that's a fancy way of saying start the clock park is it a 41 degree heading about 5 minutes away navigating is basically flying a given heading for a given amount of time sometimes you deviate but if you track the time flow from your we all know speed can increase or decrease depending on the wind that's why at your next waypoint you'll want to compare your estimated time and route with the actual time flow validate your estimate and your progress good you made it to muntz park according to the nav log we've got one more stop flagstaff pulliam airport an easier way to navigate is to follow identifiable landmarks like highways and just so happens we have one below us as you close in on flagstaff pulliam airspace next step is setting up to enter the traffic pattern we've got clearance to enter the downwind leg and land on runway 21. keep your attitude and follow the standard pattern lower your nose to a cruise attitude and reduce your power power should be an idol now so you're losing altitude while maintaining crew's attitude finally a landing on runway 21 and we'll call this one done so so so um [Music] all right successful vfr
