champagne as i entered the survey tent to pour a glass for mary i realized something was awry she'd found bradshaw's crate of dynamite i tried to calm her but she worked up a full head of steam sounding off about the risks of using explosives she was right of course i feel terrible for hiding it from her just then crow arrived and picked up the dynamite when mary ordered him to put it down he looked up boldly in the eye and said they'd found something below the hell did they find down there should never come here she's close this is so [ __ ] up government stay focused don't let this

update over doing actual receiving cameras are green and the holes have been demolished over good work lieutenant street through the eastern corridor and be on your guard i hear you over now that approximation the creature is eight feet tall bipedal wing wing webbing appears to be affixed to its forelimbs into the digits of its hands epidermis looks to be smothered in some sort of excretion underneath it is diseased almost creature is starting to rapidly decompose in death drop kick this is mailman 21 actual approaching eastern passage over i see you christ these doors took a hammer those things must have come through here in force whoever man that weapon took a stand and held them off before they got massacred from behind these creatures aren't dumb the predators bet your bottom dollar if they came this way before they could come again ugh [Music] it's the closest i've been to hell do to deserve that killed by a stake through the heart pretty sure those creatures didn't do this who did oh no buffy who maybe you should hold on to that never know when you're gonna need a sharp mistake right [Music] blowing a hole through the rock face we found a gateway to a strange world below a phosphorescence emanated from beneath casting its eldritch light over us all lady bradshaw was insistent that we descend further perhaps mary is right and bradshaw is becoming reckless and uncontrollable but i can't stop thinking about what's down there i am now working with crow and pullman to set up a winch and elevator to descend into the shaft [Music] what mysteries lie below i wonder undisturbed by the world above what's that it says they found something weird down here yeah no [ __ ] looks like he's been drained dry you gotta be one of those explorers more crap what'd you find nothing that's gonna get us out of here right now i couldn't give a crap if it was the crown jews of england perfect this looks like a good chokepoint any of those freaks coming up from below

underestimate them we mind the sides we're more likely to catch him out smaller spread but the explosives are better hidden what do you think let's go for maximum coverage wire up the middle of the corridor let's do it we've got to make each one count i can hear your brain taken away what is it should have given her a second warning [ __ ] man i wish i hadn't asked i'm through talking about this yeah what's left to say you know that checkpoint was a prime target for suicide bombers we had to act in the moment we had to make a call it was the wrong call why is it that no one ever tells it straight everyone just makes a [ __ ] to get by that's why we're in the sandbox in the first place right i just want the truth jason shooting that woman mess with my head you seriously gonna tell me
