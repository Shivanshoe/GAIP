ancestors [Music] i've never seen anything like this i've never seen so few wayfinders so what now we talk to people maybe find out what drew luke here it's nice to look up at the sky and see kites flying around instead of first order ships coming to get me and my family this whole festival really takes my mind off their galaxy-wide occupation you know don't know if you can tell but i'm not from around here i suggest talking to a local they look like the knowledgeable types [Music] that weird hermit keeps ruining my vibe fumbling around with his mask on muttering ochi this and ochi that wish he would just goachie away this is one of the weirdest collections of folks i've ever seen and i witnessed the ewok duloc wars my neck feels bare all other outsiders have those beautiful necklaces on where do i get one of those well that was useless let's try asking a local that's an excellent name i'm ray you can't hide grey what it's the mask isn't it i'm going to find you and i'm going to turn you to the dark side we'll see my knights and i are going hunting for the scavenger we have to go back to the falcon now leia sent me a transmission general calrissian we're looking for exigal luke and i were tailing an old relic hunter orchard he was carrying a clue that could lead to a wayfinder only two were made we followed his ship halfway across the galaxy it was abandoned out past lurch canyon i've got a bad feeling about this we've spotted the fugitives go there those speeders [Music] we have to get to og's i'm on it they fly now they fly now i won't be able to fly this thing if i'm

judging by the circumference of the tunnel walls that i said i do not want to know not [Music] bones i don't like bones nevertheless before we were gone we might still be with way out this way we have to hurry guess we're not the first ones to end up down here horrible things have happened with this there's writing on it oh i know exactly where the wayfinder is unfortunately i am mechanically incapable of speaking translations from sith [Music] [Applause] [Music] i just transferred a bit of life force energy from me to him we gotta keep moving to find someone who can translate that dagger

an option 3po hmm [Music] ray chewie huh [Music] ray they got true [Music] oh hello hello it's all right you're with us now no no thank you chewie had the dagger that was the only clue to the
