it's glitched and completed the ten were dedicated soldiers working together as a squad and sharing in their duty and when the time came for battle they took to the skies and leaped to glory all to nox seek to follow their example before the chief it was one of the few things the clans had in common send this to my stash and protect those were the ten they knew how to use the jungle's depths to distract the enemy until the perfect moment to strike generations ago my clan the lowland looked to this one for inspiration as they claimed the jungle to the south west hey outlander you have an old world recording this box was speaking with voices of the old ones but now there's noise over them let me take a look where did you find this we took it from an asaram delver she was trying to steal it and other artifacts from tanakh territory the others were going to bury it in the sand with her but then i heard the voices well the data here is badly corrupted but delta juliet 9 you are weapons free and clear to engage the swarm good hunting copy that we'll buy zero dawn the time you need down to juliet nine out the voices of warriors from the past and that asaram wanted to sell them for shards the bravery of the ten should be remembered i'm not sure what you mean by the ten these voices came from the final battle of the old ones another battle i could learn more about it if i could find the other boxes that delver did say there might be more recordings to be found in the wreckage of ancient flying machines she claimed she had a way to locate them yeah the box with the voice data on it is emitting a locator signal i could use it to find the others if you do then bring them back here i will see to it that they're treated with proper respect whatever sacrifices were made by these ancient soldiers we will honor them [Music] let me know when you have one that you'll part with do you get many awesome delvers in tinnock's territory fewer every time we catch them but those thieving rats would do anything for the shards they'll always be some who'll risk coming here then what do you do with the ones you catch delvers spend their lives in the dust so we bury the minute alive why do you want these recordings every battle teaches its soldiers we should learn those lessons and honor those who fell that is our way if i find more of those recordings i'll bring them back to you my focus can detect beacons from those recording devices should help me to find any others that are still out there during their war the ten climbed sheer rock braving blinding snow and wind they stopped at nothing to protect their own you make them sound invincible they weren't but the visions tell us of their courage and strength something our soldiers aspire to the sky clan admires this one above all the rest they make their home in the mountains northwest of here [Music] what's this one about the ten waged war against their enemy in the desert heat a land too harsh for any to survive but against all odds they prevailed so the desert clan does the same you must have passed through their territory on the way here i did they sound a little extreme they take that as a compliment ten clean i can get it from my stash later are you the only one listening to these voices oh no the others who captured the asaram delver heard the voices from these ancient warriors too they spread the word and now a lot of people are talking about them soldiers are interested in old battles i hope you find what you want from these recordings can i ask you something of course i'll see if this uh the chief is inside are you ready to see him i'm ready good come it's underneath the throne i will see you soon outlander the savior of meridian i am told you held back regala's forces outside barren light and defeated her champion greta in single combat impressive i met feshav there too he says you were a great warrior and a man of honor his death is a painful loss among many we will not soon recover from the massacre of our marshals but if you are here to pledge your service could help considerably i am not here to fight for you i need something in that basement something that will save many lives yours included it's not something you can see but it is there i have seen it you have named your price now i name mine with my marshalls dead i need your spear help me defeat my enemies and i will grant you access to the chamber below i don't have a price i am not a hired killer i'm here to save lives more than you can count i count the corpses of martial slain i count hundreds more to knock them whose lives hang in the balance i will fight for them i will kill anyone who threatens the peace and you will too if you want me to open the door to the chamber below okay so by that logic what's stopping me from killing you right now and taking what i need to save everyone you could try you might even succeed either way you must fight my way might hold off regala and the slaughter she craves fine what do you need i need more marshals to keep the tribe together such warriors can only be promoted at a trial by combat called the cool route i've sent out a call for the competition but since regala seeks to undermine me she is certain to attack it she'll want to kill me in front of the assembled clans so what you want me to be your bodyguard no to defend the cool route but there is more knowing regala will attack one of the clans have walked at sending their contestants you must go north and force dakota the commander of the sky clan to submit and send his best force him to submit do whatever is necessary i can't hold a cool route with two of the three clans in attendance marshall cathala will assist you he was maimed at barren light but he can still be of use i sent him ahead to the northern village of stone crest meet him there and he will guide you to the sky clan stronghold if you have any questions about your mission now is the time vashav called regala your greatest mistake why that is not your concern really i fought against her forces at baron light and i don't even know what her problem is she was the deadliest of my marshals the point of my spear so what happened above all regala despises the karja who burned her younger brothers alive after we turned back the red raids and tore down the battlements of barren light she hoped to chase them all the way to meridian she could not see the cost of such a war nor the benefits of peace after the mad sun king fell when i accepted of odds and treaties she went mad called me traitor challenged me before the marshalls what did you do when regala challenged you if you were to knock you would know that such a challenge cannot be refused it was not easy to subdue her i bear seven scars from that fight the other marshals wanted me to execute her on the spot but i found i could not sever the bond between us her loyalty had been as boundless as her rage so i spared her rather than mercy she took it as a humiliation one she will never be free from so regala wants you dead she does but that will not be enough she won't rest until all three clans fall in behind her as she marches on meridian who knows with machines under her control perhaps she can raise it to the ground it's been tried before so i hear i'm sorry about faschav he seemed like a good man more than a man a bridge between tanakh and karja no outlander ever earned our respect as he did i had hoped he would be my voice in meridian that peace with the karja might become something more an alliance an exchange the karja have much we lack our deeds are written in ink upon our bodies our memories die with our flesh but the carja never forget their deeds are written in book and scroll you wanted to learn from them as i learned from he will be missed what exactly is the cool route where once the clans fought each other now we fight as one against the machines that is my law made manifest in the cool route each clan must send contestants whenever i call for the ritual these contestants face trial by combat against machines in an arena just beyond these walls those who distinguish themselves become marshals who bind the tribe together as peacekeepers you called them peacekeepers but the marshals i met at the embassy were warriors warriors yes but more they renounce the clan that birthed them and pledged themselves to order in peace they enforce my law they settle disputes and stand for tanakh in parlay with other tribes without them i cannot rule which is why you must ensure the next cool route takes place why won't the sky clan send contestants to the cool route of the three clans they have the most defensible base protected by a mighty wall called the bulwark their commander believes he can wait out the war between regala's forces and my own safe behind his barrier staying strong while you and regala weaken each other you think like a seasoned marshal good why send me to deal with the sky clan all to noth respect strength and you drove regala back at barren light that and most of your marshalls are dead correct what about katalo can't he do it by himself he is maimed they will no longer respect him that hardly seems fair what is fair about losing an arm whether they respect him or not katalo still has worth he knows the sky clan he was raised in their base he will guide you well you said you saw what's in the basement i did on the day of my greatest victory what do you mean for a dozen generations the three clans battled for control of this hallowed ground only i achieved it i fought for years killed whoever stood in my way when i had finally slain all rivals i stood alone in the grove victory was mine to save her or so i thought thunder roared from the east and a bolt of blue struck this place that chamber gaia dies and ether arrives all around me the visions of the grove grew louder and brighter and suddenly a new one appeared before me the old ones spoke and what they said changed everything what did the old ones say to you in this new vision the one called faraday foretold the growing danger of the machines and said we must unify to stop them she called for marshals to enforce the peace then the vision faded never to be seen again i marked the spot where it shone with my spear and i took faraday's words to heart renounced war between the clans trained warriors to fight machines ordained marshals through the cool route since then the tribe has been at peace until regala attacked at barron light and the chamber beneath the throne you went in after the vision i did inside is an ancient device it hums with power you will see it for yourself after the cool route this i swear i'll do what you want and go north to deal with dakota but you'd better not forget about our deal you will have what was promised if you succeed speak to deca on your way out she will arm you for the road ahead uh come let us speak hikaru said you have something for me a weapon to aid your mission you'll need it for the long road to stonecrest many machines prowl along the way and our scouts have cited regala's rebels in the area machines and rebels nothing i haven't faced before indeed head north towards the foothills ascended slopes until your legs burn and the chill air catches in your chest then you'll know you're in the sky clan's domain strike true as the ten ailoy if i'm gonna get ether i guess i'll have to play along with akaro i better meet up with marshall catallo at stonecrest he'll be faster if i ride a machine wow this image is over the old world [Music] looks like a plane in some kind of normal structure this will be my stash when i need it huh uh [Music] i think the image was taken overlooking a field maybe i could try to line it up somewhere in the nearby that hills structure looks like the one in the image i think i might be close to where it was taken that did it uh [Music] you there over here you're the champion come from out east i've heard of your deeds in battle my people owe you a debt so i'll share what i know of this land with you there's much i see in here that might help you in your travels for example did you know that wherever you go in the clan lands you'll find places where the ten left their mark there's an ancient tower north of you i've heard rumors that relics have been sighted there but it could just be idle chatter maybe i'll have a look that's the spirit no news for me champion carry on oh [Music] my fingers feel stiff in this cold [Music] uh [Music] [Music] keep this for a cook [Music] ground's getting steeper air's getting cold should be getting close to stone crest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] not one more step the tanakhs don't suffer outlanders in the clan lands i was given rite of passage by marshall fashave i'm not here to fight hair like blood this is the warrior who defeated gruda champion of the traitor ragala her life is not ours to take you may enter but mind our ways you will be watched i'll keep that in mind this must be stone crest catalogue should be waiting for me but maybe i should look around first what careful not to let this stain in my hands [Music] are you looking to trade right your loss where's kotolo [Music] i have something to share what you've done for my people is known throughout the clan line of eastern ground i'd like to help you if i can lending you my eyes and ears nothing happens in this area without me knowing that in fact i should tell you they say you're a skilled fighter outlander but i wonder how well you'd do against de reyo one of our combat trainers at the bulwark pretty sure i can hold my own but there's always room to learn well said pay arreyo a visit if you can maybe i will this valley is infested with regardless rebels the scots from the village tell us that they've been moving machines through here for days some they ride others they hurt along and some they even strip for parts especially cannons the path ahead will not be easy we should get going my orders are to guide you to the ball work so that you can speak to decote for all the good it'll do not so fast i'm gonna need a little more than that what is this place stone crust was built as an outpost back when the clans were still at war its purpose was to guard the entrance to the valley as well as keep watching what happens below [Music] and for now that means keeping watch on regala's forces i wish we had enough soldiers to do more than just look on [Music] for all the good it'll do what's that supposed to mean the bulwark has stood unyielding since the birth of our clan behind it tekote believes himself to be invulnerable if he insists on defying carl's orders an outlander an unnamed marshal aren't gonna change his mind your chief seems to think differently and that is the only reason i am still standing here talking to you what makes the bulwark so impenetrable it's made of massive boulders impervious to any frontal assault no army or machine has ever penetrated it i am the only thing that can get you inside if we're done talking that is what makes you so sure dakota won't listen to us a snake safe in its lair he has nothing but its own rattle come on is that all you've got for me hikaru said you were from the sky clan before becoming a marshal i need to know what you know dakota is a petty vindictive schemer if he had any guts he would have gone after her carl long ago but instead he covets the chieftain from behind the ball work biding his time hoping that his foes will weaken one another [Music] is that enough for you for now why do you think regales forces are driving machines through the valley we've heard similar reports from across the clan lands the rebels are gathering machines from the wilds but whatever control they have over them doesn't seem to last so they heard them into camps something else happens there something something that makes their control permanent i've been to their camps you're right they have equipment that can establish a lasting override may the ten help us all but it gets worse we've heard rumors that the rebels are scouting larger machines i don't know what kind let's hope they don't learn how to override them too [Music] you were at the embassy i was i'm sorry about the other marshals and their deaths will not go unpunished you're still healing i will never heal but that won't stop me from cracking any skulls that need it good thing you're on my side then so what's the plan the ball work is to the southwest so undoubtedly we'll have to cross paths with regardless troops along the way we'll either have to fight our way through or find a way to sneak past unnoticed neither will be easy never is let's get this over with trail i should watch out on me travel safely soldier how would you convince dakota to send his challengers i wouldn't come on to knock the respective blade and the strength of the fighter who wields it how good is anyone who lacks that well lucky for us we're both good fighters but let's hope it won't come to that so this whole valley is the sky client's territory yes the clan has defended it for generations against who the other to knock the clans even the carja long ago if you want a history lesson talk to or sneak around i will follow so oh it seems quieter when it snows i need help here yes good onwards to the bulwark those rebels were gathering machine parts maybe to make more overrides and dakota won't do anything why would he when he has the bulwark i grew up behind the wall it's easy to have a false sense of safety there more rebels in the clearing take the lead third time this week oh and he's kind we're under attack ugh [Music] [Music] you should respect the outlander oh i thought you broke oh now let's go i'll save the extra stock for later come this way back at stonecrest you said the rebels have been moving through here for days by the time dakota realizes he's outmatched this entire valley might be overrun if not for the sake of the rest of the clan i would welcome that day to see his pride ruined here it is the bulwark let me know when you are ready and i will announce us [Music] you there a marshal requests an audience with your clan commander i didn't know there were any marshals left we defend the path to the mountain where the wings of the ten shall find us all right marshall i'll send the lift for you when we meet with dakota i'll do the talking we'll see how it goes back again so this was home a long time ago come on hit ardor soldier he's not made a straw what's he doing with an outlander the last martial well this is a warm welcome an outlander and a maimed marshall a spectacle reminds me of where i grew up i never decided which was worse and they shunned me and when they stopped and stared right now i prefer shunned ready we're here for takote let us in um the sky clan's mighty sun returns bless the ten your chief has demanded an immediate dispatch of all challengers to the cool route we're here to make sure yours haven't gotten lost on their way to the grove when i see regala must have dealt our chief a mighty blow if he's sending you to his messengers this one defeated regala's champion grudar at the embassy she fought honorably i had the sense to bar our soldiers from that embassy just as i have the sense now to keep our challengers here if they must fight then they will fight here defending our walls our clan that wall won't protect you not from the machines regala controls they're already at your doorstep and what do you know of the battles that the bulwark has withstood the blood shed upon stone i know it wasn't meant to be used as a coward's shield you were a great warrior once but that was then with all due respect that we will keep our challengers here for as long as we are safe behind the bulwark i told you words are useless with his kind we're gonna have to kill him it won't be easy with all his men and bob are you even listening for as long as we are safe behind the bulwark he said wait here i need to get a closer look at that wall what why that well might not be as strong as dakota thinks it is i need to get down to the base of it check it out come trade i'm sure of it snow's melting on my clothes beaten already outlander oh just you wait need to get a little distance from the wall in order to scan it properly okay time to scan the wall just what i thought there's something metal in there oh that rock is interfering with the scan i need to get closer but how i might be able to climb up on the left side of the wall near that waterfall where's this water coming from i cry at them now better scan that tank again power core i'll bet if i blew it up but how well can't do anything else here better go find katahlo [Music] [Music] the guard said you've been scurrying around the wall like a rat what in the name of the tongue have you been up to dakota said he wouldn't send his challengers as long as they're safe behind the bulwark right don't remind me so we take it down did you hit your head on the way down here i'm serious there's something from the old world stuck in there and it has a power i could blow it up if i just penetrate the first layer of rock even if what you're saying is true it would take a cannon to do that you're right and you said the rebels were stripping them off machines back in the valley come on no i'm not getting dragged further into this madness hecaro ordered you to help me you gonna defy him like that arrogant  up there [Music] that was an unkind comparison the rebels might have made camp northeast of here and then what the two of us go up against all of them pretty much yeah oh you may lack so um back there with dakota it seemed like there's bad blood between you two there is if we make it through this plan of yours perhaps i'll tell you i'll hold you to that we're getting close to where we saw the rebels before well it looks like the rebels just got a lot more firepower ready move out um you wanted your cannon and that thing hasn't this won't be easy to take down especially with this i'll handle the big guy you focus on the others i'll follow you in ross will hurt it tired this is not the day for standing around someone there you see that too [Music] [Music] anyone else see anything i didn't see anything [Music] down and again how you breathe oh oh oh [Music] [Music] i'm all right oh [Music] reputation oh got them all so oh [Music] i'm not looking forward to hauling this all the way to the bulwark here i may be maimed but i've still got a strong back after you now this will do some damage it's dangerous even with missing parts it was good to take the fight to them for once you really think this thing will do the job i don't know soon enough uh uh is i wonder how much snow is gonna pile up here it is but you don't just need a cannon you need a miracle coming right up well go on okay gotta blast away some rocks so i can expose the power cell it's working this isn't gonna work well isn't this impressive two children playing siege i hope they haven't heard the bulwark's feelings come now stop embarrassing yourselves and leave this poor mountain alone this is your last chance to cote you can still answer hikaru's call this is your last chance you have it backwards leave this place savage now and take this with you [Music] [Music] oh ugh what have you done can't hide behind the wall anymore dakota now you have to join hikaro never never we will we will rebuild it immediately you are not safe the bulwark couldn't protect you from a single cannon let alone an army of machines the only pathway to safety is to unite against regala with your chief you decreed that no challenges would be sent while the clan remains safe behind the bulwark [Music] so send them now unless your word means nothing [Music] send them i didn't hear you send the challengers i look forward to seeing the sky clans colors in the arena nicely done marshall what's gonna happen to this place they'll have to live without their wall but that's better than living apart from the tribe as pawns and ticolt's foolish schemes if you want to check up on them talk to jarrah the chaplain of the clan if anyone needs help up there she'll know yeah maybe i will i'll take my leave then i need to report to hecaro i'll see you at the culvert good we may need another miracle there as well [Music] i'm not sure where to get the parts i need oh maybe i should go up there see if everyone's all right and find this chaplin gara might also be a good idea to resupply before i head back out foreign [Music] [Music] you
