sauk central it confirms that lieutenant colonel king has assumed control of this operation i'm gonna need access to your network who the hell are you this is dr stokes i've given her full clearance i bet you have okay i guess i'll go figure it out for myself dr stokes please prepare the presentation you found something  is that modern art or something this is footage from the highly classified chaos program that's supposed to mean something to me it's a thermal satellite system that i personally pioneered oh well i'm impressed please pioneer away you behave like this in all your briefings corporal boys are just eager to catch a break sir no harm meant very well satellite sweeps of the war zone have uncovered what appears to be an underground storage facility this will of course require further investigation but i strongly suspect where saddam's chemical weapons are hidden we got you you son of a centcom has given the green light to raid the facility and seize any weapons on site hostilities may be over but there are hold out groups of republican guard all over the country they could deploy those weapons at any time so we need to move fast the army is giving us a ride out there in their helos on rival lieutenant colchek will lead the raid on the facility once it's secured we'll carry out a full weapons inspection now listen up there's been a change of leadership but rachel's operational expertise and local knowledge is just as valuable as ever she'll be flying with us and i want you all to show her the same respect any questions what the we waiting for i'm ready that's tribal territory out there colonel make no mistake those people are fair i take it we're getting their support nah too many birds can bring them down on us we move fast in fast out yeah that's pretty much what your mama said to me hey careful boy if i didn't pull out so fast it could have been your papi all right that's enough merlin sir what's your call i'll put in a request for air support to be on standby our birds can fly low under the radar the site is in the zagros mountain so we'll have plenty of ground cover we go dark until weapons are secured if we don't break radio sounds within 24 hours centcom will mount a rescue operation a lot of can go down in 24 hours i'll quit being a i'm just saying that's all this is why we went to war this is what gets us out of bed every morning make no mistake ladies and gentlemen this is how we stop saddam from using these weapons [Music] be right in one hour dismissed [Music] louise help me stop the equipment i'm on it i don't know man this don't feel right i'm getting this tingle down the back of my neck oh sweetie look could rub down we'll sort that right out huh i'm serious i got a real bad feeling about this that's what you get from spending too much time with eric [Music] there anything you can do i'm gonna download the latest satellite data you can have some alone time with him thank you clarice eric we need to talk there's something i have to tell you you should know it wasn't my decision to take over your operation rach this is it everything i've worked on these past years it's ready this is the big break we've been waiting for this isn't about us eric i just want things to go back to the way they were how we left it things weren't so great between us worse a lot worse nothing has changed eric you know that you and i there is no uni it's over please rage don't say that you're not wearing your wedding ring hey be careful with that oh sorry you got in that box of tricks anyway the is

you back in hg what the hell do we need this crap for we need to be mobile we need to be prepared the facility is underground possibly under construction safer this way you want me to feel safe you give me some more shooters so you're my technician i've heard about you i should hope so i'm here to keep our gear in check and if any iraqis pop their heads up i'll take them clean off you seem pretty confident corporal you need any assistance with the climbing gear i'm here to help i'm sure i'll manage colonel gear pencil pusher [Music] you think we'll bag chemical ali at this facility he's in the vicinity we'll get him that almost makes it worth the risk almost well you know i'd still rather be sitting behind a desk if hits the fan at least we can rely on air support to dig us out i'm sure it won't come down to that you seem confident you seem surprised so is this what i think it is wp shirt white phosphorus it's just for pop and smoke that's all these are only to be used for cover understood understood after all saddam is the one who's breaking weapons conventions nagas now um [Music] uh download's complete let's get to the helos what what you want to ask me something i can

drop to nowhere got rope look there's an airflow i say we climb so when did you start smoking excuse me a lighter it's nothing just something i picked up back at base are you ready are you this place doesn't look much like a weapon silo to me [Music] if there's nothing down here then why were we attacked there's a war on people tend to shoot each other i guess we could classify this as quality time you and i always did have a different view on quality type does this remind you of old times rage you mean the sense of feeling lost [Music] looks old old it's ancient that's uniform sumerian maybe what is this place you're quite the expert on history didn't realize maybe you don't know me as well as you think [Music] floor seems stable yeah it looks fine [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] you've got a certain cool under pressure what do you think this place is hard to say these carvings look religious i think we may be in a temple do you know watch horror movies you should know the answer to that it's a sumerian demon something to do with plagues i think plagues and demons huh great great that's all we need i think we can move it looks jammed pretty tight what is it didn't hear that i didn't hear anything i thought i heard something down there [Music] even in ruins this place is still something special i wonder what happened here that's gunfire where's it coming from we should move can you make anything out that's it's deep that looks safe to you it's our only option get the road we're going down [Music] [Music] oh unbelievable we're not the first ones here damn it all this crap must be what kayla's detecting how could you have gotten it so wrong you look around you went through all this for what like a few barrels and crates i'll learn from this i'll go back and work twice as hard to rewrite the program kayla's will be stronger than ever you don't think i can do it you don't believe in me there's no use in dwelling on it we need to focus on the task ahead and find a way out of this place hell is that subsidence from the aftershocks this looks like archaeological gear somebody was studying this ruin hey we could use those lamps the light got the marines to us do you think that still works it'll work just needs gas we need to find some wherever you are nick i hope you're safe sorry did you say something no nothing eric check this out why would there be a machine gun here it's a world war ii model ties in with the time the archaeologists were here what the happened here i hope we can get this thing started do you think centcom is aware of our situation i'm hoping the pilots got word back if any of them survive that is who could they have been up against i've been cataloging these pieces somewhere  that's a hell of a lot of fireworks all call signs this is king does anyone copy over september the 24th 1945 when lady bradshaw summons you you go mary and i were bound for a honeymoon but the chance to dine with one of britain's finest antiquarians was too great for us to miss when we met brad shaw wore a brooch that caught mary's eye sumerian relic recovered from a dick site in the hashemite kingdom of iraq after dinner she showed us another find from the same site a gold uniform tablet she called it the final puzzle piece in her life's work a map that pinpoints the tomb of alexander the great if she's right the tomb lies somewhere on the border of iraq lady bradshaw wants us to lead her expedition i realize now that our honeymoon will take place in a dusty dig site in the segros mountains this place is starting to make me feel a little uneasy what happened to these guys this temple it was built to appease the gods we need to get these lights running asap i can't see i'll take that thank you this is king to all call signs are you receiving over [Music] eric come give me a hand with these cans that time we had a little luck how's the lake holding up mike oh you mean the prosthesis i lost my leg back on the highway don't i

damn valve is leaking can it be fixed we have to secure the tube before starting the generator there's gonna be something here to fix it you got it i've got it once you said back at the base you were wrong it doesn't sound like me he said nothing had changed between us but i've changed all that time spent away from each other i couldn't stop thinking of you don't you feel the same way even a little i meant what i said it was over between us the minute that truck hit my car nothing has changed that's not how it feels for my side it's definitely how it feels for mine hold the fuel pipe it's done hey give me a hand with this panel look at the state of these they're shot you think we could do this with a little less attitude i'm trying to work why do we leave things like this i tried but you made it so hard for me to stay we should have stuck together i don't think either of us expected to be out of each other's lives for so long or so my head's been buried and chaos and i was blind to anything else sounds less like an apology and more like an excuse it's not either it's the truth you had no idea that k-list would even work rach say what's on your mind i've missed you rach like you wouldn't believe back then i don't know things seem confused but now it just seems simpler it's the past eric we have to put it behind us and look towards the future otherwise we're just going around in circles happy to look to that future [Music] [Music] [Music] we have power there was a way in for these people there's a way out for us let's take a look around [Music] ah huh [Music] this way foreign [Music] [Music] hello [Applause] oh yes all right i hate this place let's go [Music] what do you think the rest of the squad are doing they're tough each and every one of them they'll muscle through maybe climbing out of the cavern back there would have been the smarter move locals were spooked by these mountains i can't say i blame them [Music] [Music] eric take a look at this you think it still works let's find out shall we my tape is all tangled up it's fine i can fix that so when did you stop wearing your wedding ring when did you stop wearing yours i didn't always close to my heart stopped wearing it the day i left i've moved on eric haven't forgotten what this ring means to me but maybe you're right maybe it's too late [Music] the bones of this temple are drenched in blood we have set foot on an uncharted shore and wow something ancient and wicked a blasphemy that comes in indescribable shapes and forms the eons we lived as children in this world unaware of the horrors that slumber because now we have blindly thrown open the gates to the madness i fear but i must do what i must we will seal this place for eternity for all mankind mary i'm sorry hello the hell is going on i don't know man it was not supposed to play out like this any call signs this is king contact contact taking fire didn't even call me over that's rachel okay this is mailman two one
