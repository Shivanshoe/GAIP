[Music] my so this is the final trial i have to be ready stop thinking so much i have to focus on what's in front of me if i can complete this assignment i'll be a member of the osf i'll be able to make my childhood dreams come true you should be able to handle any kind of other with my psychokinesis power here we go [Music] here we go let's keep this up come on here we go [Music] all right there's a chance she would know something about her i have to make it through this exam no matter what we did let's keep this up all right the exam should be finishing up soon the instructor always said the most dangerous thing is being careless at the end [Music] all right let's keep this up so huh here we [Applause] all go here we go [Music] all right [Music] here we go uh [Music] [Music] i do everything i learned from my training i should be able to win i have to hey come on mission successful this concludes the aptitude test so so we're all here captain narakami may i ask a question you don't have to be so formal we call each other by our first names in the osf so we can strengthen our bonds most of us don't look our age ranks are there just to calculate pay the osf only values strength remember that that's the gist of it so what was your question right um water isn't here yet water is this platoon's operator he'll direct us from headquarters my power allows me to communicate telepathically without the system's assistance up to around 500 kilometers that being said it's a lot of work so join the group open your personal port [Music] team leaders will be nagi yuito and sugumi each of you listen to wateru's orders and move to the designated goal try to take down any others along the way retreat is allowed if you think you can't handle it but reach your goal that's all understood okay see you later good luck so the teams are split up but you can use brain talk to share information [Music] hey snobby but it really feels like you're fighting together i need your help good job taking the initiative you gemma [Applause] this is pretty rare a resource reading near here don't wander off don't go into heavily damaged areas understood i'm good at reading air i mean my power is aerokinesis after all that awkward pause was my power too [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here we go oh i have to water the flowers at headquarters oh i already did that the seeds we planted in those pots are sprouted nice recovery i know right every household should have a dependent incogneration wow i have no idea you could use it like that your power is really great this is pretty rare uh keep this up here we go i need your help the oil is making me sluggish come on [Music] uh all right huh that was close all right there all in [Music] looks like the enemy dropped something rare wait there's a resource reading near here what do you want to do [Music] this place is incredible the city is above and below us it feels like i'm in a vr from a theme park i went to when i was a kid it used to serve as the connection base to togetsu the city infrastructure was destroyed in an other attack about five years ago so what you see is what remains togetsu is the stronghold of the togetsu faith right it's kind of like a cult don't say that out loud kaguro was a believer he was even a priest at one time what that guy is a priest hey you do realize i can hear you right don't forget our platoon's headsets are all connected sorry no don't worry about it my parents were believers so i just naturally became a priest i don't care about the teachings at all now the kikuchiba is like this you hardly ever see people coming to suo from the church anymore what's that drone doing damn they found us even though we were jamming them crows captain so they sniffed us out look alive everyone crows and the press guys the crows will make a big deal out of this let's make it exciting the city vision projectors must be broken they're pretty but kind of scary yeah it's like they're looming up there oh huh [Music] all we do is spread the message souls return to the lord huh let's keep this up good [Music] huh put the pressure on come on all right yes we will be able to move forward if we use my power uito some help [Music] i need your help huh okay give it everything you've got here we go we did it come on hey [Applause] here we go [Music] all right huh [Music] uh oh huh sas to fight here we go come on i need your help yep i'm going to get stronger i've been using braintox since i was a cadet but it still makes me uneasy sometimes i worry that someone might hear everything i'm thinking that won't happen it's not telepathy i can't read other people's thoughts either don't worry here we go whoa nice huh oh ueto's team is the first to the objective nice going yeah hey do you hear something good instincts yuito i'm getting other readings nearby no wait this is a major other captain tsugumi a major other has appeared at the objective major others are others that have killed osf members in the past captain it'll take a few minutes for the rest of the teams to arrive this may be rough for rookies but hold out i guess we've got no choice hanabi let's go all right i'm ready this thing does look pretty tough yeah look up there there's the material hanging down i can still fight everyone get back so if you use my power you can turn it into a big firewall found a weak spot yeah not yet don't get worked up because it's a major other keep your eyes open you especially your power lets you use the things around you don't focus only on the enemy in front of you yes sir uh [Music] i need you camera that attack worked that must be a weak spot did we do it are you okay all of you stay back or you'll get hurt hmm uh so the hero of this fight is of course private uh sumaraki who took down a major other on his first assignment congratulations private subarachi let's hear from him thanks how do you feel uh i'm glad we were able to defeat the other your first victory on your first deployment was it satisfying um i can't answer you very well myself please ask the commander september on seventh class captain seto narukami how did private sumouragi do both yuito and hanabi fought very well the fact that private sumoragi was put under your command captain must mean that the top brass thinks highly of you that's something you'll have to ask my superiors about we're pulling out the mission doesn't end until we get to suo keep your eyes open understood [Music] [Music] everyone's here major eden may i ask a question oh naomi we call each other by our first names in the osf don't be so formal no one looks their age here ranks they're just words on paper the osf only recognizes strength i don't like to say we judge on strength alone but that's mostly how it is so what was your question right havreka isn't here yet i wonder if something happened haruka is our platoon's operator she directs us from the back with telepathy can you hear me i'm able to communicate telepathically within a 500 kilometer radius without the system's assistance it's draining though so i need you to join the group naomi kasane open your personal ports [Music] the team leaders are naomi and oh kasani that's awfully nice of you sheedan letting the new scout be leader no i i thought it would be best this way so i volunteered huh well well it's big of you to go along with that sheedan [Music] okay let's get this mission on the road follow haruka's navigation to the specified goal take out any and all others you see along the way if you decide not to fight i authorize you to retreat that's all copy that okay be careful don't provoke cheating too much [Music] can everyone hear me we can use brain talk to communicate whenever we want even when we're split up let me know if anything happens the new urban development ward what a boring assignment it doesn't matter if a mission is boring or not you're such an idiot no real others come out here it's the perfect place to train cadets when your power gets as strong as mine [Music] what's that drone oh man they found us even though we were jamming them major kyogre crows what i didn't know we had any crowbare with us crows do you mean the press they're probably after little miss randall she's a hero that saves civilians no kadama platoon is in the restricted area farther in they're probably here for arashi or always surrounded by crows i finally got out of kodama platoon but i still end up fighting along with them listen up everyone i know the crows will be in your way but try not to get distracted don't those crows realize that we jam them because we don't want them around there's nothing we can do the press uses their right to broadcast osf activity to do whatever they want it's depressing but it's the price we pay for being famous i confirmed a water attack are you okay being wet makes it hard to move it drops something rare i'm allowing you to connect to me through sas do your best with it if you can't thanks to my power there now [Music] ah me what you got i'll support you [Music] take the initiative and you win so that's how you use your psychokinesis to fight seems like a reasonably useful power yeah it is the extinction belts flows [Music] looks like there's a resource reading around here [Music] what electrokinesis might work [Music] [Music] velocity will be affected [Music] [Music] run youngster wanna go are you nervous naomi your breathing is getting a little shallow oh yes a little but i'm okay just take deep breaths you're worried about kasane aren't you she was worried about you too you must be close leave it to me the enemy is done now's the time do it this is pretty good [Music] let's use our she's hyper velocity you useless [Music] [Applause] huh nice job show me what you got [Music] you have to use my duplication the attack is the enemy's outer shell you might be able to break it it's working focus on that uh he didn't need me [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] and was under development for a residential area construction was cancelled but there's still heavy machinery all over the bridge that runs over the river is still used [Music] time to fight back [Music] [Music] uh [Music] we did it it lost [Music] sometimes [Music] [Applause] did you have a big problem with her she acts like everything's fine i have no idea what she's really thinking also she was hard on me for some reason why don't you use hyper velocity with sas i'll support you i confirmed your water attack are you okay see what makes it hard to move it's working focus on that spot i'll do it it's over that was good not quite as good as me though [Music] leave it to me super still fine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm rooting for you i don't think i can lose when i'm with you i'll do it [Applause] help me counter up i'm rooting for you yes did you just forget i was even here [Music] wow team kazani is first to the goal uh team shiden would have been first too something's here good one you picked up on the other before i did wait a minute this one's a major other major gemma a major other has appeared at the objective major others are others that killed osf members in the past yes here it comes i'll intercept we'll be there in a few minutes just hold on contact with a major other don't overdo it kasane she then follow her lead now we're talking hope you're ready to see how strong i am quick barking then fight help me kangaroo this is that killed an osf soldier it's too dangerous to russian blind use your head for example there's material hanging from the ceiling you could use [Music] that nice [Applause] hey if it's water in the tank on this other's back we might be able to use it don't worry i'm here so you don't have to worry just try and back us up as quick as you can right i'll be there [Music] uh it's hard to move when you're wet did we do it this thing is tough what the hell do you think you're doing i can protect myself thank you very much the hero of this fight is of course second lieutenant cassane randall who took down a major other on her first assignment congratulations lieutenant randall let's hear what she has to say how do you feel you must be tired your first victory on your first deployment isn't that satisfying she didn't give all the orders ask him about it what so sorry i'm late that was a good fight oh dear poor sheedan sorry looks like you caught the crow's attention are she you're right they got sheeden [Music] we're about to do a full sweep for others looking forward to seeing all you reporters there oh they're finally gone let's go back to suo everyone copy that [Music] you
