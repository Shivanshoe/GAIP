cute let's keep it simple right simple and it'll be a whole lot simpler if it was just the two of us sam we could be inside already not cleanly have you even thought about a backup plan in case uh sullivan gets cold feet no because he won't or if he got caught sam he knows the people running the auction he's gonna schmooze his way right through that party get upstairs unlock the window and we're in it's a solid plan uh-huh all right fine good say it what if he stole the cross for himself not in a million years victor sullivan same victor we're talking about right yes he's double-crossed people in the past but not us no not you i know you two have never seen eye to eye huge understanding but i trust him all right he's family no no no no i just need you to trust him too fine bye he'll

out of storage just before you guys got here they changed the lot order take a whole pile of cash to make that happen well how long before they start the bidding 10 15 minutes tops that's gonna be some way we can grab it there is just a small manner of a few hundred eyewitnesses there okay but we just need a diversion mike like um like i don't know but there's got to be something if the gods see us making for that cross they don't see us jesus you guys act like you never spend time in prison if you want something dirty done then you wait forever lights out yeah [Music] so we just have to climb up there and kill the lights grab the cross in the dark there will be an emergency generator and that'll give us a few seconds of darkness to work with meaning we'll have to be right next to the cross when the lights go out so there's no way we can get that close without being noticed antipasti [Music] [Music] that will work all right all right i'll i'll get to the breaker room kill the power

of code or a phone number come on the dates huh look 1659. it's the year avery was born 1699. let me guess the year he died but by most accounts yeah but that means we have date of birth date of death and paradise which means we're looking for avery's grave saint dismisses cathedral wait a second hasn't rafe been scouring that site for ages already yeah the cathedral see these symbols yeah these are found on old scottish gravestones right right now look at this the layout of this place is really unusual here's the cathedral but the graveyard is way over here rick's been focusing on the wrong area exactly guys we're going to scotland all right all right wait wait up you do realize that rafe knows you're coming yeah we can deal with that when we get there look that psycho would like nothing

saving sam it is come on it's both right we need the treasure so we can save sam how is elena cool with all this jesus kid look it's just not that simple with all that you two have been through

good call the hell is all this it's excavation equipment shoreline what look i thought they were just by the cathedral  get okay we're good yeah nice to meet you too shoreline seems like they were expecting us and like they're searching away from the cathedral which means we should get to that graveyard pronto exactly what is this place monks had several living quarters main one being by the graveyard of course location location location more shoreline equipment at least no shoreline errs now what do you bet yep dynamite yeah be careful with that stuff huh hey got the door open that was
