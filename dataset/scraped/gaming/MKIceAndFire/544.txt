[Music] the path above the entrance to the shopping district should lead to the boat landing how excellent to know the canal is finished hopefully this puts our days of running all over behind us the faster we can move the faster we can save yonah let's use it as often as we need [Music] we've been dealing with a wave of robberies lately judging by what we found we're dealing with tooth remember the pair of brothers that loiter near the water wheel i fear they may be hiding something from us let's go have us a little chat [Music] hey you you ever seen a treasure map before a treasure map yeah a treasure map you know a map that shows you where to find buried treasure i'm collecting them my lifelong dream is to one day roll naked in a pile of sweet sweet treasure that's an interesting dream so that's why i'm looking for a new treasure map or two if you find one bring it on over to me all right sure thing i guess i should know where to look for a treasure map before telling the guys sure thing one could hardly expect to stumble across such a thing lying on the ground perhaps we should look for a place where old documents are stored old documents huh [Music] um everything in working order [Music] yeah yeah wise i'm good your health is diminished do be more careful next time [Music] if we can't go hunting then we have to fish thank goodness for the sea the shades are much stronger [Music] so [Music] are you two the ones behind the recent robberies you must already know if you're asking like that your tone betrays your guilt confess confess now let the rage of grimoire vice fall upon you okay we did it my brother and me why his dad told us to your own father demanded that you steal this guy sounds like a real piece of work where is he now probably in the tavern that's where he spends all his time got it [Music] hey look who it is remember me that red bag i'm my pages you're the slovenly half of that couple who refused to stop arguing hey it's been a while sure has i've been in charge of this canal since we last talked apparently i did a pretty good job with it because they decided to make me the permanent ferryman oh yeah huh congrats thanks still it's not all puppies and unicorns gold ball and chain is always harping on me now about how much i work anyway if you got a place to be just let me know and i'll take you there [Music] pushed hey you have a pair of sons huh what was it to you huh well you get to ask me all these questions you're forcing your own kids to commit crimes crimes no no it's it's not like that i just i just told them to go find some food for the family now shut your mouth before i before i shut it for you bunch of no good meddlers uh our time is wasted on this drunken scoundrel what a sad excuse for a father how shall we explain this to the client we'll tell him the truth then we'll figure out what to do with the kids hmm what which job should i give you first got a job from seafront if you aren't too busy i wrote down the client's location on did you find the culprit yeah but it's complicated a pair of children driven to steal by an abusive father well i certainly didn't expect this they shouldn't have stolen from you but i don't think they're entirely at fault here agreed i'll talk to the other shopkeepers and make sure they understand thanks oh and i also think we should get them away from their father not sure who could take them folks are barely getting by as it is but let me spread the word and see what we can figure out ah yes your fee well uh shop owners passed the hat and came up with this i hope it's enough using children as tools of thievery unthinkable i can't believe this happened in our village things are more desperate than i knew if we hope to restore the lives of the villagers we must cull as many shades as we can [Music] oh there [Music] the lost shrines up ahead just past this cave as well as the shadowlord's castle let us make haste [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music]

staging a protest have fun don't waste your time but it just feels wrong well that's really nice of you but you still don't have to stay out here with us you got a super important mission you can't sleep out in the rain what if you catch a cold besides i like camping with kaine sometimes we sit around the fire and tell stories or roasts camille that's enough i got a [ __ ] image to maintain [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh we seem to be surrounded by a mob of helpless puppies just kick them aside so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] is [Music] what's going on there's dozens of them these are creatures of the darkness lure them to the light pathetic to the enders aim for that stat it's the leader hmm foolish creatures you cannot poke the best these little bastards just keep coming screechers get on the back sun lure them into the light right have you felt the beast [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] [Music] kanye hi hurry strike it down [Music] connie are you all right connie i fear there is little we can do for her no kinetic [Music] what is happening [Music] kenny kaine [Music] [Music] it's kinase jade with no other choice we must strike it down now pin her down friday please come back to us oh dear i i couldn't hold it back i can't be with we're always going to be together kaine if you transform again we'll just stop it again as many times as it takes i don't care how tough it is we're gonna get you back i like sleeping outside because i'm with you kaine i'm able to ignore my appearance and keep going because of you i'm weak and i'm sad and i'm lonely but you make me strong you're my friend and i need you so don't you dare leave me all right all right stop crying and thanks i'm all right over there and what is this it's me it's got some kind of writing on it but i don't know what it says how remarkably useless of you well let's go ask popola it's a cipher of some kind [Music] can you determine its meaning i think this is the key to unlocking the shadow lord's castle here take a look at this i wrote down all the words i can understand [Music] this fragment is called the stone guardian given that you found it in the lost shrine the words must mean something there are spaces here for four other fragments as well sacrifice the law of robotics the memory tree loyal cerberus the law of robotics probably refers to the junk heap and the memory tree might be the forest of myth but as for sacrifice and loyal cerberus i don't have a clue not a problem if we want to fill in the words we just run around the world killing every big monster we find right oh splendid by all means let us undertake a murderous rampage they're just shades besides it's the only way to reach the shadow lord it's a dangerous task yeah well jonas and even more but how can you even be sure that she's because she is all right the junk heap in the forest of myth yeah i'm on my way please be careful oh and listen about kaine and emil the villagers know how much they've sacrificed and they're thankful it's just they're scared you know people can't change overnight i'll hurry them along the best i can but can you please give them a little more time i'll try [Music] [Music] popola said we might be able to find something in the forest of myth you will forgive me if i seem less than enthusiastic about such a trick [Music] why did he have to die what is this black squall anyway why does this only happen to us why perhaps we should be going [Music] so [Music] how did it come to this my life is over i tell you over i sense another inane and time-consuming request coming on best to just walk away while you still cannot easy vice hey there what's going on whoa friend whoa is what's going on so i ended up having to work on me and my honey buns wedding anniversary right and since we couldn't celebrate the occasion together things got a little heated i want to make it right and get back in her good books but i'm a little in over my head think you could help a guy out it'll take a hell of a present to make up for a missed wedding anniversary i thought the same thing so i asked my sweet dumpling if there's anything she wants and she told me i want that thing you promised me back when we were newlyweds that sing exactly the problem is i can't for the life of me remember what it was can you believe i forgot oh i am just the worst so you have any idea what my wife might want come on you gotta help me out here well her hair was um sort of dark right was it now regardless i do not believe this to be a productive train of thought lad now all that comes to mind is how they argue all the time the same thought though it hardly seems a credible lead for a gift of atonement well you guys carry matching red bags right red ah that's it we got married after learning we had a shared love of all things crimson so she'll definitely want something red i remain skeptical this will lead us to something his wife truly desires you're so close i can taste it let's see red red yeah i got nothing here what do you think i should give her how about a fancy jewel hmm yeah i guess she might have mentioned wanting something like that a long time ago flowers everyone loves a good flower yeah i don't feel like i've seen my wife giving well girls like sweet things right what like apples yeah she loves apples but the problem is she already eats them all the time this is getting us nowhere can you believe she actually married this lout you know what fine i'll just get her apples a red jewel and some red flowers and call it a day should be easy enough for me to get the apples and flowers squared away in seafront but i'll probably need your help finding a red jewel what do you say help out a pal for old times sake how could i say no when you look at us with those puppy dog eyes sure i'll track you down in jewel oh thank you thank you thank you once you found it just bring it right to my home in seafront okay [Music] a red jewel is this the strange thing store might deal in such articles let's go check it out you know i bet they sell red jewels at the strange thing store in facade anywho where you headed [Music] [Music] i say each time we encounter that bickering couple anew we are made to endure an even further torrent of meaningless and incessant chatter yeah they love to talk all right remind you of anyone grimoire vice is one hundred times they're better you don't see this old tome blissing about starting donny brooks and set now do you [Music] foreign uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if i can track them down they're all [Music] yours [Music] foreign [Music] hold on hey so we're looking for a red jewel long story please don't ask you happen to have one i saw you this is less a jewel and more simple wait really thanks let's head for back dude's house so we can give him his jewel i imagine it would be quickest to make for seafront by way of the canal [Music] it's hard to believe there are plants that can grow in this desert yeah this will never work how do you mean i mean if plants could grow here it would be full of them god looks can be so stupid sometimes have you ever planted anything before kane nope well then you don't know you gotta try things out for yourself indeed experimentation can often be the key to new knowledge you guys sure are a bunch of optimists [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] so [Music] [Music] you got a red jewel oh this is amazing here come with me to seafront so we can get ready to give it to her okay [Music] welcome to seafront i'll hurry and get the apples and flowers together so let's say you just head on over to my place see you soon [Music] what a journey this has been let us make for the couple's home at once [Music] it's you i've heard a great many stories about you making quite the name for yourself hmm yeah i don't know about that oh no need to be so modest after all i may have a job for someone with your particular talents i'm listening i need you to retrieve three crates of particular import from a ship that was wrecked at sea this cargo has likely washed ashore on all the far-flung corners of the world so it will be a task of some difficulty can i count on your assistance sure no problem ah excellent excellent oh and whatever you do you must not unseal the cargo well now i'm curious why can't i open it i was shipping some rather unique products if you were to see them it might place me in something of a dilemma hey it's your money you don't want me to look fine hey i know you you're that kid who takes any job no matter how weird or demeaning not really how i phrase it but okay i've got a merchant ship that needs some repairs think you can round up some materials for me i need five logs 20 deaded metal boards and 10 that hardly seems necessary a trading business huh is something the matter no it's just that well i've never left this area it's got me wondering what it would be like to visit another country i'd love to take iona on a trip like that sometime and someday you shall i will i'm sure of it [Music] oh look who it is oh i remember the two of you and we most certainly recall you madame that lover's coral you had back then was the stuff of myth and legend oh hey welcome home honey pants hey snuckums so remember how i said i was going to make things up to you after that whole wedding anniversary fiasco well i tried and tried but i just couldn't remember what i promised to get you all those years ago but i had these two gents help me out and we put together a whole bunch of stuff we thought you might like huh well i'm glad you put so much thought into it but these are all wrong very wrong what when we went to all that trouble for nothing honey the only thing i wanted was a nice home-cooked meal back when we were newlyweds you promised to make me a big feast of all your tastiest dishes one day remember huh now that you mention it work has been so crazy lately that i haven't done much cooking at all i know how hard you've been working your little tushy off for my sake muffin so here's your punishment you're making dinner tonight and you two are going to join us wait us you sure of course i'm sure it's the least we could do after all the trouble this big lug of mine put you through [Music] i'm at a dining table filled with apple-based cuisine red roses and a single crimson stone [Music] illuminated by candlelight a married couple fills the room with joyous laughter [Music] the scene fills me with an unfamiliar sense of calm [Music] just a happy family gathered around the table it feels so very normal i never thought i'd feel this way again [Music] so i stuff my face with the great feast before me hoping it helps to hide the tears welling in my eyes [Music] so what did you think of my love muffins cooking it was all delicious man i can't thank you enough and though it boggles my mind to say it i greatly enjoyed the company and conversation sorry again for all the trouble but i hope this lets you know how grateful i am [Music] i know he can be a handful but i hope you'll continue being friends with my husband oh and we'd just love to have dinner with you again sometime would we ever things get pretty boring when it's just the two of us oh i'm sorry am i boring you now oh wait no that's not what i meant obviously we've been down this road and know where it leads lad flee at once right yeah so uh we're just gonna go thanks for [Music] dinner [Music] [Music] i must say i'm rather surprised you didn't bother to learn how to swim these past five years i can't swim my uh my weapon is just heavy whatever you say lad those shades are wreaking havoc with our shipments we risk our lives every time we deliver something hey did you hear the news what is it there's a giant shade in the southern plains and they say it likes to eat postmen really i've never heard of shades eating people yeah well people say the bodies look like they've been torn apart and chewed on we're all too scared to deliver the mail with that thing around the shades are becoming more of a threat than ever before all right i'll see what i can find [Music] hey buddy you know a place called the lost shrine yeah i know it listen i'm what's called a botanist that means i study plants this is all probably way over your head but just bear with me all right buddy anyway this lost shrine place supposedly contains a very rare tree and i'm looking for someone to go there and borrow a piece of its root what do you think come on buddy it's just one little piece of root [Music] i'll do it you have to stop calling me buddy [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah another day another fight with the wife over some stupid little thing i tell you work's been so busy lately we're always getting into a scrap about something anyway enough about me [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so ah the home of that blasted dream yeah truly a nightmare i hope never to experience again i hear you [Music] oh hello how are things you want to know if anything unusual is happening well i have been feeling a rather strange presence whenever i visit the divine tree the divine tree it's a legendary tree that exists in the heart of our village did you investigate the cause of this presence not really no and why not well we're not really supposed to go near the tree except for prayer and why is that i don't know it's just how things have always been [Music] weird [Music] the key to the shadow lord's castle you're talking crazy talk anyway enough of your madness let's talk about my story [Music] why do we seem to encounter nothing but odd people lately you should talk vice as if grimoire vice is capable of spouting such nonsense hang on i don't think it's done does that mean it'll tell us what we want to know that'd be nice do [Music] jesus [Music] see [Music] treat us [Music] [Music] oh [Music] now [Music] [Music] what's in there i never realized shades were capable of rational thought i don't care if they can tap dance and play the fiddle i just want to kill him without all this hassle with the tree defeated we no longer have to worry about being buried in its world of letters unless of course time itself begins to rewind [Music] popola said we might be able to find a key fragment in the junk heap perhaps we can find a clue at two brothers weaponry the strange presence has left the divine tree but it made me think i mean why are we worshiping a tree that's odd right [Music] sometimes i wonder why we do any of the things we do oh that reminds me i have a rather interesting story for you would you care to hear it [Music] the strange presence but it oh that reminds me [Music] anyway enough about [Music] die little bastards calm yourself taste will only lead you to making an ill-timed mistake an unstable heart is the worst armor one can have no time for that vice gotta get to yoda [Music] so [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] mr man there's got to be tons of machinery here yeah but i don't know how much we can actually use oh wow check this out it looks brand new hey be careful all right this place is dangerous i'll be fine oh no huh look out huh huh jacob oh god this can't be happening jacob jacob no [Music] huh [Music] the junky perhaps we should speak to the brothers they might know something about this [Music] oh hey there it's been a while you're the little one aren't you you've grown up how fair is your brother my brother's been dead for four years oh i see please forgive the question it's okay i need to ask you something what is it you heard any rumors about shades around here not the little ones i'm looking for one that's unusually big and powerful no i haven't heard about anything like that but i haven't really been listening all i want is to destroy robots just rip them up okay never mind then see you later wait yes i recently got my hands on a weapon a very powerful weapon i thought you might get some use out of it [Music] this sword has seen better days yeah it's pretty beat up i mean there's potential but it's fairly powerless right now can you repair it i can repair anything with the proper materials if you'll fix it i'll get the parts i'm so glad i decided not to throw this out i'm gonna need some memory alloy only the real big enemies on the second basement level have them so watch yourself also here's the passcode to get down there use it on the elevator you got it i'm gonna need some mem only the real big enemies you got by the what can i help you with [Music] uh [Music] it's a shame about the older lad he was but a child sounds like you went into a dangerous area for the sake of the business [Music] [Music] [Music] the elder brother postponed his joy for the sake of his sibling do you think he was ever truly happy just making his little brother happy would have been enough that's what being an older brother is [Music] like [Music] [Music] uh it's [Music] [Music] i guess [Music] shane [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huh two [Music] [Music] [Music] sir [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tip [Music] huh [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] that's some pretty impressive stuff you found i'll start upgrading your weapon right away and since you did me a favor i won't even charge you for it [Music] well actually this is gonna take a little more time than i thought no sense in you waiting around i'll send you a letter once it's ready that would be great [Music] no sense in you wait that would be by the way what can i help you with [Music] come [Music] this appears we have some free time on our hands maybe purple has found some information about the shadow lord let's drop by the village very well [Music] help help oh gods please help me what's wrong there's this huge shade near the bridge in the northern place the damn thing nearly killed my wife and daughter i'm on it it appears and disappears like the wind you could go days in the northern plains without seeing it and then all of a sudden [Music] [Music] oh man i'm in a heap of trouble now what's the problem well i was distracted while i was cooking and sort of started a fire now i have to repair the kitchen and all my equipment i can't make the repairs without a bunch of parts but the only place you can find that much scrap is in the junky yeah that's bad news all right you want me to go for you you sure you'll have to bring all the more reason to entrust the task to us this won't be our first time in the junk heap just let us know what you need thanks i really appreciate this i need one memory alloy 10 titanium alloys and 10 broken motors got all that wow that's a lot but okay we'll be back in a while i need [Music] [Music] our water supplies become contaminated still no fish you're scaring them away oh i i see i think this is one of the pieces of cargo that washed ashore no offense to that lady but i'm not carrying around some box unless i know what's inside have you assuaged your guilds with that feeble excuse then i suggest we hello what have we here i've never seen flowers like this they smell weird i believe they can be refined into a powerful yet poisonous drug i doubt very much that they are legal it is filled with strange potions and documents what on earth was that old woman transporting [Music] everything all right man no my son has come down with a strange illness he's been ill for a week and no matter what i do it just seems to get worse that's not good any idea what's causing it no he went out to play with the other children like he usually does and when he came home he was sick something must have happened to him out there i'll see what i can figure out you will of course meddlesome as always i see shall we begin by questioning the children sounds like a plan to me i suppose all children are precious to their own parents yeah but if the cause of the illness is a mystery then we have little way to search for a cure well you're smart come up with something perhaps we should speak with the local children why would kids know when the adults don't even the oldest adult in the world is but a child to my eyes [Music] oh you want a different job which job should i give you first come back [Music] oh you yeah [Music] i heard there's a scary curse on all the forests in the world and the bigger the forest the scarier the curse [Music] some kids like to play in the northern forest we're not supposed to know but everybody does man i wish i could go there [Music] things have been so hard since [Music] i knew it this is what i was talking [Music] about [Music] learned anything new about the shadow lord's key popola you know i was just going to talk to you about that you remember the arie right that depressing shell of a village not so much anymore it sounds like i just got this letter from the village chief have a look sacrifice isn't that the name of one of the key fragments that's right i've been trading notes with leaders from every town in the land you're amazing popular this entire affair strikes me as a bit too convenient i'm afraid grimoire vice is correct what do you mean the area has been shut off from the world for years and now they've not only opened trade routes but they freely exchange information about the shadow lord i agree it seems rather unnatural and dangerous you're overthinking it besides i don't care if it's dangerous i won't get jonah back by just sitting around and waiting there are shades there i'll just kill him and be done with it well if that's the way you feel i guess i won't stop you try speaking with the chief when you get [Music] there the eerie huh all right let's go see the chief what a soul-crushing place [Music] i cannot fathom that village setting up a mercantile they must have truly opened their minds yeah i have my doubts aren't you glad to be going back home kaine home that place is a [ __ ] don't be so nervous connie will protect you i got me taken care of worry about protecting yourself [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] two [Music] dude [Music] uh hello we're here from hopeless village it's all over we came to ask about the letter you sent our days are numbered is doomed as cheerful as ever it seems you're the one who wrote the letter right i i don't know about any letter what the hell is going on here it may be faster for us to take our inquiries let us ask around someone must know [Music] something [Music] so [Music] a letter huh yeah i think i heard something about that so you know about the letter um maybe i don't i'm not sure ah which is it man oh and if i may ask are you friends of kaine you could say that ah i've heard the rumors here to hunt shades are you indeed our aim is to defeat every last one every every last one everyone everyone everyone everyone vice beware this man is a shade dammit it's a trap i figured as much [Music] you've been possessed somehow keep your guard up others are surely lurking nearby you guys sure are taking your goddamn time we were distracted by the local welcoming party want some help the villagers are possessed but not all of them some are still human so be careful okay [Music] get them [Music] i can't take this anymore [Music] [Music] i blame you for all of this help me get out of here [Music] no way i'm not going to abandon my own sister connie what's going on don't be fooled by this lady she's a shade no no you people are the monsters here stay back kid your sister is one of them now i don't care what she is she's my sister and i love her [Music] uh stop it don't

this beast a shade as well that thing sucked up the villagers no if we keep this up we're gonna kill them all we can't let that happen [Applause] [Music] i feel something from within the creature it will take more than a barrage of magic to stop us the first to waiver is the best to die i sense magic coming from the center of that eye wait i think those are actual people hold nothing back those are shades the surrounding tentacles appear to deflect magic such speed [Music] [Music] now focus your magic on the beast's center what [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] look out something's coming this weak point is located around the back try attacking it from about i'll try to pin it down samia [Music] you should be able to attack from behind go around and get it please hurry emil can handle this we must circle behind the creature at once [Music] [Music] you must strike it in the eye [Music] are you there yet right [Music] won't help anyone if we lose you here [Music] damn it you beat the hell out of that thing how can it still move it's combined powers are beyond even my greatest suspicion [Music] me thank [Music] so come on help me take it out i'm on it
