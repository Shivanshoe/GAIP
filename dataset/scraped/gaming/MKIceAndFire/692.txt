sorry about that no need to be i know what's going on and i know it won't be easy for either of you if you don't want to decide here i know a much better place sure lead the way why is this spot special i took jackie there once it's not far jackie what's he got to do with any of this you'll see come on he had the same glum face oh jack this is it chica i'm done for doesn't sound like the jackie i knew that was a long time ago his mom had just found out he'd signed up with the valentinos trust me it's in euro wells on one shoulder your gang choombas on the other no choice can ever seem right life wasn't easy for my jacket ah that's more like it air he found the courage to bet on himself after i brought him here see that i come here when i need to get away be alone with my thoughts she's on to something ought to sit mull through some [ __ ] yourself thanks misty you were right joyce spot so what what did jackie decide of here oh you know i'm gonna be a legend in this city and i'm gonna leave you alone now take your time [ __ ] scared me know that thought you were on your way out no still here for now you know should call anyone you want to say goodbye to worst case scenario that would you expect no but whatever you decide risk's gonna be high if things don't go our way just [ __ ] do it anyone you gotta talk to now's the time pills can wait no not really my style goodbyes you do you come a long way to get here heavenly just think it all started in a [ __ ] landfill then you tried to kill me see exactly what i mean trying to save your sorry hide now you can let me do that or you can try pan am in her tarmac rats but then their lives will lay heavy on your soul or you take arasaka's deal but then you'll have your own soul on your conscience i think it's worth taking a chance in arisaka the [ __ ] was that god how are you so [ __ ] stubborn inherited your finer traits you absolutely sure no going back on this you know [Music] yeah just don't freak out honestly couldn't give a nat [ __ ] got a feeling you're gonna regret this decision and the moment that dawns i won't be there to help could be my last ride this if it don't work out huh just want to be there for it where see you inside mikoshi johnny okay just me now at last your offer i accept you took your time in the interim yorinobu has made his move what do you mean my brother has made me his guest at his residence in norse oak locked you in yes his people watch over me for my safety think your nobu knows many things might have raised his suspicions i do not see any other reason for him to hold me here [Music] yeah well i'll get you out can be pretty persuasive i thank you where are you at victor's my ripper doc back behind a small shop called misty's esoterica i will send someone for you they will drive you to the residence we shall visit my brother together at the arasaka tower is that you v or like vick said taking matters into my own hands so what now waiting for my driver come inside we'll wait together since you have to wait mind if i give you a reading you know probably not a good idea whatever you prefer perhaps it's best i'll just put on some music i think that's for you wait is that an arasaka stretch that's right but fee they killed jackie and and now you're working for them think i don't remember don't like it any more than you do but all the other options were worse betraying a friend you can't justify that got no right to judge me you've changed for the worse it's good to meet again you look like [ __ ] [Music] compared to you i little [ __ ] you're good i am packing graces as you say no more hiding in filth no more second rate food we should go wait a minute when we last saw one another we spoke of a construct in your head that could influence your decision-making the same construct that in its former life detonated two nuclear warheads inside arasaka tower and now you and this construct have volunteered to sort out things in arasaka what is this about has no one told you shame the engram inside is johnny [ __ ] silverhand recognize the name the terrorist yes but he's suppressed now with beta blockers but before i did that he warned me against working with arisaka so took your suspicions where the sun don't shine before i start regretting not taking his advice that is enough for me let us go to the car anagosama is waiting he may be satisfied i will be watching you we're almost there why has she not called hannah they may have cut communication at the residence something has gone wrong wrong reckless driving will not improve the stress i'm not your bloody sofa i didn't agree to this none of us did matter of fact you are awake don't remember conking out eyes open now we'll arrive shortly weapons are dead already are you mad we must act natural just everyone be still and calm and this will all go smoothly is everything in order no one is allowed onto the estate jesus christ efficient effective good work blast it all what now they won't let us anywhere near her we are not here to ask anyone's permission hellman go and bring the av here things will get very messy soon b you will come with me [Music] i am in the bedroom in the central part of the building us you get the av but first we must neutralize the four cards the camera v is your task clear uh-huh we neutralize i will obstruct their communications so that no support arrives we will take the left side through the garden i see someone so we must be aware of the mech careful now there are five more guards outside and a dweller in the garage on the left kids suspicious activity commencing search you must neutralize them all of them i will reach you shortly go go [Music] [Music] uh i require backup not bad i will go left the right side is yours where are my damn reinforcements uh i believe yes that is the last of your loves people i await you huh i'm nearing the residence good land by the pool these people they simply left me no choice this is why i have remained outside uninvolved so as not to have to make decisions such as these yet now i believe a war has just begun wars a bit much isn't it a loaded word for any arasaka is that what you believe just counting bodies you me goro and hellman makes four actually three and a half there is oda too we will meet him there pretty quick to get back on his feet he was provided with excellent care anyway against all arasaka and its armies that's not much my brother is not all of arasaka not yet at least he knows this well it is the reason he surrounds himself with criminals like adam smasher that's supposed to make me feel better reality is we're on our own my father was on his own and he built an empire foreign please is [Music] is it not too early for champagne but if it helps you calm down does anyone else have trembling hands why not might help clear my head ah weird it's flavorless what is strange is that this has only happened now meaning what your central nervous system it's a shambles you will lose your hearing next then your sight and irreversible is your nervous system assembles too he asked you a question and i have no answer for him not here not without proper equipment [Music] not thirsty anymore [Applause] [Music] once your innova has been dealt with we shall attend to your needs [Music] [Music] [Music] did you prepare everything quite oh [ __ ] [Music] slowly thanks you can do it we are almost there every loyal soldier must stand ready we shall await your signal v you must come with me this way probably won't get another chance to do what to fill me in on your plan what if i have none don't play dumb with me hanako you and takemura had a plan the day of the parade moments later you had nothing your plan was in tatters and yet we are here now do you know why because sometimes you have to look the truth in the eye back then that is what i did thanks to you you have a a very honest look that's how we're swinging the arasaka board you want me to stare at them weapon at the ready my charms don't work we go for more tried and tested methods i see what you're getting at you have yet to see as judeo where are we actually going this is one of arasaka's most closely guarded secrets hang on is this father's office a faithful replica of the original in tokyo he ordered one made in every arasaka branch on the planet every last detail every item arranged as if he could navigate it blind that is the way he is meticulous fastidious was i beg your pardon meant to say was symbols are more resilient than you think the question is if the faction leaders remain loyal to arasaka varus and if they will find the courage to admit their mistake is that happening or higher than you may think [Music] come we're going down i told you mikoshi can be accessed only from a room beneath arasaka tower before we interrupt this board meeting we must do one more thing huh keep getting this weird feeling you're not telling me the whole truth because i am not telling you the whole truth i am cautious thought you said we trusted each other there is trust between us now that is why you are here so earlier soon after you abducted me i sought his counsel oh who's fathers his office is not the only replica he created what [ __ ] me dizzy could have given me a heads up no i could not have why you are being disrespectful [Music] got that right you bastard silverhand sends his regards it is done we may go let's get out of here i johnny [ __ ] no no not now it won't be much longer v will you stay with us don't have a [ __ ] choice now do i please come i'll be calm when all this is over you got a good memory for faces oda v is with us of course is it just these the restoring position ready to do as instructed these are the most effective by much and lawyer to me or to my money i would say it's 20 to 80 hannah very well it will have to do now come you in on this saburo's comeback just spoke to his construct what he digitized his engram made copies in case he died no he would have told me why so you take your job as his bodyguard lightly how do you feel that goro night city just gave you another kick in the nuts running start this time if we cannot convince them we could lose control of the situation then what need me to neutralize them too keep your weapon at hand and do not utter a word until i ask you to no matter what happens you must trust me just one with 12 000 inhabitants [Applause] we could relocate them you know so there are other islands around it sounds very cool i am

but the changes the chip made were too great even for the corporate neurosurgeons this is [ __ ] our soccer they should figure something out you must accept the truth then listen to what i say there are options dead in a few months as me huh you will feel bad at first but then the illness will grow fierce attack in full force your final weeks you will spend in bed [ __ ] please feel no anger i wish to speak about an alternative said our saga would fix me if i helped you you promised i believe truly they could said you had powerful friends where are those friends now i did not come with empty hands we must speak about your options hanukkah arisaka promised to save my life it is the reason she sent me here to discuss the alternative are you talking about trusted you all once already you let me down you may join the secure your soul program hanako arasaka has agreed to it you will leave your body arasaka will store your ingram in mikoshi until away is found to transpire to a new body store can i get a new body right off with technology as it is now this is impossible seemed pretty damn possible for super our soccer he returned in his son's body tissue compatibility made things easier yet your phenotype thanks to the chip it's unique arasaka cannot provide a suitable body at this time sorry not buying it our sock is out to lock me up you overstate your importance to the arasakas i fear you are nobody or nobody with this offer hanako arasaka rewards you generously for your service there's not as you say more to the story nope doesn't sound good at all to me i agree to this and they'll do whatever they want with me there will be a contract to protect you sign it and you will live it is written here that you relinquish all rights but do not worry the law is simply behind the times and ingram is not legally a person so i get to be corporate property first like many brain dance stars and politicians from what i know the program is a success there have been no complaints and if i say no this is not a prison you will take your things and return to night city why you i would decide but the choice is yours think it through carefully made my decision going
