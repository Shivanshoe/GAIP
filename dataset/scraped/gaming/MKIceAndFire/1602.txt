[Music] CEL has reached untouchable levels of power nothing can stop him now hey everyone but t10 trucks are coming out to the hyperbolic time chamber [Music] really hey everyone sorry for the wait my father broke through the Super Saiyan barrier in about two months but he still wouldn't drunks that's enough now sounds like you did it for Tita you could say that you can go in next if you want to but it would only be a waste of your time I'm more than enough to clean up this mess cell and the androids don't stand a chance well I went down and fought sell myself he's super strong now a real monster there you are Krillin said you'd all be here huh wait what's going on here trunks is that you yes what's with your hair are you wearing a wig or something there's there's this room here where one year passes inside while just one day passes out here father and I were training in there Oh what the hell are you doing here boma here the Jada's battle suit has great defensive properties so I made some for everyone whoa this stuff's a lot lighter than it looks did you not hear me Kakarot your services aren't required because you're gonna beat sell right I heard you that's fine by me all right go on time for some quality father-son training right [Music] be warned training in the chambers no cakewalk Gohan [Music] I'm ready you training to surpass Super Saiyan Wow it's nothing but white space my body feels heavy it's so hard I could barely breathe that's not all this place is as big as the earth itself so we're gonna spend a year in here let's get right into it after all it's not like we're here on vacation first things first we're gonna make you a Super Saiyan me a Super Saiyan I don't know if I have what it takes of course you do don't forget that you got saying blood running through your whole body all that said any real type of training we need to do isn't gonna happen until you're a Super Saiyan aren't I just gonna waste your time and and get in your way well yeah at first but don't get me wrong I'm planning on going completely beyond Super Saiyan when the time is right I've got plans for you two I want you to get even stronger than that I know you can do it what me stronger than you yep if anyone can do that it's you Hannah I I hope I can relax it's gonna take some time so no rush we'll take it nice and slow at first now that's enough talking let's get warmed up [Music] [Music] still got more in you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you're definitely getting the hang of things [Music] [Music] go on I'm only just started [Music] [Music] let's stop there for now Gohan it's really hard to fight in a place like this it is but your techniques and movements are pretty great I'm betting you've got piccolo to think for all that yes that means we can move straight on to Super Saiyan training what do you say yeah no no all you're doing is raising your energy that's not enough you need to get angry to become a super sink getting let out all your rage I'm trying I can't get angry though it's not gonna come to you right away and that's okay me and Vegeta had to go through a lot before we got it there's no need to rush Gohan right you [Music] alright I'm coming - very well you [Music] spectacular the others waste their time this wood might provide a challenge music time when we find seven keep your hands off he's mine [Music] hmm I don't see 18 anywhere she's gotta be hiding somewhere on one of these islands very well lesson operating you better make your presence known if you don't I'm going to start destroying these islands water time until I find you so she won't come out she's not that he was easy you PR Fujita so your sale for Jada then what is it that you think you're doing here don't tell me you think you can start me I didn't come here to stop you I came here to tear you limb from limb tear me limb from limb you that's hilarious but I'm getting so tired of hearing you talk take a good long look cell I'm going to beat that stupid grin right off that annoying face of yours [Applause] [Music] [Music] sleep on me are you [Music] okay so you could fight a little thank God [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] we'll gosh looks like I'm a little too much for you to handle now aren't I how is this happening your Fujita rice vegeta raw oh that power level is huge amazing so that's the new and improved Vegeta huh so is trunks that's strong - I don't see Goku or Gohan anywhere it's the Android they were here the whole time cell Vegeta trunks they don't know they're here do they yeah I've got to be within 10 yards of them for the remote control to work here goes nothing you've used up all your power and still you couldn't muster the strength to fight me very disappointing oh this can't be happening if I could only gain the energy I need to fight you with my perfect body what's that you actually think getting that perfect body of yours will be enough to defeat me of course I wouldn't lose to the likes of you [Music] okay now I should be within 10 yards of them I gotta make sure I shut a team down then destroy her otherwise cells going to absorb her this is my only shot better make it count [Music] see ya [Music] ha you that's an emergency shutdown remote control why does he have that sorry yeah go on get out of here while you still can but boys sell and live your life why did you why did you destroy that that was your only chance it's if I could achieve my perfect form power speed technique intelligence I would be perfect in every way the computer told me as much is this true could achieving this perfect form of yours actually close the gap between us how many times are you gonna make me repeat myself you you would have no hope of defeating me at least not as you are right now hmm father don't tell me you're you saying say you're warriors through and through I would think you'd want at least test your mettle against my perfect form fine I'll fall for your little ruse go ahead and get this perfect form you've been babbling on about go on father my father may be willing to let you go but I'm not okay for Tschida do something about this dire Ward job stay tuned so she was Harding there the whole time [Music] your heart hey sell those where you are no you're not going anywhere don't even think about it Trump's [Music] you I'm so close to perfection I can taste it [Music] father what you're doing is wrong we can't let him absorb 18 where's your sense of pride don't you want to see how much stronger he can get no I've seen enough bloodshed and destruction in my future [Music] [Applause] No perfection of this they better not disappoint that's for sure [Music] [Music] so there it is [Music] CEL had finally absorbed android 18 and achieved his perfect form in a fit of rage Krillin launched himself itself but was effortlessly sidelined by cells newfound strength Krillin having been brought back from the brink of death thanks to a Senzu bean from trunks was overwhelmed by the power of cells perfect form vegeta excited by the prospect of fighting a more worthy opponent taunted cell into continuing their fight cell calmly accepted Vegeta's challenge and prepared to engage him in battle once more achieving perfection [Music] would you care to take part in a little warmup sure a warm-up II won't survive we'll see about that doesn't seem like it was worth [Music] yourself [Music] prepare yourself you've got heart you do know well then let's fight [Music] let's try this next quit thank God prepare yourself prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] well now look at this hmm that's so odd it appears this gap between the two mentioned is moving in the opposite direction now why would that be oh whatever I think it's about time to kill you what are you doing trunks if you don't get in there Vegeta is gonna die my father would rather be defeated by cell than have me Goku or anyone help him he's that proud of a warrior hey I get that but still if my father loses consciousness while fighting cell I'll step in impressive it looks like you're still holding on to what little life you got to left allow me to put you out of your misery for Cheeta drinks I'm gonna kill you sell quite a gutsy thing to say trunks Krillin take my father and get him out of here right you got it [Music] trunks power level it's taken a massive dive cells power level is through the roof to the over power trunks that good Vegeta come on Vegeta wake up that I'm rather disappointed in you and Vegeta I expected more from you too they don't tell me this has been a waste of my time now just one last question it's interesting although it ultimately proved meaningless you were able to greatly increase your power in a very short period of time if you had more time would you be able to power our be even further it's hard to say without actually trying why would you ask me something like that next question why hasn't Goku shown his face yet I mean what could he possibly be doing it's more important than this Goku is training to take you down no matter what you do he'll be ready to fight you tomorrow if you're looking for a real challenge and it sounds like you are Goku won't disappoint let's trust me then maybe I'll hold a little tournament a tournament let's make it 10 days from now say 12 o'clock that should give you time to better your skills if that's possible no what are you talking about I don't know if you're aware of this or not but there used to be a martial arts tournament known as the world's tournament I think it's high time we brought that back one small change in this tournament I'll be the only opponent I'll fight you one victim at a time and if I win the next Challenger enters the arena and fights me and then the next and the next until I'm the last one standing I'll spread the word of the tournament its rules in its location soon perhaps we can even have the whole thing televised what fun wait cell what's the point of holding a tournament what's your end goal the tournament will showcase my strength and true greatness and blending the world into terror will be a nice little bonus as well and my end game is I tell me maybe to have a little fun toying with you half-wits destroying tormenting lording over you but my real passion of course is to see the look on people's faces as they cower and realize that all hope is lost I can't wait to see what you can do [Music] after reviving Vegeta and Quillin with some Senzu beans trunks told them about the tournament cell was planning to hold a tournament he's just toying with us damn him hi I plan on entering the hyperbolic time chamber again once goku and gohan are out you and Kakarot will only get in the way I will be the one to enter that room and finish this all right I too will enter the tournament please take me to the capsule corporation and have me repaired I will prove useful are you crazy you're one of doctors heroes Androids okay I'll take you truth be told we could use as many allies as we can get really relaxed trunks I have a feeling this guy's not so bad after all I mean the two other androids sell absorb didn't seem that bad either you said it yourself these androids and history itself are different from what you know you you [Music] [Music] go on you've gotten so much stronger than I thought you would it's pretty impressive I hope so it's hard to tell though but I gotta say you haven't come close to reaching your full potential yet got a lot more in you I just know it really what do you say I think it's time to finish up our training finish it yep come at me with everything you've got don't hold back try your bra I can't do that but I'll do what I can [Music] [Music] yeah you need to get angry well on your way to surpassing me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Gohan that was incredible don't ever forget what that felt like right dad we're probably gonna need more time before we go beyond Super Saiyan I mean come on I just learned how to become one so I have no clue what I would even do to go further than that I think I just might know what to do about that huh we just need to get our bodies used to staying in the Super Saiyan form what do you say I think the two of us can manage that Gohan staying in the Super Saiyan form yep we treat Super Saiyan as our normal state of being do you understand anytime we're awake and moving around that's the form we'll be in first we'll learn to control the more emotional aspects of the transformation that makes the most sense right then once we do that we'll start our training up again from the basics this could work out I know it's not exactly straightforward but I really think this is our best shot at going beyond Super Saiyan okay after informing trunks of the tournament cell constructed an arena in a nearby deserted area he then forced his way into a TV station and via live broadcast delivered his terrifying message to the entire world his tournament known as the Cell Games would be open to all and begin in just nine days cell then declared that if all participants were to fail he would eliminate all known life on the planet in order to prove that he meant business about his threat he easily reduced a section of the city to rubble cells ultimatum proved effective in its purpose as the world had become utterly gripped in fear recent peace had weakened army and police forces now powerless to confront the new enemy people had already seemed to have forgotten about the young boy who had stopped the evil demon king piccolo they were also unaware of Vegeta the Saiyans and the others that fought Frieza on Nemec Goku was no more than a long-forgotten memory [Music] damn that cell this is just a game to him no way I can't believe he actually went on television and told everyone if none of us can beat him he's going to kill everyone on earth and now the whole world is panicking I hope Goku and Gohan are almost done with their training there are still three hours left before the full day is up no guarantee they'll come out after exactly one day no need to rush we've got nine days until the games goku and gohan Zenergy are they out already what what are they what are they doing out this early what Vegeta and trunks you guys are here to sell must still be alive what happened I can still sense his energy let's go home it looks so different what they're they feel Super Saiyan wait something is different they seem calm someone get us up to speed on what's going on right here's what happened the Cell Games huh so he's holding a tournament honestly that sounds kind of fun mr. po po you still got my uniform oh yes I have it right here mr. piccolo I'd like some new clothes too like yours sure thing you're gonna look real good in this yay thanks mr. piccolo so tell me think you have what it takes to beat sell it's not sure I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him in this perfect form of his yet actually I'll go do that now hmm there we go [Music] [Music] oh it's Goku yep in the flesh so what do you think Goku are you willing to let the fate of your world be decided in this ring kind of small for something like that wouldn't you say so that's your perfect form yes yes indeed you can count on me being here for the tournament but until then don't go killing anybody now one person got it we're gonna have a great match man he's gotten way stronger than I thought he would so Goku what do you think I'll be completely honest I didn't think he'd power up as much as he did okay so I will no wait then just go back into the hyperbolic time chamber we've got the time now me and Gohan I'll train outside we got nine days we'll figure something out within that time but why you still haven't used up a full day why in the world would you waste one of the two days of your life you're allowed inside that chamber because that place can really put your body through the wringer if you know what I mean well well look at that even the mighty Kakarot wasn't nearly tough enough to handle the room fine you might be right about that but training there anymore wouldn't do us any good but don't let me stop you if you guys want to head back inside go right on ahead besides it looks like you could use some more training what you have some nerve you don't actually think you're stronger than me now do you don't make me laugh yeah a lot stronger actually what alright keep bad at you guys see you all at the tournament okay Gohan let's go oh right [Music] only nine days remained until the Cell Games tournament [Music] goku and gohan returned home for some well-earned rest after their intense training here's the plan we'll rest for three days train for three days and then rest another three how does all that sound dad are you sure that's okay you think we can beat cell trust me we'll be fine Goku I need you to come back to the house huh yep there's Goku your finished training right then let's go somewhere as a family well I'm not completely finished but okay sure good it's settled now that Goku finally has his license we can borrow a large car from my father and take a relaxing drive to the lake as a family okey-dokey anything we should bring I'll put some lunch together for us can I count on you for some meat and fish meat and fish I can remember that how much I will need exactly bring all that back and I'll whip up a feast [Music] I need to hurry gather ingredients [Music] [Music] all right [Music] [Music] it ought to be enough me great this should be everything time to head back to chichi you this should be every time to head back to teaching all right happy hunting chichi will this do for the ingredients backhoe ready that's my husband for you he can't wait to dig in I'll fix us something nice so hold your horses finished oh wow it smells delicious I tried broadening my culinary horizons for the occasion set your expectations high boys man I can't wait you'll have to no eating until we reach the picnic spots then let's get going all right it's been ages since we've gone out together this will be fun I'd do anything for some tasty grub but I've never been big on this driving business why don't we just take the Nimbus way easier because then it wouldn't be a family drive now what it plus a trip by car has a little something called ambience um is that it that's what I'm talking about hey Goku remember the first day we met when we rode on your flying Nimbus of course I do we went to see Master Roshi to borrow the Banco fan yep that's right when I was riding behind you I already knew that we had to get married huh ah such beautiful memories since the day we were first engaged up until our reunion at the world tournament all I could think about was meeting you again mom seems happy to be spending time with dad when that heart disease hit him she was really worried I know I should excuse myself they probably enjoy a bit of time alone together sorry I just remembered some stuff I have to do mine going on ahead without me I'll catch up as soon as I can huh but Gohan we've been planning this vert don't worry I know this but Plus well I can fly there faster than you can drive you to enjoy the ride if you say so shall we go ku it'll be just the two of us sounds good see you later Gohan what should I do now hey someone's calling I wonder who it could be hello this is going oh hey go on it's me Bulma can you put your dad on the line oh you want dad sorry him and mom just left he did Oh rats but I just missed him is something the matter you see we're at my place fixing up the Android the Crillon brought back he needs a replacement chip in his head but we don't have the materials to make it I did some research and it looks like the metals we need can only be found in your neck of the woods I was hoping your dad would be able to help out in that department oh is that all I'd be happy to help I'm free anyway okay got it I'll have uh you're a lifesaver Gohan this isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I think I can take this guy [Music] [Music] this must be you a boma was talking about [Music] [Music] [Music] none left [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] closer to my dad there's a lot of energy in this thing I think I can take this guy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] better hit the books when I get back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you now let's take this back to capsule core [Music] hi boma is this everything looks like it great work Gohan I really appreciate it all that's left is to build the tip Hey look are you really go on I am honest uh it's a long story oh but I mean look at you ah well you are your father's son and sans are weird so I guess this isn't out of the question no you supplying logic to you guys anyway she's being surprisingly calm about all this I guess living with Vegeta is kind of under thanks for being my delivery boy you're the best uh you're welcome and sorry I surprised you by the way now that you're here do you want to watch me fix the Android up I'm pretty sure he's safe but you know you can't be too careful so do you mind staying for a bit oh uh uh no problem you so this is an Android these things were built to kill dad there we go it's done mm-hmm almost the chip you helped us build was successfully integrated it may be tiny but it's what gives the Android life now we stick it in the cranial chamber here and analyzing situation he's online hey you got a name um Android 16 scanning memory logs I was brought here by Crillon for repairs his memory circuits are functional oh good he's back you did it guys are you the ones who repaired me I am grateful no need to mention it if you want to thank someone thank Gohan here after all he helped us fix you go on hello searching data profile found go on son of Goku hey now mister just cuz he's Goku son doesn't mean you have to terminate him he is irrelevant my target is Goku not his offspring that's so okay I guess I can live with that hmm staring doctor yes I wish to run a field test in the nearby forest to gauge this body's functionality hmm well I don't see a problem with that come with me Gohan your assistance may be required really I'm sorry kid but humor him he should be alright but we just restarted his systems and you never know what could happen sure thing I will go on ahead find me in the forest counting on your junior right [Music] you [Music] so how's that body of yours hmm satisfactory diagnostics indicate 100% functionality glad to hear that oh [Music] so do you like animals affirmative they put me at ease I like animals too Oh sorts of things interests me actually I'm hoping to be a scholar someday it's a fine goal I am certain you will make an exemplary scholar by the way are you really out to kill my dad affirmative that is my only directive I have no other use as a result I was declared defective and stored away [Music] huh I loathe conflict therefore as a weapon I am defective that's no reason to shut you down doctor zero once said he made me in the image of his deceased son but he was bold and daring I am NOT a war machine that shuns war is nothing but a failure don't say that it's the truth so this is where all them cuddly critters behind who are you people they're just folks looking to make a gosh good fortune up a pelts what looks like we hit the jackpot can't believe we'd fight all these birds in once blood they're poachers go on way ahead of you let's send these jerks packing [Music] [Music] [Music] you folks crazier than a dog in hubcap Factory threat neutralized yeah go on I am grateful for your assistance and protecting the animals as well as for assisting with my repairs my apologies for not thanking you sooner oh it's no big deal hmm the real reason I asked you to accompany me is a discrepancy between my data and your current appearance I intended to personally reevaluate your potential in combat but thanks to the altercation with the poachers there is no longer such a need your power is immense that far surpasses all your records in my system I foresee you becoming the deciding factor in the outcome of the Cell Games my dad's way stronger we are not so different you and I we art let us return for now the doctor will be worried if we take too long right but our 16 and I alike how'd it go exceptional I am fully operational thanks to you nice job out there boys I heard you rounded up some poachers that you socked him something fierce huh what morons going up against the son of Goku and a giant Android it was nothing really I know why don't you stay for dinner it's the least I can do to repay you for your help today honestly I haven't done anything oh don't be silly make yourself at home and spend the night while you're at it I'll bone your mother for you okay okay sure you Oh [Music] so go on Zeb Alma's I was wondering where he'd run off to yeah she just called and said he's staying the night to her family's loaded go hunts probably having the Feast of his life right now aren't you jealous Goku well sure I love myself some good grub but nothing beats your home-cooked meals and if we're being honest I choose them over any spread in the world really Thanks even if it's just flattery ah oh I'm getting so embarrassed shortly after Gohan had returned home we've just received breaking news after having been dispatched to defeat the monster known as cell the Royal Guard has been utterly decimated due to one of cell's attacks I repeat how terrible those were innocent people that monster chichi I need to talk to piccolo about something I'll be right back Goku and he's gone what does he need to talk to piccolo about I'm not sure yo Goku what is it you don't think you'd be able to go back to how you used to be before merging with commie do you what well merging with commie made the dragonballs disappear right and I want to use the Dragon Balls to wish all the people back who were killed by cell sorry but it's not like flipping a switch we're stuck together forever exactly why I needed to think so long and hard about it before coming to a decision wow that must have been a tough call hmm I know maybe I could ask one of the namekian survivors to come to earth if he agrees to stay here we have a new guardian and you know what that means the Dragon Balls had come back baby that's a wonderful idea wait here fingers crossed with King Kai's assistance goku managed to zero in on the namekian survivors new homeworld upon arriving via instant transmission goku was given a hero's welcome by the planets residents goku explained earth's predicament and asked the new grand elder mori if he knew any candidates suited to becoming Earth's new guardian as luck would have it Lauri knew just a person for the job it was none other than Dendi piccolo it's been too long wait one sec I'll have gone and krillen here in a jiffy let's see what guys meet Earth's new Guardian is that really you today it's been ages okay can you believe blondie here is actually going on Krillin gone it's great to see you too ah are you really gonna be the new Guardian that's right I'm really glad our paths could cross again dandy is it true that you can restore the Dragon Balls yes I can making a new set would take about a hundred days but if we use the inert set already on earth I should be able to have them working in no time really that's perfect we would then get three wishes right same as on Namek yes so would we be able to wish back multiple people like last time I suppose that could be possible I mean I'd have to make the proper adjustments but if you did that it would count as two wishes oh is that all fine by me let's do it alright I'll be getting right away the Dragon Ball should be restored now wait what already incredible looks like this little guy has some serious power alright I'll round up all the Dragon Balls then Gohan consider your training complete kick back with den day until the sell game start huh but hey don't worry it'll be fine later [Music] well time to get looking [Music] it's the to start Dragonball here's the five star Dragonball [Music] this one's got loads of stars [Music] [Music] you
