out for himself he proved himself during the blitz held off enemy forces on the ground until reinforcements arrived he's the only reason the lithium is still standing we can't question his courage humanity needs a hero and shepard's the best we've got i'll make the call [Music] [Music] the arcturus prime relays in range initiating transmission sequence commander [Music] the relay is hot acquiring approach vector [Music] all stations secure for transit the board is green approach run has [Music] begun hitting the relay in three two one [Music] thrusters check navigation check internal emissions sync engaged all systems online drift just under 1500k 1500 is good your captain will be pleased [Music] i hate that guy nilas gave you a compliment so you hate him you remember to zip up your jumpsuit on the way out of the bathroom that's good i just jumped us halfway across the galaxy and hit a target the size of a pinhead so that's incredible besides spectres are trouble i don't like having them on board call me paranoid you're paranoid the council helped fund this project they have a right to send someone to keep an eye on their investment yeah that is the official story but only an idiot believes the official story [Music] you always expect the worst well bad feelings are an occupational hazard we don't go anywhere unless there's a good reason so what are we doing here joker status report just cleared the mass relay captain stealth system is engaged everything looks solid good find a calm buoy and link us into the network i want mission reports relayed back to alliance brass before we reach even prime aye aye captain better brace yourself sir i think nihilus is headed your way he's already here lieutenant tell commander shepard to meet me in the calm room for a debriefing you get that commander [Music] i'm on my way is it me or does the captain always sound a little pissed off only when he's talking to you joker [Music] [Music] [Music] she [Music] with him relax presley you're gonna give yourself an ulcer i grew up on eden prime doc it's not the kind of place spectres visit there's something nihilus isn't telling us about this mission that's crazy the captain's in charge here he wouldn't take orders from a spectre not his choice doc inspectors don't answer to anyone they can do whatever they want kill anyone who gets in their way you watch too many spy vids jenkins what do you think commander we won't be staying on eden prime too long will we i'm itching for some real action i sincerely hope you're kidding corporal your real action usually ends with me patching up crew members in the infirmary only a fool goes looking for a fight corporal sorry commander but this waiting's killing me i've never been on a mission like this before not one with a specter on board do your job follow my orders and there won't be any problems easy for you to say you proved yourself in the blitz everybody knows what you can do this is my big chance i need to show the brass what i can do you're young corporal you have a long career ahead of you don't do something stupid to mess it up don't worry sir i'm not gonna screw this up the captain's waiting for me goodbye commander [Music] commander shepard i was hoping you get here first people give us a chance to talk what about i'm interested in this world we're going to eden prime i've heard it's quite beautiful they say it's a paradise yes a paradise serene tranquil safe eden prime has become something of a symbol for your people hasn't it proof that humanity can not only establish colonies across the galaxy but also protect them but how safe is it really if you've got something to say just say it your people are still newcomers shepard the galaxy can be a very dangerous place is the alliance truly ready for this i think it's about time we told the commander what's really going on this mission is far more than a simple shakedown run i figured there was something you weren't telling us we're making a covert pickup on eden prime that's why we needed the stealth systems operational i don't like being kept in the dark captain this comes down from the top commander information strictly on a need to know basis a research team on eden prime unearthed some kind of beacon during an excavation it was prothean i thought the protheans vanished 50 000 years ago their legacy still remains the mass relays the citadel our ship drives it's all based on prothean technology this is big shepherd the last time humanity made a discovery like this it jumped our technology forward 200 years but eden prime doesn't have the facilities to handle something like this we need to bring the beacon back to the citadel for proper study obviously this goes beyond mere human interests commander this discovery could affect every species in council space are we expecting trouble i'm always expecting trouble there's more shepherd niles isn't just here for the beacon he's also here to reevaluate you since when do we answer to the spectres you're smart enough to know how things work commander the alliance has been pushing for this for a long time humanity wants a larger role in shaping interstellar policy we want more say with the citadel council the specters represent the council's power and authority if they accept a human into their ranks it shows how far the alliance has come you held off an enemy assault during the blitz single-handed you showed not only courage but also incredible skill that's why i put your name forward as a candidate for the specters why would a turian want a human in the specters not all turians resent humanity some of us see the potential of your species we see what you have to offer to the rest of the galaxy and to the specters we are an elite group it's rare to find an individual with the skills we seek i don't care that you're human shepherd i only care that you can do the job i assume this is good for the alliance earth needs this shepherd we're counting on you i need to see your skills for myself commander eden prime will be the first of several missions together you'll be in charge of the ground team secure the beacon and get it onto the ship asap niles will accompany you to observe the mission what do you know about the protheans just what they taught us in school they were a technologically advanced species that ruled the galaxy 50 000 years ago then they vanished nobody really knows how or why though i've heard plenty of theories but everyone agrees galactic civilization wouldn't exist without them their citadel is the very heart of galactic society and without their mass relays interstellar travel would be impossible we all owe the protheans a great debt i'd like to know more about eden prime before we touch down it's a peaceful farming world but it represents something much bigger eden prime is one of our oldest and most successful colonies it proved we were ready to face the challenges of settling new worlds to forge a place for humanity beyond earth it symbolizes humanity's growth and evolution as a spacefaring species and after this it will be known as the world where humans made a discovery of galactic importance why is this beacon so important all advanced galactic civilization is based on prothean technology even yours if we hadn't discovered those prothean ruins buried on mars we'd still be stuck on earth that was just a small data cache who knows what we can learn from this beacon what if it's a weapons archive we can't let it fall into the wrong hands like who the attic and traverse isn't the most stable sector of citadel space there are plenty of raiders and criminal groups active in the region they might figure a prothean beacon is worth the risk of attacking an alliance ship plus eden prime is right on the border of the terminus systems the attic in traverse is under citadel protection if the terminus systems attack it's an act of war technically yes but some of the species in the terminus might be willing to start a war over this the last thing the council wants is to get dragged into a major conflict with the terminus systems we have to keep this low-key just give the word captain we should be getting close to eden captain we got a problem what's wrong joker transmission from eden prime sir you better see this bring it up on screen get down we are under attack taking heavy casualties and repeat heavy casualties we can't get evac they came out of nowhere we need everything cuts out after that no calm traffic at all just goes dead there's nothing reverse and hold it 38.5 status report 17 minutes out captain no other alliance ships in the area take us in joker fast and quiet this mission just got a lot more complicated a small strike team can move quickly without drawing attention it's our best chance to secure the beacon grab your gear and meet us in the cargo hold telelenko and jenkins to suit up commander you're going in engaging stealth systems somebody was doing some serious digging here captain your team's the muscle in this operation commander go in heavy and head straight for the dick site what about survivors captain helping survivors is a secondary objective the beacon's your top priority approaching drop point one niles you're coming with us i moved faster on my own niles got out ahead he'll feed you status reports throughout the mission otherwise i want radio silence i don't like putting my life in the hands of a korean sir niles is on our side he wants you in the spectrum and he wants that ready and able sir the mission's yours now shepard good luck we are approaching drop point two ship perimeter secure commander clear oh god what happened here [Music] [Music] sometimes marines die the rest of us just have to carry on we still have to find that beacon aye aye sir so i've got some burned-out buildings here shepard a lot of bodies i'm gonna check it out i'll try to catch up with you at the dig site [Music] so [Music] huh thanks for your help commander i didn't think i was going to make it gunnery chief ashley williams of the 212. you the one in charge here sir give me a status report williams oh man we were patrolling the perimeter when the attack hit we tried to get off a distress call but they cut off our communications i've been fighting for my life ever since any idea what kind of enemy we're facing i think they're geth the geth haven't been seen outside the veil in nearly 200 years why are they here now they must have come for the beacon the dig site is close just over that rise it might still be there you're coming with us williams we need that beacon aye aye sir it's time for payback move out the beacons at the far end of this trench [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] this is the dig site the beacon was right here it must have been moved by who our side of the gas hard to say maybe we'll know more after we check out the research camp you think anyone got out of here alive if they were lucky maybe hiding up in the camp it's just on the top of this ridge up the ramps change of plans shepard there's a small space board up ahead i want to check it out i'll wait for you [Music] there looks like they hit the camp hard it's a good place for an ambush keep your guard up oh god they're still alive what did the guests do to them so humans thank the maker hurry close the door before they come back what are you doing here i'm dr warren i was in charge of this excavation we hid in the shed during the attack they must have come for the beacon luckily it wasn't here it was moved to the spaceport earlier this morning manuel and i stayed behind to pack up the camp when the attack came the marines held them off long enough for us to hide they gave their lives to save us no one is saved the age of humanity has ended soon only ruining corpses will remain what else can you tell me about the attack it all happened so fast one second we were gathering up our equipment the next we were hiding in the shed while the guests swarmed over the camp agents of the destroyers bringers of darkness heralds of our extinction we could hear the battle outside gunfire screams i thought it would never end then everything went quiet we just sat there too afraid to move until you came along what's wrong with your assistant manuel has a brilliant mind but he's always been a bit unstable genius and madness are two sides of the same coin is it madness to see the future to see the destruction rushing towards us to understand there is no escape no hope no i am not mad i'm the only sane one left i gave him an extra dose of his meds after the attack say good night manuel you cannot silence the truth my voice must be heard oh my god what did you do that might have been a little extreme commander you can't just go around whacking people in the head just a little bump on the head let him sleep it off i suppose you're right by the time he wakes up the meds will have kicked in did you notice a turian in the area no i'm sorry we haven't left the shed since the attack can you tell me anything about the beacon it's some type of data module from a galaxy wide communications network remarkably well preserved it could be the greatest scientific discovery of our lifetime who knows what secrets are locked inside miraculous new technologies groundbreaking medical advances the possibilities are endless williams take us to the spaceport good luck commander it must take a few hours [Music] saren nice this isn't your mission sarin what are you doing here the council thought you could use some help on this one i wasn't expecting to find the gath here the situation's bad don't worry i've got it under control what is that off in the distance [Music] [Music] um did everybody stay calm out there we're coming out we're not armed is it safe are they gone we took care of them those things were crawling all around the shed they would have found us for sure we owe you our lives ah i still can't believe it when we saw that ship i thought it was all over it showed up right before the attack knew it was trouble the second i saw it so we made a break for the sheds tell me everything you remember about the attack the three of us were working the crops when that ship showed up we just saw it and ran i don't know what happened to the rest of the crew they were by the garage over near the spaceport right where that ship came down no way they survived you don't know that we survived if they made it to the garage they could have had a fighting chance do you know anything about the protein beacon they dug up we're just farmers we heard they found something out there but it never really mattered to us until now what else can you tell me about the ship you saw i was too busy running to get a clear look at it i think it landed over near the spaceport tell them about the noise cool that awful noise it was emitting some kind of signal as it descended sounded like the shriek of the damned only it was coming from inside your own head it was probably trying to block communications whatever it was it felt like it was tearing right through my skull almost made it impossible to think i have to go hey cole we're just a bunch of farmers these guys are soldiers maybe we should give them the stuff jeez blake you gotta learn when to shut up you have something to tell me cole some guys at the spaceport were running a small smuggling ring nothing major in exchange for a cut of the profits we let them store packages in our sheds what kind of packages i found a pistol figured it would come in handy if those things came back but you'll probably get more use out of it than we will we're risking our lives to save this colony you sure there's nothing else in here that could help us out yeah there's one more thing i was gonna sell it after this was over but you probably deserve it more than i do who's your contact at the spaceport call what's his name he's not a bad guy i don't want to get him in trouble besides i'm not a snitch he might have something to do with this whole attack cole we need his name it's important yeah okay you're right his name's powell works the docs at the spaceport if he's still alive i have to go good luck she commander it's nice something's moving over behind those crates wait don't don't shoot i'm one of you i'm human what are you doing sneaking around back there i'm sorry i was hiding from those creatures my name's powell i saw what happened to that turian the other one shot him you're saying nihilus was murdered by a turian the other one got here first he was waiting when your friend showed up he he called him saren i i think they knew each other your friends seemed to relax he let his guard down and saren killed him shot him right in the back i'm just lucky he didn't see me behind the crates we were told the prothean beacon was brought to the spaceport what happened to it it's over on the other platform probably where that guy's sarin was headed he hopped on the cargo train right after he killed your friend i knew that beacon was trouble everything's gone to hell since we found it first that damn mothership showed up in the attack they killed everyone everyone if i had been behind the crates i'd be dead too your call's contact here on the docks for the smuggling ring what no i mean what does it matter now so i'm a smuggler who cares my supervisor's dead the entire crew's dead doesn't matter now does it anything hidden nearby that we could use against the geth a shipment of grenades came through last week nobody notices if a few small pieces go missing from the military orders you greedy son of a we're out here trying to protect your sorry ass and all you can think about is how you can rip us off i never thought you'd actually need those grenades who'd want to attack eden prime with just a bunch of farmers how was i supposed to know just give me the grenades they're yours take them my smuggling days are over i swear a lot of marines died here pablo those grenades could have come in handy if i were you i'd think of some way to make it up to them yeah okay there is something else i was saving could be worth a fortune experimental technology top of the line take it i don't need it i didn't want anyone to get hurt really i'm sorry we need to find that beacon before it's too late take the cargo train that's where the other turian went i can't stay here i need to get away from all this um [Music] so [Music] so set the charges destroy the entire colony leave no evidence that we were here demolition charges the geth must have planted them hurry we need to find them all and shut them down so powering up [Music] so [Music] send me so [Music] [Music] [Music] shhh so [Music] normandy the beacon is secured immediately actual working prothean technology unbelievable it wasn't doing anything like that when they dug it up something must have activated it roger normandy standing by so [Music] no don't touch we identified the ship that touched down on eden prime the normandy a human alliance vessel it was under the command of captain anderson they managed to save the colony and the beacon one of the humans may have used it this human must be eliminated doctor doctor chakwas i think he's waking up you had us worried there shepard how are you feeling how did i end up here how long was i out about 15 hours something happened down there with the beacon i think it's my fault i must have triggered some kind of security field when i approached it you had to push me out of the way where's the beacon now what happened to it the beacon exploded a system overload maybe the blast knocked you cold the lieutenant and i carried you back here to the ship what's the damage doctor physically you're fine but i detected some unusual brain activity abnormal beta waves i also noticed an increase in your rapid eye movement signs typically associated with intense streaming i saw i'm not sure what i saw death destruction nothing's really clear hmm i better add this to my report it may oh captain anderson how's our exo holding up doctor well all the readings look normal i'd say the command is going to be fine glad to hear it shepard i need to speak with you in private aye aye captain i'll be in the mess if you need me sounds like that beacon hit you pretty hard commander are you sure you're okay chief williams isn't part of the normandy crew i figured we could use a soldier like her she's been reassigned to the normandy williams is a good soldier she deserves it lieutenant elenco agrees with you that's why i added her to our crew intel dropped the ball sir we had no idea what we were walking into down there that's why things went to hell the geth haven't been outside the veil in two centuries commander nobody could have predicted this i don't like soldiers dying under my command jenkins wasn't your fault you did a good job shepard you said you needed to see me in private captain i won't lie to you shepard things look bad dead the beacon was destroyed and get there invading the council's going to want answers the council can kiss my ass i won't let them blame me for losing the beacon i didn't do anything wrong i'll stand behind you and your report shepard you're a damned hero in my books that's not why i'm here it's saren that other turian saren's a specter one of the best a living legend but if he's working with the gift it means he's gone rogue a rogue specter's trouble saren's dangerous and he hates humans why he thinks we're growing too fast taking over the galaxy a lot of aliens think that way most of them don't do anything about it but saren has allied himself with the geth i don't know how i don't know why i only know it had something to do with that beacon you were there just before that beacon self-destructed did you see anything any clue that might tell us what saren was after just before i lost consciousness i had some kind of vision a vision a vision of what i saw synthetics geth maybe slaughtering people butchering them we need to report this to the council shepard what are we gonna tell them i had a bad dream we don't know what information was stored in that beacon lost prothean technology blueprints for some ancient weapon of mass destruction whatever it was saran took it but i know saren i know his reputation is politics he believes humans are a blight on the galaxy this attack was an act of war he has the secrets from the beacon he is an army of death at his command and he won't stop until he's wiped humanity from the face of the galaxy i'll find some way to take him down it's not that easy he's a specter he can go anywhere do almost anything that's why we need the council on our side we prove saren's gone rogue and the council will revoke his specter status i'll contact the ambassador and see if he can get us an audience with the council he'll want to see us as soon as we reach the citadel we should be getting close head up to the bridge and tell joker to bring us into dark [Music] hey commander i'm glad you're okay commander the crew could use some good news after what happened to jenkins jenkins was a valuable part of this crew part of me feels guilty over what happened if jenkins was still alive i might not be here you're a good soldier williams you belong on the normandy thanks commander that means a lot from you i've never met anyone who has awarded the star of tara things were pretty rough down there are you okay i've seen friends die before comes with being a marine but to see my whole unit wiped out and you never get used to seeing dead civilians but things would have been a lot worse if you hadn't shown up we couldn't have done it without you williams thanks commander i have to admit i was a little worried about being assigned to the normandy it's nice when someone makes you feel welcome i think you're going to fit in here just fine williams thanks commander [Music] good timing commander i was just about to bring us into the citadel see that taxpayer money at work [Music] look at the size of that ship the ascension flagship of the citadel fleet wow sizes and everything why so touchy joker i'm just saying you need firepower too look at that monster its main gun could rip through the barriers in any ship in the alliance fleet good thing is on our side then citadel control this is ssv normandy requesting permission to land stand by for clearance normandy clearance granted you may begin your approach transferring you to an alliance operator roger alliance tower normandy normandy this is alliance tower please proceed to dock 422 [Music] [Music] this is an outrage the council would step in if the geth attacked a taurian colony the turians don't found colonies on the borders of the terminus systems ambassador humanity was well aware of the risks when you went into the traverse what about seven you can't just ignore a rogue specter i demand action you don't get to make demands of a council ambassador citadel security is investigating your charges against siren we will discuss the susec findings at the hearing not before captain anderson i see you brought half your crew with you just the ground team from eden prime in case you had any questions i have the mission reports i assume they're accurate they are sounds like you convinced the council to give us an audience they were not happy about it seren's their top agent they don't like him being accused of treason saren's a threat to every human colony out there if they don't stop him i will settle down commander you've already done more than enough to jeopardize your candidacy for the specters the mission on eden prime was a chance to prove you could get the job done instead nihilus ended up dead and the beacon was destroyed that's aaron's fault not his then we better hope the c-sec investigation turns up evidence to support our accusations otherwise the council might use this as an excuse to keep you out of the specters come with me captain i want to go over a few things before the hearing shepard you and the others can meet us at the citadel tower top level i'll make sure you have clearance to get in and that's why i hate politicians [Music] greetings and welcome to the presidium my name is avina and i am pleased to be your virtual guide throughout this level of the citadel space station what does that mean i am a fully interactive virtual intelligence programmed to provide spontaneous guidance at predetermined locations of interest throughout this level of the citadel i may also be contacted through any of the presidium vi terminals should you require assistance give me the tour you are standing at presidium tourism terminal 1 on either side of this lobby are the embassies of the various citadel races along with csec headquarters on the far end of this level you can see the citadel tower where the council meets regularly to discuss matters of interstellar importance what can you tell me about the citadel council originally the council consisted of representatives from the asari and solarians the two dominant species in citadel space roughly 1 304 galactic standard years ago turians were invited to join the council in recognition of the role they played during the krogan rebellion since then the three council races have worked together to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the galactic community while preserving individual autonomy for each species it can't be as simple as that there must be problems somewhere in the system i am not programmed to make that kind of qualified judgment my code is limited to information and simple interaction simulations i want to know more about citadel security citadel security serves as law enforcement for all regions of the citadel though the majority of officers serve in the wards executor palin a turian is the current head of c-sec but individuals from virtually every species across citadel space serve as officers beneath him if you wish to learn more executor palin's office is located in the seasick headquarters just across the lobby tell me about the embassies each species in citadel space important enough to be consulted on matters of galactic politics maintains an embassy on the presidium the volas were the first non-council species to be granted an embassy roughly 2 384 galactic standard years ago as citadel space has expanded more embassies have been added the most recently added embassy belongs to your own species humanity it was added 19 galactic standard years ago despite some rather vocal opposition why were people trying to keep my species out some species felt humanity was given preferential treatment it often takes a century or more before a new species is granted an embassy the council gave a great deal of thought to this matter in the end they decided humanity's impact on citadel space was significant enough to warrant an embassy do you agree with their decision i am not programmed to make that kind of qualified judgment my code is limited to information and simple interaction simulations how come the bolus were the first species given an embassy in the early years following the formation of the council the volas were apart from the asari and salarians the most populous and widespread species in citadel space they established many new colonies and trading outposts and they petitioned the council for a greater role in determining interstellar policy in recognition of their work to expand interstellar trade and establish a standardized galactic economy the volus were granted an embassy here on the citadel why weren't they made a council race the council races have extensive responsibilities they must provide personnel and ships for the citadel fleets they often provide economic aid in times of disaster it would be unfair to demand such an enormous burden of a species unable to meet these obligations the embassies allow lesser species to have a voice on the citadel that's pretty damn arrogant i apologize if my personality has offended you please submit all formal complaints in writing to the citadel tourist and visitor board do you know anything about spectres the term spectre is derived from the branch of special tactics and reconnaissance each spectre agent is hand-picked by the council their primary role is preserving galactic stability and resolving volatile situations that cannot be handled through normal political channels in this role they are granted extra territorial rights and jurisdictions spectres answered to no law or authority except the council itself goodbye goodbye and thank you for using aveena please enjoy your visit to the citadel [Music] [Music] the council isn't going to ask me any questions are they i doubt it we've made our reports now we just have to trust ambassador udina no we don't sir [Music] look at that bug thing over there do not disturb the keepers please do not welcome to presidium tourism terminal 2. you behind me is the spectacular relay monument a scale model representation of a prothean mass relay to your left is one of the keepers the enigmatic caretakers of the citadel working on a control panel you may see keepers involved in various tasks throughout all levels of the citadel we ask that you do not interfere with them in any way the keepers are essential to the smooth operation of the citadel obstructing their daily work will result in harsh penalties including incarceration and rehabilitation i'd like to know more about the keepers little is known about these peaceful servants of the citadel though they are essential to the operation and maintenance of the entire station citadel regulations protect the keepers against interference during the performance of their tasks failure to comply will result in harsh penalties keepers can be seen in all sections of the citadel but are typically found in and around the tower any particular reason there are so many keepers in this area the keepers do not communicate with other species it is assumed however that the tower houses the citadel's primary control systems many of the station systems such as navigation and life support function automatically it is believed the keepers operate those systems from inside the tower's inaccessible core the keepers also make frequent appearances in the council chamber itself though they appear to be just passing through on their way to some other destination that's all for now thank you for using aveena have a pleasant day ah human this one is greatly pleased to see you here in my decadent emporium who are you this one's face name is de la nindor though many in this place simply refer to it as delon please take time to examine the fine goods it has for purchase all of great worth who are you this one's face name please take time to examine the fine goods it has for purchase all of great work show me your items oh this one is pleased to do so human you will not be disappointed [Music] good day commander the human ambassadors up the stairs first room on the right [Music] you know who i am yes i receive reports on all newly arrived dignitaries and notable people i should be going now have a pleasant day [Music] she [Music] saren's hiding something give me more time install them stall the council don't be ridiculous your investigation is over garrus commander shepard garris vacarion i was the officer in charge of the c-sec investigation into sarin who were you just talking to that was executor palin head of citadel security my boss he'll be presenting my findings on saren to the council sounds like you really want to bring him down i don't trust him something about him rubs me the wrong way but he's a specter everything he touches is classified i can't find any hard evidence i think the council's ready for us commander good luck shepard maybe they'll listen to you the hearing's already started come on the geth attack is a matter of some concern but there is nothing to indicate saren was involved in any way the investigation by citadel security turned up no evidence to support your charge of treason an eyewitness saw him kill nilis in cold blood we've read the eden prime reports ambassador the testimony of one traumatized doc worker is hardly compelling proof i resent these accusations nihilus was a fellow spectre and a friend that just let you catch them off guard captain anderson you always seem to be involved when humanity makes false charges against me and this must be your protege commander shepard the one who let the beacon get destroyed you're the one who destroyed the beacon then you tried to cover it up shift the blame to cover your own failures just like captain anderson he's taught you well but what can you expect from a human you can expect me to kill you the next time we meet your species needs to learn its place shepard you're not ready to join the council you're not even ready to join the specters he has no right to say that that's not his decision shepard's admission into the specters is not the purpose of this meeting this meeting has no purpose the humans are wasting your time counsellor and mine you can't hide behind the council forever there is still one outstanding issue commander shepard's vision it may have been triggered by the beacon are we allowing dreams into evidence now how can i defend my innocence against this kind of testimony i agree our judgment must be based on facts and evidence not wild imaginings and reckless speculation do you have anything else to add commander shepard you've made your decision i won't waste my breath the council has found no evidence of any connection between saren and the guesth ambassador your petition to have him disbarred from the specters is denied i'm glad to see justice was served this meeting is adjourned it was a mistake bringing you into that hearing captain you and saren have too much history it made the council question our motives i know saren he's working with the get for one reason to exterminate the entire human race every colony we have is at risk every world we control is in danger even earth isn't safe tell me about this history between you and sarah i worked with him on a mission a long time ago things went bad real bad we shouldn't talk about this here but i know what he's like and he has to be stopped we need to deal with sarah and ourselves as a specter he's virtually untouchable we need to find some way to expose him what about garrus that c-sec investigator we saw him arguing with the executor that's right he was asking for more time to finish his report seems like he was close to finding something on saren any idea where we could find him i have a contact in seasick who can help us track gareth down his name is harkin forget it they suspended harkin last month drinking on the job i won't waste my time with that loser you won't have to i don't want the council using your past history with saturn as an excuse to ignore anything we turn up shepard will handle this you can't just cut captain anderson out of this investigation the ambassador's right i need to step aside i need to take care of some business captain meet me in my office later harkin's probably getting drunk at cora's den it's a dingy little club in the lower section of the wards i thought you said he was a drunken loser couldn't hurt to go talk to him just be careful i wouldn't call him reliable our ambassador doesn't seem to get along with the council he's just frustrated the council's always preaching that we need to be part of the galactic community but for them it's a one-way street they want us to expand and settle unstable regions like the skillion verge in the attic and traverse but when we run into trouble they don't want to help us out everyone knows it's only a matter of time until we get a seat on the council the ambassador just thinks it should happen sooner rather than later and i agree maybe they'd let us join the council if we were more willing to cooperate with the other species of course they would if we did everything they told us to they'd love to have us on the council but it wouldn't be much of a deal for us i understand their side they don't want us dominating the council it's founded on cooperation and alliances but we have to look out for our own interests too who cares if we get a seat on the council what's the big deal if the council passes a ruling on an interstellar matter we have to follow it we don't have the fleets or political allies to defy them once we get a seat on the council we'll be able to influence those rulings protect our own interests no more jumping through hoops whenever we want something take this mess we're in now if humanity had a seat on the council we'd just send the citadel fleet out to take care of sauron and his guest problem solved you and sarin have a history what happened about twenty years ago i was part of a mission in the skillion verge i was working with sarin to find and remove a known terrorist threat saren eliminated his target but a lot of people died along the way innocent people and the official records just covered it all up but i saw how he operates no conscience no hesitation he'd kill a thousand innocent civilians to end a war without a second thought killing innocents doesn't end wars it causes them i know how the world works commander sometimes you're forced to make unpleasant decisions but only if there's no other way sarin doesn't even look for another option he's twisted broken he likes the violence the killing and he knows how to cover his tracks i should go good luck shepard i'll be over in the ambassador's office if you need anything else so this is where the council passes judgment on all this little folk huh ever get the feeling ran over our heads commander [Music] so what oh no i wasn't never mind um yes is there something you want why are you so interested in the keepers keepers i've got no interest in don't get coy i know what i saw oh yeah i'm not so sure i should be talking to you about this we're just talking is there something wrong with that no i guess it wouldn't hurt to tell you i'm using a small scanner to gather readings on the keepers so far i've had mixed results i find it difficult to get near the creatures why were you being so secretive about it though well technically we're not supposed to disturb the keepers i don't really think my scanning disturbs them but the authorities might disagree i'd like to do it more openly but it's not really getting arrested over i could help you out i'm not worried about the authorities i don't even know who you are i'm commander shepard with the alliance military hmm well i suppose i could use the help you'll need this it's the scanning device i developed activate it each time you see a keeper all collected data will automatically upload to my database i'll even send a few credits your way for each unique scan what are you doing with the data once you've scanned it trying to learn whatever i can about the keepers we see them working everywhere yet we know so little about them i'm a scientist i want to know what makes them tick i should get going then yes i have much work myself so long and good luck with the scanning uh [Music] i can't believe the council ignored all the evidence against sarah sarin's one of their best operatives it's only natural to take his words oh so now we just chase leads while this smug turian runs around with his death troopers that's politics chief i hate politics please do not disturb the keepers you're creating a public disturbance it's against citadel regulations [Music] that's him i think we got hey back off rex this told us to down if you showed up what are you waiting for i'm standing right here this is fist's only chance if he's smart he'll take it he's not coming out rex end of story this story is just beginning [Music] out of my way humans i have no quarrel with you what was that all about who knows let's just try not to get caught in the middle alliance military i could have been a marine you know instead i joined the goddamn citadel security biggest mistake of my life [Music] parking right i was told you could help me find someone victorian c-sec officer named garrus garrus you must be one of captain anderson's crew poor bastard still trying to bring sarin down eh i know where garrus is but you gotta tell me something first did the captain let you in on his big secret [Music] is there something i should know about the captain the captain used to be a spectre didn't know that did you it was all very hush hush the first human ever given that honor and then he blew it screwed up his mission so bad they keep them out of course he blames sarin says the turian set him up [Music] you said they covered all this up how'd you hear about it i spent 20 years working cases here on the citadel people on this station love to talk secrets are like herpes if you got them you might as well spread them around why'd they kick him out have to ask him i never heard any of the details but it's a good story though the heroes fall classic tragedy why should i believe a drunk like you fine ask anderson i bet he tells you he's too stupid and proud to lie right to your face just tell me where garrus went garrus was sniffing around dr michelle's office she runs the med clinic on the other side of the wards unless i heard he was going back there i'm out of here yeah good go let me drink a nice you're probably right still i'd like to hear what the captain has to say about all this hmm [Music] hmm [Music] in light of the recent attack on eden prime many colonial investors are pulling their support for future projects proponents of expanded human colonization insist that eden prime was an isolated case nevertheless colonist enrollment has dropped sharply many colonial proposals are on hold until backers have some reassurance that human colonies will be adequately [Music] protected do you really think we'll find him down here he always stops in for a few games of quasar before he makes his drop fist is gonna be pissed if we take down his supplier that's the point we want to make angry people make mistakes there's just something about fist that makes me nervous a solarian excavation team has run into an unexpected problem after unearthing a prothean dig site hanar protesters have blockaded the dig site claiming that artifacts of the end kindlers as the hennar call them should not be disturbed the excavation team has appealed to henna representatives on the citadel to reach a diplomatic solution i've told you before you're not allowed in here [Music] [Music] i didn't tell anyone i swear that was smart doc now if garros comes around you stay smart keep your mouth shuddering who are you let her go [Music] perfect timing shepard gave me a clear shot at that bastard you took him down clean sometimes you get lucky dr michelle are you hurt no i'm okay thanks to you all of you why were they threatening you who do they work for they work for feast they wanted to shut me up keep me from telling garros about the quarian does this have anything to do with the investigation into saren i think it might dr michelle tell us what happened a few days ago a quarian came by my office she'd been shot but she wouldn't tell me who did it i could tell she was scared probably on the run she asked me about the shadow broker she wanted to trade information in exchange for a safe place to hide where is she now i put her in contact with fist he's an agent for the shadow broker not anymore now he works for sarin and the shadow broker isn't too happy about it feast betrayed the shadow broker that's stupid even for him saren must have made him quite the offer that quarian must have something saren wants something worth crossing the shadow broker to get what else can you tell me about the quarian i'm not sure like i said she wanted to trade information for a place to hide she didn't wait a minute guess her information had something to do with the guest she must be able to link saren to the geth there's no way the council can ignore this time we paid fist a visit this is your show shepard but i want to bring saren down as much as you do i'm coming with you you're a turian why do you want to bring him down i couldn't find the proof i needed in my investigation but i knew what was really going on saren is a traitor to the council and a disgrace to my people welcome aboard you know we aren't the only ones going after fist the shadow broker hired a krogan bounty hunter named rex to take him out yeah we saw him in the bar a krogan might come in handy last i heard he was at the c-sec academy what's he doing there fist accused him of making threats we brought rex in for a little talk if you hurry you can catch him at the academy before he leaves move out uh [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] binary helix has settled out of court with a krogan group that had accused the genetics corporation of fraud the krogan group had contracted binary helix to perform studies with a long-range goal of curing their genetic sterilization the group later sued for a return of investment money when the study produced no viable results witnesses saw you making threats in fists bar stay away from him i don't take orders from you this is your only warning rex you should warn fist i will kill him you want me to arrest you i want you to try go on get out of here do i know you human my name's shepard i'm going after fist thought you might want to come along shepard commander shepard i've heard a lot about you we're both warriors shepard out of respect i'll give you a fair warning i'm going to kill this fist knows you're coming we'll have a better chance if we all work together my people have a saying seek the enemy of your enemy you will find a friend i think we're gonna get along just fine rex let's go i hate to keep fist waiting [Music] looks like it's shut down i'm on it so uh stop right there don't come any closer warehouse workers all the real guards must be dead stay back or we'll shoot this would be a good time to find somewhere else to work yeah yeah right that's a good idea yeah i never like fist anyway it would have been quicker to just kill them shooting people isn't always the answer wait don't kill me i surrender tell me where the quarrion is i won't have to shoot you in the kneecaps she's not here i don't know where she is that's the truth he's no use to you now let me kill him wait wait i don't know where the quarian is but i know where you can find her the quarian isn't here said she'd only deal with the shadow broker himself face to face impossible even i was hired through an agent nobody meets the shadow broker ever even i don't know his true identity but she didn't know that i told her i'd set a meeting up but when she shows up it'll be saren's men waiting for tell me where that meeting is before i blow your lying head off you're on the wards the back alley by the markets she's supposed to meet them right now you can make it if you hurry what are you doing the shadow broker paid me to kill him i don't leave jobs half done i'm in charge here you ever pull another stunt like that it was the only contract i had left and don't we have something more pressing to worry about that quarry instead if we don't go now so [Music] let's see perimeter secure did you bring it where's the shadow broker where's fist they'll be here where's the evidence no way the deal's off set me up i knew i couldn't trust him don't worry about fist he got what was coming to him then i guess there are two things i need to thank you for who are you my name's shepard i'm looking for evidence to prove saren's a traitor then i have a chance to repay you for saving my life but not here we need to go somewhere safe we could take her to the human embassy your ambassador will want to see this anyway you're not making my life easy shepherd fire fights in the wards and all out assault on korra's den do you know how many who is this a quarian what are you up to shepard this quarian can help us bring down sarah i would have told you that if you hadn't jumped down my throat i apologize commander this whole thing with sarin has me a bit on edge maybe we should just start at the beginning miss my name is tali tali we don't see many quarians here why did you leave the flotilla i was on my pilgrimage my rite of passage into adulthood i've never heard of this before it is a tradition among my people when we reach maturity we leave the ships of our parents and our people behind alone we search the stars only returning to the flotilla once we have discovered something of value in this way we prove ourselves worthy of adulthood what kinds of things do you look for it could be resources like food or fuel or some type of useful technology or even knowledge that will make life easier on the flotilla through our pilgrimage we prove that we will contribute to the community rather than being a burden on our limited resources tell us what you found during my travels i began hearing reports of geth since they drove my people into exile the geth have never ventured beyond the veil i was curious i tracked a patrol of death to an uncharted world i waited for one to become separated from its unit then i disabled it and removed its memory core i thought they get fried their memory cores when they died some kind of defense mechanism how did you manage to preserve the memory core my people created the geth if you're quick careful and lucky small caches of data can sometimes be saved most of the core was wiped clean but i salvaged something from its audio banks eden prime was a major victory the beacon has brought us one step closer to finding the conduit that's saren's voice this proves he was involved in the attack he said eden prime brought him one step closer to finding the conduit any idea what that means the conduit must have something to do with the beacon maybe some kind of prothean technology like a weapon wait there's more saren wasn't working alone eden prime was a major victory the beacon has brought us one step closer to finding the conduit and one step closer to the return of the reapers i don't recognize that other voice the one talking about reapers are they some kind of new alien species according to the memory core the reapers were a hyper advanced machine race that existed 50 000 years ago the reapers hunted the protheans to total extinction and then they vanished at least that's what the guests believe sounds a little far-fetched the vision on eden prime i understand it now i saw the protheans being wiped out by the reapers the geth revere the reapers as gods the pinnacle of non-organic life and they believe sarin knows how to bring the reapers back the council is just going to love this this is a lot to handle they might just ignore everything we tell them no matter what they think about the rest of this those audiophiles prove saren's a traitor the captain's right we need to present this to the council right away what about her the quarian my name is tali you saw me in the alley commander you know what i can do let me come with you i thought you were on your pilgrimage the pilgrimage proves we are willing to give of ourselves for the greater good what does it say about me if i turn my back on this seren is a danger to the entire galaxy my pilgrimage can wait i'll take all the help i can get thanks you won't regret this anderson and i will go ahead to get things ready with a council take a few minutes to collect yourself then meet us in the tower [Music] she excuse me commander shepard could you spare a moment of your time commander shepard my name is sameesh bhatia forgive the intrusion but i have nowhere else to turn what do you need my wife was a marine she was in the 212 on eden prime i have requested that my wife's body be returned to me for cremation but the military has refused my request why did they refuse your request there's got to be some reason i don't know all i know is that they have declared it impossible for my wife to be returned to me there's no reason for your wife's body to be held like this just wait here the man in charge of my case is mr boska when i last saw him he was in the expensive bar over there thank you for your time i just want to give my wife a proper funeral and the respect she deserves [Music] [Music] so hmm my goodness you're commander shepard your activities made for quite a briefing in the diplomatic corps is there something i can do to assist you you can cut the red tape for a grieving husband i want you to release the body of neroli bacha commander nothing would make me happier i'm afraid though that it's not quite that simple serviceman narali bhatia died on eden prime as mr bhatia no doubt told you her wounds are inconsistent with any type of weapon damage we've seen before that is why her body is being held you're studying her injuries to learn more about geth weaponry the tests we're conducting may lead to better defenses against death attacks respectfully serviceman batia may save more lives in death than she did in life i understand what you're trying to do but holding the body is wrong commander you of all people should understand how far we must go to protect humanity not if we lose our humanity in the process i'm out there fighting to stop crap like this all right commander you win it was hard enough refusing mr bhatia i'm not going to risk an incident by refusing you tell smesh that the body is being shipped back to earth i'll go now to see to it myself hello again commander has there been any word your wife is coming home mr batya thank you i will return home and begin my preparations it does not bring me happiness but it may bring me peace goodbye [Music] commander [Music] ah [Music] so come on hoodin is presenting the quarian's evidence to the council eden prime was a major victory the beacon has brought us one step closer to finding the conduit and one step closer to the return of the reapers you wanted proof there it is this evidence is irrefutable ambassador sarin will be stripped of his specter status and all efforts will be made to bring him in to answer for his crimes i recognize the other voice the one speaking with saren matriarch benezia matriarchs are powerful atari who have entered the final stage of their lives revered for their wisdom and experience they serve as guides and mentors to my people matriarch benezia is a powerful biotic and she had many followers she will make a formidable ally for saren i'm more interested in the reapers what you know about them only what was extracted from the geth's memory core the reapers were an ancient race of machines that wiped out the protheans then they vanished the geth believe the reapers are gods and saren is the prophet for their return we think the conduit is the key to bringing them back saren's searching for it that's why he attacked eden prime do we even know what this conduit is sarah thinks it can bring back the reapers that's bad enough listen to what you're saying saren wants to bring back the machines that wiped out all life in the galaxy impossible it has to be where did the reapers go why did they vanish how come we found no trace of their existence if they were real we'd have found something i tried to warn you about saren and you refuse to face the truth don't make the same mistake again this is different you proved saren betrayed the council we all agree he's using the guest to search for the conduit but we don't really know why the reapers are obviously just a myth commander a convenient lie to cover saturn's true purpose a legend he is using to bend the geth to his will fifty thousand years ago the reapers wiped out all galactic civilization if saren finds the conduit it will happen again cern is a rogue agent on the run for his life he no longer has the rights or resources of a specter the council has stripped him of his position that is not good enough you know he's hiding somewhere in the traverse send your fleet in a fleet cannot track down one man a citadel fleet could secure the entire region keep the get from attacking any more of our colonies or it could trigger a war with the terminus systems we won't be dragged into a galactic confrontation over a few dozen human colonies i can take seren down the commander's right there is a way to stop saren that doesn't require fleets or armies no it's too soon humanity is not ready for the responsibilities that come with joining the spectres it was a turry inspector who betrayed this council and it was a human who exposed him i've earned this commander shepard stepped forward [Music] house it is the decision of the council that you be granted all the powers and privileges of the special tactics and reconnaissance branch of the citadel spectres are not trained but chosen individuals forged in the fire of service and battle those whose actions elevate them above the rank and fire spectres are an ideal a symbol the embodiment of courage determination and self-reliance they are the right hand of the council instruments of our will spectres bear a great burden they are protectors of galactic peace both our first and last line of defense the safety of the galaxy is there you are the first human spectral commander this is a great accomplishment for you and your entire species what's my first mission we're sending you into the traverse after saren he's a fugitive from justice so you are authorized to use any means necessary to apprehend or eliminate him any idea where to find him we will forward any relevant files to ambassador udina this meeting of the council is adjourned congratulations commander we've got a lot of work to do shepard you're going to need a ship a crew supplies you'll get access to special equipment and training now you should go down to the csec academy and speak to the spectre requisitions officer anderson come with me i'll need your help to set all this up bastard didn't even thank you he's got a lot on his mind come on right behind you shepard 300 years ago the guest drove my people into exile we asked the council to wipe the synthetics out but they ignored our would be pleas now [Music] [Music] shhh you quarians messed up the whole galaxy when you let the death break free do your people ever talk about it do the krogan talk about starting a foolish war that resulted in the turian sterilizing your people all the time i've got big news for you shepard captain anderson is stepping down as commanding officer of the normandy this ship is yours now she's quick and quiet and you know the crew perfect ship for a specter her well commander i want the truth why are you stepping down sir you needed your own ship a specter can't answer to anyone but the council and it's time for me to step down come clean with me captain you owe me that much i was in your shoes 20 years ago shepard they were considering me for the specters why didn't you ever mention this what was i supposed to say i could have been expected but i blew it i failed commander it's not something i'm proud of ask me later and i'll tell you the whole story for now all you need to know is i was sent on a mission with saren and he made sure the council rejected me i had my shot it came and went now you have a chance to make up for my mistakes saren's not going to get away this time saren's gone don't even try to find him but we know what he's after the conduit he's got his guests scouring the traverse looking for clues we had reports of geth in the pharaoh system shortly before our colony there dropped out of contact and there have been sightings around noveria find out what saren was after on pharaohs in novaria maybe you can figure out where the conduit is before he does the reapers are the real threat i'm with the council on this one shepherd i'm not sure they even exist but if they do exist the conduits the key to bringing them back stop sarin from getting the conduit and we stop the reapers from returning anything else we have one more lead matriarch benezia the other voice in that recording she has a daughter a scientist who specializes in the protheans we don't know if she's involved but it might be a good idea to try and find her see what she knows her name's liara dr liana tassone we have reports she was exploring an archaeological dig on one of the uncharted worlds in the artemis tau cluster sounds like we should head for the artemis tau cluster it's your decision commander you're a specter now don't answer to us but your actions still reflect on humanity as a whole you make a mess and i get stuck cleaning it up i'll do whatever it takes to stop sarin kept exactly the answer i was looking for a shepherd remember you were a human long before you were a specter i have a meeting to get to captain anderson can answer any questions you might have the asari were the first species to discover the citadel when the solarians arrived it was the asari who proposed the establishment of the citadel council to maintain peace throughout the galaxy since then the asari have served as the mediators and centrists of the council an all-female race the asari reproduce through a form of parthenogenesis they can attune their nervous system to that of another individual of any gender and of any species to reproduce this capability has led to the unseemly and inaccurate rumors about asari promiscuity asari can live for over a thousand years passing through three stages of life in the maiden stage they wander restlessly seeking new knowledge and experience when the matron stage begins they meld with interesting partners to produce their offspring this ends when they reach the matriarch stage where they assume the roles of leaders and counselors the second species to join the citadel the solarians are warm-blooded amphibians with a hyperactive metabolism solarians think fast talk fast and move fast to solarians other species seem sluggish and dull-witted unfortunately their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short lifespan solarians over the age of 40 are a rarity the solarians were responsible for advancing the development of the primitive krogan species to use as soldiers during the rachni wars they were also behind the genophage bio weapon the turians used to quell the krogan rebellions several centuries later salarians are known for their observational capability and non-linear thinking this manifests is an aptitude for research and espionage they are constantly experimenting and inventing and it is generally accepted that they always know more than they are letting on roughly 1200 years ago the turians were invited to join the citadel council to fulfill the role of galactic peacekeepers the turians have the largest fleet in citadel space and they make up the single largest portion of the council's military forces as their territory and influences spread the turians have come to rely on the solarians for military intelligence and the asari for diplomacy despite a somewhat colonial attitude towards the rest of the galaxy the ruling hierarchy understands they would lose more than they would gain if the other two races were ever removed turians come from an autocratic society that values discipline and possesses a strong sense of personal and collective honor there is lingering animosity between turians and humans over the first contact war of 2157 which is known as the relay 314 incident to the turians officially however the two species are allies and they enjoy civil if cool diplomatic relations the second speak roughly 1200 years ago that the assad fifty thousand years ago the protheans were the only space-faring species in the galaxy they vanished in a swift galactic extinction only the legacy of their empire remains they are believed to have built the mass relays and the citadel which have allowed numerous species to explore and expand throughout the galaxy prothean ruins are found on worlds across the galaxy while surprisingly intact for their age functioning examples of prothean paleo technology are rare time and generations of looters have picked their dead cities and derelict stations clean some believe the protheans meddled in the evolution of younger races the hannah homeworld of kaje for example shows clear evidence of former prothean occupation the presence of a former prothean observation post on mars has caused a rebirth of interventionary evolutionists among humans these individuals believe the god myths of ancient civilizations are misremembered encounters with aliens [Music] yes commander how are you holding up honestly this isn't how i pictured my career it pushing papers really isn't my thing but you're the one who can stop sarah i believe in you shepard if that means i have to step aside so be it tell me what happened with you and saren 20 years ago it's close to 20 years ago now ambassador goyle was our representative like udina she wanted to get a human into the specters she chose me the council sent sarah to keep an eye on me and evaluate my performance just like they sent nihilus to keep tabs on you i trusted you you betrayed me it's not something i'm proud of i had a chance to become the first human specter and i failed saren made sure of that i think i deserved the whole story we had intel on a rogue scientist being funded by batarian interests he was trying to set up a facility to develop illegal ai technology alliance intel had done all the work but the council wanted a specter involved we compromised i was assigned to help sarin in his investigation we tracked the scientists to a refining facility on kamala he was hidden away somewhere inside protected by an army of batarian mercenaries the plan was simple sneak into the plant capture the scientist sneak back out quick quiet and a minimum of bloodshed i'm guessing things didn't go as planned saren and i split up to cover more ground then about halfway through the mission there was a massive explosion in the refining core officially it was ruled an accident but i think saren detonated it on purpose to draw off the enemy guards sounds like overkill to me the explosion tore the refinery to shreds the whole place was on fire black chemical clouds poured out into the atmosphere nobody inside survived there was a camp for the workers and their families nearby between the fires and the toxic fumes the final death count was over 500 mostly civilians saren didn't care the target was eliminated mission accomplished and i ended up taking the blame that ended all talk of me joining the specters sarin caused the explosion how do you pin it on you in his report saren accused me of blowing his cover he said it was my fault the guards were ready for us he claimed that's why it turned into a massacre saren's report was all the proof the council needed to kill my chances of becoming inspector don't blame yourself captain i don't i blame sarah i think he wanted things to go bad he was looking for an excuse to blow that refinery maybe he just likes the violence maybe he was just trying to make me look bad to keep humans out of the specters if so he pulled it off why'd you let him get away with it who do you think the council was going to listen to me or their best agent i had a bad feeling about him right from the start i should have been more careful maybe i could have stopped things before they got out of hand don't blame yourself captain i don't maybe he just likes the violence maybe he was just trying to make me look bad to keep humans out of the specters if so he pulled it all the only thing i care about is stopping saren you're right it's no good living in the past i want to know the truth about you and saren i want to know about the mission you were on together all those years ago we had intel on a road a lot we the plan was simple sneak into the plan the only thing i care about is stopping right it's no good living in the past what do you know about the artemis tau cluster not much i've never been there myself a handful of systems with a few small uncharted worlds but no real colonies might not be easy finding dr desony out there my advice is to look for the world with the prothean ruins any extra intel you can give me on our colony at pharos the entire planet used to be one giant prothean city mostly ruins now but some of the infrastructure is still intact the colony tried to build on what the protheans left behind we lost all contact with them when they get attacked what can you tell me about novaria no various trouble always has been the whole planet's basically a center for corporations to conduct illegal research watch your back there shepard specters are about the only form of citadel authority novaria respects but they aren't popular i should go i'll be here if you need anything stand by decontamination in progress i heard what happened to captain anderson survives 100 battles and then gets taken down by backroom politics just watch your back commander things go bad on this mission you're next on their chopping block captain anderson should be the one in charge it's like i'm stealing the ship from him yeah the captain got screwed but it's not like you could have stopped it nobody's blaming you everyone on this ship's behind you commander 100 intercoms open you got anything you want to say to the crew now's the time [Music] listen up normandy this is your commander speaking we have our order therein before he finds the conduit and i refuse to let anything get in the way of that mission we all know what happened on eden prime we saw the destruction we saw the bodies we saw what saren did and i plan to make him pay for too long our species has stood apart from the others now it's time for us to step up and do our part for the rest of the galaxy time to show them what humans are made of wherever saren goes we'll follow wherever he searches for the conduit we'll be there we will hunt him to the very ends of the galaxy and bring him down humanity needs to do this not just for our own sake but for the sake of every other species in citadel space sarin must be stopped and i promise you all we will stop him well said commander captain will be proud the captain gave up everything so i could have this chance we can't fail yes sir [Music] do [Music] [Music] so commander i'm picking up a signal from the planet's surface it looks like an automated distress beacon [Music] [Music] commander i'm picking up some
