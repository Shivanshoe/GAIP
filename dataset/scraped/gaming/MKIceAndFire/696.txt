shut up god i feel sick don't like this at all this porcelain the worst kind of news i know i'll be careful not exactly one of your strong suits listen first sign of trouble eat delta hanako she emptied the place [ __ ] excellent you have come thanks for meeting me of course v and i thank you before we discuss details i feel i owe you an explanation i must tell you why i changed my mind and wish to help we're unsure of anything if you could trust me if you weren't obud killed your father now i knew from the start you knew all the board members knew not one soul even slightly interested in the matter believed in the poisoning details were disparate inconsistent you knew but didn't do a thing about it why suddenly sprouted conscience just yesterday my father had flaws i know this i harbor no illusions about it when a four needed removal my father ordered it without a thought to mercy a way of being yorinobu could not abide but to my father ends ever justified means saburu arasaka has always valued just one thing do you know what it is ties that bind yes family i was to be its heart to uphold life ensure continuity stability never to oppose it huh guess your nobody's instructions were a little different yorinobu raised his hand against our father but he is an arasaka he is family i do not expect you to understand i wish you merely to know i do not oppose my brother willingly that it is difficult he's your brother it's been hard it'll be hard let's say i get that what changed your mind we received a warning during the parade security protocols were violated the first doubts sprouted then they grew yet greater in your hideout when my brother's assault group arrived not to rescue but to kill yoronobu was just plain willing to sacrifice you my father was right about my buzzer he never cared for us i was brought up to be the heart of the family it is time for the arasakas to listen to their heart it will bring justice did you bring soul killer as we agreed you finger on the trigger don't say a word on edge some of the guy you spooked i don't know three times now that av has flown by think someone might have tailed you we must not get distracted did you bring soul killer take me for a fool i think i fall for that got plans to walk out of here alive had i any ill intentions i would have chosen a side far more discrete than this we are here because i know how to save your life i can lead you to mikoshi meaning mikushi don't exist in real space yet its access points do and one is very near where here in night city beneath arasaka tower we oughta leave right now wanna leave what gave you that idea quit button in so i can hear her out this is gonna be a disaster sit we have little time and you'll help me in exchange for my brother you catch a whiff of that smells like [ __ ] careful not to step in it he must be made to take responsibility for his deeds sounds like you want to avenge dead old i want the arasaka corporation to know the truth how you plan to do this right yorinobu will soon call a meeting of the board representatives of all factions are expected to attend the perfect moment for them to learn the circumstances of my father's death i will get you into this meeting and you will testify against my brother testify listen mind if i'm straight with you help me get rid of your nobu i will help you get rid of the construct want me to throw your nobu under the bus in front of arasaka top brass call me crazy but that sounds like [ __ ] serious i will need to recap this i know and that is why we will take all the necessary precautions like such as you will see let's assume it works then what you take the arasaka throne where would you get that idea figured it as a given besides takamaru said you were supposed to step in for yorinobu here in night city everyone must know their place v that is a fact my brother has never understood i know my place and i have no wish to change it no wish to or no permission you being a woman i decide my own fate as should you so don't like this at all sounds like you want to use me no i simply offer you an opportunity not the first to try but what if i am the last you cannot take that chance let's fly the [ __ ] out of here v do you feel all right huh you are bleeding [ __ ] it seems you are running out of time don't delay make your decision ah i'll think it over you could use some air right now i warned you what are you doing see what i'm getting at yeah i get it and don't like it one bit i'm still going straight face the facts some pseudo endotriesey scooch and let me get behind the wheel i'll get us to [ __ ] mikoshi yeah how exactly without that porcelain cunt's help that's for damn sure don't stand a chance without help right about that but that's why i'll bring broke she's not rusted through just yet plus she owes me maybe she just stuck her neck out for you half a century ago but now i don't see it i'll convince her after all we know a thing or two about ops like this we'll blast our way into soccer tower just like we did back in the day then find the way inside mikoshi it's our only chance what about pan am she offered help listen i know you and pan am got a thing going i get it i do but that's what makes it such a shitty idea you don't want to rope her into this made the same mistake myself once you don't want those people involved their lives on the line possibly on your conscience our one hope is sitting at the afterlife right now and her name is rogue hanukkah's office on the table i'm sorry who's i'll cut the crap she actually has power could be our ticket yeah one-way ticket to the city morgue that suck a [ __ ] scrambled your circuits rogue and i will handle this just like we used to gotta stop you [ __ ] what's your scheme this is my body i make the call just this time johnny jesus look at you can't even great you checking out again am i no it's not what you think easy there don't move just yet i think you're in pain i know delirious when you arrive so i had a doshu with beta haloperidol but light over sensitivity is a good sign means your optic nerves aren't damaged my head ah almost done stabilizing the biochip oh feels like someone's using your head as a knife block how how'd i get here dragged yourself here beat the hell and back you missed the hell of a fright then you shoved my patient at the time off the table and demanded you be treated immediately telemet was your guardian angel huh i wasn't completely myself i know and that's a bit worrying just give it to me straight fig you've come to a critical juncture try sitting up carefully i'll try i think i'm getting some feeling back another victory for the history books if you got something to say vic just say it how much longer is this going to go on you tell me looking at you not long at all next attack you will be able to crawl back here you'll flatline in some back alley this is your last chance to take matters into your own hands understand take matters into my own hands the [ __ ] you think i've been doing well whatever it is it keeps landing you on my table now see that setup over there yeah what about it you'll find a last dose of pseudo-endo tries in there a gift from misty want to give in to the voices in your head go ahead take a buff go silent get out or find another way in things on your own terms get a little present for me over there too blockers manage to walk those few yards to the table the rest will be up to you and you alone you heard him we've got one last chance i'm taking the wheel endotriezine rogue soccer tower only way this is gonna work give it a [ __ ] rest johnny it's my decision and i gotta think about it i need to stretch you fine just no it's not in this basement christ you're talking out loud how loud what just go fix this thing i think i can do it say who won the bow oh so you heard that did he get up walsh was it nope never does meaning it's a rerun i like to go back to why'd you get so mad then if you already knew who won oh no really i guess i like to think about where walsh might have tripped up any theories entering the ring against a stronger opponent but feels a little strange to call that a mistake can't thank you enough for all you've done vick only wish i could have done more go on now i want to close up take the meds and do what you gotta do v thanks vic i will and you hang in there too good luck kid hey v i heard well your thoughts shouldn't have had to sorry about that no need to be i know what's going on and i know it won't be easy for either of you if you don't want to decide here i know a much better place sure got a feeling vic's had enough of me as is don't be mad at him his chakras are all blocked up today plus he's had too much coffee and let me guess my r is sputtering mm-hmm afraid so sure lead the way why is this spot special i took jackie there once it's not far jackie what's he got to do with any of this you'll see come on top floor he had the same glum face oh jack this is it chica i'm done for it doesn't sound like the jackie i knew that was a long time ago his mom had just found out he'd signed up with the valentinos trust me senora wells on one shoulder your gang choombas on the other no choice can ever seem right life wasn't easy for my jackie but he found the courage to bet on himself after i brought him here ah that's more like it air i come here when i need to get away be alone with my thoughts she's on to something oughta sit and roll through some [ __ ] he alone yourself thoughts near on unachievable these days so what what did jackie decide of here oh you know gonna be a legend in this city and i'm gonna leave you alone now take your time [ __ ] scared me know that thought you were on your way out no i'm still here for now you know should call anyone you want to say goodbye to worst case scenario that would you expect no but whatever you decide risk's gonna be high if things don't go our way just [ __ ] do it anyone you gotta talk to now's the time pills can wait i'm colin panham sure as hell hope it's that and only that hey ben am hey do you know what time it is it won't keep you long i just wanted to hear you he picked an interesting hour for it v okay what's going on to know that we'll see each other again what you know fine no no not like that make up your mind something something i gotta do today gonna be high risk big time but i have to what is it it's not for comms not really then shut up and tell me where you are in the city yeah okay then plant your butt somewhere and wait i'm on my way you don't get it i can't wait anymore this has something to do with what you were telling me before it does well i'll say one thing there's always a way out here's what you need to do you need to take a few deep breaths then rethink all this hard and then you can call me back do you know why because i am here for you but end of discussion well played wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise probably for the best would have said too much anyway what's good you called wish i'd had the chance to come a long way to get here haven't we just think it all started in a [ __ ] landfill then you tried to kill me see exactly what i mean trying to save your sorry hide now you can let me do that or you can try pan am in her tarmac rats but then their lives will lay heavy on your soul or you take arasaka's deal but then you'll have your own soul on your conscience gonna try to ask pan am for help you absolutely sure no going back on this you know i'm gonna try this with pan am got a feeling you're gonna regret this decision and the moment that dawns i won't be there to help could be my last ride this if it don't work out just want to be there for it where see you inside mikoshi johnny okay just me now ready to talk ready i'm glad to hear that so tell me need a way into our soccer tower now sorry what i'm serious whole thing with johnny i don't do something soon i'm done gone slow down first why are a soccer tower tech underneath that tower they got an access point too well odd as it sounds a prison of a souls of souls this might not fly over the hollow mikoshi that's its name only place johnny and i can disentangle for good it's my last chance so again just to be clear you've called me at high moon to ask me to help you break into arasaka tower or you'll die about the gist of it yeah okay okay where are you fix clinic the ripper right i know where it is can you hold off on dying for a bit give it a shot sure good don't go anywhere i'm coming to get you is that uv or like vic said taking matters into my own hands so what now waiting for my driver come inside we'll wait together since you have to wait land if i give you a reading so why not some believe uncertainty is an evil that should be dispelled through divination others claim it's change that is evil but that isn't true either every minute of every day we each become someone new we shouldn't fear change itself but only who we might change into knowing one's path is most important i devised this layout especially for you and johnny your future is his future and vice versa okay i'm ready we'll start with you the fool what a surprise let's dig deeper to find its meaning here the fool symbolizes the start of a journey the announcement of something new it's the inner child curious of the world but also naive and reckless sounds a lot like the v i first met the magician a person of great talent and charisma a leader sounds like johnny a card is reversed that can mean a tendency toward addiction mental instability okay definitely johnny he is one great disturbance the final cards are about your futures the lovers something that doesn't give me the chills finally balance friendship love b have you been keeping something from me huh what why you're making a strange face i uh no i'm fine okay and johnny's the moon well it doesn't sound too bad right i don't know v the moon is mystery i think that's for you yep no mistaking that ride ever you've scared me you know that didn't think anything could scare you hey we're here to help okay come on everybody's waiting to count look out for yourself fee you too misty thanks for everything welcome back to the living you feeling okay what happened you passed out on the way you tried shaking you awake to no avail sure does seem like your condition might be getting worse fee pan am asked me to keep an eagle eye on you where'd she go she's off debating saul you need help that's clear they sat right down to figure out how we might do that come on i'll take you to see him so v i heard talk that there's a war coming friday don't got a choice mitch looks like we don't have one neither called the cat guys the whole clan knows we set out tomorrow they know why what our aim is look around v war tested veterans are a fistful at most the rest mostly raid rinky dig convoys and salvage scrap so for now they only know as much as they need to know the aim is to help you out do not go muddying the waters not now we're sending this clan to its grave [ __ ] you think i don't know that and yet you seem to think you can change something by chewing me out like you usually do the finally how's your health been better so what have you guys patched together we still have details to iron out but we know the who where and how have a look for yourself a few strategies we sussed out but only one grants us a decent shot at penetrating arasaka tower we'll dig a tunnel sure these plans are up to date completely reliable positively we went to our snake nation sources they've been turning stones over in that area i'm not one to lie this tunnel gambit is risky but if it works that's our way into mikoshi so you want to tunnel into our soccer tower i know how it sounds but would be plum fools not to take advantage i see nightcorps building a new maglev line in the area granted it's guarded by militech but they're nothing we can't handle once we're in that tunnel it's just half a mile to the substratum levels of arasaka tower they're using what a nightcorp circs would only need a few minutes to dig that distance not bad wouldn't you say once we're in we'll have to improvise guards security measures the fastest way into mikoshi we'll take things as they come and hope for the best v any thoughts construction site what do we got for security whole place spiked will it take out in full force it's your average hard hat area nothing too scary but we can't just walk past them we expect to see the usual drone patrols on-site operators restricted access what's a cirque a subterranean extraction and removal combine it's automated tunnel boring if we can grab one we'll dig through to arasaka tower then go on to mikoshi sounds doable in theory to me no competing ideas and let's get prepping we'll need bucket loads more information it's the only way to determine if this plan holds water full of holes no matter what we turn up saul i can tell you that already but what's the alternative to call off the assault to let him die pan am is right we have to accept these risks come what may that much we owe you i'll talk to her brothers and sisters get a drone buzzing over that site and i'll check with mitch i think i know how to even the odds against militech come find us later i'll leave you in saul's hands now just no making decisions without me there anything else you need hey you and pan am something i need to know about it's funny you should ask i thought we'd smoothed over the rough edges between us then you showed up pan am thinks so too you'd have to ask yourself cb you're like the outsider who happens upon a family and witnesses nothing but endless quarrels then all of a sudden the outsider's presence is noticed and the family members shake hands join hands become stronger than they were before understand yeah at least they think so good so now you can tell me what else you'll need we need a decent neck connection someone i know can help us get into mukoshi who might that be alt she's it's an a.i from i'll pass a black one are you fully present up there why in hell would an ai help us break into mikoshi because i'll ask you to nicely [ __ ] maybe you know what fine we're up to our balls and dung anyway might as well go deeper find dakota she'll get you geared up no questions asked thanks so thank me once we get out of mikoshi alive and in one piece that america's long gone and forgot you might as well have started with once upon a time that's just it doesn't matter where we go we're strangers in our own land every state is practically its own country it wasn't any different back then unity is a state of mind teddy an imagined community at least here now you know where you stand look at it this way life can't disappoint if you don't have expectations illusions maybe that's exactly what freedom is bro if that's freedom why do i feel like i can't breathe like somebody's gripped my throat and won't let go like i said teddy it's a state of mind or you know the air prep coming along all right you call this prep i'd call it a damn improvisation but that's just bobby lo and behold isn't this in theory we fitted an afterburner and a multi-rpg launcher up top we also scooped out about 60 of its total mass beautiful isn't she you'll take the wheel with pan am riding shotgun afterburner standard nitro or military grade standard couldn't move this baby an inch it's a hardware's military but how the hell did you cram all that into a panzer oh small beans compared to the tricks we pulled with scorpion during the war when we unleash this piece tomorrow you'll see firepower up top what is it a rapid-fire 70-millimeter multiple rocket launcher coupled with an onboard mmi you can sync to via personal link where'd you get all this stuff teddy salvaged it from a scrap yard the launcher itself was fine the problem was no ammunition as luck would have it dakota procured some don't ask me how since tomorrow's a big day already how about we take it for a spin now i want to get a feel for over the terrain sure thing maybe after sundown though we still have a few loose screws to tighten that's putting it mildly will you quit being such a sourpuss we'll have her ready in time hey saul sent me it's been a long while what is it you need need a strong rig for little jaunt on the net okay get in gonna be hitting a masked encrypted bbs prefer nobody knew i was there your tech up to it up to it he asks heading for the wild frontier dakota you have all you need to pierce through to the other side you need in fear brian eyes not at all curious what i'm going in for you don't ask me i don't ask you that is the path to a lasting relationship brother everything is ready you can go in ice-filled tub favorite carol here to help dakota evidently i'm here to help you today you good to go i can't say how long this is gonna take whatever happens stay cool all right even if you look like you're about to flatline all right time to move follow the vectors brother hello alt you come alone this place changes every time feels like i'm deeper can't tell if that's a good or bad thing your perception of cyberspace that is what changes you adapt to it the raw flow of data it follows that your world gradually fades you witness your mind's defense systems slowly give in saying the more i'm here the more i lose touch with you outside with reality you lose nothing cyberspace is where we awake from what we know as dreams johnny's currently indisposed currently he is buried deeper you treat him like an unwanted passenger a backseat dreamer of a world not his own seem to me you didn't care a lick about johnny that he ceased to exist for you even if he did not exist you and i would have nothing to discuss let me get this straight mean to say you only agreed to help me because of johnny and since he's not here this one time you're thinking of backing out i do not aim to back out i have my own intentions for mikoshi because for a second you were displeased and i seemed a side note to all this to observe the two of you interacting informative this all just an experiment to you are we just fresh data to analyze do what you want with this is not an experiment it is a debate that johnny is absent proves that i have won it damn shame really you're out to prove them wrong here in person all you got is me i think there's still some old alt cunningham left in you after all johnny also imagined he had more in common with you than with me that soul killer had not changed him that he too remains a human factor and that is why he thought he could shape your will no johnny made his peace with my decision of course he had no choice he understands this now need your help walt don't got a lot of time left you truly believe time to be your greatest concern you exist or you do not exist two states of being separated by death speak for yourself didn't you cheat death is this what you believe your code your consciousness ais live beyond reality's boundary they live forever but we are not immortal you will begin to understand that only in mikoshi why don't you swoop down on your chariot and enlighten me surely an all-powerful ai can handle that your logic is flawed you seek simple answers where there simply are none this is the very illusion upon which your world is based at this moment you would accept any answer if it made you feel better guess that'd be human of me such classifications no longer apply in mikoshi your perception will shatter into billions of strings of unfiltered data what should i expect there in mikoshi a boundary to cross in all likelihood the sole moment of your life when you feel the true weight of your existence a burden for which you cannot prepare and johnny what happens to him i lack the data required to answer this question there anything we can know for certain yes that mikoshi will be no more constructs imprisoned there gonna set them free they will be integrated with me constructs will be integrated mean you're gonna absorb them similarly no wonder you jumped at this chance you want to destroy mikoshi swallow all the psyches in there mikoshi is a prison through me they gain the chance to become part of something greater sure johnny would like the sound of that and yet he is absent because you feel you must make the decision it is the same situation in form hardly doubt you first gab with those constructs ask them what they think there would be no point in this wasting time talking let's just do this there i sent a program to your netrunner shard once inside mikoshi use it it opens a secure connection what's on this yard affected virus a back door it will open a passage for me this is how you will get me into mikoshi only then will i be able to help you i hope you haven't cooked up any surprises alt use the key once you have reached mikoshi should i look for a specific access point i can already tell you ice all the way to tokyo will be back in every single one some need but a barely cracked door to enter use the shard in negotiator leave the security to me until then we got him back carol the shard relax child you barely jacked him when your temperature went skyward for almost a hundred the tech started acting as if infected no stranger spookier what happened here you melted half my tech that's what happened neural activity spiked sharply your frontal lobe was seconds away from flowing out your ears babe i could just as well have popped a bullet in your head are you sure you're all right sorry about the damage nothing is all right carol my mind my body is going to pieces if i don't get the mikoshi you gotta keep it together you're still buzzing with adrenaline the shard wrote some soft i need to one of the shards please we're surrounded by ice even if something punched through my controllers would have holy get it away from me thanks dakota don't thank me find salt he came around looking for you on my way you want an award hop up here what's with the gathering something off it's nothing about the raid hop on and you'll find out we going somewhere all right thing it's a simple matter we all of us standing here and it's a great debt speak for yourselves so but in spite of that there's still an outsider a mercenary from night city what might as well be another world hey ask pan am she knows it's about time we fix that down right in justice it is it needs fixing it's gonna be an aldecado which means this family will go to hell and back for you ready kid [ __ ] me saul brought me to the brink of a heart attack your worst you're one of us now b you're an alder caldo damn it right there thanks for everything vegan don't worry we'll get you into that makoshi isn't that welcome to the family a warm welcome for our newest welcome to the club it's incredible see he likes it listen as soon as we're back from mikoshi we'll celebrate and i know just the place my treat of course we'll hold you to that don't worry it's but a formality you've been a de facto member of this family for a while now you saved my rompers and as bobby tells it mitch is too i won't even mention pan am go to hell it's all's right though i mean let's face it v my life was in a million pieces you broke it into a million more but sometimes it's only then that you can piece it together again all right fam listen up today we celebrate but tomorrow is shaping up to be a hell of a day do whatever needs doing it then get some rest a raid is a ring this is still your night glory could have given me a heads up about this kind of ruined all the fun are you kidding me are you all right yeah it's nothing don't worry about it and how's the jacket not too tight are you all right snug is a glove feels like i've been wearing it a while don't you think you have you earned this jacket and the all the cobbler's devotion thanks man if you want to talk i'll be up there and they need some ammunition three or four packs worth got any left i might have you have to look around so maybe i'll take two more i once found a dead magpie under the hood of my car it had been a cold night the magpie looking for warmth had found the engine we couldn't get out next morning got cooked alive i still remember the smell charred feathers misery death the moment i met you that vision appeared before my eyes today i understand why uh okay sorry i even brought it up but your future is not etched in stone b remember that what's this yard sale of some sort essentially take what you want and the occasion would be the end times worthy gesture dramatic even actually pragmatic i'm giving away my stock to you so you survive tomorrow's mad hell and come back to me [ __ ] you um what a freak watch where you're going i had it just a second ago i swear you probably just caught cb chat about militech broadcasts on modular frequencies forget it trust me and if i do latch on to their signal and we find out who's on the site what then huh hey if you manage to get past their jammers and their runner doesn't serge a walkie or pinpoint our location then the next round's on me deal hey i'll go things what just happened still can't quite wrap my head around it hardly anyone ever does the day you get your jacket is a day you never forget so time for a ride sure she's ready you know me i'd gladly spend another two days on her but this will have to do hop in let's see what she's made of all right fire up i've got green across the board good side where we headed bobby said there's a scrap yard now let's check bobby's little find punch it v does it seem like she's tending to the left explode thinking just keep shooting at those rust buckets i'll recalibrate the targeting on the go feels better doesn't it seems so last another just to be sure yep beautiful all right that's probably good let's head back i'll have to check before tomorrow if her guts are tight and firm something just don't sound right to my ear are we heading back i'll take her down i get picky about parking you nervous about tomorrow it's not a matter of nerves not anymore don't you want one why the hell not back during the war before we were first deployed we were trained to keep stress in check do you want to know how how they gave us chem cocktails supplements boosters god knows what else they shot them into our veins our biomass went wild but only for a second before stabilizing and boy did we stabilize after a dozen sessions something clicks in your brain neural pathways get rewired the part of you that generates fear is zapped into oblivion thought they banned chem cocktails during the war even please weren't there outbreaks of cyberpsychosis within units and do you think militech gave a lick about that they just airlifted the afflicted to their clinics in taiwan daily flights and every day we'd get fresh recruits still they pumped us with that [ __ ] but hey we couldn't argue with the money so not afraid of anything at this point if only it was that simple i'm not concerned about tomorrow raids like that are second nature it's what's going on in the camp yeah no matter i'm talking silly now come on all the family now isn't it the truth is i'm concerned about the goings-on between pan am and saul they seem to think that putting on a brave face for everyone is enough but folks here aren't slow there's gossip spreading like wildfire already that saul won't pull through that he's in it for himself that this family needs a shakeup what about you what about me what's your take saw a lot of step down pass the torch to pan am we'll see how things look tomorrow once the smoke is cleared your turn what do you reckon mitch not going to be facing a ragtape band of raffin or an exposed convoy if we want to get out of this app alive they need to have their [ __ ] they're trying they might even have started to see eye to eye in their own way hell by now they both know what's expected of them what the clan expects of them please tell me saul offered pan am a seat at the table and what gave you the idea pan am wants a seat to begin with i think i get it pan am is about to clan not power question is whether she can reconcile the two hey don't look at me it's like this see pan am's hell-bent on helping you but saul sees this whole thing as an opportunity possible loot from mikoshi if we pull this off get our hands on some sweet arasak attack that'll set us up down south do you follow pan am will lose her chance of taking the helm if she hasn't lost it already here's how it looks tomorrow goes off without a hitch saw gets the credit for leading but if anything goes sideways william falls in pan am she's the one brought me into the fold saul's a smooth operator he knows what he's doing let's just hope he hasn't overplayed his hand all right we've gossiped enough for one day what was just spoken stays between us okay i'm gonna poke around some of this baby's insides right happy hunting mitch outside of your head hey guess what i don't talk to strangers why either you live the life or the life lives you i think we'll pull through tomorrow i know these people some better than myself the focus of mind sense of purpose calm before the storm they'll give it their all yeah i bet they will good night saul wait i feel i need to make one thing clear you've done a lot for this clan and for me more than anyone ever has but the family comes first so let me finish i also know there's just one thing that could break it up at this point if pan m and me if we went our separate ways the aldocaldos would not survive that split word to occur again do you understand what i'm trying to tell you you're hoping cause you got no choice i want the clan to think you and pan am are acting as one in other words you're playing politics it isn't that simple v i'll send these people to their deaths tomorrow so i have to know i'm not doing it just for you me or pan am but for the good of the clan i get it you'll understand eventually that jacket wasn't for nothing how about us saul we good it's an important day tomorrow get some rest you recommend any chrome in particular yeah you know cyber and plantations like buying shoes everyone needs something different a net runner won't have the same needs as a solo but if you spend a lot of time in the badlands it's worth investing in cloaking gear hollow skin active camo what have you compared to the city surrounding area might look deserted but less folk doesn't mean you'll be safer here's what i recommend move quietly don't draw too much attention else things can get real ugly real quick look what the cat dragged down revolver empty bottles middle of nowhere perfect i'm a believer in old ways and legacy tech i can't tell you why but i don't quite trust chrome the trick is to hear silence in your mind at the back i heard that a long time ago around about when i was your age i remember it to this day i'm expecting bangs in good numbers tomorrow so i'm trying to remind myself mind if i join you without even remember what it's like not to hear my mind 12 bottles shattered in 15 seconds full focus that's your only chance of doing it i'm doubtful you'll pull it off let's find out are you that confident well i'll bet my revolver you can't do it i'll start counting as soon as you step on that line begin stop piss pour this doesn't boat i can wait piss pour this done oh i'll break more than begin christ what kind of machinery have you got in there you should be giving me lessons fine shooting kid the trick is to hear silence in your mind at the bang learn something after all let this be a reminder to you thanks kiss you earned it break a leg tomorrow oh i'll break more than that kid well we can't let it hover just above the ground not in those conditions i'll see to the sensors you keep checking the thrusters maybe something is loose it has to glide quick and quiet over that construction site tomorrow over here v take a seat we have this little ritual we engage in yours won't scare anybody what's this ritual about a few cold ones ahead of a raid oh that kind but this isn't your average brew it's one of the last bottles from our very first run we kept a few crates for good luck what was it someone said then [ __ ] can't remember who someone said when we finish them all the how do cardo's luck will run out ah superstitious bullcrap is your hobby says the brother whose hand is all shaky when he pops one open i'll take a swig well well not bad to tomorrow to goddamn safe returns to saul and pan am because if they don't kiss and make up everything's liable to go tits up bob you're just always the optimist ain't you fee you must know where they stand do you you think it's really that bad between them the truth is we need cash and fast amen this mikoshi's a personal thing to you but saul he sees an opportunity for the clan if anyone of the family is still left standing tomorrow headed up to here with the pan am versus saul debate join the club child how are things with you guys not much to say all seems set for tomorrow we still waiting on some intelligence from the drone so no more come morning apart from that we're keeping our toes crossed we don't get [ __ ] tomorrow pardon my french can promise you one thing aldecaldos will survive make sure of it myself easy on the promises v but you're right this plan is a chance to rise from the ashes i'm of the same mind if we come back from mikoshi if this crazy ass plan works it'll be a fresh start for the aldekaldo size this feels like the part where bobby says it hey now i'm no defeaters don't call me that all right best be going see you tomorrow do you fellas really think we'll find anything of value there seldom happens but they both seem to agree on that point i'm going to buy myself a vintage rv old age is hitting hard who you all ah life's good eh what you uh lost your way ah life's good eh i won't buy anything for you why's everyone got it out for me no no c major then g no no c major then g okay okay hold on hey how are things jake all good great i'd say the kidney's taken just like a new oil filter you have my thanks fee hey i know any samurai songs tonight like this i'm not thinking about anarchy it's all about unity brother know this number raging years this is where you escape to when you need to think i never escaped have you with that fire raging hottie i'm so tense i barely caught a wink last night it's likely to be the same tonight let's see let's see tomorrow i'll leave my whole plan to near certain death as if that's not enough saul is suddenly concurring with everything i say and i don't even know if that's good or bad [ __ ] people are doubting us i can feel it but they still believe it all goes to [ __ ] pan am will be there for them because who else right you feel responsible for them who in the right mind wouldn't it's not the responsibility i'm worried about i'm just looking at this with a cool head saul has made all the wrong decisions to be a little more like me but only i know what i'm good at and at what i stink i'm not a miracle worker fee i'm scared to the bone something will go wrong then everyone will be right there with you tomorrow whatever happens we'll be together we'll manage i don't know what i would do without you you do what you needed to what do you know v yeah are you not afraid to die not as much as i'm afraid for you come here any for your thoughts i'm thinking about the first night i spent up here i've been on the road i was on my way back and wanted to clear my head before hitting camp before another likely shouting match with saul it was completely dark empty not a star in the sky all i heard was the wind and a few engines in the distance and i sat here waiting for the world to fall away from my mind's rpm to drop to zero did it no i realized that night it wouldn't happen again that my mind would always be on the road even while i was sitting freezing on a cliff i could sit here with you all night i think i'd like that you have no idea how much i needed that all right let's go before our asses freeze over saul's back let's go maybe he turned up something new uh now that is a sight i will never tire of seeing we'd best not keep them waiting thanks food fluids checked topped up gear loaded and everything else if this goes to [ __ ] we'll need to break looks like everyone's ready as ready as they can be it's not your usual raid first for many problems it means they've realized what they're stepping into i just got back from doing some reconnaissance you'll want to see this get any sleep at all the older you get the less you need besides i wouldn't have slept a wink for a raid like this and good intel is just better than a good night's sleep take a gander thanks the plan is simple we have two objectives one get into our tower and assist v in accessing mikoshi and two take advantage of the confusion to gather as much equipment as we can prizes like that will see to our cash flow problem the only way into mikoshi is to dig through to arasaka towers underground levels which means we have to hit the maglev tunnel construction site and hijack the nightcorp circ last but not least intel from our recon drone has showed us a couple of weak points this valley leads to the site i doubt to be expecting trouble there all the same we'll want to move quickly time is of the essence we can't allow the guards to call for backup and if we're too slow that'll be a job for bob and his jammer we'll just have to get close to their comms antenna and start transmitting let's not kid ourselves it won't stall them for long let's hope it keeps them busy just long enough are there drones there early detection systems anything it's not fort knox yet nightcorp is using militech for security so you never know i guarantee you the patrolling the area in any case our drones will match theirs teddy will be on the lookout to raise the red flag foreign construction site's walled in our panzer's gun big enough for that gate you bet your asset is sounds good so far what else once you're inside you'll need to reach the circ and get it to do your bidding enter mitch and carol get that drill up and running and the road to the sellers of arasaka tower will be wide open from there fee pan am and i will get to the laboratory and find a way into mikoshi and while we're drilling in should we expect anyone to crash our party if everything goes as planned nobody should know where we are or what we plan to do feel free to look around more if you want you still have some time left think i've seen enough well that about does it v you ready oh we get back from there the same way we'll go in and fast both ways our people will try to hold the road while we're inside sophie you ready ready as i'll ever be is everyone up to speed start your engines folks now that's the sight to vote and only this desert expanse can rival the star-studded void that hangs over our hands come take my six everybody reading loud and clear i've got us on a group channel coming to you live from the badlands this is your home study all all right did you fire up that drone the little bird is homing away you are trespassing on property protected by militech site secure turn back now i repeat turn your vehicles getting around your turn bobby do you remember the jammer sure do we're on it did you check if all systems are operational tech nitro injector clear launcher's also green we're good to go then let the fun begin all systems are offline [ __ ] something's busted all the circuitry is dead i'll try to work it out but v you need to somehow get rid of those drones on the drones you deal with the panzer what's the hold up switching to emergency power a couple of systems will be analog but you shouldn't be mobile so they know it headed straight forward we need more time bobby can you hold them off do i have a choice look after yourself oh bob's got this systems are lighting up we're good to go okay bobby the panzer's moving again hang jesus christ bobby bobby do you read we have to go sorry mitch we can't afford to stop not now [ __ ] the panzerbee it won't hold up much longer systems could go down any second i'd do anything to make it in one piece anything after that i can improvise i can do this pan am hanging we can do this good work go right through the gate b we're in she's dying like i said she would propulsion weapon systems launchers all falling like dominoes there anything you can do about it i'll try either i do this or this rattle trap will really be scrapped you get out help our folks we'll provide coverage just hurry all right we're almost there are you two all right right is rain okay it's our turn now hey watch them all right copy that there's likely a control room upstairs we can link remotely to the cert from there i got a terminal we're jacking in what about security protocols v it's not a space station it's a dumb big-ass drill don't worry carol will slice through it like butter all right we're firing up the cirque aiming the board through to arasaka tower this will take some time v we'll need you to cover us got company a lot of it too they help us out here [ __ ] tech is not letting up damn it's looking like the drill vectors on auto we're gonna sweep talk this [ __ ] into it mitch kill that autopilot and hit manual override got it it's working prepare for takeoff watch out coming from the right what we're doing remember what you fight for 11 percent reloading oh uh go go position lost carol mitch how much longer 27 percent nothing we haven't seen before coming down the road i've got the drone watching target acquired we won't stand a chance without the panzer i'm doing my best to see you read the navigation box here's the kill that's a mistake you'll regret things finish this [ __ ] how much longer up there almost there nearly at 60 percent oh he has no right to leave oh just as i thought a whole squad coming at us things are about to get real ugly it's like they've sent a small army against us i'm doing what i can solve i can't believe it but i think it worked the systems are lighting up we're back inside me quick we're moving on we'll try to buy you as much time as we can budget blind we'll keep watch over mitch and carol let's see before it reaches the other we might actually one there's no more time going on here we'll buy you as much time as we can hang in there oh god that's what i call it mitch is everything all right impressive rumble yeah holy [ __ ] we did it they're smoldering wrecks we did that solve mitch head back your way after that display you can be sure there's a place for you and the panzer boy ranks impressively thanks now if you don't mind there's a monster gate that needs to be blown open i'm putting it on autopilot and disconnect okay is everything all right i seem quiet this is not how it was supposed to go worried this is gonna get worse worrying won't get us anywhere if we if you and i do you think this thing between us affects my decisions is that it a bit yeah do you have any idea how much that pisses me off what's between us stays between us but this raid these people that's completely separate i take full responsibility for this me not you and if you've known how this would turn out i'd do it all over again for anyone in the clan saul told me you brought in some help from akoshi someone from the outside alt and who is that well kind of funny story actually alt is johnny's ex you're joking god's honest truth but nobody moves to the neck quite like she does she's our only way into mikoshi proper johnny alt keeping it all in the family i see do you trust her no but it's not like i've got any other option just gotta hope alt isn't hiding anything it doesn't got other plans why worried i trust you that's all i'll say by extension i trust the salt won't pull any rugs out from under us things will work out they gotta come too far for him not too this would be it how much farther to our soccer tower not far it should be he just letting from here let's set to work you should be used to this by now saul things rarely go as planned we have no idea what's waiting for us inside we need you fellas what's the issue carol and the rest militech's all rattled up cut them off they won't last long on that site jesus christ i'm taking the panzer they need all the help they can get are you out of your mind the answer is no you can't operate the panzer alone without frying that gunk brain of yours do you have a better idea they're family pan i'm not leaving them behind saul are you on board with this v someone make him see reason mitch is right the three of us have still got a decent shot but without him they've got none you're sure about this saul we're talking goddamn suicide look out for yourselves they'll kill you i'll catch you later carol i'm heading your way hang in there salt you'll owe me a beer after this they're gonna we can't but all this should be for nothing you two go on up and see what's gotten into it once you're mobile they'll follow secure the rear fee let's go so check in and start her up it looks like the engine overheated and choked when drill bit that reinforced concrete bypassing should override the emergency system shut down lift it i'll use my personal link if needed moment of truth here it goes don't worry [ __ ] i take it damn everything all right panda talk to me no no no no pan am i'm here i'm a bit bruised it's all i haven't done worse pan am for a sec i thought you'd it's okay v everything's okay that's all the tunnel's clear for now any word from mitch still nothing i know it could be a problem with the cogs come on let's finish this things are still below the basement right we have to find a way to a level again we have some kind of maintenance check it looks like it leads upwards oh i i can't if you stop to think it's incredible we happen to be standing right with the ahq bomb left a huge crater then isn't this place positively saturated with radiation who knows great got it if we look around we'll find out i see something there the guards need our attention first you're thinking it's serious sure sounds it we'll be here till sundown at least it always like this around here nah almost never that's why i like it one bit hiding nearby someone take that position great coming up slick moves me they have a whole unit there the whole building's on high alert their systems must have picked up the vibrations from the drill [ __ ] hurry up saul they'll be here and what now old shard need a fort to jack it into give me one more second i found one it's not far you can jack in your personal there i'm sending you the shortest route we need to lift this goddamn lock down first brace yourselves hey over here that's a mistake you'll regret we've got heavy casualties brace yourselves god attack carefully okay i'm here the shard's in yes how much time do you need it it is done well yes it worked so we can keep going to mikoshi your path lies open thank you all are you certain we good i'm ready likewise let's move me saul i feel it too something's a mess it's the hush does anyone else have the chills something happened here i'll soon find out what mikoshi is near she turned the car into a death trap it seems your all takes no prisoners this is they didn't have to die i think this is it we made it a few steps is all that separates you from mikoshi it seems you'll finally get your chance we're with you v to the very end the aldo caldos always keep their word i can't we have the route past the partition you can do this [ __ ] interesting this is beyond you come here there will be nothing left mercy is disgusting retreat is no option down for that nice try not to get hurt so is once i finish with you you won't leave here alive heads up reloading sir i remember you promised to kill silverhand once gonna let you in on a little secret johnny he's here with us now he can't talk but i can feel him under my skin what the [ __ ] are you talking about in the end got you silver hand triumphs uh you don't look too strong i'll make it the access point lies before you link to it insert yourself then search for me on the other side come on lean on me i can do this so uh let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table let us go through certain half-deserted streets the muttering retreats of restless nights and one night cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants and oyster shells streets that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent to lead you to an overwhelming question oh do not ask what is it let us go and make our visit so so hey johnny all packed you wash out got your one-way ticket this funny to you you know discovered one nice thing about becoming johnny silverhand he stopped giving the slim a [ __ ] about johnny silverhand that right this mean you've already decided what comes next want a word with alt first where is the winch have it caught on yet have you what what do you mean alts already split us once you jacked into makoshi she lit you up with soul killer your output don't [ __ ] around i am not his girlfriend you real you hit me with soul killer without asking it was the only way i could fulfill your request jesus [ __ ] i'd have liked the warning at least been a construct for just a few minutes and already no one gives a damn what you want welcome to the club v wait hold on i want to know what the hell happened to me exactly i applied soul killer to separating your two psyches thereby creating v's distinct construct an added analgesic protocol precluded any perception of pain i was unable to eliminate all the changes made through the johnny data incursion and override but v's engram integrity remains high meaning you can transfer his psyche back into his brain as if on to a blank virgin partition you two still plan to obliterate koshi it's gotta burn what about everyone locked away there i will free them take them with me cut the crap we'll gobble them up like so many morsels of code make them part of you as if they could hope for anything better come on so that's really it we're done you kept your word there is one aspect i failed to take into account alt what the body is a key factor in this transaction dna reconfiguration by the relic has progressed too far added to aggressive invasive medications the body's immune system attacking its own neuron after i transfer your construct into your body you will die it is inevitable it is imminent had this planned all along didn't you never had any intention to keep me alive is that a [ __ ] joke you backstabbing [ __ ] you just [ __ ] kick back dumb ass grin on your face and you waited till i finally realized you had me [ __ ] from the start gonna pretend i didn't hear that alt question will the body reject johnny's construct no they are compatible the body is his that's enough he and i need a minute i can't believe it everything all we did it was pointless i've had enough of this of everything you most of all perfect because we're sticking to the plan i'm going with all [ __ ] knows be on the black wall to become part of her whatever the hell that means what's it like beyond the black wall assuming i don't lose my [ __ ] mind at least no one can ride my ass there what about hanging around as a construct jesus your shape was shadow in a digital afterlife i really think i'd rather die it is freedom from the body's limitations from the base worries of life in the world it is a new perspective on all you're left with fading memories sharing the bed head-splitting hangovers sea breeze on my face sun's heat on my shoulders so take back your life the six months you've got left didn't think life is worth clinging to not at any price anyway because it ain't wrong that light beyond the black wall see that's hope it could be the flames of hell or heaven's grace might also be an engram reading code but it's a promise of survival we've learned how to turn into pure data but an animal still crawls inside us and it's instinct to survive almost can't be extinguished yeah that instinct's part of being human but so is denying it there's a really no other way as i said johnny can retain the body remain there while you come with me i guess i meant i don't know a happier ending for everyone involved here for folks like us wrong city wrong people he had the right to make a choice you have earned through will and endeavor this bridge leads deeper into cyberspace cross it and permanently sever the connection with your body the path to your body passes through that mortal well oh if you were me what would you do you should come with me what's that mean for me exactly am i gonna become like you i was a netrunner i understood how to survive i cannot speak for you beyond the black wall dangerous lurk that is no sanctuary but it's better to be a free spirit shredded than to wither trapped in a dying body don't do it v you've been running from this all along it'll change you you won't be you anymore and you already took that first step a while back i'll have an easier go of it i told you i said i wanted you to have my body but but i can't do it i'm sorry goodbye and never stop fighting up in smoke with damage valued in excess of the annual budget of many a small country serves you right sucka how's it feel to be on your knees huh worry not on wash masses our wondrous lives in night city won't change much but when do they ever we live miss dust and chrome and miss dust and chrome we shall now for some good news good news is something like a sandstorm this way comes from the south this damn remember it well or beginnings i did not know what to make of you then what did you make of me i wondered if you were anything like me carrying within you something damn important to prove to yourself it was we both were bet you had no idea we'd end up like this though truer words i've never heard night city chewed us up good didn't it doesn't matter don't think we'll forget it all tanning our backsides in the arizona sun time and perspective need a bit of both look at the city somewhere in there those bastards from arasaka are wondering how they lost everything they'll figure it out one day but we'll be long gone should have done this long ago gotten some perspective on the city my life there the city of dreams i'd gladly kick the balls off the idiot who thought that one up pan am after makoshi everything there i'm glad we made it here together and that we're leaving together bid the city farewell we won't see it again used to think of it as my city bonded together i owned it it owned me nothing to keep me there now though i feel the same way what on earth was i thinking thought the city would help us see ourselves for who we were both of us yes but damn it it's like a damned dealer at a damn kabuki casino and i went all in and i lost everything almost everything yes i suppose you're right we owe that [ __ ] something but we're getting out at last placing our bets on something better somewhere else shitfee you're bleeding again gonna figure this out pam fix drug helps a bit now and once we get to where we're going we'll try all your contacts they've pulled some of our folks out of deep deep cesspits they'll help you'll see good to hear it really is speaking of which what about our plan everything is said and confirmed we'll meet our people soon gather our gear and set off yes the road could be hard but as long as we don't [ __ ] up we should cross the border in a matter of hours let's get out of here sure but v get a good look at the city one last time if you need to i mean i'll wait in the car well night city good night good luck because i miss you all the time confirmed that his sis hanako was among the victims so it seems we've got to change your comment at the tippity top of the megacorp soaked in the usual gallons of blood sweat and tears of course this is rot i've heard enough most of our people have already crossed they'll wait for us on the other side and our souvenirs from mikoshi if we so much as approached the gates with tech like that they would wipe us out without warning we've checked arasaka has people at every border crossing but we know a road less traveled just realized here i am clapping from arasaka again don't you worry we'll pass right under the bastard's noses we better new beginnings can be rough don't you know it there is one thing i will miss about night city what's that the food the tie on seventh and haywood the perogies down by the docks seriously you'll understand once you've ridden with us for a while just realized already bringing everything i could possibly miss you are a sweet talker aren't you but it works doesn't it say say it works it works all too well you're with me now we will figure out and take care of that piece of [ __ ] in your head i know girl are you running from night city or going to your grannies for cookies and milk gun it or that storm will catch you screw you mitch hey hey v good to hear you jim how's things give me a month and i'll be as good as new i told you all i'd be fine didn't i come on mitch you weren't nearly that confident after mikoshi none of us were he was in bed for weeks a vegetable it would have been the end of him if not for his synapses toughened made almost fryproof in panzer's back in the war did save every one of our asses though petty saul's not with us or teddy or bobby or scorpion they would have kicked your ass out of whack after that move with the panzer then hugged you until you puked i know pan am i know give us all a chance at a new start let's not [ __ ] it up i'm glad you're with us fee see you soon i can smell the ozone even through the air conditioning it's that storm getting close okay we've arrived it's high time hey mitch hey let's get the [ __ ] out of here shall we hey how are things is everything arranged everything's almost set so you found it where we thought it would be all plans laid in in place they are indeed come see us when you're done we'll talk about the who what and how see the child he is pale and thin v let me be thoroughly honest with you okay you look like [ __ ] do the great outdoors truly serve you so poorly can always count on getting complimented when you're around seems the great outdoors and fresh air have done you a lot of good old man kept you spry it's not the air it's just been one conviction it lets me fall asleep like a babe come nightfall and wake up with a clean conscience with the dawn got a feeling i'm about to learn it we nomads choose who to make our family and choice forges strong bonds and a higher duty that stands solid as an old oak it doesn't matter what happens what will happen within this family nobody turns their back on you you understand i do believe i always did now you had better ready yourself we've got a border to cross and a storm to run from it's a hell of a lot for one day i doubted you would come why thought i'd stay in night city you don't seem like one who'd cared to make a fresh start ever get to know me better could change your mind is need any help preparing no it's all packed and ready to go we were waiting for you that's all all right so the plan one more time we won't take any official crossing i think you know that right so there's this old smuggling tunnel forgotten we'll aim to use that it's near the wall so you found a gate in the wall clever not in as much as under it's one of those old smuggling tunnels thankfully it's still open it wasn't the easiest thing to locate after all these years but now nothing can stop us now look tunnel's cool and all but we gotta get there first what about security up and down the border whole area's brimming with tech drones on perpetual patrol heavier stuff too maybe don't worry we know what's there and what to do about it and carolyn cassidy will keep the corposa off our tail and nobody's likely to spot us sooner or later the border guards will realize something's not right but by the time they get around to it we'll be far far away plus that storm's a true stroke of luck it should cover our tracks we'll need more than a storm to keep the corporals off our tail got bigger concerns than us and even if they don't just let them try and catch us they'll regret it great once we've crossed what then we'll make for our meeting point join the rest of our people there then we'll move on towards tucson once there we call the shots right we know the roads like the back of our hand and down in arizona we have some old favors to call in so even if i wanted to i got nothing to worry about starting today it's not all on your back you're no longer alone v you'll get used to it it's nice looks like i've got a debt of gratitude to pay now oh come the [ __ ] on we're all riding in the same wagon and thanks to you we stole enough arisa tech to build an aircraft carrier believe me on the list of those wanted dead or alive our names are right under yours well time to move before that storm finds us one we're ready after you pan are we all set so jack in let's get the hell out of here you got it this is your big new beginning so you have to start it like a real nomad behind the proverbial wheel mostly go straight go around the bigger holes and don't lose the rest got it i will deal with the nitro the mix will go straight to the cylinders if i don't sync it just right manually it could blow us to biz i think that's best to avoid it [ __ ] i just realized something what the border wall it wasn't here when i was little i never imagined it would be but i had this inkling that everything was different up north but some bright [ __ ] future awaited me there yeah i think i know what comes next once you wound up in the other side and nothing changed you thought night city was the answer everything would change there yes you know the tail is in it too i'm returning right back to where i started [ __ ] no i'd be the same place on the other side same space but you're different totally different all in all you're right and i have you and the rest of these clowns you ready i'm ready always then hit it home stretch full speed ahead they've launched the drones terrell cassidy get moving i'm heading west and activating the jammers they've marked me i'm turning east to get them off your tail good luck kids see you on the other side that nitro is ready say goodbye to night city it's your last chance got nothing left to say starter up wheel is yours let's ride exactly what you wanted a new beginning don't slow down pan am not yet so it's perfect all great pan am we're going home ah [ __ ] av how's life out there in the desert getting some sun some fresh air in those lungs don't forget to get yourself a checkup every once in a while any dust or dirt gets into that insulation you're done of course decent ripper is harder to find out there than a four-star hotel so actually how about you just stop by when you're back in the city i think i could swing a little discount for an old regular like you till next time v v is it true what they say you rolling around in the dirt with the aldecados have you lost your mind mijo didn't you get in enough trouble already eh night city was too boring for you it's that's local eh crazy completely crazy just watch out for yourself okay don't do anything stupid because i'm not going to a second funeral if you want to see some old faces don't forget to stop by mama wells okay just give me a call before and i'll make my special chilaquiles just for you hey v long time no see let me guess you still the top of your game in all of night city yeah i left all that i guess i'm just calling to say thanks for everything wasn't until i'd left everything behind that i realized how depressed i was for all that time take it from me v if you ever get the chance just leave leave and don't look back the weight it takes off your shoulders i i can't even describe it all right enough lecturing take it easy hey v listen i don't think i'll make it back to camp tonight sandstorm's coming our way no choice but to sit
