[Music] hey the trees overrun with mistletoe when did that happen now let the sighing of the branches soothe me and may all thoughts of chaos fade ah hurry we are nearly there peace frick it will do us no good to arrive at our enemy's doorstep exhausted suitor has our son fair balder fall into treachery does that mean anything to you it does suta will pay a heavy price for it we do not serve our

slept you were warming your wife's bed while i nurtured your son you were only too keen to send him to my care and freyas when the call of adventure became too great to resist now dampen your heart fire captivity may be there's nothing in the nine realms that can harm belter there is one thing pick up your heels balder was mighty to be captured by force i sense loki's hand in this as you are

we have brought each other pain harvey look burnt their corpses left us food for the crows a dark omen indeed come there is no time to waste on the dead [Music] we should have done more we should have rallied the whole of asgard when the mushrooms invaded smart helping and you should never have let our son come here he sought to prevent this war was that not a worthy goal as for asgard the builder's treachery was still fresh we needed to rebuild honor our debt there was little appetite for further conflict i recall you said the same when sutured invaded alfeng now the elves are no more now you dredge up ancient history you should have intervened lord of asgard then and now instead suta has grown too bold and our sun may be the cost of it do not say so freak we'll find him yet what have they done the city lies in ruins this is worse than i thought i've put this land to flame and sword boulder he is nearby javi i feel it you feel it the bond of mother and child something you will

bulker's wisdom [Music] mistletoe nothing more until i see you next [Music] [Music] the air hangs heavy around you avor you are troubled i had another dream a vision like the last there's one full of fire tell me i saw the god balder broken and beaten held captive by his suitor i i tried to save him but i was defeated and left to die in a pit of corpses when i awoke i found this in the fold of my clothing balder also dropped off his own death this tale i know afterwards his mother freak visited everything living or dead and had them swear not to harm him but he overlooked the mistletopus and so fate had its way not all visions are premonitions abor but all hide wisdom if we have the wit to see it drink this if you would know more then go to the sacred circle behind my hut there is more mistletoe there lay the mistletoe around the circle light it and stand within we shall see what your dream has to teach you so the mistletoe is in place ready for burning oh what is the meaning of this is this some part of your ritual the flames draw ever closer ah welcome will you find me alive if you would reach your dreams avon you must not run from the fire you must be coming [Music] [Music] [Music] are you well huffy's not well a passing weakness is nothing we should continue are you sure we could rest a while they kidnapped my son murdered his mother i will not rest till i repay these wrongs ah forgive me you lifted me from that fly-blown hell set me on my feet again you do not deserve my rage and you do not belong among the dead not yet now come on your gift awaits still have not told me the nature of this gift nor why you offer it it's nature you will know soon enough as to why will you have seen the suffering the musicals brought to svartage fire and ruin and slaughter they may waste land of our green meadows and enslave those they didn't kill they keep your people as slaves i sorter works them for some dark purpose of his own what that is we don't yet know we can't fight them harvey our people are broken forced into hiding but now the tides of fate have washed the lord of asgard to our shores i'm not your savior i mean only to find my son and return him rid us of stooge and you might save us nonetheless it is look upon the splendor of our [ __ ] hubby a sight to stir a cow on heart and all the nine worlds the crafters of swat half fame have no equal moose spell oh hammer and tongs they're here they're looking for the gift this dog dares to steal a gift intended for me javi you have to stop them with pleasure keep back i will deal with this well done javi we should search around here hopefully with better luck than that it must be around here somewhere what are we looking for i see nothing but stone there should be a hidden catch it's somewhere right about here take it lord of asgard put it on from the dwarves of sparta pain to you this is the mighty gift indeed told you they'd like it with this bracer you can draw out the essence of fallen foes steal their powers and make them your own try it now on that moose smell you killed i feel it fire charges my blood i but you'll need more of it before you can take on their powers let's keep moving let's keep moving it's the essier sound the alarm here [Music] spawn of asgard flame and ash a powerful incentive to kill the enemies of the dwarves aye it's almost as if we've planned it or something where this one was well there'll be others let them come i have death in the fall the brazer grows weak i must find a way to revitalize it i must remember to draw new strength from the world around me what other gifts might this bracelet grant be the other side was bad are you there open the door they're taking too long oh what if the spells got them dude drop your fretting i knew you can do it hi sure never doubted for an instant javi your braces magic will run dry if you do not replenish it look around see if there's something here that will help you to do so we must hurry if the enemy found these hidden halls they can find the shelter shelter a sanctuary a secret hideaway only the dwarves know when the invasion began our people took refuge in such places but the threat of discovery means we're always on the moon holstein and i left our own shelter in search of resources and we returned everyone was gone leaving nothing but a secret sign to show us how to follow that shelter is somewhere nearby we'd better find our companions before the moose fell obstacle there's the door these flowers are useful those flowers like the shrine they call out to the bracer though oh it's gone that block of stone is closer we could make the jump the musical's in the fire sludge it's everywhere i will move that block nearer and make it across thanks hobby i knew you wouldn't let us down i never will you saved my life not so long ago then i shall use this new trick to my advantage i will and then give them a big nasty surprise let's be on our way i thought i heard the mewing of an ass here kitten my husband should have stamped on you when he had the chance but mercy is no flaw of mine i will see red vengeance on all of you for what you have done and i will enjoy watching you fail you should have skated i scored uh ugh you fight well better than your woman at least come at me then let's finish this oh i'll be back i will hunt you to the far corners of the nine worlds treasure every moment javi for death is at your heels and you know not the hour it will find you damn you to hell you beat cinema i never dreamed i'd see it fate has truly sent us a hero fate bends to my will now show me to the shelter of yours the fine they left us spoke of a hidden power look around in the woods that will set us on our way [Music] that symbol a dwarf mark he points the way to the shelter let's examine the map for any clues see here javi this is a map of sparta you can see the shelter should be nearby there are other shelters too we only have a rough idea of their locations but when you get close you'll see the signs [Music] i can't wait to see that faces when we arrive and his dirty beard bimba still owes me 20 silver from losing at cards bet he thought he'd got away with it too remind me never to play you in cards huh the day you part with a coin is the day the sky falls down another we must be getting close there's a hard part to walk well hidden has to be or else the musicals would find it but day by day they're learning to read the signs and once that happens no dwarf will ever be safe again where is the next sign it should be here hidden perhaps let's look around good work let's be on our way then we are getting closer are you sure about that yes we should go left after the next sign no no and certain it's to the right you are mistaken as usual follow my lead [Music] hmm might be i took a wrong turn i told you didn't i let's haste more care let's retrace our steps [Music] yes yes this is the right path the sons of ivaldi have steered us true i see it now have a little faith house thing i know what i'm doing hal stain oh shut your face who are these sons of evil that you mentioned evilde is a name well known to me but he never spoke of children yes he was your slave once wasn't he hosting oh sorry perhaps slave wasn't the right word uh your freedom deficient associate the sons of ivaldi are those who follow eve aldi's teachings we're not all male either though you can be sure whoever came up with the name was evaldi learned much from the essio during his time in asgard not least the value of being prepared for unexpected attack after his return we set up a network of shelters bolt holes in case of disaster it's thanks to us there are any dwarves left free at all if freedom's what you can call it speaking of which first order of business is to find the chief and warn him about those spells else there'll be no one left for us to protect [Music] and call me enough you found us and with all those spells on our doorstep you know about the moose bells wouldn't be much of a chief if i didn't hope you didn't wear yourself out coming out to warn us actually we kind of did and who's this you've got with you i'm harvey called wolfsbane ravenguard the high one of asgard that right they call me brood our scratcher snot snorter he of the crusty toe javi is here because we have an enemy in common surtr has taken his son captive he fought sinmura to a standstill i saw it any enemy of that oversized stack of heart sweepings is a friend of mine come inside you two get some rest wait heavy before you go i have another gift we would not have made it here without you no i without you my friends i'd say we're even take this all the same it's silica bring it to a blacksmith and they will put it to good use on your behalf thank you secret and you helstain may our paths cross again soon you must have done something right that stuff's rarer than hen's teeth these days the muscles i they seized the minds and now they guard him carefully bunch of overly flammable bastards still if you ever need more you're welcome to slaughter your way to one of their stockpiles my sign is in sutras clutches i have no time for diversions might be you change your mind once you see it put to use let me show you our blacksmith salutations gene who's your friend here they've got too many names to remember all you need to know is they've got silica and the bracer of such craftsmanship as makes my hammer arm weak with empty that's a fine thing indeed but maybe not so fine that it can't be enhanced somewhat any half piece of blacksmith should be able to help you improve it assuming you have the right materials of course others here will be glide of a stranger silver look around the while if you like you know my purpose i have no time to tarry here he asks for death who goes to battle unprepared i'll see you at the entrance when you're ready back again so soon it seems but a moment since i saw you last it is said by your kind that time passes swiftly to the beat of hammer on anvil i and those who say it have never lifted a hammer in their lives how can i serve how came you to this place did you flee here when the invasion began i know i was here already studying where the refugees started coming in what is there to study here calico porphyry serpentine banded nice bretchy obsidian silica gold oh friend there is beauty in the earth here in this secret place we gathered all we knew of the thousand facets of emir from whose body sprang all creation i dreamed of learning fantastical techniques of crafting armor with materials never before attempted but that dream has died i suppose along with so many others sachi's fate [Music] any other way i can help puppy oh what in the nine worlds is that terrible stench oh that it's me have you considered taking a bath you smell like someone vomited on a week old carcass and then shat on it afterwards no bath will cleanse the stench of shame are you here to trade or to add to my misery tell me of your shame i was a warrior once head of the militia charged with keeping law in our village then the muslims came my people looked to me to lead the defense to give time for the others to escape but when i saw him you ran i hid in the village cesspit how long i lingered in that unspeakable filth i'll never know but when i emerged it was all over none survived that day none but me so i put away my axe forever and tried to make myself useful down here but though i strap my skin raw the smell of that split never leaves me the mark of my cowardice my curse forgive me i cannot stay here any longer you know you ain't the first stranger to come around here a while back our scouts saw a u-turn creeping about name of hurricane hurricane no doubt she flees the wrath of sutunga and gun luther hers was not a name i expected to hear in this place her presence here may be an ill omen or it might mean nothing at all you as guardians like to be fake don't you walk with me now let's have some straight talk one thing puzzles you cower in these holes like rabbits why not fight back we fought at first fought hard but they hid our leaders scattered us once they divided us we were done then join together raise your axes and throw them off not simply look we don't even know where the others are the shelters were planned so that if one of us was caught we couldn't give them all away but you could find them i'd wager my business is the suitor and rescuing my son you might have noticed that suitor can't be killed could be a problem i'll find a way or else i will seize what he values most and trade it for father's freedom either way you'll need our aid you don't know an inch of this land listen harvey i understand this isn't your war you just want your son back but those more spells on our doorstep they ain't no joke if they find us we're dead meat thing about moose spells though is they love to fight amongst themselves all that's stopping them is fear of slutter take out their leader they'll tear themselves apart flee back to muslim most likely the swat el fame will once again belong to the dwarfs dwarves who will be very very grateful to the one who delivered them there's more gifts where that racer came from i make you no promise i will seek out your shelters perhaps there i will find the means to save baldur good enough for now [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to smarthealthy [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] gods here are legit uh hey what died [Music] huh uh uh [Music] uh uh [Music] this gemstone might be important ah hmm oh thank you let's end my this [Music] ugh you there [Music] uh here you die now what dark spirits torment this land [Music] [Music] uh uh uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] malevolence this land bears deep affliction [Music] huh damn troll magic will then the curses holding here uh this shelter must be nearby what are they looking at there must be something keep it under oh warm and markings if i follow they will lead me to a shelter i wonder what this nonsense means a bone or a riddle this points the way to a dwarf shelter the dwarves hide their paths in plain sight this points the way to a dwarf shelter there's a shelter not far from here ah dead end these dwarves are cunning indeed a dwarven moon a dead end ever since uh [Music] i must be on the right track there's a shelter not far from here good woven roon he has a child's innocence my boy i pray as it's still after all of this these dwarves and i need them it chases me to admit it gracious heavy humble and patient the dwarves hide their paths in plain this wave will take me to the dwarves uh oh i'm working so hard that even my calluses have blisters please ah an outsider tell me stranger have you seen any heaps of dwarven bodies piled high moose spells reeving the land ruined villages well there have been as a thought the invasion is nothing but a fiction dreamed up by our rich masters so they can add to their wealth well two can play at that game many rare gems lie unguarded while we hide underground bring them to me and i will see you well-rewarded you do not believe there has been an innovation control your ass here it's all about control if you aren't a shepherd you're a sheep but you could simply go outside and see for yourself i don't need to it's already plain as day oh tell me you've fallen for it too the moose smells i've slain were no lie and i've seen more dead dwarfs than i can count oh no yeah you're one of them aren't you spare me your falsehood serpent tongue the truth cannot be denied [Music] you are always [Music] songs of my deeds follow me my enemies do not well if you're sure not many know this place not even the other dwarves that's how we'd like to keep it you price your secrecy here even more than other dwarves i've met well of course they'd only just discovered this place when the invasion began those of us nearby were herded in quick best thing we can do now is to keep our heads down don't need strangers going in and out bringing who knows what to our door i am no friend to muscle oyoton glad to hear it see that it stays that way anything else speak up enough of this here comes another one no don't worry i'll be careful this time yes no need to remind me now it was only a little blood who are you talking to shh i'm speaking to no one good sir take a seat let me get my needles and blades you spoke of voices when none are to be heard are you moon touched voices the very idea that crystals can talk and that they would be speaking to me it is you who is mad for even suggesting it i made no mention of crystals that's because they don't talk to you you're not special i think you've been down here a very long time what have you got for me today i might just try elsewhere if only king raymar was still alive they wouldn't be stuck down here who goes there i am harvey lord of asgard you you're a long way from home or the ass you're now invading us as well jailer avivaldi evaldi owes me his freedom where is he i would speak with him be my guest i assume you know the way to hellheim he's he's dead oh how else or do you need both eyes to see the moose spells everywhere that was uncalled for leader of this shelter or what remains of it now ivaldi is gone he was trying to make contact with the other shelters there was an ambush glods soldiers and something else something worse a creature of fire and fury perhaps loki's aid before i could make him my captive you and your captives regardless uldar fell soon after eval did it our minds and miners any survivors now serve colot is that name meant to mean anything to me global suitor's bastard son hath must spell half yutan a nightmarish being capable of tearing a dwarf in two your people will have vengeance no the people of uldar are finished and yet god has not simply slaughtered you people he needs your miners to what end the invaders hunger for secrets buried deep in the ground ancient relics the moose spells place great importance in them and how do you know this enough javi we have suffered enough now i must endure all these questions aid me with your knowledge and i shall strike a blow against glad and all muscles in uldar we had someone gathering information for us the miner frithiover he's been silent for days now we're just unlike him probably dead for all i know anything sought by the moose belt must be mine where was fritzio the last scene perhaps i can find him there is a house in uldar its owners killed by muspells long ago there we would exchange messages with him this house how do i find it it's the tallest house in the jewelers district by the city southgate just look for the gold in the streets you'll see faithful may be the key to obtaining these relics sutra seeks i must find him do as you must lord of asgard i have too many burdens of my own to worry about yours as well is it lunchtime already no probably not man so evan is dead a pity but ulda may yet reveal something of value that i can trade for boulder or use against suitor loki and i we brought balder here once too although when he was just a boy now both are captives loki deservingly by my hand and boulder by suitors will be saved and his mother avenged i should be cautious uh keep the dog my [Music] wow oh [Music] always have been too busy squabbling over their minds i'd wager they put up no real fight against the invaders have you seen it is he still inside leave us alone i remember this was a lively city once a place of great happiness [Music] you will be incinerated don't bite they're going to feed the world uh so so be my eyes gold in the streets the house i seek should be close this is where gunwork told me to look i once saw a bluff crush an ogre's skull like it was a raw egg [Music] oh oh ah your blood giants [Music] maggot [Music] ah ugh oh so much gold strewn about what happened here someone was beaten tortured perhaps then dragged along the ground here generally for every occasion this building surely played host to important moments in the lives of many look at it now [Music] flee the over rights of holding cells within aldor therefore wolves who disobey may yet live like this tira he mentions [Music] the artisans who once worked here their life's work how trippy all these trinkets must seem now given all that has happened huh what do we have here the sons of ivaldi tried to warn frisjova of increased muscle activity in ulda i wonder did he get to see this message this place was used to exchange messages but fridhiova was careless the spells found out ambushed him and took him from here to the holding cells then i need to get into the smelting foundry show me these relics suit our sikhs i'll cease them for myself and use them to party for baldur's life or to end suitors [Music] everybody feels cold uh [Music] you please spread out [Music] yeah i can feel this melting foundry's heat see why the spells keep prisoners here roast the whole part of them poor bastards i think the dwarfs this is their future and for them cannot come soon enough i however forge my own destiny shut your mouth wretch what do you want to bake in the cells [Music] i'm looking for freedom they they took him below we are safe thank you but do you have water no now which of you is with you no i am and i do not care you are you physio i don't know any frizzy over is just stay behind me and keep quiet hold your tongue triage okay quietly stay close uh okay i'm lord of asgard hides from no one you don't die meet up we work together stay with me oh oh ah oh now to find frieza which way hey where do you lead me tira tita a good name like a tear of asgard which is sauna never mind we should hurry we're now to fit yoga frankly i'm surprised you could even see this mighty galleon from up there across the money in any case i don't suppose we can simply sail all the way to free the over don't say anything too noteworthy as a good lass let us find this relic with your van yes yes him too lead on so i see them keep out of the way yeah i'm telling you i was there glod grabbed the poor fool's head and crushed it in front of us all i got you come we must not delay further take me to free the other i forgot that enough of these fragments i wonder what a decent blacksmith can do with them what language you speak you're not from here are you oh green clever petrol vapor well take the hell of a time to visit smart hill fame well you picked a hell of a time to visit svatel fame that's for sure where do you lead me [Music] over rodriguez that isn't very well the sons of evaldi were active here but no longer i suppose no they were not of much use to you or free your [Music] no they were not of much use to you i'll free your or your aldi for that matter let's go truly i regret letting svatar fame fall to sutra and i've been more vigilant perhaps balder would have never fallen into his clutches boulder my son as kind as he is which way is it [ __ ] that's what i get for trusting a dwarf there must be a clue here the road heads west and has fresh tracks from a cart clearly in regular use this main road continues north away from uther a road like this surely leads to another city oh gosh i voted and i'm holding there must be another way to be sure look around tyra what is this lettering intentionally damaged and written in a script i cannot read tyra can you make sense of that yeah yeah freddie fritz terra i find you impressive tyra they unless a dwarf would only be interested in saving their own skin yet here you are on this journey determined when we get to our destination be sure to stay out of harm's way yes wolves why did it have to be wolves [Music] [Applause] i will do what must be done the relic is what i seek for now freaky over is no more than a stepping stone uh best not to draw attention here so aid me be my eyes

free from the ground there was a blast of bright white light and that was the last thing i saw that's not what i asked what does it do other than blind unsuspecting dwarves dunno moosebulls didn't seem sure either hence taking it to that bastard scholar up in the palace this palace i must spell stronghold i take it you're a sharp one evaldi was commissioned there long ago aynar's there now

a simpler life one that has been denied to me thanks to loki not to mention my own occasional foolishness only one thing watches over this tiny village that's that you [Applause] so nothing but whatever stone was here has been carefully removed no scratches no scorches so it was not taken by muscle hands let's see you old friend when i was a child my brothers and i would rob the fairies
