twice up all persons on the premises must at all times carry valid identification and be prepared to present it to albion personnel upon demand failure to comply with instructions from albion personnel got bagley summons i've already taken care of your entry get you in quick and quiet you're not like actually putting me in their system right that's a hassle that i do not need no worries i'll spoof well come meet me on the rooftop the only place here that doesn't smell like piss got some info for you the european processing center it processes deportees by stacking them up in squalid conditions and forgetting about them but hey is to protect london right what is going on here this place is worse than our prison camp every day i see people come through here fun from their homes and their families but i'd rather stay and keep our eye on things maybe how about once in a while like now so this is what this country does to people with wrong stamps on their passports cool so cool so glad that i live here yeah well people have been disappearing records say they have been processed but it doesn't add up no one ever properly leaves and with the kelly's prowling around like [ __ ] hyenas i am not too optimistic about the people slipping through the cracks oh cool now we're [ __ ] with mary kelly i was just thinking how i'd love to get my balls cut off truth now about your missing guy the best place to start would be the epc database they keep a record of everyone that comes in and be careful pushing the location of the epc database on your optic what is going on i'm on your side here just relax listen to me there will be a database here that we can search for evidence on angel lopez oh ah [Music] ah don't fall in a hole wait [Music] uh [Music] so oh [Music] what oh locking that spider bot [Music] calling for a search someone hacked that bot nothing here area clear moving on let's keep looking [ __ ] that's going to be hard to explain so ah [Music] um ah go on buddy tell me you found something i have his file has been deleted from the main database along with hundreds of others still very detailed even when committing crimes against humanity the government doesn't skimp on paperwork here is a recording labeled exit interview you know what we do with terrorists lopez ah don't go pissing me off by denying anything we know you're with dead sick you think you were picked up on some random sweep not a [ __ ] chance nothing to say well this is not going to go well for you then because i want information the rest of your cell where are they i want names places everything you've got you think i'm daft i spill everything i know and what you let me go i'm not talking about you know how this ends oh i don't think you do i'm going to throw you to the wolves the kellys have an interesting way of disposing with problems do you think i'm scared of some [ __ ] thugs i'm winding up floating in the dance not too pretty for that mate first they'll peddle you for dosh right then when you're used up they're going to chop you up and send the pieces to the four corners i can take whatever you've got i almost feel sorry for you get him to the bloody clinic then [ __ ] they knew he was dead sex the whole time this doesn't look good for angel the clinic keeps government service hours which means it's closed we'll have to find angel the old-fashioned way and hack their ctos hub deportation limbo horrible living conditions unexplained disappearances it's almost as if the media are deliberately ignoring the situation here in favor of oh look here beatrice stokely 89 recently took up kickboxing to fill up a daze fascinating if the epc is a typical example of how humans treat each other i'd say a benevolent ai overlord is a step up wouldn't you is now the time badly [Music] i have reconstructed an ar scene of angel's examination you can view it inside the clinic yes smashed it so help out don't put me out of here procedures mr lopez we'll have you out of here in a minute or two [ __ ] what was that looks like they put something in him let's get a closer look facial analysis matches for both they're part of mary kelly's little pack so inspector lau was right after all clank kelly and albion are in bed together what a [ __ ] that would be microchips coated with biocompatible glass to prevent rejection so they put a thingy in his neck is it for tracking or oh maybe it's the current steps no these are more sophisticated if i had to guess i would say they were designed to deliver a dose of some unknown compound not the kind of thing you find at your local corner shop i could reconstruct the path he took if you want to see how this clip hanger gets resolved keep on him he might run off i wonder if there's more to this thing [Music] [ __ ] he's getting away get after him [ __ ] they're catching up on him come on angel [ __ ] yes he's gonna make it get [ __ ] up we don't have a match yet she's gonna kill us nah it's fine as long as he's not damaged don't be no waste demands high with the new network yes you're right let's jump in get him in the van and out to the incinerator what the [ __ ] so i guess that neck thing wasn't just a tracking device looks like they triggered it i don't know what mary kelly's up to but at the risk of sounding too optimistic angel's alive we need to find him see what they did to him and what that [ __ ] microchip is all about seems like advanced technology for mary kelly and her band of thugs be waving around could mary be part of a scary dark web hacker group like say oh i don't know pick one zero day interesting theory bagley but hold your investigation algorithms for the moment will you angel needs us the incinerator they mentioned is probably the southern incinerator it's practically right around the corner um um oh so this is where clan kelly brought angel how pleasant now now keep your chin up we'll find him there's a camera network that might have caught where they took him human [ __ ] that thingy right lock it down [Music] let's hurry and access that network shall we i'm not seeing anyone [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh oh that's fine miss belland leave before i see you yeah this part's good let's keep [Music] ah no one here continuing search uh i've gone over the captured footage i was able to follow mr lopez down to the cellar but then i ran out of cameras not a problem you often have in london sounds like a plan to me fail the body oh [ __ ] my oh my deadbolt trumps technology the door is sealed but this rubbish suit might do it's either leads to the cellar or your grizzly death or both i suppose brilliant [Music] uh shut it down they [ __ ] off all right then come on out i'm not gonna cut you well get over here thanks for the distraction gave me the second i needed to take care of this filth are you okay looked like he was ready to carve off a slice he was i'm fine i just need a second to catch my breath and find my files hold on you're caitlin now you're a cop right a police inspector we found your video logs you've got bigger board than i do going after mary kelly on your own [ __ ] hell it wasn't always on my own who the hell are you're dead sick aren't you you tracked me to the starter house not really see a friend of ours disappeared from the epc and the trail led here but i guess we've solved the mystery right what [ __ ] depressing plot is this is then i'm sorry i don't think there's much hope for finding him alive the kellys have got a sick little operation going a kind of human organ black market i've been investigating them for months and they got my [ __ ] files gotta feel like [ __ ] you don't say look i'm gonna bail someone to come get you sleep off somewhere safe yeah in the meantime i'll find adrien and your fast sounds like they're important everything i've gathered on mary kelly almost enough to take her down hey we should work together on this mary kelly thing dead set and inspect allow crime smashers got a certain ring to it all right an operative is on their way to escort inspector lao so let's find angel and inspect allows files i'll wait for your guy in here um there's no doubt about it this whole operation is meant to harvest organs clan kelly's chopping off the parts they want and burning the leftovers something tells me mary kelly doesn't wait for these people to die of natural causes oh my god yuck their faces are all oh okay bags can you do anything with this take a picture and i can run key details past various databases negative this is evil just [ __ ] evil we need to take mary kenny down hard unfortunately i must confirm that this is indeed angel lopez [ __ ] angel he knew the risks i did too but never thought dedsec would get caught up in this mary kelly is preying on london's most vulnerable she's a [ __ ] monster taking her out needs to be a dead set priority now we need to find caitlyn lau's case files on mary kelly and see if my conjecture may be correct could mary kelly be in zero day well done you got the files the inspector will be impressed now get out of here before someone decides to turn you into minced meat chop chop yeah no kidding i wanted to thank you i'd be nothing but an anatomy lesson by now or a pile of ashes you'll be happy to know that inspector now has been escorted to a nearby refuge and is getting her wounds treated i'll be fine still a little flighty from whatever they gave me and frankly a little stunned that we've joined forces dedsec working with the police never thought that happened well you're not really in the police anymore but still we're in we won't let mary kelly put more people through this exactly you have an organization i have information and some backing from powerful people pool our resources and we might just take her down marry kelly's no petty criminal hey magazine we need to bring everyone in to figure out what to do with these files yeah i'll sync with inspector lao and prepare a briefing got a potential recruit for you i'll mark them on your map i've heard from inspector lao we're ready for the briefing mary kelly heads up the most powerful crime family in london clan kelly which should at least be easy to remember under her old man they were a bit player then he died and her rival started disappearing her enemies her friends her family they call her bloody mary for a reason early on mary abandoned cash in favor of cryptocurrency and brought the kelly's criminal business online it makes weapon smuggling drug running money laundering all a lot easier without a cash trail the woman single-handedly modernized organized crime in london she considers herself to be untouchable case in point from my files you retrieved darla covington 19 sasha haddad 28 radik stockkovic 24 all disappeared it's difficult to find good health these days isn't it love most people they ain't driven not like you because they feel worthless don't they the way that the world is how it uses people is horrible it's nice that you have a purpose oh that'll be me love if we aren't finished here this was a courtesy oh give my regards to their families it's horrible losing someone you love nice meeting you caitlyn as you can see she'll never respond to interrogation but there is one place she feels comfortable talking the sandstone residence inspector lau thinks a police bug in the kelly's headquarters may have the evidence she needs to finally convict bloody mary sandstone is their center of operations i know the data on that bug will take her down get it for me and i swear i'll put her away forever pushing the coordinates to your optics sabine here inspector lao i'm curious how you think you can bring mary kelly to justice now with no backing even before albion took over policing you couldn't lock her up and she goes on treating humans like cattle i had to work within the system yes it was corrupt i knew it i just didn't know how bad it was i thought a strong enough case couldn't be buried yeah and your childhood dog's living up on a farm up north well i can't figure out why you expect this time to be different because i'm taking it to a contact in the attorney general's office an honest solicitor with a hard-on for organized crime specifically for mary kelly look our methods may differ but i want to help those people as much as you do all right but however this goes down there's no way we're letting mary slip the net again that's not how deadsec does things let's get to sandstone [Music] ah [ __ ] out the combat drone is on me security here is state of the art quite impenetrable unless of course you flew a drone through the window one of mary's mouth breathers left open the recording device is in her security room getting there should be a simple matter of navigating the vents what the [ __ ] she's using these people as house servants against their will horrible in itself but a million times worse knowing they end up as unwilling organ donors do you know that please i need help [Laughter] [ __ ] idiot do you piss everyone off the way you're pissing me off wanker stupidness it let's see what kind of recording we've got on here just look at this place this is what comes of old crooked money the kelly family has been profiting from people's misery for a long time she's got this [ __ ] all over the manor so you've been in there before is that how you ended up in the basement of the southern incinerator we needed something incriminating so we decided someone had to get in here and plant a bug i wasn't going to assign someone else to do that who saw how mary uses the people she grabs out of the epc and the staff's uniform's not hard to mimic so i went in what i didn't know was that she had intel on our investigation my team i thought going off book would stop the leaks but she still knew we were coming she tortured me for the names of my team tried to break me but cops don't give up cops turned out she already knew the whole unit and put hits out on them the woman is a mind [ __ ] [ __ ] well at least you don't have a microchip in you [ __ ] knows she was dealing with you're never about to ear that's how i ended up on that butcher's table so many reasons to want to rid the world of her but it wouldn't be enough to just put one in her brain my mates died trying to bring her to justice i have to honor that teddy oh yeah look at this state of you what you've done to yourself after everything i've done for you you made me a slave all of us please let me go take this thing out back to your old life back to nothing back to you 2.5 screaming blighters in your dead-end job and sucking off the dull you don't want that love this microchip is scary i know but i got to keep tracks on my merchandise didn't i and this kitchen knife that won't do it love cutting yourself affects my bottom line i can't believe it like this anymore no you are right there it's all i sweetheart because i have another use for you oh paying attention all we're good be sure and spread the word you know where this one goes get these two and all the others over to their venue and ready for the sale right away ma'am also the foreign investors have already landed and the drones are programmed ready to deliver the invitations and the coordinates to all the guests um it's that initiative i'm smelling peter initiative can be a dangerous thing can be misinterpreted [ __ ] sake you
