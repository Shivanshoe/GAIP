before i'll stay here protect beta be careful help get back over here you [Music] hey lloyd get a hand over here drive away from veda boy i'm on this one stay back [Music] over here you next fight you two okay still breathing hey hephaestus can't escape but it must have fled deeper into the facility i'll drive it back here i'll get the cracked core fixed in the meantime keep her safe okay i gotta chase after hephaestus force it out of wherever it's hiding make it retreat to the core i can grab this from my stash later no you don't have festus i'll find another way over anyway i'm patched into your focus feet you should know there is a huge power draw coming to the next chamber thanks for the heads up i'm almost there it's some kind of production chamber first is up to something all right what kind of machine is it trying to build i don't know but i'm gonna shut it down i bet those metal carriers will lead me to where it's getting materials from here that's where looks like there are a couple of ways i could go well that doesn't sound good i've managed to rewire most of the components in the core but the energy processors cracked without a way to fabricate another there's no way i can fix it okay um let me think what this you bypass the processor connect it to the power load i think that could work i think it could just a little longer okay thanks i should deal with these machines first oh uh [Music] oh good [Music] hephaestus has locked me out of the node any ideas i'll see what i can do machine speeding up foreign oh ugh oh so nice thanks prepare uh well i better not get comfortable energy content to fail safes all right professors cover the floor with lightning i gotta find a way over it hey more machines keep coming please tell me you're getting close i'm working on it i've been smashing through a lot of machines on my side too i guess aaron's missing out anyway i'm making progress on the bypass but i need something to hold the cycling module together maybe a ligament from one of the machine carcasses right or some luminous braiding and you could reinforce it with a conversion cylinder for increased connectivity i can get into that chamber if i go over the shields all how old right the glacier oh ah [Music] stamina for that uh huh what's up i'll try to get your access back 0.5 oh ha ha shotgun what what [Music] you did the heavy lifting okay professor is running out of places to hide uh bayley i just registered a huge energy search back in the production chamber something big is happening here too everything's glowing machine if this just was building it must have finished it it's powerful whatever it is i'm almost done with the core repairs should we come to you maybe i could disrupt the machine if no beta just stay where you are okay handling the machine's my job okay be safe intruder [Music] stop some of its attacks finish charging it's covered in plasma maybe one of my potions yep had to drop the heavy weapon [Music] [Music] he's powering up oh okay oh [Music] it's done you did it there there should be one more note to override good stand by i'm sending hephaestus back to you no more hiding hephaestus make sure it stays there i'm heading back and then we can start the merch because of you beta i'm glad you came along and you laurel we couldn't have done any of this without you right back at you eloy hey lloyd the the bypass is done the core is stable festus is 100 contained now we better get started with the merge it's all set up gaia establish the link please [Music] okay to complete the merge we need to excise hephaestus's malicious code carefully [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] eli look [Music] well hello redundant copy you cost us quite a lot of time eric get beta and squash that bad [Music] oh get behind me come on quit screwing around now we're having fun [Music] right oh [Music] finally tilda get guy and hephaestus ready for transport tell them i failed hush all is not lost what the hell are you doing i can't even see her beta farley hmm where am i ah you're awake you took quite a hit when gerard attacked you i imagine you must still be in a great deal of pain i can assure you that we are safe the others can't detect us here you mean the other zenith you must be tilda i wasn't sure if beta would have told you about me where is she alive and while she isn't where she wants to be not in urgent danger we must discuss how to get her back of course after you've shaken off the cobwebs when you're ready take the stairs down the hall and come see me in the meantime i'll make breakfast breakfast okay [Music] [Applause] what is this just a few favorites from my collection rescued and stored here just before i went off world take a look if you like i'm curious to hear your impressions my friend is dead veda and gaia are gone and you want me to look at old paintings don't be so quick to dismiss the comfort we can find in art or the insight we might gain [Music] my favorite pairing on the left is a woman reading a letter by vermeer a true master and on the right is a forgery woman reading music which fooled experts into believing it was a priceless original early in my career i became fascinated with such deceptions eventually i developed scanning software that could detect fakes with unparalleled accuracy is that how you made enough money to buy your way on to the odyssey oh no i made my real fortune later celine and endymion she's the goddess of the moon whereas he's a simple shepherd beside her is the god of love cupid so she's sneaking up on him more like visiting him in secret the torch that cupid bears represents celine's undying infatuation with him though the two must remain apart her love will forever burn [Music] and why can't celine and endymion be together sleep took a vow of chastity promising to never take a lover so when she fell in love with endymion she could only visit him at night while he slept but then wouldn't she be breaking that though think of it as a forbidden love though circumstance keeps them apart still they find a way to come together however are in briefly and endymion cold perhaps we should move on to another piece why do you keep the forgery i've always enjoyed studying the two side by side both painters capture light color and perspective but what makes one a masterpiece and the other simply an imitation the forgery looks sharper eye the details are crisp the contrast bold it tells us more and yet we feel less what's in the letter who can say what does the painting tell you she's concerned whatever's written in the letter troubles her burden [Music] why go through so much effort to make a fake masterpiece the forger initially painted under his own name but found little success his work was considered unremarkable but when he took on the guise of vermeer suddenly it was celebrated as extraordinary but it was a lie and he knew it sometimes we struggle to clean what is real and imagined even within ourselves the irony of these two is that vermeer died in obscurity he had no idea his work would become some of the most precious most copied most preserved pieces in all history this is rembrandt painting jeremiah a man in warning morning what his home the ancient city of jerusalem he foresaw its impending doom but could do nothing to prevent it so instead he saved its treasures from destruction just as i saved these works you could say we're kindred spirits about jeremiah if he knew his home would be destroyed why didn't he save the people why save those relics he tried but no one would listen to his warning so he saved what he could but how did he know he was a prophet he saw an army invade and destroy the city in a vision so it's more like he calculated which side would win a battle what matters is that he was right in the end if not for him all those wonders would have been lost forever at least this way some part of his world survived you know what i like the most about this piece even though he's the sole survivor his home and ruins left with only the remnants of his world the light keeps the shadows at bay there's still hope precisely take as long as you like [Music] a portrait of the painter rembrandt's son titus depicted in the habit of a monk i don't get it why would someone like you with infinite resources care about this painting of [Music] a boy in a hood it's not the image itself but the feeling it conveys the face is bright and defined but his eyes are downcast heavy with misfortune and the background seems to swallow all light the painting is infused with a sense of loss i guess i understand how the painter feels works of art such as these can often cause us to look inwards at our own lives i'm sorry about your friend had i been able to intervene i would have but the risk of losing you as well was too great everything went by in a blur i couldn't get to him you know long before holograms and focus recordings people relied on art to memorialize their loved ones because of works like this painting their lives are immortalized rembrandt had four children by his wife all but titus died shortly after she gave birth to them she passed not long after that titus became the only family rembrandt had which is why he painted him this way indeed then tragedy struck again disease claimed titus at 26. it's almost as if rembrandt painted the future closing in on him rembrandt actually painted several portraits of titus but this one has always been my favorite it's honest what do you mean in others titus was portrayed in brighter livelier states but here rembrandt allows himself to express his true feelings sorrow fear hope love laid bare on campus for all time i see this one resonates deeply with you rembrandt's the night watch by far the most famous painting my homeland ever produced it was commissioned to honor a militia made up of influential citizens i guess you must have been an influential citizen in my day but not as influential as you've been in this new world the militia they look disorganized where others painted such scenes in a stiff and stationary manner rembrandt chose to show them in action preparing to march he wanted them to feel alive you can almost hear the commotion who's the girl in the painting she's a strange one isn't she bathed in light though no one is paying attention to her many believe she's a symbol of the militia [Music] a physical manifestation of their spirit if you will she's not real what's real in a painting she's meant to represent the militia's virtue and victory but i like to think they underestimate her she looks as if she's seen something what does she know what secrets does she keep there's so much detail to take it isn't there [Music] the gust by willem van de velde the most famous of his many maritime paintings a ship crossing into the unknown i guess you're familiar with that indeed which is why i appreciate this composition in particular though waves and wind threatened to destroy the ship it perseveres clinging to the light even as darkness closes in all around it where is the ship going to a faraway land most likely my ancestors used ships like these to explore the world sometimes at great cost what were they looking for anything i value they were traitors willing to face unknown dangers to make their fortunes but no matter how far they went they always turned their sails home so this von develda only painted ships it was his specialty following in the footsteps of his father willem the elder the two had quite a journey of their own taking them all the way to the court of a foreign kingdom did they ever come home no but eventually their lives worked it take your time stunning isn't it paintings weren't the only masterpieces of my people's golden age this is vanvion and insulated ewer molded from a single sheet of silver what was it for how like elizabeth you are function over form its practical purpose was less important than its meaning bon vionin created it in honor of his late brother who himself was a famous silversmith memorial yes such beauty from sorrow if this you were was a memorial how did you end up with it as the pharaoh swarm closed in my homeland's greatest museum gave it to me along with many other works in the hope that i could preserve them a masterpiece like this was too important to lose to history i even considered bringing it with me off world to insurance safety why didn't you i took a calculated risk this vault seemed more secure than the unknowns of space besides i thought someday i might return a long life after all has its advantages now lo and behold here i am exquisite isn't it [Music] out of madness out of grief that's hard to watch [Music] [Music] [Music] there you are feeling better how did you find us at the cauldron and what did you do to everyone right before i passed out all business i see well suffice it to say we were keeping a very close eye on hephaestus knowing we would need it at some point uruz didn't fool us and as for my little trick it was an overload of the senses accompanied by an energy discharge gerard and eric were only momentarily disoriented due to their shields but it it rendered you unconscious while i got you out perhaps some breakfast might study you a bit [Music] [Music] this was your house the one you recreated for beta and the data channel you shared how perceptive of you please this way after everything your people have done you think i'm just gonna sit down and have a chat with you they're not my people they never were and especially not now you shot off into space with them and live with them for a thousand years before coming back so what made you suddenly turn on them quite simply this my old focus you repaired it but that means you've seen incredible things you've accomplished in two decades of life a thousand years at my back and i haven't even come close i'm sorry if i invaded your privacy but i had to in order to understand to be enlightened you truly are elizabeth's blood with her drive her sense of mission her integrity [Music] watching all this shame to me for the company that i've kept having seen it all i want is to help you even if it means stopping your friends especially so please sit down [Music] there that's better now we must recover beta and gaia at all costs by now you must know that gerard intends to use gaia to reboot the earth's biosphere remaking this world to specifications that would only suit us immortals this process will kill every living thing on the planet he calls it a clean install not if i stop him first not if we do and once he and the others are gone we can work together to fulfill elizabeth's dream i'm sure beta told you that there's a build of the apollo database onboard our ship a complete collection of human knowledge [Music] with that and gaia we could do everything elizabeth wanted heal the biosphere educate the people of this world uplift them create the world she imagined let's not get ahead of ourselves from what i've seen your friends are invincible i do wish you would stop calling them my friends and they're not invincible in fact a friend of yours has found a way to defeat them silence oh he's been a busy bee building an army powerful enough to crash through gerard's precious base regal and her rebels even now she's preparing a final march on the tanakh capital when she wins she'll have the entire tribe under her control hundreds of warriors and machines to throw at the base she's been duped they'll all perish of course but it should be enough to break gerard's defenses and allow silence to kill him along with all the others using the new weapon he's developed yes he's found a way to circumvent our shields truly an exceptional man he's planned for everything except you and me you see while his army is battering down gerard's doors you and i will sneak in through a back way one that only i know about while silence and my friends are busy battling each other we'll take back beta and gaia i told you i want to help you i mean [Music] you said beta is not an urgent danger so what are the zeniths doing to her putting her to work merging hephaestus with gaia a difficult time-consuming task as i'm sure you know they will compel her if need be but her life is not in danger she's the only one who can do it because you people made her to be nothing but a tool gerard's idea not mine they always viewed me with suspicion when i attempted any form of kindness towards her that's why i created the data channel a virtual place where we could speak in peace so this channel you shared with beta none of the other zeniths ever found out about it gerard believes he's the most cunning of all of us even after a thousand years he still can't imagine that i would outwit him the channel allowed me to interact with beta away from their misstrustful eyes it offered us a chance to be ourselves until you cut off all contact yes though it pained me i was worried that our meetings would do her more harm than good she felt like you tossed her aside i was afraid the others would find out and punish her she may not have had the comforts of friendship anymore but at least i ensured she was safe i know it seems harsh but you must believe that her well-being has always been paramount to me why did you make the data channel look like this place i built this house as a shelter to weather any storm a safe place not just for me but for the art store below cultural artifacts of incalculable value truly some of the greatest achievements of human civilization and you wanted beta to see them yes her upbringing was so cold and technical i thought if she could experience vermeer and rembrandt it would bring something else into her life a heritage every bit as valuable as the scientific and technical data being drummed into her i'm sorry i had to cut off contact but i'll never regret sharing this house with her she needed its shelter even more than i did my old focus how did you find it let alone repair it when we encountered you at the hades proving lab gerard saw you as a redundancy i knew better you were a revelation after your dramatic escape bravo by the way gerard and eric assumed you were dead and gave up the hunt i wasn't so sure when the others were busy i returned to the lab and searched for any trace of you that's when i found this little treasure not easy to repair but certainly worth the effort as i watched your life unfold you were like a splash of color on a worn canvas what liz was and more did you show it to the others of course not it was your actions that inspired me to defy them it's worth noting that if i hadn't found it and watched its contents i wouldn't have known to save you at the cauldron you'd be dead so i should be grateful if you like so you know all about me what about you what would you like to know well start with your life on earth when i was eight terrorists flooded my home city thousands drowned my parents included i was one of the few who survived my guardian sent me to boarding school among my peers i was the strange girl the orphan to be avoided all because of circumstances beyond my control oh so we're a lot alike huh aren't we you're an outcast but you didn't let that stop you from getting what you needed neither did i i climbed my way out of desolation and used my wits to build a fortune first from the technical analysis of art and the detection of forgeries profitable expertise in those days but as it turned out the software i developed was even more useful for counter intelligence from there it was only a short step to gathering extremely valuable intelligence on my own you were a spy more like a service one could turn to for information i had to remain anonymous of course to protect my privacy but despite that anonymity far zenith inevitably sought me out what happened when farzinus approached you they painted an irresistible vision of humanity's future one where we need not fear illness or death where we explored the furthest reaches of the stars and thrived it was only later that i realized that they only intended to bequeath this future to the rich and powerful by the time i finally figured it out the walls were closing in farrow's machines were devouring the earth so i accepted farzina's invitation to a birth on the odyssey i wanted liz to come but she had nobler plans issue well now so you didn't know the other zeniths were monsters until it was too late i i knew some of them were certainly it wasn't until we were off planet that i understood the true scope of their greed i was grateful to simply be alive but the others became obsessed with a kind of effortless immortality they built a colony where machines serviced their every need where any memory or fantasy could be endlessly savored in virtual reality it wasn't life it was stiltifying a pampered dream state as the decades passed i withdrew more and more alone yet again but this time with eons to consider my mistakes now finally having met you i feel like i have a second chance to do what help you of course to fulfill liz's dream which isn't so different from farzine's original vision a better future for humanity betta told me your colony was destroyed but you came back to earth because you had nowhere else to go it's true after we reached our destination a planet in the serious star system we spent decades building a new home the physical constraints of earth the boundaries of mortality gone to think of what we could have done with it it might have been a utopia instead we stagnated absorbed in effortless comforts and virtual realities it took a cataclysm to finally yank us out of our stupor what happened a massive geological event we knew of instabilities in the planet core but we underestimated them by the time the collapse was upon us it was too late to stop it only a few of us made it to the ship in time we set course for earth the only safe harbor left to us which you decided to make unsafe for anyone else not me gerard he believes it's better to wipe the canvas clean than work around the smudges no more primitive tribes no more combat machines only a blank slate to do with as he pleases but we will stop him all we have to do is get into that base what exactly is your plan to sneak into the zenith base we will make use of a lesson i learned from an early age always know your exits in this case a place where gerard's new construction meets the ancient foundation a passage that only i can access when silence flings his army at the base we will enter through this back door bypassing most of the fighting the distraction will provide us with a window in which to rescue beta and gaia once we're inside the base where will we find beta and gaia here in the command center by then gaia will have been reunited with all of its subordinate functions including hephaestus what about the alpha build of apollo on your ship a simple matter of recovery once the others have been dealt with with that in hand we'll have everything we need to make this world as it should be how do you know about silence's plan he isn't the only one adept at spyware you hacked his focus no he's too careful for that but his subordinates not so much he gave additional focuses to the tribals he branded the sons of prometheus the ones working with regala by tapping their focuses i learned about most of his dealings the distribution of override technology the arming of tanak rebels and the secret pact with regala to attack gerard's base but how did he come up with a weapon that can take down your shields that's the one thing i haven't been able to figure out but however he did it i'm quite certain it will work with it in the tanakh army victory seems to be within his grasp such a shame he'll be disappointed regala is only interested in killing hakaro and waging war on the karja what does she have to gain by attacking zenith it's the price she must pay for her war without the ability to override machines her little rebellion would have languished in the desert so she trades with the sons of prometheus machines to help her overthrow hiccaro in exchange for an assault on the base pride has deluded her into thinking she can actually survive such a battle and all without ever knowing who the sons of prometheus really answer to yet for all of silence's brilliance still he underestimates you that blind spot is what will allow us to take beta and gaia right out from under him while hundreds of tanakh are cut down outside so you knew elizabeth what was she like this was everything she was i see in you and more your ingenuity your determination your moral compass you've managed to distill her greatest qualities and make them your own i'm not asking about me tell me about elizabeth what was she really like the honest answer is that i don't actually know for all the time that i spent with her she always kept a part of herself locked away it was like that from the moment we met so when you met elizabeth she was what distant aloof not aloof not exactly it was a summit in paris about machine learning a touchy subject in those days because regulatory authorities were just starting to clamp down on ais liz gave the keynote address she had already achieved great renown for her work in automated environmental reclamation but in her address she was just starting to imagine the next step an ai driven system that wouldn't just act on its programming but actually take responsibility for its sphere of influence to care about life not just follow orders revolutionary stuff i was fascinated and i wanted to meet her for a long time i watched her after her talk she had spoken with such moral authority such empathy but after that she retreated i could tell she felt uncomfortable with all of her admirers it was as if giving the talk had cost her something i didn't want to be a pest so i planned my approach carefully so how did you finally approach elizabeth after her talk i picked the right moment the morning of the next day right as she came back to the conference she had just had her coffee she was fresh rested it was like she had braced herself for the onslaught of colleagues i asked if i could walk with her then put forth a question about her talk that i thought was intelligent her answer made me realize it wasn't but she was very welcoming almost as if we were previously acquainted it was only halfway through the conversation that i realized she knew exactly who i was it was quite a shock to me my business was trafficking in secrets and i took great pains to protect my anonymity so that was lis perpetually one step ahead i came to view our meeting as a metaphor for our friendship she always seemed to know me far better than i knew her i guess i know the feeling [Music] your plan would wipe out an entire tribe there has to be another way we are in [Music] an admittedly desperate situation but i assure you there isn't remember zero dawn elizabeth's sacrifice sometimes many have to die for a new world to grow if it looks impossible look deeper [Music] wait the data channel it still exists doesn't it i need you to open it let me talk to beta impossible we might be detected it's worth the risk there is another way one where the tanakh survive but we won't if the others if you want to help open it [Music] so [Music] [Music] what are they doing to her virtual reality dissociation the manual merge of hephaestus will take hours upon hours of tedious micromanagement if she resists the work they run simulations to induce feelings of isolation and despair can you hear me you're alive they're watching me i i can't hold up this extra projection for long you should have killed me no no look at me i'm coming for you i promise okay i just need you to hold out a little while longer and work on the merch then i think it can be done i'll contact again when it's time can you hold on as long as i know you're coming for me i can endure anything [Music] all right i did as you asked now i think you need to tell me what you're planning i'm going to take silen's army away i don't need it only the weapon he made to penetrate your shields and how do you propose to get it ask him nicely without regala and her rebels he won't have a choice will be his only option only option for what what did you tell her that is between me and my sister [Music] will be silen's only option for crashing that base i'll tell you the rest later but first there are a couple of things i have to do oh and what are those lay my friend to rest and then i'm going to use the override that beta gave me a gemini to put an end to recall's rebellion from the air wait since you insist on doing things your way i know of something that will truly help you make a grand entrance with the tanakh the ancient horus titans still possess electromagnetic energy cells as part of their arsenal drop one of those on regala's army and they'll receive quite a surprise so go do what you must i'll come to your base if you manage to bring silence to the table not if when aaron are you there hey hey is that really you yeah it's it's me where's everyone else we're all we're back at base what happened it it might be easier to explain in person i'll try to join you there when i can okay i will wait here for you it's good to hear your voice just to let you know i'm now patched into your focus network great i take it the other zenith can't hear us of course not and they don't know about your base either in case you were wondering i've sent you data on the horse energy cells you can use against regardless forces reach out to me when you're ready to acquire one understood what when you're wounded you have to strike back draw blood hey can i get one damn minute to mourn my friend regala is going to slaughter my tribe to overthrow hikaro the zeniths have beta and gaia we can't sit around wallowing in our losses kotalo's right we must fight ah all right so what are we gonna do huh take on all of regala's rebels not to mention the zeniths what can we even do throw ourselves at their base something like that so [Music] after we lost contact with you we regrouped and went to gemini what happened the recording we found on varro's focus cut off when that zenith eric the zeniths were tracking hephaestus when gaia trapped it in gemini they they knew where we were after varl tried to stop them [Music] they took beta and gaia i only survived because one of the zeniths turned against the others to save me one of them well at least we didn't lose you too so what do we do now we're going to defeat the zeniths and get beta and gaia back but first we're going to stop regala how back in gemini beta gave me a gift there's something i need to do first to make it work but it could put an end to the bloodshed word is regal is readying her army for an all-out assault on the grove i need to be there i know go stand with akaro and keep an eye on the sky strike true as the turn [Music] the rest of you whatever preparations you need to make upgrades resupplies get on it it won't be long before we take the fight to the zenith we'll be ready eloy and when you're ready meet me outside the east exit i'd like to have a word in private [Music] even when things are darkest you're the flame that lights the way forward just tell me one thing am i gonna get to smash up a bunch of zenith bastards we all are good before i do anything else i should check on zoe that sounded important i thought you were gonna go fight some tanakh i wanted to check in with you first don't worry about me i'm just you know picking up the pieces like everyone else they'll be there when you need me i never doubted that oh good i'm glad you're back so am i i know you hate waiting but you'll have to stay back here a little longer well you go do what you got to do but are you okay it's not just var we lost beta's gone i almost lost it when i realized my sister had been taken by derval back in the sundom i'm getting her back [Music] that's all that matters understood do you think so we'll be okay i don't think anyone's ever okay after losing the one they love i can't tell you she's handling it better than i ever did that keeps the rest of us level-headed [Music] you should know silence is involved with the sons of prometheus he's the one who gave them the override tech to begin with why doesn't that surprise me that's probably all part of some master plan huh at least we know we're good at wrecking those damn straight i need to get going you better get there before catalog tries to take on regala's entire army by himself do me a favor don't go disappearing on us again i'll do my best you look busy my studies are a good distraction especially after culture and gemini varl beta gaia gone and that's just the beginning the zeniths want to rob us of our future too we won't let that happen so all of the tribes here are new to you yes i've been studying up on them the most fascinating one thus far has been the tanakh an entire culture based on the holograms of an ancient museum there's much they've misinterpreted not unlike the queen but still there's a nobility to what they've become they're honorable and fearless and deadly how are you holding up varro's loss is heavy on everyone's mind i didn't know him well but i can see how much he meant to the others zoe and aaron seemed to have taken to it the hardest but i don't quite know what to say to them they need time to sort through it and what about you will time heal your wounds i don't know i try not to think about it seems like everyone's ready to take the fight to the enemy kotalo more than most if i were this regala i wouldn't want to cross him on the battlefield regala still has a lot of machines on her side that's where you come in i suspect if my plan works tilda the zenith that beta mentioned she was the one who rescued me did she say why she knew elizabeth sobeck seems to think helping me is honoring her in some way she was willing to share information on both silence's plans and the other zeniths but you still don't trust her where i come from the more valuable the knowledge shared the higher the price extracted i'd be careful if i were you eloy what was leviathan again a flood control system back in the great delta it was built by aileen sasaki another of our ancestors if we can acquire the data on it we might be able to fix the system back home then my sister my parents other families won't have to live in fear of their homes washing away when the long rains come right and to find it we need to head back to san francisco i should get going be ready to go on my signal okay i won't let you down i know and i haven't forgotten about the data on leviathan i'll let you know when i make it back to landfall thank you eloy over here aloy [Music] we would come out here to tend to the garden sometimes i needed fresh air other times we would simply sit and watch the sunrise so when we returned from gemini it seemed fitting that he'd be laid to rest here now he can always look out at plain song and [Music] further east to the nora sacred lands he would have liked that he often spoke of his sister bala he said she used to gather her favorite golden blooms and tie them to her spear their mother called it useless but milo was stubborn yeah she seemed like that it wasn't easy but i tracked down the flower [Music] gathered at seeds has [Music] still the sea [Music] from death follows new life so it is with the land and so it is with us [Music] i'm with child hey i was going to tell him when he got back from gemini instead one day i'll bring our child here we'll sit among the blooms and watch the sun rise i never got to tell him to thank him for saving my life sure but also for not giving up on me he always knew [Music] goodbye farley i promise to look after them [Music] i'll try to visit again when i can't for now i need to go to the fabrication terminal to install the new override on my spear then i'll use it on a sun wing and get ready for an entrance for a gala we'll never forget oh before i forget i watered those plants for you i just know they meant a lot to you and uh i well thank you aaron i think you can manage things here while i go help akaro stopping regala's war it'll help us take the fight to the zeniths yes then i'll make sure the rest of us are ready upon your return okay we'll be facing spectre drones soon aaron and catalo have fought them before so i already asked them to run us through some combat drills aaron moves like an oaf but he's good with that hammer [Music] how's erin doing for a moment there he thought he'd lost both you and varell but he never truly succumbed to despair guess that asaram stubbornness comes in handy sometimes i know we both want to make the zenith pay for what they've done but once we infiltrate their base our priority will be to get gaia and beta out of there don't worry i won't go seeking revenge like some blood crazed tanakh wherever your arrow strikes mine will follow let's hope we hit our targets i need to get going whatever you plan on doing against regala you better return to us in one piece i'll try was there something else you needed tilda's the one who rescued me same one that spoke to beta when none of the others would did she say why she saved you she knew elizabeth sobeck seems to think helping me is honoring her in some way she was willing to share information on both silence's plans and the other zenith but you still don't trust her where i come from the more valuable the knowledge shared the higher the price extracted i'd be careful if i were you eloy i should get going be careful eloy override installed now to find a sunway i think there are some roosting at the top of the mountain okay i need to find a sun when it's override better head up the mountain what [Music] [Music] good there's some wings up here we'll have to approach them quietly later got it hello oh this is it i'm in the air i'm in the air then you'll want to pick up an energy cell on one of the ancient horus titans but first you must send out a pulse to activate them i've sent you the necessary software to deploy it you'll have to override one of the communication machines you refer to as tallnecks there's one in the middle of the desert that should do nicely on it i definitely don't sound like rebels maybe if i follow their tracks i can find out where they're headed i can probably use my focus to follow the tracks those riders left behind [Music] there's a tallneck i need to get on top of its head now how to land this thing it okay tilde i've overridden the tallneck good and the energy cells are now primed simply pick one up on a morris the nearest one should be northwest of your position dropping it on regala's machine should produce quite a spectacle thanks for the assist i told you i want to help [Music] whoa i'm gonna get used to that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] look at all those rebels reinforcements maybe heading for the grove i hope oh [Music] [Music] by the time there's the energy saw right on the titan's back got the hill now onto the grove pulse from the tallneck should have reactivated all the energy cells in the region i should be able to pick up more from any horse i fly to be useful even after i deal with rubella [Music] [Music] all right here we go carl will soon be dead it's all over chaplin i gotta drop it now here it goes is that it's eloy she flies in the wings of the ten the tide has turned push through [Music] [Music] now on your knees and i'll give you the death you didn't have the spine to give me they're down the machines all of them they're down what how's that possible [Music] enough bloodshed let's settle this you and me easy to say when you're on top a machine well that was just to get your attention i don't need any help to take you down fine i accept your challenge and once i'm done with you i'll get to finish the slaughter we'll see about that the duel is set let none fight is interviewed beginning oh [Applause] don't give up huh [Music] all right so that's how it's gonna be feeling better [Music] is this how you give up your life [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] this is where it ends yeah it is i will rise above [Music] this is all [Music] [Music] come to me oh oh don't have enough stamina yet oh i hope to fight here i am again on my knees before bootlegs and cowards go ahead run me through shut your mouth traitor [Music] it was you who flew in on the wings of the ten you who challenged her by our rights you must decide her fate i spared her once it only made things worse she was the best of my marshals what a waste she's dangerous all right but maybe that's exactly what i need cowards what more do you have to conspire about whether you live or die after all that you've done i can't let you live finally there blood for blood guess that's over then chief there's something you both need to see in the throne he surrendered to our guards outside the grove claims he has an urgent message for the outlander who defeated regala so stated it's for her alone [Music] from an interested party i'm gonna need some privacy clear the room put him with the rest of regala soldiers i'll see you back at base you saved the tribe let me help you with your mission no with regaligon you have a chance to build the future you dreamed of so get to your task then at least allow me to give you this regala's bow may you always strike true with it thank you [Music] do you have any idea what you've just done oh it's a pleasure to see you too silence congratulations on your victory you saved the tanakh for a few weeks unfortunately you do the entire planet as well wrong i don't need it to knock the army to defeat the zenith have you learned nothing about the enemy we're up against more than you hiding whatever hole you found my idea is just better than anything you ever came up with [Music] no not here we're doing this my way face to face and with the weapon you've why would developed do that because i'm your only way of beating the zeniths and getting the copy of apollo that's on their ship so meet me at my base mountains west of plain song time to submit to the inevitable silence and follow the person who actually knows what she's doing don't be late [Music] tilda you there i did it silence is on board so head to my base impressive i'll be there as soon as i can now that i can fly i might want to see what else i can do before i head back you defeated regala flew like the ten i doubt you have enough skin to mock all your deeds we'll just have to remember them then yes thanks to you chief acara's hold on the tribe is secure his vision for the tanakh endures but that's not why i wanted to speak with you i need a favor a personal one my grandson cavo he was not counted among the dead which means he must still be with regales remaining forces he was taken prisoner no he joined them willingly like many young soldiers who seek to mark their skin with distinguished deeds i must search for him convince him to come home chief hacarro cannot spare any soldiers for this task so my blade is alone in this unless you'd be willing to join me i know it is much to ask after all you've done for us the cabo is the last of my blood what made cavo join regala's rebellion for some regala represented a chance at vengeance against the karja during the red raids it wasn't easy to turn the clans back at baron light many wanted to pursue the karja all the way to meridian so unregala attacked the embassy they took it as a call to arms yes but others the young especially care only about the glory they think they'll earn by hunting an age-old enemy as for cabo it was probably a bit of both and a youthful desire for a cause to get the blood burning nothing i said could stop him [Music] so if cabo didn't listen to you when he joined the rebels what makes you think he will know kabba was too young to fight during the red raids moore was a stranger to him but he must have experienced the suffering it brings by now he will listen must i just have to find him before it's too late you said cabo is your last living relative yes before chief accaro the clan's war constantly with each other every skirmish claimed another comrade one by one i buried my children and then their children i'm sorry i tried to vent my grief on the battlefield but i never found comfort there only in the wisdom of the visions and even so i still couldn't prevent cavo from following the trail of blood if cavu joined regala's rebellion of his own accord will hecaro let him back into the tribe the chief knows the value of mercy and the toll of unending bloodshed the rest of the tribe i'm more concerned about they won't quickly accept someone who betrayed them even with my support it won't be easy but you have to try help you find your grandson if i can where do we start a while back our scouts reported calvo's squad left one of regala's outposts in the hills to the south his squad never returned but the scouts also spotted one of our own being held captive there so we'll start at the outpost if we free the prisoner maybe they'll know where kevo's squad went shall we head out i have some other things to take care of first i can meet you there i'll wait for you on the hillcrest southeast of the grove we'll make our way to the outpost from there until then strike true honor champion walk with honor regardless i'd keep your bow handy if you plan on traveling west to the coast it's infested with machines likely on account of a cauldron that lies nearby thanks for the advice worth the risk ah the wondering return to me another time we could learn more i think this is where cotalo wanted to test out his new arm even though he didn't say how exactly i should let him know i'm around to find out hey kotalo i'm by the tremor test site where we agreed to meet want to test that new arm of yours i'll be there shortly thank you for waiting maybe now you can tell me what we're doing here not just yet follow me please someone's being awfully mysterious you took your sweet time telling me what you wanted to do to the bulwark consider this my revenge fair enough this is it what am i looking at oh you'll see come all right talk to me catalo i wish to test the arm on that i just managed the valley for some time killed more than a few of the sky clan but no longer i'm honored to help after you let's see how this thing likes the taste of metal use the equipment [Music] well i think it's safe to say the new arm works fine agreed then why are you taking it off this is what i am now what i overcame anything else feels wrong like a disguise i'll use the new arm when i need it but the rest of the time i will simply be myself i wouldn't have it any other way you have my thanks for doing this with me here something to mark our victory thank you i'll see you later then the ten be with you eloy [Music] you
