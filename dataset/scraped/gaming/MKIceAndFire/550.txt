so black squirrel got your sister huh yeah and we need the sealed verses to cure her gotcha is it well i'm not sure if this will help but i know a guy who has the same disease he's a king actually and his kingdom has been trying to find a cure for a while it's possible they may have something you think they may have discovered a cure i said it's possible i didn't say it happened anyway the place is called facade it's deep within the desert we should go check it out if nothing else we might be able to find some clues there indeed and if this proves successful it would certainly make our task a good deal easier how does one reach the desert we need to head back to the village then leave by the east gate i imagine a tome such as myself will find an arid desert climate quite delightful foreign all right look would that be the canine we were looking for it's the missing dog that poor old man's gonna be pretty upset but we should at least give him a proper burial hey wait i think the dog has something in his mouth it's some kind of leaf this is a rather dangerous location for leaf hunting i wager this decision cost the animal it's life well the least we can do is bring it back to the old man it's too bad about that poor dog this is going to be hard for that old-timer to deal with be they dog or man no living thing can escape their ultimate fate that include you vice in truth i have never considered the question i suppose at some point in time i may simply wink out of existence well that sounds horrible um say yeah see here lad if i ever find myself departing this world quit being more of advice besides you can't die you're made of paper one can always hope i suppose hey what's up oh wait outside what why it's way safer inside the village it's fine i like being alone if you head out from another exit i'll just meet you there you sure i know jonah would be really excited to meet you don't force the issue now her mind is clearly made up not everyone loves the company of others as much as you hmm all right i won't push it see you in a bit excuse me have you seen the old man who lives here you mean granddad he passed away his heart finally gave out on him oh man looks like he went with his best friend after all here hold on a second his dog had this leaf in his mouth when we found him that's the herb granddad used for his heart medication max must have been fetching it for him well i suppose i owe you a great deal i can't give you much but i hope you'll accept this such a faithful animal you think max and granddad are together in heaven i do i'm sure of it what so what's facade like it's strange let's just leave it at that stranger than a boorish young woman who battles monsters in her undergarments let's go what is this a fountain it appears to be out of service wolves look out they're leaving that one appears to be the pack leader i think it's a graveyard the headstones seem to be lacking names also why do they shine as if they were carved from the rock just yesterday it appears the gate is sealed tight well great guess we're not getting in where is she going whoa alec you know these guys kinda not exactly a while back i saved a local kid from a pack of wolves ever since this town's welcomed me with open arms got to be a pretty screwed up place if they let me in huh anyway i suppose a quick stroll about town is an order the language they use here is pretty crazy so uh good luck with that i'm fascinating they speak a language i have never before encountered i feel bad that i can't understand them you could speak a thousand tongues and still fail if you lack knowledge of another's culture come on vice help me out already i am a brilliant book of unspeakable value not some dog-eared travel guide i'd wager that huge structure is the king's manor how do we even get there with willpower and smart smile lad i feel like we're just going in circles here if only we could speak to the locals i've no doubt we'd have little trouble reaching the king's manor we'll just have to suss out a route on our own yes and after we finally made it all this way yeah this is pointless let us go back ho ho look this one lacks the power of speech perhaps she can communicate through gesture let me see thank you you're welcome i am fiera do you need help yes we came here to talk to your king but it turns out we can't actually talk to anyone i can guide you oh she will act as our guide how fortuitous but first i must explain this town we really just need to see the king no there are rules to follow follow me well there you have it hmm rule 106 is rule 106 the reason for your labyrinthine system of staircases well i suppose eccentric people deserve an eccentric town huh oh come now what could possibly be the point of such an absurd rule hold on your people are still making rules of all the idiocy that i could never live in this city foreign ah so the aristocracy lives in the top levels while the commoners subsist below seems like a rather unpleasant rule for those on the bottom does this girl plan to drag us about the entire town in this fashion she's just following the rules vice a strange thing store such as yeah that is pretty strange it would seem we are impeding progress yes i was beginning to suspect that it would seem we are impeding it would seem we're in thanks these rules are enough to make a sensible man reach for the noose i don't know how you survive in a place with so many inconvenient prescripts you're a good citizen fearow hmm you have no king the black scroll thank you all of this touring has been helpful for understanding your language i believe i will be able to speak with this advisor myself we need to talk to the prince my patience for this kind of thing has long ago evaporated it's not your fault fira let's go back to kaine for now finish your business yeah thankfully we met a girl who helped us get around a girl slow down i can barely the person who saved me surely you don't mean kindly kinda helps you this foul mouth tatty piss off book you guys done or what why'd they make a bunch of rules that contradict each other these that rule only forbids your people from entering the temple right so why not ask an outsider to save your prince oh and what luck we just happen to have an outsider who can't stop meddling in the affairs of others right here i'm going to fira told me about rule 1024 you know that one right rule 1024 you must honor the request of any outsider owed a debt that's how it goes right fira why did i ever agree to travel with such a pack of do-gooders let's move hmm are we leaving the girl behind uh it would seem we are impeding beware the wolves it would seem we are impeding the moment i open my mouth the sand rushes inside did you even have a mouth how does fear a deal with this perhaps there is some manner of filter inside that mask of hairs keep a keen eye on your surroundings fira sure is brave isn't she such a miniscule body she seems to possess almost boundless stores of energy stay close to the girl now wolves look out this girl must possess extreme patriotism look how she gives all this day close to the girl now uh hmm thanks for your help do what was that supposed to mean give it all you got kenny i wonder what this prince is like the man is tasked to protect his people and yet he's made them toiled to save him i think that tells us everything we need to know that he is an incompetent fool did i just hear someone where did you come from boy wait seriously but you're just a kid lazy what well that was unusual come on we have to help him or we could simply pretend we didn't see him instead hmm god damn it this shit's starting to piss me off oh are kanye kidding me let me go let me i'm gonna kill you when i get out of here i assume we'll have to find her as well yep huh us so so so so oh oh this madcap barrage of rules shows no signs of slowing easy vice we need quieter we're going to mess this up again the last folks suddenly enjoy their customs i wonder what drove them to make such complicated rules huh huh okay oh the space between my pages feels crunchy i'd give anything to jump into some water right about now despite your inability to swim are you mad it was a joke vice missions um so what's this well this doesn't look suspicious at all i suppose that was to be expected hey look that mewling child is inside without any rules to blindness we are free to unleash the entirety of our powers it's about time what is this thing i detect magic within the glowing tubes good so what's up how mindless the guardian of this temple is a curious sight indeed says the talking book this is a powerful foe there you are you bastard kane i'm gonna kill the out of you now hold still and die already huh how did you find us it's me i just kicked a bunch of ass and wound up here and without even bothering to get dressed  off book kindly the glowing cubes take priority screw your priorities i'm gonna kill this thing my way this should prove interesting so so uh um huh ah foreign did oh no that's all right we were just happy to help i believe the regent has just given us an order i guess so in that case how about you make rule zero and have it say that if people don't like a rule they can vote to change it a splendid idea uh thanks but i think most of your praise belongs to someone else do you know how to cure the black scroll it seems there is no way around it we'll have to collect the sealed verses after all yeah it's the only lead we have we came across an old song that says if we find them all we can cure the black scroll and yes we are well aware that refrains penned by minstrels half and their cups are hardly a reliable source of information hey i'll believe anything if there's even a sliver of hope it could help me save yonah and i'll collect verses orbs crystals magic goat meat whatever just try not to get yourself kidnapped again um foreign i suppose rules are rules even if they are absurd i don't think they're absurd no those rules are important to the masked people you don't say i do and i think it's important we respect that well well the boy is beginning to sound like a man boy i'm not a kid you know hey less talking more walking jonah oh hey how are you feeling better now that i'm taking the medicine you brought good um by the way are you gonna stay here today you bet really you'll stay with me really yeah yonah i'll stay yay now get back to bed okay just a dream even in my dreams i'm hunting sealed verses morning morning yonah what's wrong are you feeling sick too no i just i had a strange dream what was it about it's nothing don't worry about it because i had a dream too oh yeah yeah me and this boy were playing a game together what kind of game it was called guess the words i think he made it up because i never heard of it before how did it work the boy would move his mouth but no words would come out then i had to guess what he was trying to say it was hard i wanted to play hide and seek but we had to play his dumb game instead so what did he say i don't know all i could figure out was dream and forest of myth but don't worry i'm gonna study hard so that next time i can figure out everything we should play a game together sometime too sure yonah i'm ready to make that stew anytime something troubling you lad it's nothing don't worry about it come on i need to go ask popola something what's up popola oh hi i just got a strange letter in the mail that is certainly one bizarre piece of writing who's it from the mayor of a small village in the forest of myth it's a wooded area up north the forest of myth they're usually a bright and cheerful group of people something like this is very out of character for them i have a bad feeling about this i'll check it out uh you will but don't worry about it i've got business there anyway oh well all right thank you what is the purpose of this place beats me maybe it's popola's hobby corner it's that lizard thing we fought in the airy who would make a figure of that anyway and what is it doing here what's that it resembles the shade we saw in the lost shrine we saw this cube back in the barren temple perhaps the prince of facade gave it to popola as a gift this is from the junk heap for a decoration it's certainly in poor taste hey there you mind giving me a hand with this sure what's up hobola asked me to organize her bookshelves but it's kind of a big job i'm hoping you can take care of a few of them here this book goes in the second shelf from the left on the east side of the second floor here's the spot the first book is all set thank you now take this book to the third shelf from the right on the south side of the first floor hey vice yes lad aren't you all powerful can't you just you know use magic to zap this place into shape the infinite power of grimoire vice is not to be used for such trivial tasks this isn't trivial you are the one so enamored with hard honest work the second book is back where it belongs oh wow that's a huge load off my mind it's always nice to meet someone else who appreciates the value of a good book you know anyway here's your reward ah okay it sure is quiet here such silence bodes ill there's trouble on the way i'm certain of it you know a little optimism now and then wouldn't hurt vice such beware beware the words the words what do you mean contagious those who dream those who dream hold a moment there is a strange new sensation in my mind it is not quizzical what's going on perhaps we should start by asking this man who are you we heard something happen to this village so we came to see if we could help if you can speak to me i must have caught you in my dream in your dream now see here are you saying that we have been absorbed into your dream well yes i think you have in other words we've caught the death dream ridiculous preposterous completely unfathomable on every conceivable level i don't even recall falling asleep that's just how the death dream works my remarks are not to be brushed aside fool something there must have caused you to enter my dream a certain conversation a specific word something grimoire vice does not engage in meaningless conversations it does not seem to sting my pride you bloated gas bag of a narrator it has demolished it utterly i was doing no such thing just leave me alone already so do do do oh so do so do so so do so so oh thank you so much now i can finally return to a normal life this is one of the most bizarre diseases i have ever encountered i know that's why we have to help the other villagers no matter what for a sealed verse that didn't take much effort yes all a touch too easy if you ask me it's almost as if someone was guiding us to this village don't overthink advice so um so this person must be dreaming too it would appear that way yes can't say i'm very excited to go back there that dream world sort of creeps me out perhaps you should spend less time complaining and more time getting on with a mission yeah yeah you is oh you have anything to say about that hopefully there will be no labyrinth next time i hear that and another victim this work certainly is trying i figured a book like you would be into all this word stuff vice even i have my exceptions now let's be off me boy that was rough i am positive i have seen that place before okay that's enough don't need you getting all weird on me too okay there now all the villagers can wake up right yes if the mayor's assumption was correct i think i've had enough word play to last a lifetime thank you very much you're telling me anyway let's go see the mayor oh how wonderful thank you so much here i have something for you wow this looks valuable i can really have it of course it's apparently a weapon of some renown but we have little use for it well we appreciate it thank you again for everything so so how was the village oh it was truly magnificent there are no words really neat let's get back to popla she'll probably want to know what's going on in there so is the death dream certainly is a strange illness yeah it was something all right even i with my natural love for words have no desire to visit that place ever again you guys did well you've been making a lot of long trips lately are you sure you're not pushing yourself too hard i'm okay i can't just sit around all day while yona is sick after all if you say so so anything i can do for you well i suppose there is one thing i could use a hand with have you heard about our plans to repair the canal the work probably won't happen for a while but once it's done we can use the canal for trade and travel and all kinds of useful things unfortunately however we're a bit behind schedule at the moment if you're willing to help out i'd really appreciate it no problem what do you need great so the man i originally asked to help on this project hasn't shown up for work in a few days i'm starting to get a little worried so maybe you can head over to seafront and check up on him i'll mark the location of his house on your map he always carries a red bag over his shoulder so he should be easy enough to find got it a canal is it fascinating if we had a ferry we could put these days of endlessly running about behind us don't you just float everywhere anyway do you think i am born aloft by the wind slad it takes stamina to maintain this height oh really you could at least try to hide the utter dismay you know please get that welcome hey is hey um i am starving a city of this size must have some manner of eatery nearby i love the breeze care for someone thanks for um hey uh are you the guy who's supposed to help repair the canal popola sent me to oh god it's over my life is over surely you must realize nothing good can come of being involved with this particular endeavor easy vice hey so are you all right what happened it's my wife she left home a week ago and hasn't come back i'm so worried i can't even focus on my work oh my sweet dumpling where are you that's terrible would you like us to help you look for her really you'd do that for me sure but do you have any idea where we should start hmm well she always used to enjoy drinking at the tavern with her friends all right and i guess we'll start with them thank you this means the world to me oh and by the way my wife always carries a red bag just like mine if you mention that it might ring some bells i've met some odd couples in my day but none who felt the need to wander about flaunting matching luggage you need to get with the times coordinated outfits are all the rage plus these bags are special we bought them for our anniversary but now my sweet dumpling is gone and it's all my fault oh god okay okay just stay calm we'll go look for her all right you sit tight i'm willing to bet that man knows more about his wife absconding than he's letting on hey there i'm uh looking for a woman carrying a red bag are you now interesting did something happen to her she hasn't been home and her husband's worried do you know anything about where she might be trouble in paradise is it oh those two never change anyway the short answer is no she hasn't been around here either though come to think of it she always got on well with the woman over at the tackle shop maybe you should try her i'll do that thanks hey what's the rush you've got a cute face why not sit here and join me for a round or three uh sorry ma'am but i'm not old enough to drink hey there do you know a woman with a red bag by any chance a red bag oh sure although now that i think about it i haven't seen her in a while last time she came around she mentioned something about leaving town but i figured it was just idle talk leaving town huh all right thanks for your time if she has truly left this charming hamlet finding her may prove most difficult indeed i just hope she hasn't been attacked by shades or anything hmm something about that shit's rather odd hey look at this it is identical to the red satchel carried by the man who sent us on this mad quest perhaps it belongs to his spouse oh no do you think the shades got her i fear it lightly lad i sense no other activity in the immediate vicinity we were too late well this is terrible what are we supposed to say however difficult it may be we've no choice but to tell the man the truth so hey did you find my sweet dumpling we didn't but we got this off a shade oh no this this is hers so our fears were correct oh god how could this happen to her this is all my fault if i may my good man why did your wife leave home in the first place it's because because i i think we should give him some time to himself vice you're not dead what in the world are you talking about oh you found my bag thank you so much i can't believe i went and dropped it like that oh this is such a relief okay seriously what's going on i see so he found a shade with my bag and assumed i'd been attacked and killed i'm just glad you're safe dumpling but i'm also so sorry this is all my fault if i didn't eat that apple you were saving oh god i'm such an idiot listen i promise i'll never eat anything of yours again you just promised never to run away from home again okay run away have you lost your mind i just went to visit my parents i told you about this going to see my family gone for a week remember ugh are you serious right now why don't you ever listen to me um lad my brilliant intuition suggests we should beat a hasty retreat from these two with all speed i can't believe you didn't listen to me and you ate my apple you are the absolute worst what oh like you're some perfect angel you didn't even care enough about our anniversary to hang onto your bag you kid i'm right about this yeah if anyone's wrong here it's my wife right wait you're asking me well you shouldn't have eaten your wife's apple that's not very nice but i was hungry and it was just sitting there look i'm glad you went looking for my wife and all but that was low friend low did i cross a line there it was pretty rich to come after me for an apple when you threw away my entire stamp collection you're damn right i did and i'd do it again you are nothing but a hoarding slob you there my husband's in the wrong here isn't he oh enough the both of you are at fault now apologize to one another and end this ridiculous display floating magazine i see you finally agree on something do you not even understand how frustrating this is you colossal oaf this is exactly what i hate about you fine hate me i'll still sleep like a baby knowing i'm not an unreasonable hag like you vice what do i do you turn on your heel and walk away as fast as your legs can carry you my good lad that's it i have had enough instead of belittling me why don't you get a proper job everyone in the neighborhood treats me like dirt and it's all because of my unemployed slob of a husband actually i have a job now wait you what you're kidding why didn't you tell me oh that's great well i sort of wanted it to be a surprise oh you big silly billy well this calls for a celebration come on i'm going to bake you a nice apple pie i have no idea what just transpired but it has utterly exhausted me well looks like they made up so all's well that ends well in the course of all that madness i have forgotten why we even came here in the first place oh heck the canal we need to ask him about the canal i can't thank you enough for all your help sure but listen we need to talk to you about the canal all right that's why you came here in the first place huh well now that my love life is rolling in clover again i'd be more than happy to get going on the canal work heavens that was exhausting tell me about it anyway let's go give popola an update so you
