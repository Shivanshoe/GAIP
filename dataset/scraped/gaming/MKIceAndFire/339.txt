actually a little annoyed you feel hurt that we didn't tell you until now whether it's true or not you don't like being left out well okay oh [ __ ] the foosball game you knew exactly what to do you needed to focus on the positive memories not get lost in the sadness i thought it would help it did just warn me next time okay deal never thought i'd have a freaky impact friend pretty wild so any sign of diane today no but she was in yesterday working on her laptop you said she was afraid of something around gabe's death if she's covering up what typhon did i bet there's proof i hope so if she comes in today let's be ready with a plan in the meantime i've got to finish my shift we're on it time to earn a paycheck i should clean the dirty dishes around the bar i'm not convinced this is totally sanitary but what do i know how do these bird washing contests even work who's checking the sightings stop nobody cheated the people here respect the birders code of honor as much as anyone i just lost again i'm sorry i was so close i just needed one more red-tailed hawk there's always next year right yeah i guess [ __ ] you ryan luken enjoy your birder of the year title while it lasts oh [ __ ] ryan's got a rival i wish riley never found out about my condition she needs to focus on her future not mine riley found out i wonder what this means for them hey eleanor how are you i'm doing okay thank you dear i really appreciate your help from a couple weeks ago it means a lot to me of course i'm glad i could help hey is everything okay with you and riley for the most part she's pushing herself too hard helping me i just want her to focus on her own life now let me know what i can do you've done so much already i'm grateful alex i feel terrible for eleanor and i don't think it's getting any easier how's it going we have some ideas that are gonna blow your mind well let's not get ahead of it blow your mind i can't wait [Music] where are you girl from rome gosh i really miss that song they used to play it in here all the time weird i've never heard it maybe judd knows where it went definitely the best boss i've ever had which to be fair isn't that high a bar i can't go on a run everyone will see how awkward and out of shape i am forget it been there before maybe i can encourage her hey can i ask you something i've always felt too self-conscious to try running you seem like a pro any tips oh well definitely don't let that stop you just push through it you know i'll try that thanks trust me you're not alone definitely the best boss i've ever had did you trade out the quarters in the register yet all you kid hey where do we keep unused jukebox cds we don't everything we have is in the jukebox cool just curious she's here i know hey welcome i'll be right with you i better check in with stefan ryan it's gonna be a long night tonight always is same thing every year tonight's the spring festival i wonder what's wrong hey ducky is everything okay of course i've never felt better okay glad to hear it jed acts like he's in charge but we all know who really calls the shots in here poor emilia so i started dust in daylight while you're at work you're kidding i already got to verdant cliffs wait holy [ __ ] seriously yeah i'm kind of addicted it's a good game i'm so glad you like it i really do ah yes the legendary keeper of the high score ass charlotte must be getting ready for the larp hey getting ready for the big larp oh hey yeah trying i hope we can get ethan into it is everything okay yeah don't worry i'm sure he'll like it the spring festival is nigh nigh i say hey do you guys know a song that goes where are you girl from rome holy [ __ ] blast from the past alabaster daydreams my dad used to love that song gabe would put it on repeat just to mess with him got to the point where he couldn't stand to even hear it anymore so what happened to it oh eventually judd pulled it out of the jukebox and stashed it somewhere you could ask him sweet thanks hey boss do the words alabaster daydreams mean anything to you oh hell like brother like sister huh fine guess it's been long enough it's back behind the bar someplace thanks [Music] figured out the song kind of want to play it and blow her mind alright let's hear this infamous song one small victory that no one will ever know about alabaster daydreams that's it how the hell don't worry about it okay she's here what's the plan well we have two plans actually but we're still workshopping them what does workshopping mean exactly it means ryan won't admit that my plan is perfect okay so here's what i'm thinking i asked diane out on a date wait what and she's so into it she doesn't notice one ryan lucan swiping her laptop ryan carries said laptop upstairs acquiring damning evidence maybe diane and i still hook up not important that's your plan my god please tell me you have something better i do now to be clear it's the same plan except i'm the distraction look steph i don't even think she's gay all right she's probably into the rugged mountain man type all the transplants are i'm genuinely worried that these were the best ideas you had what it's a simple plan literally two steps you just need to choose the hotter distraction okay i'm not doing that you're the only tiebreaker we have [Music] let's go with brian of course you're a total smoke show staff but for diane i think brian is a good choice this ryan this is like a bad dream look i appreciate the the effort but we don't even know if she has anything worth stealing yet i'm just gonna try talking to her maybe i can get her worked up and read her emotions i'll let you know if i need that distraction good luck your usual thanks alex what's the best way to rile her up you know all i want is justice for my brother please help me alex i can assure you that typhon is committed to a full and open investigation we want to find those responsible and hold them accountable just as much as you do that's the truth she's got a great poker face unlike mac but let's see what she's really feeling let me try and read her first poor gabe no one deserves to die like that she's sad if i keep her thinking about gabe's death maybe i can find out more oh such a cute photo my niece and nephew they're adorable william bloom gabe loved him i think he spent a whole year just listening to him really he had good taste surprise we never talked about it i bet you and gabe threw back a lot of these together he was a great bartender made the long work days more bearable typhon does a lot of local hiring huh we're always growing are you joining in the larp later it's been so hard for ethan we're all hoping it will cheer him up i can't good luck though i'm sure he'll appreciate it okay now i need to pick something that will push diane's emotions over the edge do you have um enough napkins for the table uh yeah i'm fine thanks that's a nice cross oh thanks look i know you're not a bad person but my brother is dead because of the choices you and typhon made how does that make you feel i actually want to know alex i we typhoon is doing everything we can to address the situation that's the truth okay all right that's the emotion i was looking for time to explore diane's guilt about gabe [Music] okay time to find out what diane is really hiding he came here looking for a better life just like me he's gone i'm still here hello ms jacobs it's deputy pike like i'm sorry but we're very busy at the moment there's been an accident what kind of accident wait there's something else hello miss jacobs it's deputy pike i'm sorry but we're very very busy at the moment there's been an accident what kind of accident i can't undo what typhoon did or the role i played but at least i have everything i need to protect myself from them holy [ __ ] she must have evidence on the usb stick looks like i'll need a distraction after all diane hey ryan what's up well if you're free later i was thinking we could go on a hike together there's some beautiful trails up in the mountains oh that sounds like a nice idea sounds fun ryan knows all about the local flora and fauna of haven ryan tell her about the flora and fauna oh uh well that right there is a colorado pinion jay it can hold more than 40 seeds at a time with an expandable esophagus that is impressive so what do you say hey no rush he's not going anywhere mull it over get back to him anyway gotta go see holy [ __ ] that was epic totally insane my heart is pounding ryan real talk i think diane actually wants you i know i can't believe it hey oh man you guys oh that was hilarious oh my god i hope this was worth it password protected guess i'm not surprised i'll bring this to riley see if she's willing to help she's a whiz of computer stuff in the meantime we have a lark to do grab your hat and meet me at the park and don't forget your guitar okay is the guitar really necessary what how can you be a bard without a guitar the bard's whole job is to musically regale people well then prepare to be regaled so did you finish the thing yeah barely it took me all night i haven't carved like that in ages all right i need to grab my guitar and the hat that steph got me wow typhon officially clears typhon of any wrongdoing in death of local man at the hands of typhon explosions so many memories of gabe i didn't get to make best job i've ever had not that the competition is super fierce so okay let me grab my hat leave it to me to wreck gabe's bike on my first ride at least ryan had a good laugh about it i still haven't gotten you open yet must be a key around here somewhere wow steph is a rock star for putting this together ethan is going to flip a dire rat joined your party maybe i should put something on ducky's gift to me for finding his booze it's um it's a unique expression of gratitude i know this is ethan's copy but i'm level 73 and i'm not stopping i found some really cute photos of gabe and ethan on this thing i haven't beat steph a single time that i don't even know if i'm doing this right but it felt like i had to do something i haven't beat steph a single time that just means i'm overdue for a win right life in haven would be a lot worse without these two weirdos a housewarming gift from eleanor she said gabe loved these little dudes no sunglasses though huh there it is half person half dump truck i feel you yeah i don't need to know what that was for another one of gabe's hidden cans torque oh [ __ ] the feather on the hat must have fallen off maybe i can find it gabe's last effects from the coroner pike dropped it off a few days ago guess i've been avoiding looking through it okay you can take the kid out of juvie oh one match left i don't know why but this must have been really special to gabe never know when you'll need a light i'm not giving up yet gabe i better find that feather steph is a stickler for details we're one step closer now steph i will murder you wish i'd taken steph's advice ugh this must have been caves that's a long list and i bet he would have gotten through it wow gabe still finding ways to break my heart huh one day i'll stop being a freeloader for now i'm just grateful yikes this garden is looking gnarly [Music] ugh not much better [Music] well it's better than nothing look man if you want to live here you need to do your own dishes so far ryan is the only one that uses this maybe i should just gift it to him i wonder how many times gabe got stoned up here and stared at these guessing it was more than zero i haven't played for anyone else in years that was a good night alex the bard ready to serve time to head out hey i don't need like cheering up or whatever okay so maybe this wasn't the most subtle idea but gabe was so excited to larp with you i bet he'd really want you to do it i do want to do this it's just [Music] everyone's been working so hard and if i'm not happy they'll all be disappointed must be weird having a bunch of adults pressuring you to dress up in a costume and act like you're having fun yeah especially my mom she always looks so sad cause i'm like bummed out but i can't just pretend so don't pretend just be yourself or yourself with a foam sword and a funny hat but what if i'm still you know not having fun then don't that's fine too no one will be disappointed in you for being you all right but i don't want to do it alone you have to help me of course vayner the monster slayer thanks to the gods and all the heavens you've come i am in desperate need of a great hero could you be the one please tell me of your exploits uh there's a bunch of stuff maybe my bard can sing something about me oh sure a kraken ate a city every year until it died on thanor's spear my goodness so you must be thinner's bard alwyn whose songs have magical powers it sounds like you are exactly the heroes i need my name is king tabor the age of monsters has come upon my kingdom horrible creatures

rivers one two three i control me one two three i control me this book is written for [ __ ] toddlers nothing like getting pissed off at your anger management book i bet there's something fun in the record store i saw that like right before you picked i wonder how riley's doing with the usb that run felt amazing i'm so proud of myself wow good for her mind if i duck in here a second i have to um [Music] renew my bard guild membership yeah okay hey there i could ask riley how progress is going with the usb so eleanor's donating all those decorations any luck with the usb no not yet it's gonna take hours if we're lucky oh if you want to check it out it's running on the office computer but don't touch anything okay thank you so much for doing this you don't have to thank me it's the least i could do for gabe and honestly it's a nice distraction for me right now is something going on with eleanor i found out nana has been sick she has alzheimer's oh wow anyway let's talk about something else how's mac doing i haven't seen him in a while oh he's around he's been a life saver mack has yeah he really stepped it up for me and nana i'm actually glad we're still together that's good are

life being a smith in the age of monsters whoa he's really into this what did you need again sun silver the components for sun silver i'm guessing this is a fancy art gallery wait no a pet shop go for it monster or mortal mortal come in sorry about the lock these are dangerous times welcome to the magpie emporium oh so this is like a magic shop i'm gonna take a look around a bit okay okay let's see what steph's done to the place he's forging the sky sword of power oh yeah one day thanos gonna find it that actually looks legit golems animation fee not included oh steph spells very cute stuff are these spells for sale to members of the sorcery guild only sorry wonder if they have drills for this how does steph come up with all these names i'd like to try one of those bard instruments please you'll need to schedule a private appointment i'll do that that's not ominous at all the streets used to be full of people alex is allowed to think ryan's hot i need to get over it never seen steph all twisted up like this before surely she knows she's hot too she's always so confident the soul sapphire's right there for sale why is this 10 000 gold was i too generous it was originally 20 000 but no i meant never mind maybe we can make some kind of deal with her would you consider giving us that sapphire in exchange for something far more valuable my hand in marriage and all of its associated benefits i'm sure this isn't the first time someone's asked you given your obvious hotness uh i mean oh man this just got real i'd be lying if i said i wasn't intrigued but i'm afraid i can't accept for now we need the sapphire right away it's for a quest to end the age of monsters i've heard there's a magical fish that lives in the river of sorrows bring me back one of its scales and i'll give you the sapphire in return one magic fish scale impressive well then here's my end of the bargain only one more jewel left getting there too bad we didn't have this back at the bridge this i like the scroll of advantage it's kind of thane or style too bad we didn't have this back at the bridge one gold please so i can heal already with my music yeah but the squirrel heals us completely and it cures poison and stuff like that one gold please nimbleness is kind of a funny word thanks vayner that's really insightful we need to find more coins for that [Music] i do i do i do

he thinks the world of you you know after everything i think you're sort of a zero he's sort of mine how creative he is you must be so proud of him he was so thrilled to see you show up with the sword i think that was mostly about the sword maybe but i think he was happy to see you in his world sorry i'm sorry i'm okay charlotte god alex don't mind me okay just a lot going on i don't mind you at all do you want to talk about it you're really sweet but i'm okay thanks for swinging by i'll see you at the festival charlotte i can tell some sad no [ __ ] don't you listen [ __ ] this was a mistake where did that anger come from so [Music] [Music] [Music] her anger is so intense maybe there's something here that can tell me why [Music] ryan it's your fault you were supposed to protect us why couldn't you [Music] [Music] alex it's your fault everyone loves you but i can't look at you without thinking about how [ __ ] everything is since you came into my life [Music] [Music] gabe it's your fault why would you teach me to need someone again just to go and leave me all alone she's so angry at everyone around her but there's something else here [Music] what is wrong with me i can't let myself feel this way when did i become such a [ __ ] monster [Music] ethan it's your fault why couldn't you just [ __ ] listen you're angry at him at ethan you blame him i'm a bad mom alex charlotte charlotte i hate my son alex he's sweet and he's creative and he's the most important thing in the entire universe to me and i hate him for so long it was just me and him it took so long to learn how to be okay with that and i was but then cape i can deal with hating ryan or you or even gabe but ethan if he had just listened gabe would still be alive it all comes back to that none of that makes you a bad mom no matter what you're feeling you always give ethan what he needs that's what matters none of it [ __ ] matters he's dead i wish i were too this anger could kill her and nothing i'm saying is helping what if i could just take it away [Music] i can do it i can take her anger from her what would that do to her what would it do to me and even if i can should i [Music] uh [Music] alex i'm okay are you okay yeah yes i i think so [ __ ] did i freak out on you i'm sorry alex i'm not sure what came over me it's really okay i'm a big girl i can take it huh i wrecked my sculpture

matters is taking these [ __ ] down this usb stick has what i need time to dig through it if that happened to me what's happening to charlotte a key part of any good investigation a cold case and a warm beer ryan brought this down from his station hope it comes in handy gabe's call came in from the sat phone at 8 41 pm i should find the next call and see if that has any information lina it's diane we have a problem you're kidding there's a kid lost in the mountains near the pit we need to postpone lina haven is your sight diane and therefore this is your decision i know i don't need to remind you of mistakes someone could be hurt or killed we've been over this anyone up there has disregarded posted notices and accepted full liability we're talking about a child i'm just asking for one day if you postpone tonight's scheduled blast you put rhea in jeopardy that puts the whole company in jeopardy is that what you want no then do the math and make the right call email me when it's done i will so typhon thought reya whatever that is was worth risking our lives let's hope diane's email sheds more light lina hello diane is it safe to assume you've gotten your emotions under control my emotions someone was killed last night because of a decision you made i think i would be very careful with what you say next who do you think is more at risk here me or you excuse me now of course we're all committed to helping you make it through this difficult period we don't want to see anyone be scapegoated over an unavoidable accident right right great then you and i are aligned who else knew there were people in the mountains just my safety manager mac he got their distress call just before i contacted you do you trust him i i think i can convince him to be trustworthy good good only one point of contact and you've got him handled i think we're going to make it through this just fine speak to you soon okay i refuse to feel bad for diane in all this but damn seems like a lot is hanging on these inspections this is the email diane mentioned so what is rhea i bet this is when diane decided to start copying evidence to this usb stick rhea went off undetected a second blast went off that night what did lina say without the scheduled blast rhea will be discovered it was a diversion they set off the blast that killed gabe to cover up another one somewhere else that's why they couldn't wait if i can find out where that blast went off it might tell me why it was so important a second blast that's a bond villain type stuff he had a name and a life and a girlfriend and a sister wow that's a funny way to spell criminal negligence this is rhea [ __ ] this map's too small to tell where this is i need a map i really hope these maps line up that's the site of the 2008 typhon mine collapse why would they set off a blast in their current mine to cover up a blast in their old mine didn't typhon just have inspections around the old site they weren't mining for anything they were burying something [Music] you
