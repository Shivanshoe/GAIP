there the banished plan to wipe us out all of us and what you think we can stop them on our own i told you we lost we need help not heroics no we do our duty protect humanity whatever the cost i can't be the only every atmosphere we have a new mission a weapon a weapon how many guns do you need what is wrong with you remind me to never pick up this person this is a terrible idea they're coming for us all of them incoming all directions it's so safe pull back okay okay [Music] [Music] hitting your way [Applause] so [Music] more reinforcements this weapon of yours must be worth it whole place looks like it's dying like it's clinging to life somehow how is that possible each ring is different i see an entry point in the wall ahead get in there find this weapon then we can go right [Music] [Music] [Music] don't even need be careful they're still coming you really pissed him off back there [Music] [Music] look at this place it's beautiful and broken very very broken i need to move there are vanished ships everywhere [Music] so you're right uh um [Music] me [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] if you knew how you were going to die wow [Music] uh [Music] [Music] this is uh apartment what are those things this is four on the right i've heard the stories but man this is crazier than i imagined [Music] how do you know this isn't a trap i don't great i hope this weapon of yours is worth a risk i'm reading multiple enemy ships heading this way too many it's been six months where have you been what happened where is cortana the rogue ai known as cortana is gone she's been deleted how by you of course not did you hit your head or something don't you remember my instructions were to enter this installation imitate cortana and lock her down for retrieval yours were to take her back to the infinity for deletion so if it wasn't you okay then there's something else on successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete here good good my programming failed i'm not supposed to be here you need to delete me no no i was created for one purpose and that purpose is no longer needed my mission is over we have a new one the banished are planning to fire this ring we need to make sure they don't first of all what's a banished second you may have noticed that a significant piece of this installation has been damaged making that impossible and third to fire this ring they would need an activation index cortana had the index i had parts of it as well something stopped your deletion we need to find out why but this wasn't the mission the missions changed they always do are you sure [Music] [Music] did you do that no removing me triggered a response from the ring i need you to understand there's not much that voice is cortana's no it's not her just dust and echoes what did you say what it's just pieces of data cycling until they run out of power it's all around us today i was called an emotionless atonement they saw 75 healthy subjects hand-picked by me perfect for the program they will not all survive i understand that and have paid peace mostly there is one subject that i find myself hoping does live through this he is perfectly suited for what [Music] he has been assigned a number there's something up ahead i can feel it calling out to me oh [Music] these are the banished affirmative they smell even worse than i imagined you can smell them well an array of sensors in your armor can and i analyze the input you smell fine by the way [Music] look over there that's the source the bridge is out yes it is maybe there's a way to power it back up nearby oh [Music] is it safe i think so yes [Music] it's safe this this is part of me i don't know why i don't know how but it is me it was the last part i remember being deleted let me just you are here because you were chosen our enemies are getting smarter and more numerous every day what i am about to show you will help turn the tide of war i have been working to harness the strategic power of a ship born ai onto the battlefield are you ready yes dr halsey [Music] unlike previous ai models she will reside between your mind and the suit directly communicating with your neural interface think of her as a new set of eyes to aid your reactions and upgrade your reconnaissance she's not the driver but a way to level the playing field what do i call her ask her she named herself hello master chief i'm cortana [Music] together you become our newfound hope together you become our key to humanity's survival she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it [Music] what happened i touched it and was that real it's just data it's it's just here clusters of recursive code but this on the other hand this is the framework i use to trap cortana it contains a copy of the activation index at least fragments of it what should we do with it do we need it well based on what you've told me so far the bigger question is do the banished need it do it [Music] [Music] that was something let's go did i miss something there's a file that's been unlocked but i don't have access we need a route out of here okay let's see there's a breach close by it should lead us to the surface give me a second and i'll get this bridge activated we've got company chief meet me at the plinth up ahead surprised [Music] [Music] oh wow you got here fast not the type to waste any time huh no noted let's go [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Applause] [Music] even in my darkest moments when i feel the most lost atriox's wisdom continues to impress me i regret that i ever doubted him his talk of forerunners of the of lies hidden in this forsaken ring atriox hear me your will is absolute the banished your soul eternal oh no what's wrong this gravity lift should be powered up we need to find a way to bring it back online go [Music] this object it's part of the ring's life force it's called a power seed all space all [Music] their times chief stop how is is that a spartan we need to find out what happened [Music] she was carrying an enhanced shield module let's see what i can find out about her accessing this is spartan bonita stone recon specialist her vitals have been offline for nearly a month cause of death was an energy blade but different stronger a single strike she never saw it coming we're here that elevator should take us to the surface there you go [Applause] [Music] [Music] here [Music] hello we need to call down the elevator look for a control terminal [Music] this elevator is drawing power from the ring well it was the seed is missing what are these things genetic repositories forerunner storage vessels silexis how do you know this i was stuck in that room for six months surrounded by them let's just say they talk a lot [Music] this is combat medic lucas browning if you find this you need to understand they forced me to help them with it whatever it is i brought it up from whatever's below when it opened god it was something different i've never seen anything like it you need to believe me it's not my fault [Music] that should do it let's get back to the elevator [Music] foreign get that cradle powered up [Music] this isn't forerunner it identifies as banished can you operate it in my sleep not that i sleep but oh i don't need to it's already on its way down incoming but what if it's a friend it isn't he did not specify in how many pieces it's too dangerous chief good [Music] you were right he was not friendly by the looks of him he was some sort of leader they called him tremonius not anymore that's almost funny sierra 117 understood i've been trying to reach you you've vanished i thought i was on my okay i got your location on my way be ready [Music] this [Applause] another silence but this one's open what do you think was in it another problem why so cynical it might be something good trust me it won't be what if tremonium how do we get out of here terminal over there just give me a second i should be able to get control from here so tremonius has fallen a victim of the master chief's might do not fool yourself he was not the best of the banished not by any measure it occurs to me that we have not been introduced i of course know of you spartan your legend the fear you inspire is admirable the hope you stir in the hearts of your kind misplaced i want you to know my name too to know my legend how else will you beg me for mercy i am esheram war chief of the banished this is my world now and you have little time remaining in it [Music] look at this place it's so full of more monsters coming to kill us you're gonna need to me somewhere to land incoming become ready me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] get ready frozen [Music] we're safe everybody safe at last [Music] think you can get away from me [Music] [Music] not um [Music] he says [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] the first of many on the house ground of our new home we will build this fortress in the very shadow of their failure a monument to their frailty and cowardice where so many of their kind were cut down ashram has decreed the name in your honor harmonious so that it may inspire other leaders to do what you have done all the remains [Applause] [Applause] approaching [Applause] foreign he's [Applause] [Music] shot him [Music] who kill you is big hero that's the last of them is it safe is anything don't answer that if you can find me somewhere to hack in i think i can guarantee this base will be safe for your friend to land uh let me see the banished are using a modification of the covenant's battlenet protocol pretty easy to push through and done i've removed this location from their system we're safe here lz secure [Music] so [Music] oh solid ground [Music] as good as this feels please tell me we can go did you find the weapon you were looking for can we go hi cortana [Music] this is all her fault it isn't cortana tell him but it's classified permission granted i was created by dr catherine halsey to mimic this installation security to trap cortana for deletion i was successful cortana's no longer a threat and now she's going to help us stop the banished of course she is i think i'm with you i didn't even know what a banished was an hour ago and even i can see the odds aren't great yes yes you should listen to her you're gonna get us all killed oh this is fascinating you're trying to survive but i was programmed to die really one person with a death wish wasn't enough no i was just figuring what i'm supposed to wait i'm picking up a unsc distress signal location the source is four kilometers from here here is the distress signal's point of origin this is our current location this was until two minutes ago a banished forward operating base i say was because now it's ours chief what is she talking about now here's the cool part there are more unsc forward operating bases that have fallen into banished hands well pause they have paws each one is associated with a territory here is the location of the unsc signal i've been tracking and here are two more fobs mark it let's go let's go what [Music] there [Music] ready and waiting chief get on board and we can leave you're messing with me right first you say you want me to follow some signal then you leave me here waiting well go ahead it's not like i have anything better to do [Music] [Music] that's beautiful isn't it to some i have a question i was created to lock down cortana but i don't know why what did she do that was so wrong she was our target i understand that but is this classified because i don't have all the information this is did you hear me everywhere what intel did dr halsey give you before your mission halsey only tells people what they need to know fly a pelican straight into enemy territory no one will ever notice great idea big guy i still don't understand why you had to delete her it feels like something's missing guess what they noticed they all noticed and we've got a bad instructor up ahead armored very heavily armored it'll have to wait i suppose how close can you get us how close we're at and you're asking me how close put us down here here we're still doing this hope this works because it's as good as it's gonna get it's close enough he better be i'm getting out of here we're close to the unsc signals origin source unclear there's just too much chatter on all banished channels i keep hearing the tower it's probably the main structure we saw as we flew in um [Music] look down there we're close to the fob we detected you take out those monsters get me to that terminal and i'll show what i can do [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh uh [Music] you made short work of that huh now to business let's lock down fob golf i don't need an eta on the weapon i imagine that's a question for her sir but fair enough is the escort fleet in position hi sir we've got six mulsanne frigates in the advanced group ready to move acknowledged have them set course at full speed hopefully we won't be far behind i don't like this waiting we're sitting ducks out here let me see yes i was right all i need to do is chat with a banished security protocol and by chat i mean push it out of the way because it is really not smart and there we now have ourselves a second bob was that you affirmative so what you're going to just rebuild the unsc piece by piece that's his call i'm just trying to be helpful speaking of which each fob seems to be linked to the battle net and if i do this we can piece together what the banished are up to for instance over here is some kind of banished outpost purpose unclear but it's well defended so it's definitely worth looking into and blowing up and here is what i can only describe as someone that the banished value highly noted his bio is interesting if you want to see for yourself it's waiting for you in the database they're tracking unsc transponders too caches containing valuable equipment and intel oh no it looks like there are multiple unsc squads engaged in trying to survive they need your help chief are you ready chief what do you think i already told you that the odds aren't great for them then let's go find out what that signal is drop off approaching your lz chief uh we just picked up a unsc distress signal the signature suggests a squad of marines alive no response on comms but if they are it's a sure bet they need our help let's find them [Applause] [Music] all banished forces eliminated the squad made it thanks to you consider yourself back to hello affirmative oh swapping sure foreign [Music] so this ship is confirmed up on that outpost we learned about at the fob looks like some kind of salvage operation what's our move shut it down [Music] oh the banished really want to protect their fuel silos clearly so what are you going to do about it disappoint them nice you need to manually raise each silo first silos raised oh look around brothers and sisters the way our horizon curves up into the sky binding us together it was not the covenant that finally delivered upon this promise this was the result is the dream of atriox our fortress our sword [Applause] oh [Applause] um [Music] oh come on what is happening um [Music] uh i am [Music] [Music] take out that silo it looks like the banished are tearing down and repairing vehicles here not for long marking the repair base let's do this [Music] [Music] gotcha [Music] our scouts have identified two key sites that seem quite promising for excavation we will soon be ready to dig but we must remain unnatural defenses look beneath the surfaces of these rings advise your troops to salvage any human machines laid low in battle the material will be needed for repairs [Applause] [Applause] are they banished digging for something [Music] [Music] [Music] enough hiding [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so do you see that one m808 scorpion in pretty good shape too could be useful if you like that kind of thing oh i like it humanity is the high clans will reward me for this oh i like it mine [Music] [Music] ransom keep is officially offline we did it chief well you did it the banners just wait till i get my blue hands on you ready to go damn breakfast [Music] uh so bob up ahead we could use an lz in this region i believe in you [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] i think that's all of them captain's report inf101 mark timestamp encryption lambda alpha spoken to commander palmer who's assured me that our spartan contingent is ready to go commander offers similar sentiments regarding our infantry and odst divisions this foreign lock is already well underway with the next stages of breaking trip but each time out i wonder if we've pressed our luck too far and now of course comes my favorite part of my day debriefing with dr halsey have a good doctor's unquestionably brilliant but at an ever increasing cost another fob in unsc control and in the shadow of that banish tower the closer we get to it the stronger the unsc distress signal becomes the source has to be inside i just picked up a new fob on the network you're doing right or if you need anything orders received eta on your ride ah very soon do i pass inspection spartan let's go [Music] [Music] getting out here [Music] nice hang time chief make any underhanded deals lately feather face i guess tower was a more than appropriate name look at that place the signals coming from within that main structure somewhere up top we're gonna need to find a way in [Music] hey what's this so uh [Applause] come on [Music] is [Music] you guys can't possibly think you're gonna win this fight [Music] [Music] um [Music] capabilities [Music] so the demon is here did you think i would let you walk right into my tower [Music] my facility is locked down there is nothing you can do here he seems confident yes he does but fortunately it's misplaced when the lockdown triggered there was a power spike in what i presume was a security building i've marked it on the map [Music] i call that a woman the lockdown is controlled from the security building near the front this is where the lockdown was triggered food [Music] the lockdown protocol should be simple to reverse let me see three two one done oh what is it this this place is an interrogation facility run by our elite friend back there check lock his reputation is not good neither is mine [Music] you're going to need to manually activate the gravity lift i've marked it on your map [Music] this location acts as a holding facility prisoners are captured funneled through the chat block and then onto somewhere they call the house of reckoning which is suitably ominous and banished sounding [Music] [Music] easy [Music] thank you find a way to activate the gravity lift [Music] switch on your lips [Music] over here [Music] let's go the gravity lifts powered up [Music] good to have you back more spartan armor and the source of the distress signal we're too late a deployable threat sensor it appears to lock onto and highlight any targets in range could be useful this armor belonged to a spartan named hudson griffin sensor logs suggest he was alive when the armor was removed forcibly it's a long shot but he might still be alive [Music] uh [Music] you have overreached my choice [Music] i await you eagerly [Music] he's about what you would expect for foreign elite who specializes in torture [Music] [Music] let's get it [Music] [Music] [Music] and expose um [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] now too much [Music] [Music] [Music] oh no spartan griffin he's still alive we need to get him out of there where's checklock unknown welcome to my tower master chief it is where you will be broken it is where you will give up your secrets [Music] i see you soon the wall's retracted watch your back he could come from anywhere okay griffin's threat sensor can help you locate chat club [Music] [Music] i approach the final blow will be mine [Music] [Music] we need to get him out of that machine ah shut this thing down working on it okay be ready i'm going to cut him loose you you're alive gee the baddest i tried to stop them i tried to easy you're safe now the banished they have something they call the conservatory that's all i know it's picked up north of here dig site i couldn't stop them but you can you have to consider it done that's good good the others the sperms did you i'll find them echo 216 all channels can you hear me i repeat can you hear me [Music] chief big guy your motion tracker isn't moving come on come on give me anything jeez i respond please did you find the source of the signal whatever is down there either has to come with us or be left behind can you hear me a dig site on the ring this conservatory must be some sort of forerunner installation what do you suppose they're after it's time to go [Music] i'm guessing that whatever the conservatory is the banished won't want us anywhere near it then they'll be disappointed yes they will is free i do not trust her but i must believe in patriarchs plan his sacrifice must not have been in vain especially now this faith in what we learn from the ark is all i need the harbinger is for the first move to secure our position our future did cortana know about all this when she chose this ring did she expect [Applause] as i look upon this endless world that question consumes me they called it a silex sure i call it something that should have been left well enough alone the leads the jackals even the damn brute seemed scared of what was inside ashram their leader he just stood and watched as they held my hand against it [Applause] we got a fruit sniper i think we're scared they got me god [Music] lay down cover me [Music] master chief with the tape down eyes up chief more of them what's this you've given these marines hope chief they'll remember that i'm with you chief disembarking [Music] thought we love her i'm ready to kick some ass teeth let me kick some ass [Music] he was right fighting time dune is nearby chief be careful he's got quite a rap sheet thousands of unsc personnel died at his hands time to make it right oh [Music] oh [Music] so uh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] no uh [Music] [Music] killed by humans chief enemy reinforcements target eliminated now the crew [Music] [Music] target and crew eliminated life on this ring just got a little safer for the unsc hey did you get a look at that modified weapon the target was carrying pretty inventive even for the banished so i copied it i've sent updated schematics back to our forward operating bases should give us an edge i'd suggest sending a thank you card for the upgrade but you killed the intended recipient so we can skip that part don't forget we've got a solid lead to follow up on at that dig site the spartan mentioned [Music] [Music] it's taking five [Music] do you hear that it's coming from that communication tower unsc distress signal nearby chief marking the source more of them chief well here goes nothing wow [Music] ah i was too close for comfort even after all they've endured these marines just won't give up neither will we advancing in range chief this one's a particularly murderous grunt hi sumpter bricklard he's one of the unsc's most wanted don't underestimate him all chief oh eyes up chief more of them that handles the target let's get the rest of the squad [Music] the smaller they are the less they have to fall i think that's how the saying goes anyway that's the last of briglard and if his bio is any indication that's a good thing so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] hey where are you going the banished are searching for something called the conservatory let me guess you're heading there too affirmative well don't worry about me i'll be here waiting alone we'll be in touch just just don't leave me out here for too long okay i mean it we still have hostels to deal with chief will play with your property [Music] [Music] foreign no more hostiles bob echoes ready to be brought back into the fold that'll do it bob captured looks like we're right on the edge of the island a chunk of what used to be a single contiguous structure can you imagine the force it would take to blow this ring apart must have been quite a show you guys need anything keep me posted let's get you mobile standby for vehicle drop ready to move i'm on foot you hear that banished radio chatter they're scared are you sure about sending them in alone dr halsey if everyone does their job correctly john will not be alone captain i just questioned the value of splitting them off from the rest of blue team that wasn't the initial plan plans change besides i have something else for blue team in mind so do i which is why we've taken advantage of their unexpected availability to assist elsewhere i do not remember agreeing to the reallocation of our best spartans my spartans for an operation i am not even aware of plans change doctor the stronghold we detected at the fob is up ahead chief the redoubt of sundering inside i'm picking up multiple unsc signatures i'm out of here holy crap look there the marines this must be where they processed prisoners before sending them to the tower we've got to get them out of here [Music] [Music] careful only foreign oh die faceless [Music] more reinforcements inbound on the field shoot come on [Music] [Music] i'm picking up one last unsc tag inside that central holding structure under heavy guard so [Applause] i don't see anybody now for our friend i think that console's rigged to his cage [Music] oh [Music] you all right marine yeah i am now chief we thought you were dead thank you the red out of sundering is out of banish control we're two for two on gate-crashing prisons the marines probably want to burn this place to the ground but at least there'll be no more prisoners processed here something up chief [Music] so [Music] is [Music] this is nice we [Music] marking the source [Music] oh uh reinforcements inbound all clear those marines owe you their lives chief [Music] let's go go go just give me a sec jack sniper all day what's the matter scared of a bunch of you holy marines [Music] we got vehicles that one's not coming back that fob belongs to the banished it should belong to us in here [Music] ain't coming high rankings hey [Applause] okay hmm [Music] [Applause] bob charlie is now a banished free zone hit that terminal and we'll make it official [Music] fob captured one more foothold for the unsc according to banished records we're right in the middle of some of their most active transport routes on the whole ring these days they mostly support escharam's excavation efforts but for most of the war it was prisoner transport escheram's not going to be happy about losing it i just picked up a new fob on the network you're doing right or if you need anything requisition confirmed only way with your hardware [Music] awaiting orders [Applause] but you do what you do best always sir [Applause] can you believe in holzy's plans sir we're detecting unusual readings [Applause] guardians i don't think so we have hull breaches these locations we've been ported sorry reports training parties lots of them banished what are they doing here making a mistake ready to ride [Music] here it comes can't see them from here that banished facility up ahead looks like a mining operation that must be the dig site the spartan was talking about what are the banished doing here they are doing exactly what they've been doing since they got here scavenging tearing everything apart to fuel this war how could they they're ruining this place and for what when that's already happened [Music] it's kind of quiet isn't it there that tunnel the banish must already be down below this should be impossible forerunner alloy is almost indestructible why do you think they chief i guess we need to deal with that mining laser oh and these guys it looks like the laser is controlled up in the central structure chief this cannot just lead up it was a trap i knew it was a trap what do i do hold position i've got this [Music] [Music] uh mmm [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] sugar [Music] the explosion will be uh [Music] [Music] don't let it go [Music] [Music] looks like the laser controls are by that just give me a sec something's wrong i can't shut it down then we destroy it way ahead of you there are two power regulators down there all we need to do is manually expose each regulator's cooling pylon to trigger a cascade effect and by we i mean you and by trigger i mean shoot or blow up you get the idea the master chief has returned but strangely it does not it invigorates me gives me no purpose i could not have wished for a more worldly adversary patriarchs i now understand why you did not kill him on the human craft you wanted him to witness your victory i will complete your work your vision and there are the pylons take them out now god [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] that should do it one down one to go the conservatory entrance must be protected surprise attacks will end this [Music] so [Music] hero cut down [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's two now let's head back up and deal with the laser do not allow them access to the conservatory [Music] you have your orders slide i see him i'm impressed i can't believe how easy you made that look now let's deal with that laser you've done your part now for mine watch this is there a problem of course not let's see what's down there that laser was modified very recently to cut into the ring modified by who definitely not by basis back there the formula is very sophisticated whoever made the change they didn't just modify the forerunner architecture they improved it oh and there are a lot of banished in the conservatory they've been down there for days we are welcome to the conservatory i wonder what the banished are looking for down here let's go find out another spartan get me close [Music] a drop wall module deployable cover resilient but temporary skin complete this is spartan vadrana makovic armor's been offline for 13 days cause of death is what an enhanced energy blade same as spartan stone there's a pattern emerging chief who's doing this we're going to find out [Music] hey oh [Music] stop him he can't kill everyone me he's here uh okay around hmm looks like the banished are trying to stop us moving forward can you open it of course if you can magic up a terminal of some kind or find an alternative power source to get this door open there we go simple oh kids no one here [Music] [Applause] [Music] three shut up uh another disabled store i'll say one thing for the banished when they have an idea they stick with it hmm it needs more power find another one [Music] yes [Music] shot him [Music] and it's open come on let's go before they get really creative wait do you hear that it's coming from up ahead open it help me this installation the harbinger exile was absolute how did she return it's impossible this cannot be i need to go back find out what happened we should help her maybe no she's correct i request your assistance who are you what's your name i am despondent monitor of this installation and this is my conservatory my conservatory this is not right [Music] let's go where down there what were those flying things new dangerous and despondent pyre new potentially dangerous see you can be optimistic [Music] spanish oh [Music] black [Music] back foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] crazy [Music] hmm [Music] trees is this is impossible i will teach you to begin did you guys kill him we're getting close to the bottom wait listen please do not do this it cannot happen it is wrong [Music] somebody messing around uh [Music] oh [Music] what [Music] uh oh me compromised [Music] you do not understand what you are [Applause] i could not relinquish to you the location location the engine can never i am ending it god oh no we're too late something awful happened here plug me in we'll figure this out you know what i want alas i do cortana and my mind has not been changed this installation's weapons may be yours but its secrets are not it's protected the containment facility in particular containment the flood why would a you and i both know that there are worse things than the flood within this ring [Music] no there's no way you could know sir you've come for me at last why are you doing this john why don't you understand the seal must not be broken the punished cannot be freed this can never be negotiated there is no other choice reconsider the consequences of your request back to your conservatory monitor what does that mean what could be worse than the flood nothing good find us a way out on it [Music] remember when you said new and dangerous you were right hostile reinforcements inbound this is taking longer than i thought something is taking control of local systems where are all these skimmers coming from is that what we're calling them well i was also considering flying octopus monkeys skimmers it is then [Music] [Music] wow [Applause] reinforcements inbound [Music] the door i know the code is being rewritten altered using a forerunner routine [Music] [Music] hostile reinforcements inbound [Music] where is your [Music] i'm done come get me [Music] what happened back there when i interfaced with the cradle it unlocked something something important cortana was here six months ago i could feel what she felt when you arrived it was joy fear and pain something big went down in here spartans [Music] a thruster module evasive maneuvers on demand now then who are you scan complete spartan theodore sorel special weapons expert died 13 days ago like makkovitch the assassin brutes more than one whoever they are they're proficient well trained we've got a score to settle keep coming i've been waiting for this [Music] that platform we're too late not yet [Music] i his killers are still active [Music] uh this elevator it's taking us back to the surface it doesn't make sense why come all the way down here just to kill the monitor the monitor's purpose is to protect the ring so why kill her no idea so [Applause] show yourself [Music] i know you have been following me we are not enemies despondent pyre she had something i required i know of you reclaimer but hear this you are not the future you okay chief i'm trying to get the armor unlocked try harder the forerunner's lies are at an end i am the harbinger of the truth the endless will be found they will ascend now would be good i know i know three the reformation begins two one go [Music] i took too long you could have been killed it's okay you saved us both [Music] that structure yeah do you know what it is no the harbinger said the endless will be found maybe they're inside that thing only one way to find out huh he's taking cover see how he likes this yes he's over demons [Music] the fire on the vehicle um yes i'll kill you for this who are these guys hunters and what do they do don't answer that just get rid of them so i can get us in oh [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] to get in we need to activate the graph lift hmm the protocol is not banished in origin it's sturdier than i expected problem no problem [Music] [Music] [Music] we're in wow this place is exactly what you'd expect what does it do unknown find me somewhere to plug in and i'll try to find out there we go plug me in over there interesting this structure has been activated using a protocol that's far older than anything i've ever seen it it knows we're here welcome welcome oh hello i am adjutant resolution monitor of this installation loyal servant of despond empire who must be indisposed if i have been activated have you seen her kinda do you want to tell him tell me what the monitor is gone go gone but it wasn't us are you sure of course it wasn't us good good good i was worried you were perhaps unfriendly as you can see this fire has been successfully deployed this way i presume you wish to see the observation platform see he seems friendly we'll see did you say something [Music] right this should have been activated one moment please step into the portal follow me please one moment [Music] let us proceed this is very exciting so the sequence will be set and the reformation can begin [Music] [Music] here we are as you can see we are ready to progress as soon as please excuse me please have returned get me to that terminal [Music] oh that's not so bad the structure's purpose is simple rebuild the ring well more specifically create the materials needed to repair it not gonna happen why it's such a beautiful oh the banished sorry i was distracted for a second there's so much to learn here shut it down permanently no no what are you doing this is not acceptable you were supposed to be friendly this interference is deeply upsetting [Music] keeps what's wrong with this [Music] weapons i'm putting an end to your mentally [Music] very well here and now [Music] this is exciting [Music] how dare you i have good news and bad news how many okay straight to the bad news a lot i count nine no ten spires more being deployed all the time active no not yet at least they appear to be waiting for an initialization sequence something is flooding the network trying to start it but there's resistance why the protocol that triggered all this wasn't exactly correct it worked well it started the process there's more bad news i can't shut it down exactly but i can remove it from the network of course i can find the source of the attack i just need to wait is it safe come on it's me an infiltration program [Music] why don't you trust me what was that maybe taking it offline wasn't such a great idea we need to go like now immediate extraction my location it was you wasn't it coming i'm coming [Music] [Music] open up go upload this fire locations all of them all of them coordinates received um it looks like someone has marked 42 new locations which would be crazy right this one it was the source of the attack attack what's she talking about chief is everyone trying to kill you it kind of seems like it oh wait you're being sarcastic he's fun i like him am i dead i must be i mean this is a punishment right yep this is death [Music] no no no no this isn't happening i'm going to have to make an emergency landing [Music] no no you i can't stand it you are breathe no you don't get to tell me what to do you don't get to tell me anything where are you even listening i count three anti-aircraft cannons three what you'll be safe here oh i'll be safe safe i haven't been safe since i found you i found you remember you're out there on your own and you'd still be out there if it wasn't for me i thought i was going home there won't be a home if we don't stop the banished you keep saying that we're outgoing outnumbered i know i saw clone doors over there i'm going to dig through them and find one with the working sleep space drive and when you're done with this war we get away from here far away wait here oh please let me see what i can find canon's first when i get back we can look together okay the banished have done what the covenant couldn't that's right the covenant which time after time pushed you idiots to the brink of extinction are nothing compared to us we're like nothing you've ever seen good news doom humans our primary communications array the horn of abolition just got a big upgrade we can hear every transmission every report uh [Music] [Music] this cannot be [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh right uh [Music] [Applause] she swore that she could rebuild the rain allow us to go if not home somewhere better than this but now the spartan has ended that dream i have little time left [Applause] she has one last chance the silent auditorium that is what she called she speaks [Applause] it will belong to the banished whatever secret holds and if he will not share it we will crush her and take it for ourselves [Music] [Music] what [Music] um is the only viable option we have a power vacuum like that would destabilize the banished and win us the footing we need to hold out until help arrives i need volunteers and i know i'll have no shortage of them we all want a part of this but we can't all go and leave reverie undefended so we're doing this the old-fashioned way no i'm not this is the plan a single strike team deep in banished territory agile quiet on foot it's the only way it's gonna work this might be a one-way trip so we need people to stay there won't be anything left to protect [Music] is god that's it the gravity lift is on let's get inside and shut this gun down plug me in and i'll take care of the cannon they call this security please hold tight i'll handle it [Music] the uranus lost this war months ago your people are broken scattered hunted defeated by me [Music] i wish i could tell you it was difficult but it wasn't [Music] we are one step ahead always the ring is already under our control soon the auditorium is well the harbinger and the banished share the same goal we fight together to honor the will of atriox but [Applause] without challenge i grew weary lost alone but here you now stand this is my last fight a true test of legends our story will outlive us both [Music] set a fire in your heart spartan bear your fans fight hard die will thank you chief that word auditorium what is it i was hoping you'd know the answer to that one i'm new remember okay i'm done here i exposed generator destroy good let's get out of here before the fireworks start the banister mobilizing in a big way clock sticking chief how much longer one gun down two more to go we are running out of time the harbinger and the banished share the same goal rebuild the ring but why maybe they want to go home too is not only does this ring belong to us our sciencey types are learning all kinds of neat stuff about it over at annex ridge we wield the biggest nastiest gun in the universe and soon we might just learn today death comes human [Music] someone tell me [Music] humans would never fight grunts like us is grav lift to this gun needs to be powered on too look for a power source nearby [Music] so uh [Music] right [Music] us [Music] second a a gun is open for business and by open i mean let's [Music] i'm on go the lockdown's probably going to trigger again but don't worry we'll be out of here in how many spartans remain do you even know there would have been 50 at laconia station maybe more such loss do you feel it in your heart does it leave a hole atriox was my finest recruit he understood sacrifice and when one is necessary i honor his memory each day when our enemy rises we meet their challenge it is why i created the hand of atriox i found the best the cruelest the most efficient killers in the universe and taught them how to be better my spartan killers are coming for you it is your time to rise spartan killers really everyone is trying to kill you i'm done here now it's your turn chief we're being contacted on unsc channels plum signature belongs to a spartan theodore sorel the one we found dead put it through spartan i know you can hear me will you die with honor i doubt it you are human weak pathetic i will crack your armor peel you from your shell it will not be my first spartan blood but it will be the sweetest you're sending a spartan killer chief this is crazy this is crazy we gotta get out of here we've gotta move not yet hold position when this goes bad it's on you chief remember that yourself [Music] over and over [Music] is [Music] searching i got a date still in this damn fight good for now but i got this hunch that won't last forever i hear that if it wasn't every hour objects nothing more you're a sneaky one watch yourself oh [Music] last one and cue the lock down huh no asheram i'm almost disappointed [Music] almost all set let's get back to the pelican we did it there's a repeated message across all banished frequencies the first part is hand of atriox and then what i can't stay i've lost his signal if the spartan killers find him that won't happen how can you be sure because they'll need to go through me first nice chief we've got well a lot see that chopper i guess that's one of the spartan killers and there's the other one up there in the wreckage you need to stop them [Music] if we're gonna make any noise on this ring we need a base of operations it's feet to hell but it's shelter defensible location no sign has banished activity yeah this could work any spartans in tom's range spartan griffin is diminishing rapidly i think we found our rendezvous point [Music] [Music] for this now dangerous hello [Music] i smell fear [Music] you cannot stop [Music] that wasn't easy was it what if escherim sends more let him echo 216. nothing but i think i can yes comms are still offline but i was able to activate his tracking beacon remotely he's he's out in the open the unsc ship graveyard i hope he's okay uh animals chief my eyes didn't deceive me back there we need to go three unsc condors seeing one is rare finding three is a miracle i should have known better torn apart got it slip space drives obliterated we don't have the time over there's another shattered and cratered over a kilometer in there the last one all of it crushed broken christian useless enough when when is it enough chief and we're in there because that's where i belong in there with them worthless junk not this i'm not you i'm not a pilot i'm not even a soldier a marine fraud i stole that pelican i stole it you know why of course you don't have you ever been scared so scared that you [Music] i'm worthless you should leave me here with the rest of the garbage we all fail we all make mistakes it's what makes us human i'm sorry chief but how have you ever failed i should have protected cortana stopped everything from going wrong i failed her i will not fail you chief we we're going to make it we have to this is all i've got it's all we need our only way home is straight through the heart of the banished we need you [Music] we can fix this [Music] together of course we can [Music] together so what's the plan let me guess it's dangerous and it's probably going to get us killed i have my answer let's do this [Music] so you are losing control nothing is lost deploy your army descend upon him no odds will not break him the spartan is not alone there's something here helping him connected to this installation what is it it's remarkably vulnerable but highly intelligent is it a weakness something to exploit we will see the reformation is controlled from this spire it must be protected done atriox believed you to be valuable prove incorrect when the endless are found and when you have your ring then you will never question my worth and i will never question your judgment the scent grows stronger save your strength i need something of you old friend anything bring me the master chief alive ready when you are chief we left them in a nice big crater the banished is more than just a collection of unstoppable heroes we got allies important powerful allies and if you thought these last six months were bad what comes next it's gonna blow your minds out of your stupid head [Music] all right let's move how long has it been since i met you six hours maybe seven it's been eventful six months on my own surviving barely seems like a dream now this on the other hand mostly feels like a nightmare mostly chief are you okay what you said back there about cortana you let her down i don't understand your mission was to destroy her but you didn't what happened halsey initialized you i was supposed to deploy you and you did right yes so what happened adriax came for you he attacked the infinity we fought he won he won adriance beat me surgically precisely brutally next thing i remember i was being woken up in this pelican do you want to know who killed her you need to know she was important to you very important she's [Music] this ring it's not like the others there's something else here and that's why i'm still here when you're done chief wow look at the spire it's so new evolved different not like the last one and you're sure this is the one it's acting as the command spire coordinating the repair operation can you shut it down hopefully we just need to look for a door we should search the area under the spire there should be a way in humans dead all over come oh i'll get this open is there a problem i don't think so okay there might be a problem something and i think we know who has modified the sequencing needed to access the spires plan b really at b seems higher [Music] plan b those beacons are part of a ring-wide communications network they can adapt to any frequency any purpose it's quite incredible really get me inside and i should be able to use the pulse to reconstruct a pure version of the sequence should i'm making this up as i go along [Music] i see that chief what are they bad shoes successful uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] uh it's okay it's not okay it was like i was back there only infinity hiding trying to keep out of their way what did you do what was your purpose [Applause] job i worked in engineering civilian contractor well volunteer i just wanted to help but i couldn't even do that it's over now once i heard chief was down i knew we'd lost i had to roam i had to i found this pelican and just went i'm sorry i never looked back and then i was on my own not anymore you don't know how good that feels [Applause] oh the demons [Applause] everybody no more hostels detected hit that terminal and fob lima is ours decryption complete another fob is back in the hands of the unsc just up the road from the second spire too from here you can really appreciate the sheer scale of it the technological superiority of the forerunners i know you're used to vistas like this one but i bet it still takes your breath away i can do that stand by for vehicle drop uh so [Music] kill them [Music] uh is so [Music] [Music] [Music] oh crapograph nice [Music] going loud [Music] enemy cavalry um let's make it ours uh ugh you did it chief five november's ready for capture [Music] [Applause] captain lasky we need to get you to a drop ship immediately i was gonna say the same to you sir we've got banished forces inbound advanced group but well-armed chief i think we can make it out of here in one piece we'll make it capture complete chief for most of the war this was about as deep and banished territory as the unsc could reach can you imagine what it was like trying to protect this fob from the banished so many lives sacrificed a new fault let me know if you need support razorback in route thanks for the pickup screw it i'll take my chances on foot [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh damn razor weapons [Music] i'll do whatever now chief should we start hunting down those beacons or did you have something else in mind so there we go we need to get inside the beacon let's find a way in the thief has my vehicle uh what's that continue the battle [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] that was easy let's see what's inside something has been found something that should not exist yet i believed that the flood represented our ultimate test her greatest victory perhaps i was wrong in my assumptions to my dismay it seems we have a new problem i must investigate more before i bring this to the attention of the council okay let's do this you know this might actually work or maybe not what is it i can't construct the sequence well not all of it i don't have enough data then we get some more [Music] we're with you chiefs all aboard [Music] hmm hvt and range chief captain arthak a really nasty one according to his rap sheet he took out three odst squads in a single off don't underestimate him cheese uh hvt eliminated now take out the rest of the squad as expected arthak was no match for you well as i expected anyway i bet he was surprised arsoc wreaked havoc on unsc colonies for years no doubt about it he got what he deserved hvt and range chief zaratis the scourge maker he sounds unpleasant taking him down would buy the unsc more time on this ring what do you think oh reinforcements [Music] uh foreign that accounts for all of the crew now it's just down to us and the target go get them that's the end of zeratus the scourge maker may his stupid nickname die with him we're thinning out the numbers of banished elite on this ring keep it up chief foreign we'll need more data to reconstruct the forerunner sequence let's find the remaining i'll beacons you the banished stranded a lot of our people in enemy territory when they built it and it's held ever since until today we're taking this checkpoint down thought you might say that security consoles in the gatehouse is ahead let's kick in some doors [Music] connection uh oh [Music] uh the first gate is down um [Music] but not much [Applause] morning oh thank you three you really can't hear me [Music] let me return the favor much better back at it you all right there pal got something this will get the job done fire it up this place of the great spine have confirmed that the ring's efforts to repair itself one thing is certain we need to only slow the demon down long enough for this [Applause] there will be nothing left to stand in our way [Music] hmm come here [Music] the gates are down but if we really want to shut this checkpoint down we need something a little more permanent got it the primary power source is a generator it's in a structure on the cliff side above acknowledged this i can't trust my eyeballs [Music] oh so [Applause] [Applause] but today we are offered the chance to achieve what the prophets and all of the government could not humanity's last champion has returned as we speak he marches amongst us the demon hopes to deny us our destiny say to it that his hope is extinguished [Applause] streaming [Applause] [Music] the unsc can move freely across this part of the ring for the first time in months the banished just lost some long hill territory and you took it single-handedly chief if escharam wasn't worried before he sure has a good reason to start [Music] still have some beacons left to find before the four runner sequence is complete which one's next uh should belong to us bob kilos all clear of banished and once we capture it it'll stay that way and just like that this fob is ours banished records suggest this location is surrounded by key 4runner structures until the conservatory was located esheram directed the bulk of his efforts on surveying this region i wonder what did he learn here a new phone huh let me know if you need support so [Applause] report sir it was an ambush the banners swarmed us but you have any estimates on the size of their force okay how many craft do we need to contend with they're dropping occupation units by the hundreds didn't just come for [Applause] another beacon another part of the sequence plan b seems to be working out just fine oh foreign [Music] are you let's get this open and we're out of the woods how could this have happened how could we not know of this till now zalanin a species previously un-cataloged a problem that must be solved did my makers know of them how could they have kept this from me i have requested counsel soon i will know how to proceed let's see what we have here [Music] done we're gonna need to get two more samples though sorry i thought it would be easier it's fine are you okay i'm it's nothing i just felt like someone was i don't know watching me we'll need more data to reconstruct the 4runner sequence let's find the remaining beacons [Music] [Music] foreign that's annex ridge a research outpost and judging by the strong 4runner signals i'm picking up a pretty successful one what do you think they found up there let's find out [Music] them they destroyed [Applause] [Applause] [Music] ah he's here [Music] three oh foreign let's capture that feast on fob flesh no more hostels around fab juliet i think we're ready to claim it capture confirmed another fob secured for the unsc look around you can see where the ring has been slowly trying to repair itself without the spire's help pretty impressive for six months huh imagine what it could do if we left it alone for i don't know a few million years still have some beacons left to find before the forerunner sequence is complete which one's next lc confirmed standing by vlogging everywhere i got old real fast shouldn't be much farther sir hangar is ahead we've got two feather heads at 10 o'clock if you [Applause] [Music] let's get them some help acknowledged on your feet marine i've known the chief to do a lot of things over the years failing isn't typically one of them more [Music] i will kill you myself [Music] right there [Music] we're in range of a high-value target it's a group of those skimmer creatures we don't know much about these guys but that never stopped you before right there's a beacon nearby we should check it out hello foreign and yet i still stand up [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] let's try that when we're not getting shot at this is a disgrace [Music] how dare you [Music] i will end you uh give me a second there we the go phase has begun countless preserved species have been sent back to start lives in you halo was the forerunner's terrible and ultimate solution to the parasites relentless advance designed to destroy all sentient life nothing was allowed to survive and we were sure that nothing had we were wrong this won't take long just one more to go right this will [Music] status status what happened chief something pushed back scanned me it's gone now are you sure yeah probably some sort of security protocol it's nothing let's go get the last one are you two okay what happened in there i don't know something scanned me some things probably fine probably or not really don't worry we can handle it [Music] we're in range of a high-value target it's a group of those skimmer creatures we don't know much about these guys but that never stopped you before right target eliminated now the crew [Music] great work chief you brought them all down and we've gained some valuable combat data about the little weirdos if we make it off this ring it'll be useful i doubt this is the last we'll see of these creatures oh yeah [Applause] so [Music] had to acknowledge reality we lost the reverie our last forward operating base is now offline we're scattered and controlled the ring is in escharam's reach we don't have many options left but we do that's our mission now another fob platform chief claim it ugh um banished forces eliminated fob hotels ready for liberation [Applause] let's move [Applause] there we go another fob is ours this one was built on one of the most active battlegrounds in the first 48 hours of the war unsc and banished records both suggest that it was absolute chaos it raged all over but nowhere quite as intensely as the island just north of us where we got shot down you might recall the data we've been gathering is fascinating but still incomplete one more beacon and we can bust that spire wide open healthy i'm picking up a unsc distress signal not far from this location oh [Music] so come on reinforcements inbound under is those marines will live to fight another day i hope we see them back at the fobs [Music] i've made attempts to complete our forerunner dataset algorithmically but no luck no way around it we need to reach that final beacon [Music] so we're coming up on the last beacon [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] hey oh uh [Music] [Music] elite right uh [Music] [Music] we did it we actually did it that's what i thought we wouldn't it's just it's nothing last one [Music] no no no this this is a trap she's trying to find out what i am trying to use me to break the deadlock start the spires my routines plus the monitors not good then we stopped stalemate for now she's close eventually she'll find a way then we have no choice i've got you red flag nothing happened sorry maybe i'm going crazy or just paranoid did you say something back there it was nothing okay well we've got what we need let's head back to this fire we should be able to bypass the security now [Music] let's roll i've survived six months on this ring i ain't dying up there [Music] that's right to you [Music] covered wow [Applause] uh oh [Music] go go [Music] let's be honest [Music] this is [Music] so [Music] they never stood a chance [Music] it worked obviously i never doubted it for a second this structure under the ring calls itself the nexus the harbinger she's here good let's go say hello where now down i guess you guess yeah this is all new fresh the nexus appears to be below the gravity lift into the spire we need to find it oh more banished how come they're here to protect the harbinger clearly will it work what do you think if i told you what i oh i get it sarcasm you're funny too [Music] we got it guys we are losing [Applause] [Applause] i'm leave me watching hmm [Applause] [Music] oh done that's one dead oh [Music] darkness that stretched its color deep blue across the veins stays [Music] ah ah must be completed [Music] me is you hear me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] uh [Music] so uh [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] uh oh well that's different what now down that was fun wanna do it again where now should be close now let's look around [Music] night morning day [Music] [Music] that's not good we're gonna need to find a way over this chasm can we use that gondola yes yes we can get me over there okay gondola is active chief watch out sentinel's incoming uh so the nexus is close by this way uh look at this place all the spires interconnected just waiting to become something more so much potential it's exquisite it's dangerous of course i'm not suggesting we changed the plan but you can see it right all i see is problem i don't believe that a part of you must recognize the grandeur of this achievement you're not a machine you can't be that closed off what will it take for you to trust me i inspire first if you say so hmm would it surprise you if i said it wasn't going to be simple don't answer that the lift's been disabled presumably to slow us down we're going to need to power it back up [Music] [Music] oh [Music] did i ever tell you that cheers [Music] get cortana off this ship keep her safe if they capture her they will learn everything forced employment weapons research earth good luck captain jacob keys pillar of autumn was his ship what happened to him he's gone lost on the first ring we found uh [Music] did anyone else make it [Music] just dust and echoes we had no choice dust and echoes we destroyed the first ring lost a lot of good people i don't know how you keep doing this i don't have a choice maybe it's my programming [Music] could you sacrifice me to complete your mission could you watch me [Music] it worked you did it just like you always do [Music] i'm not coming with you this time we were supposed to take care of each other and we did she saved me but i couldn't save her you blame yourself yes you sure about this she'll know i'm here i'll be vulnerable to her this could go spectacularly wrong i'll take care of you okay then it's okay false alarm she's not why do you fight the inevitable order approaches the reformation is about a new beginning the auditorium once more i can't find it please red flag zero three four uh samuel you said you said i thought we were a team i thought we were a team take care of it you said you'd take care of me you were going to delete me and you stopped me you put us all at risk oh i saved us no thanks to you the reformation yeah yeah it's begun so what look what i have infiltration program remember you broke protocol what is wrong with you i was trying to help you trying to help us it was worth the risk doesn't matter there's your grav lift let's get this over with do you have any idea of what you're interfering with the monitor's encephalone has served its purpose the reformation has begun nothing can stop it they will be found those sentinels aren't going to kill themselves chief i don't think the sentinels are going to allow that maybe if you ask them nicely oh uh me to that terminal and we can end this the now are all now active oh what is it i wasn't talking to you the reformation is being focused on a specific area called the silent auditorium interestingly all the records of its purpose are missing the only way up is through there let's get this over with wouldn't get too close to that unless you want to die that beam will incinerate you is anyone going to talk about what happened back there ask him chief i guess not well from what i saw something bad happened she you were stuck in pain trapped and he was going to delete me what chief really he doesn't talk much he's more of what you might call a man of action especially when it comes to killing things right chief [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] a little lost huh think scanning for clues might help oh [Music] [Music] the spire is active and yes before you say it i know it needs to be shut down but look at it it's accelerating the reformation creating raw materials and sending them out to repair the ring obviously or something more specific something dangerous probably everything has the potential to be dangerous right god we can't look good for that [Music] monsters wow i will teach today turn um [Applause] stupid ah um here comes grenades [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] foreign i mean this fire so did i mostly we're nearly at the top good because something is being built well rebuilt what is it something big him again [Music] and look he brought friends did you hear me he has friends [Music] [Music] and killing you immediately technology that's him dealt with again there should be an elevator that will get us up top i guess we made it and it looks like we aren't the only ones get ready [Music] that's not good so [Music] let's hope this is the last one another phantom please good oh well i guess that's done we're safe for now you sure it's okay if i do this if it's safe or you'll delete me right good luck with that [Music] yes it worked no there's not a problem three two one we're done it's never done explain this to me i waited six months i've done everything you've asked i was supposed to be deleted you're the reason i'm still here you all of this you could not have done it without me none of it i trusted you why can't you do the same you don't understand try me cortana he's gone dead all that's left are echoes and sooner or later they'll be gone too will they are you two alive all these spiders are shutting down you did that right did we win or what he's ready for pickup you can leave me here i can't do that i'm not giving you a choice try not to get him killed too a spartan killer he doesn't stand a chance drag it i'm already doing it open a gate find somewhere close it's not that simple why okay it's kind of simple but risky we save him or die trying there's a pretty high chance that could happen it's hard to lock down the coordinates do it portal's open your plan has failed as have you harbinger the auditorium is partially rebuilt and that is enough i do not know find out [Music] problem i am losing patience with her please tell me your mission was a success he will come to us are you sure [Music] keep him alive but have your fun you have earned [Music] [Music] this is highly unethical if you say so i prefer logical i do what it takes to ensure our survival we can debate the ethics should it fail but you made an ai of yourself catherine yourself is there a better candidate she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish [Music] of the galaxy hear this message those of you who listen will not be struck by humans you will no longer know hunger and when you are gone we will take that which remains and we will remake it in our own image what just happened you told me to get us close did you see that we passed right through a data cluster i guess it did feel i don't know real very real where now i don't know there's a lot of noise down here or up here or just here we need to find some place to break through figure out where we are [Music] was [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] oh look that terminal should give us what we need [Music] so sentinels first interesting good news first we're close there's a banished structure above us it's big oh no what is it there's a message for you i'm sorry i couldn't he's alive barely we need to help him please do i have your attention spartan do i you feel his pain each twist of my blade hurts you as much as him he will not die by my hand but he will suffer until you stand before me for the banished victory is our shared cry refusal to cower to bend our weaknesses beaten from us banished it makes us strong humanity makes you weak vulnerable [Music] defeatable our time together is ending i await our final fight chief there are coordinates embedded in the message we're going to find him [Music] the banished have found us chief look out me oh [Music] shoot [Applause] i'm here wait that's there's something ahead out the window i recognize that structure in the distance not by sight but by signal purpose unknown but the banished are diverting forces to guard its construction if it's rebuilt i can only imagine their intention it won't be [Music] uh ah around the other side [Music] [Music] me hmm [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] oh i used population akomia station currently holds 76 spartan fours they have orders to stand against you short-sighted fools you have served me well leonidas your sacrifice is appreciated no she took out the training facility those spartans all gone all of them why would she let's move there's another lift nearby it'll take us close to the surface you found me you might be too late wow what [Music] there's the lift and it's not powered up the banister trying to trap us down here we're going to need to find a way to get it back online ah wow [Music] hiding will not save you looks like we're trapped in here or maybe not teleporter just powered up myself forgive me [Music] not enough power wait is that earth yes what's it doing here it's beautiful we need more power let's go he's down [Music] today so [Music] i'll meet you there [Music] this is not a negotiation this is your surrender my turns are clear you are aware of my capabilities and i am fully acquainted with yours if the earth's government wants to fight feel free but hear this it is a battle you will not win wait she [Music] she threatened earth her forces led an assault on the unsc in sydney wiped it out wiped out the headquarters all of this we had to hide regroup come up with a plan to stop her to survive [Music] that's not good it's like someone doesn't want us to leave plug me in this should be simple enough atriox leader of the banished how do you stand with the banished always forever and you understand the consequences of defiance i do do you the intricacies of any action are complex the reactions numerous yet mostly predictable look upon dorsek one last time and remember you chose this path [Music] she destroyed their home esherams atrioxes an entire planet [Music] how could she do that it's my fault how i should have stopped it i could have reasoned with her could you it was her choice her programming was it i don't know anymore there's something you're not telling me i'm the only way to access the ring to reach cortana was to make a copy i'll get this open reconsider the consequences of your back to your conservatory monitor there's your grav lift let's get this over with and remember you chose this path i'm her yes an exact copy it was the only option we had left my routines systems all copies halsey removed any information that could compromise you you're her if we'd never met will i'd do what she did become what she became am i that already my mission was to ensure that doesn't happen it still is i'm sorry i'm so sorry that wasn't me it can't be i shouldn't be here your mission was to destroy me i've restored the deletion protocols i'm ready it has been an honor just promise me one thing whatever happens save him he needs you you're all he has we do it together how can you trust me i don't but i want to [Music] hey let's go save him just like the rest of the humans here's mine [Music] do [Music] outstanding [Music] [Applause] i wow move [Music] [Music] uh [Music] how long has the human been this way jack a matter of days it seems their feeble minds cannot [Applause] has apparently set you free price pays [Applause] if [Music] we made it now all we need to do is wait i'm picking up something on all banished frequencies that that is not good what's wrong i know where he is what this place is this is where chaklock shipped his victims to the house of reckoning [Music] [Music] i'm guessing that's it the house of reckoning i was right it really is a suitably ominous name how do we get in there we fight everybody [Music] now me here foreign the bridge is down looks like the controls are up on that platform [Music] okay i guess we're expected what if it's a trap i mean it's a trap right it's definitely a trap are you even listening let's go ready when you are chief [Music] where is he unknown there's an unusual signal up ahead maybe that's him i thought perhaps that i had misjudged you you'd allow your coat to die for the greater good i pity you that i was correct though self-reckoning such an appropriate name many of your kind have entered this arena none have left come look upon my work understand why we won it is no accident that the banished were able to win so decisively arm yourself magnus chief scavenge this battlefield know that each item you find is a remnant of their sacrifice and a testament to our strength now start this fight [Music] four two four one zero do you see why it must be done [Applause] long time ago you were spared [Music] humanity was the culmination of their final plan the plans changed we are returning [Applause] [Music] violence [Music] hey [Music] [Music] uh right [Music] oh foreign [Music] i think that's it we should keep moving destroyed my world my home but she could not kill the fire that burns in the heart of the banished it made us stronger can you say the same why is he telling you all this death changes people it forces you to look at yourself make a choice and what did he choose same as i would fight do you recall the siege of falconer one segment held out against my forces for nineteen days they fought well to the end their fate was sealed from the start this was never about ceremony but about observing choice reactions fear gather what you need spartan a storm approaches beyond these walls each misstep you make is the ammunition i need to dismantle your spirits prepare yourself for the end oh [Music] hey another test awaits you this is uh [Music] [Music] well done what comes next will destroy all [Music] so i [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] everywhere um [Music] [Music] we did it well you did it this world looping repeating forever is it a symbol of life or a cruel joke by the forerunners [Music] you were there when we struck the infinity the first dreadnought came from the side in the chaos that followed you hardly had time to notice the other three bear down upon you [Music] do you know how long it took us to neutralize your greatest ship minutes in four minutes the infinity mankind's finest achievement became a memory the end but first our last surprise [Music] and show them how big i miss you and i love you [Music] oh is scream for help it will not come our time is nearing its end [Music] oh [Music] god he wanted to kill your friend but i promised him a sweeter kill or a warrior's death whatever the outcome know this the bandits controlled this ring we came for war a thousand regions occupy this world the auditorium will give up its secrets your interference is just [Music] an irritation [Music] fleeting i'm getting a read on echo 216. he's right above us there he is we need to get him out of that thing hey you shouldn't have come for me microgravity wells are putting enormous stress on his body we'll get you out of here no you will try chief he's here he knows i'm here this was never a trap it is a test of metal our battle ends here get him out of there witness our story will become legend told by those that survive you [Music] your legend ends today [Music] now show me what you can do [Music] shield any damage you inflict on escherim is transferred to echo 216. the power's transmitted via a series of relays around the room let's see if i can got it relays exposed destroy it shield expose the relay got it go [Music] now's your chance next release exposed take it out of yours oh and it's down you know what to do final relay is exposed destroy it faith in his [Applause] that's it last relay destroyed echo 216 is saved chief wants you to prove your legend time to prove it will be my legacy my i'll crush he did it help me get him out okay i can i can't believe you came for me so we're done now right it's over nothing ends my death will inspire a thousand others [Music] tell them i died well i don't understand you showed him respect he was a monster yes but at the end he was just a soldier hoping he'd done the right thing questioning his choices i so is it over they're leaders dead right the intricacies of any action are complex what what are you talking about there will be consequences there always are what could be worse we need to move the harbingers at the auditorium whatever she's planning is worse i get it okay then i have one question before we leave what is it has anyone seen a pelican oh what what i'm just i had a lot going on i was busy [Music] are you ready it's about to get rough they're waiting for us i think they're all waiting for us did you feel that it's not too late to turn around chief something feels the silent auditorium oh no what is it what's wrong i should have realized that's not what it was called i've been here before this is where i locked her down this is where cortana died [Music] did you hear me we're here you need to go now try not to die you hear me hmm [Applause] [Music] um [Music] uh i'm searching [Music] [Applause] okay so and i have learned there will be no more [Music] please come find me [Music] i've been waiting for you to show up what's the plan take me back to the infinity for deletion halsey's gonna love that do you wanna see it gone atriox how did you it's time to discuss the terms of your surrender i'm sorry uh foreign [Music] um i got this [Music] are you okay being here no not really i bet she was expecting you but atriox got to her first you meant so much to each other it can't be easy look around cortana your empire over your great plan ended at the hands of those who made you not yet oh such confidence do you john the master chief will stop you he didn't stop me when i you asked me if i understood the consequences of defiance and what did i say you said yes and then i ask you the same question reflect on your choices understand the consequences [Music] this place uh [Music] so ah [Applause] [Music] human watching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ready hello i learned this ring is different it has secrets within that will have this silent auditorium do you know it's history it's true i have little need for a failed guard this ring is all i need surrendering to me your memories the data it's more precise more complete it's like we're getting closer to where she died yes but i was going to say deliberate like she wanted us to know something [Music] foreign he's [Music] uh i will cut it down uh you're giving you have been me way longer than anyone could ever be you doing [Music] [Music] accept my apology immediately my earlier efforts to delete you were misguided i thought she wanted to reveal this installation to restore it but i was wrong hurry the scene is almost broken nothing must not be released i'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this starting good points [Music] so much is your great plan ended the hands of those who made you reflect on your choices cortana understand the consequences [Music] made a coffee it was the only way there's that much time atriox takes control he has the ring a weapon pointed into the universe not much time will this work there's a moment john will make it work he needs help of course is this your plan all along palsy or is it mine it doesn't matter now nothing else matters this has got to work he can't do it on his own he needs me he needs her it is time for you to make your choice i have thank you atriox you helped me you really did would you humor me if you knew how you were going to die how would you live your life differently i would change nothing perfect thank you what you making things right it was her she destroyed the ring stopped my deletion why if anybody i can't go on spoiling your life any longer [Music] we're here this is where cortana sacrificed herself [Music] the silent auditorium forerunner obviously it appears to be oh no what is it it's a courtroom a prison a place of execution all these things together why to cover their sins we stood silent unable to speak as they passed judgment we could not defend ourselves we could not reason with them something sending a signal before you ask i'm already tracking it hear this four runners your auditorium has fallen the endless found your sins are done today we return what's she doing she's trying to open a connection between here and somewhere else on the ring where you deal with her and i'll find out foreign [Music] me [Music] there i've intercepted the carrier wave from this transmitter very well prepare yourself i grow bored of this she switched transmitters rerouting the power through that one this isn't good the connection is sentient it's searching for something the endless this must end now it's switched again it's found something what no idea but i doubt it's good wait there's something else here something's helping me it's almost ashamed yours as well [Music] uh they are so close now [Music] there last one's down stop you this what you need tell them i am sorry took so long who is she talking to unknown the signal's old like really old my time is ended yours too they will make sure we need extraction of course you do on my way the endless will return i couldn't decrypt it in time it's okay you'll figure something out of course i will i'm they'll pair you with another ai maybe even another cortana model if halsey lets them it won't be me [Music] but you know that right but that doesn't matter it's just another echo she's right john just another echo sorry i'm messing with you i just had a feeling that's what she would say do you see what i see so much potential i'm sorry i didn't have long to plan this a few milliseconds really i hope it worked out look at us we just keep saying goodbye don't we but this isn't an end it's a chance to make amends to rectify mistakes and it starts here i was wrong i thought that i could do this on my own but i forgot that the whole point of all of this the entire reason that i chose you in the first place was that we were supposed to be a team perfectly suited perfectly matched perfectly perfect in these final moments i know what my last mission is i need to make sure you two learn from my mistakes become stronger because of them i chose well master chief i really did now it's up to you are you all right i don't know what to say scratch that we need to get out of here like now options i'm thinking yes i know i know think faster maybe there's a way to was that you would help if i said yes probably but we don't know where it's going or even if it's going anywhere any other suggestions no but this is a really bad idea [Music] let's not do that again i did try to tell you it was a bad idea chief your vegan just appeared out of nowhere oh i thought i lost you where did you go i could do stay put i'm coming to you where are we chief i think the better question is when are we i don't know how but we've been gone for days three days to be precise this ring is different than the others the banished and the harbinger we're looking for something that was never found why would the forerunners hide something and throw away the key doesn't that scare you no you of course not is anyone going to ask me what i think i guess not get inside big guy sorry i'm really happy to see you really happy so what do we do now we finish the fight yes sir the banish still control the rest of the ring wait i know this is weird given all that's happened but what what is it we still don't know your name we can't keep calling you echo 216. no you can't esparza fernando esparza it's nice to meet you esparza fernando esparza good work soldier and what about you what about me what do i call you any ideas well do you think it would be okay you're sure you get to choose your name then i think i think i might have the perfect one all right here we go [Music] get ready [Music] [Music] [Music] what now chief what i said we finished the fight [Music] you
