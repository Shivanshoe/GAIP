[Music] [Music] hello I imagine you've found my room what does all this mean that's a question I've asked myself many times what does all this mean Irving how far do you want to push yourself how much can you take what's every memory painstaking gathered every reconstructed piece every little element retrieved from the dark a photo hairband a lipstick it means remembering Rachel that's what all this means but in choose this path I had to do it [Music] what did you do Irving these waffles booze with memories the memories get into the walls under the floorboards they creep into crawl spaces you're not with FEMA you Jenkins you never talked to him you've lost the phone call all those weird events you were behind all of them someone had to bring the last piece of the memory puzzle here the most important one you me I I your father wanted to keep him out of it I convinced him that only you could resolve the equation as he called it I don't understand how could you over the last few days you got a little taste of what it means to dig around in the past hunting for memories that scratch away behind every wall in the night I we did it for years day after day after day I have nothing against lies I grew up around lies but now it's time for the truth to come out finally who are you really I want to tell you a story there was an invisible boy like everyone he just wanted to run on the grass ride a bike swim in the lake in summer his father though his father had other plans missile in his dark world made of stylin sand prayer the show only one star his wonderful sister a heavenly creature that spent hours telling him fairy tales in secret she who told him what he free and strong man he would become one day Rachel she was like that free and strong at the time I didn't understand her dyslexia or what [ __ ] meant that's what they called her at school but I could hear her cry at night I wanted to protect her but I couldn't one day that beautiful luminous creature met someone the human being that saw her for real my dad yes and I was the invisible witness what happened love simply a love nothing more nothing less but I'd love it's too much and it would be punished who paid for this love Nicole Rachel Rachel was your sister now I remember you you were too caught up with your hatred for Rachel to notice the innocent little kid that sometimes tagged along I didn't hate your sister I was just just doesn't matter those days are over how could I have forgotten you I was raised to be forgotten what do you want from me the day my sister paid their life for her love we all died we make up the history of the timber line it was a tragedy you we all got frozen there in that vent moment in that confined horizon of events as you'll understand it as you've already begun to understand for the first time in years I depended on someone else you have to keep going to get to where I wasn't able to go you will be new witness you owe it to us and you owe it to her [Music] a few years of pass and sell last used this old tape recorder I think you were in elementary school I imagine a testament should start in a poised manner My dear Nicole my favorite daughter etc etc poised wadies serious irrevocable I prefer asking you how you are how are you Nicky you're probably tired I can imagine at this point of your journey the marks and voices of this old hotel will have already whispered all their secrets you've always been good at solving puzzles and this you surely resemble more your mother than me Irving has always been convinced that you only you could surmount the fear and suffering that exude it from these hallways we tried we waited we were terrified we studied we listened we listened to her but all the love in the world wasn't enough to decipher those muted vowels those wide-open eyes those tears of light in your time and space and the here and now I will no longer be with you but it doesn't matter trust me it doesn't I have a new theory Nikki love is and remains it isn't the would you stand on in the walls that keep up this hotel who are you to look at only breathe and sometimes it hates it hates those who didn't allow it those who cast it aside with indifference and those who can't recognize it stars still emanate their light even after collapsing right there is a lot of light here there is light in death I want to free myself in all this darkness I can no longer see the stars I'm tired of surviving in this limbo so how are you Nikki I'm good I will be good figured out what Rachel was saying Nikki she's here [Music] hello Leonard was a very special man his soul was big enough to love both you and Rachel I knew my father's soul better than anyone you were just a jealous kid don't you dare try to make me feel guilty you don't I just want you to get to the truth so why didn't you tell me about the truth tell who the Nichole who thought eating beans was the worst tragedy and couldn't wait to finish this business and run away forgiving everything all over again you don't know anything about what my mother and I went through but you're different too when you got here now you can discover the truth a truth that otherwise would have destroyed you I didn't lie to you I protected you listen I'm sorry about Rachel I hated her and I hated my father but I never wanted it to end like that I understand your pain maybe better than anyone betrayal shame death my family was destroyed just like yours how much longer does this pain have to last it'll be over soon what else is there to know you want the truth well I can't give it to you I've already given you everything I could now you have to tie the pieces together what does that mean the father always said we are the sum of the people we take with us and you abandoned these people here in this place enough riddles Irving I'm tired me - you're the only one who can give a finale to this story it's time you open the last door Oh God how could I forgotten I I saw everything I was there all the pieces were in front of my eyes a kid's eyes it was the same night as the hockey game in Missoula Reverend foster was so busy with the preparations of the meals for the giving to the poor at the Timberline Church and my mother Claire said that we would get back from the game in time for the distribution she convinced my father to help the Reverend and he'd come with his whole family you and Rachel yeah I remember it like it was yesterday I couldn't find my stick I panicked and I went down to the garage Claire was there red in the face her look her look it was just a fleeting feeling that's why I erased it from my memory I had to erase it understand what was in her look it just wasn't her it was like a frightful creature a disturbed dangerous animal I've never seen her like that before or after not even on her deathbed then she put her hands on her hips exhausted she smiled and there she was again my mom but it must have just been the impression of a moment I had the final against cold springs high awaiting me I climbed in the car throwing my bag into the backseat my hockey stick was there Claire said she cleaned it she cleaned it go on I I don't go on we we got there on time and I played best game of my life and the last Claire was on the bleachers encouraging me and cheering and then I lost sight of her for two whole periods I think and later when I asked she said she'd moved because Marty O'Donnell's father was getting on her nerves but it wasn't true just enough time to go back to the car don't see her video say it don't say thing I I don't I traveled all the way with Rachel's body and the baby she carried his side of her in the trunk we rolled in the blanket she killed Rachel Thank You Nikki you've had your revenge I hope all this gives you the peace you were looking for I wanted you to help me uncover the truth you're saying you didn't know but Claire I was home like a kid plus she never wanted me to get to the bottom of it Rachel this is here you know I I think she's still protecting me I'm growing up now now we can all be reunited at last what wait where are you going listen we can work things out what happened is terrible but all the main players in this story are dead get it dead we are still alive we are alive me you we didn't do anything that's exactly what we did wrong Nicole we didn't do anything it's beautiful here Rachel told me about it so many times but I never thought it was so [Music] you're the only one left don't leave me here alone I'm scared Dwight as far as the eye can see
