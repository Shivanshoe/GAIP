ivory trader 2. [ __ ] i'll just borrow this fraser come here that looks promising it's locked not for long what was that map western ghats oyster territory [ __ ] no it's all right nothing we didn't already know [Applause] nope that's beautiful it's time to go nadine ross what a pleasant surprise uh uh careful brothers this tiger's got claws a self oh all these years and you haven't aged a day you two kind are you looking for work i hear that shoreline's under new management temporary setback nothing i can't handle of course of course piggy though my men and i could use someone of your caliber why are you here i mean this this isn't your area of expertise it is a nice collection i must say chloe fraser collector of antiquities a thief you're working for a thief sir we have a situation i'll be right there the disc oh right about that at first i mistook you for just an average rebel but you have managed to find the hoysala empire that's not bad their greatest treasure task of ganesh now that's not an easy fight what are you doing three persian invasions three separate wars and all these years later no one has found it we're close you're lost and the only chance you have of even narrowing down its location is to find someone who can help you crack this artifact someone with an extensive knowledge of voice hollow society exactly an expert in their culture and history my rates are reasonable a parasite who exploits our struggle in order to fat in her pockets hmm so that's a no felt like a no you've got balls i like that but i don't need any more so-called experts shoot them throw their bodies in the river no need we'll throw ourselves out come on we need to get across the river okay quick what the hell was that back there messy but effective you were going to sell me out weren't you it's called improvisation god who's being unprofessional now what the hell is that supposed to mean it means you let assad get the jump on us i'm starting to wonder whether you're worth the 50 percent i knew it you were going to give me up because olympic can't change your spots you know nothing about me fair warning last person who betrayed me wound up dead there's your river yeah and your guy better be there [ __ ] yeah well time to go come on come on are you joking don't stop keep moving follow me here we go how are we going out there on schedule should hit land in about an hour great the tusk of ganesh no wonder the high solar capital was ransacked look at this thing any luck i don't need luck i'd say we can use all the luck we can get are you still hung up on a serve so-called expert don't worry if assault's not in the gets already he'll be right on our heels plus he's got weapons transport hundreds of men like i said don't worry looks like some kind of key maybe let's see okay the trident was ganesha's weapon the bow and arrow was parachiramis and the axe was a gift from shiva the great battle what the battle in which ganesh lost his task i bet we find these symbols we find the task not bad fraser yeah well you like my dad for that hindu myths were his thing made her rubbed off you must be proud sun's almost up i'll go get ready nice work okay nearly there this is a long way to go to settle an argument just for my peace of mind alright well nice view and look how weird i'm sorry i doubted you chloe it's not a modern structure so we're definitely on the right track what i don't like it you don't like anything no we've gone nearly 100 kilometers with no sign of a soft last half full maybe we got the jump on them unlikely i'll find the tusk ourselves on you meet understood back at the car yep ah right where i left ugh okay you still down there yep still here just checking yeah give me your hand i'm good actually okay want me to drive nope oh don't mind i do it's a control thing sure ah let's just enjoy the serenity shall we got a dumb question so much to that how do you know that tusk is still there it would have turned up in a museum or something by now right plus i haven't seen any whistler exhibitions i've never even heard of the boy solar before this job yeah well that's the fault of their last king really young reckless lawn city's empire as well built a new cafe and then led the persians right to their daughter hey look flamingo convention oh refreshing could have warned me oh where's the fun in that so quite nice to be outdoors isn't it way from the city quiet you come back here often no look at whatever poison ruins can we get through that gate i'll check it out the old capitals what have we got hullabadoo and velour i thought these were ganesh and shiva someone's been paying attention ganesh was the guardian of hullabadoo the newer of the hoysala capitals shiva was the guardian of the former capitol below the stonework is beautiful but this isn't much of a defensive wall um sculptors quarters by the look of it we're still on the outskirts didn't take you for an archaeologist that would be my dad actually i'm just a thief remember hey the rental equipped with a winch looks that way great i'll make short work of these gates what you're just going to pull them down that's the plan unless you brought dynamite this is your gig take that as a no right that should do the trick fraser move it's an amble [ __ ] take cover thanks for the headset okay we're clear right where were we you were about to pull down an ancient gate yeah i was and there we go give me a second white ah you're awfully quiet i'm just surprised dissolved figured you'd be more of a leave no trace type when it comes to indian ruins sentimentality in this line of work get you killed whoa what they're just large flying rodents actually no they're not yeah they are they're closer to primates and lemurs okay well i'll look it up there we go made it well spotted [ __ ] it's brought a whole battalion with him might even be more inside already hey i'm flattered that he's taking us so seriously we need to get through that gate all right we'll slow down gotta take care of these jokers first you have a plan yeah sure hey guys wrong uh [Applause] okay hmm [Applause] oh okay uh oh i think that's it that's the way to do it not bad work thank you for the assist let's get going i'll get the gate open bring the car around sure thank you okay bring her up careful always right back to shotgun i'm perfectly capable of driving you know i'm sure you are honey wow it's a lot of grinder cover true but unlike your boy assab we've got an advantage the three symbols let's have a look at the map okay let's see we are right about here i can mark it up as we go check out that tower bet you could get the lay of the land from up top maybe okay i'll keep an eye out for a song perfect not that i'm too worried about him though you should be we won't have the advantage of surprise again don't think he was expecting much for you wait was that a compliment that sounded like a compliment his guys are idiots but a service we just need to stay the hell away from him where are you going wanna climb it with me i really want to but uh someone should keep watch for a solves forces good call so far so good uh-huh nearly there here's our three symbols well that took less time than i expected tucked into the mountain side i'll just mark that on the map with an axe [Applause] and behind door number two huh wonder what that could be for future reference let's see what's behind the trident course another old fortress just beyond those waterfalls trident mark on the map for you last but not least the boudoir and another old fortress sitting smack dab in the middle of the lake bed i'll jot a bow on the map in that spot whoa guess i should have looked for a call button before climbing up [Music] found the three symbols really yep each one was pointing towards a different fortress those will be the best places to look perfect never understood the appeal of people like assad easy he finds men who are weak and office than power gives them purpose purpose sounds more like [ __ ] to me how do you get tangled up with a sav anyway purpose rather not going to certainly seem to have a thing for you don't remind me proved useful at the time but yeah uh do tell rather not maybe over drinks not enough alcohol in the world right you're the military expert what's the strategy here he's spread out his men hoping to stop us in our treks not what i would do so what would you do if you were a star besides lose the beard hang back let you do the heavy lifting then swoop in and grab up the task once you've done all the hard work devious practical mitigates a lot of risks lucky you're on my team yeah you are i'm a little surprised assault's not doing the same thing maybe his ex [ __ ] knows more than we think right wait look there one of us off's trucks looks clear out here interesting circular motif at the disc we're definitely in the right place check it out it's ganesha's tried it matches the symbol in the tower ganesh this isn't good nope come out now they must be close come on down below all right where are you what the movement over there man down man dog hey you got anything hey do you hear me hang on [ __ ] another one down we know you're out there thank you what what did you find cleared over here [Applause] that's it the side's clear not bad fraser i'll take a not bad from you okay that's not it no this what's the trick here what looked like a button yeah i just wanted you to have a go at something what's this that's a good sound one of the spokes on the wheel just turned around and how about you that's two here's another one three down found you only one left last but not least that should do it okay back to the big wheel thing big wheel thing whatever the archaeological term for it is the big wheel thing works you did it did oh come on looks like we're going under i do [Music] ah well looky here what are you willing to bet i told you some kind of key gold star for you now let's see what it does what is it ancient hoysala jigsaw puzzle ah of course i'm making a trident it's ganesh hello sir now what now i guess we turn this crank and see what happens next you think it's safe you know that treasure hunting is not a good gig for the risk of us right neither is being a mercenary difference is when i pull the pin on goodnight i'll know it's going to happen next my way's much more fun [Music] did you hear that you feel that look at that holy hell there's a massive relief carved into the side of that mountain and you were worried we were gonna turn that crank and die i guess it's good i've got an archaeologist's daughter with me it must have been fun growing up eh it had its moments i learned a lot oyster our empire was kind of his thing took up a lot of his time though me if i go digging for treasure i better make a buck or two not sure i don't take big risks without a good bad day i imagine so like running an army huh that's a big responsibility second nature it's my father's company he retired i took over family business made a real mess of it what you should know heard you and those drake brothers are close well it's conversation for another time so where to next there's the fort marked with an axe on the mountain there and that fort marked with a bow in the lake bed suppose i should have asked about the drakes before i took the job not much to tell i know nate pretty well sam less so he seemed to just appear out of thin air right all right let's find a way out last one back to the car by his dinner i brought mres you're no fun incoming reinforcements figures [Applause] so here we go you miss me uh ugh all right we're clear for real this time you handed yourself on all things considered all things considered that's high praise coming from you it is uh sir mountains yes and yes hey just so you know nathan drake is no longer in the picture you don't have to worry about it behind my concerns why do you accept my offer i'll not want to look a gift walk in the market especially with everyone wanting to see me fall i hear that but on the plus side oh there's a plus on oh when people have low expectations it's much easier to take them by surprise as far as i'm concerned this business is tough enough on your own you have to take any advantage you always lived alone mostly how old were you when you started young learned quickly enough i needed to let people think they were getting their way and then i could get the upper hand too subtle for me i always prefer the direct approach yeah whatever works i say over there in that cliff wall [Applause] the rebels beat us here oh i it should do the trick hey look shiva's axe spotted this on the tower too who's the god of destruction yes but maybe not in the way you're thinking definitely not all right a fortress not the right layout for a temple he was protecting his guru and killed the animal in one blow it's where the name hoysala comes from hoy meaning strike in their language yup come on in water's fine i mean don't drink it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh they've left their climbing gear they should come in handy there correction our climbing gear well trade them i'm sure there's a man here with floppy you okay slightly deaf but i'm good good let's keep moving oh my what the hell is this okay let's see what this does that statue well i'll be going to hell that's elaborate that was all right i think that did it come on over oh for goodness sake three statues with two different symbols star close shave okay what next [Music] figured we had one more to go everything always comes in threes oh that one went by fresh air there we go guess this will be a picture of an x good guess [Music] [Music] oh this one's a bit trickier nice to see you shiva right let's do in the water on whoa what's to say it's not different this time what if it's fire or something you're messing with me i'm totally messing with you [Music] here we go i'm a little disappointed it wasn't fire another waterfall yeah two out of three now arsenal went to an absurd amount of trouble to hide the tusk well the tusk was the symbol of hoysala dominance representing their wealth and their might a nice trophy for the persians yeah my dad always thought that the tusk was something even greater though what your dad was after the tusk my dad was obsessed with it he spent every day and night researching it all our money wasted on fruitless expeditions heard that one before so what came of it i don't know well he sent me my mum away he said it was no longer safe and off to australia we went and now here i stand on the outskirts of halibudou that's pretty funny and the last forts resting in the lake bed so that's the one with the bow australia your accent makes sense now yeah frese is not exactly an indian surname either it was my mom's let's head back to the car gotta love a shortcut glad we don't have to go back the way we came i would have made you dodge the axes huh hey hold on careful that place is crawling with rebels i think we've lost them she who fights and drives away lives to fight another day careful the sob's men might be around once more with gusto here we go hey i'll take care of this one okay you're welcome up we go up nice to be out of that [ __ ] finally i was starting to think the boss was all talk you boys really don't want me shooting from down here that's it we're clear probably alerted the others can't be helped come on there on the mountain here come the others okay we're all clear it won't be the last there was a big truck parked out front we'll keep our eyes open we'd better we'd walk right off a cliff you do have a sense of humor would have preferred a head start over his soul not much we can do besides doesn't matter who starts only who finishes their points follow me nadine more friends up ahead check it out got it did you find something nothing you are okay here stole this from the stock extra mag i'm okay thank you are you sure got one down over here look around people search the area watch it another one down come out five [ __ ] all right are we clear we're clear good good to be clear let's press on just what i was going to say opening that gate perfect that should do it well you made it across at least sorry i'm sure you can find your way over here oh definitely figured you'd want to take the easy way over show me how it's done watch and learn beg your pardon doing all right fine just don't get started without me sure what a dream of it ah there you are having fun just like the monkey bars in primary school i'd say this looks safer than the playground at my school nearly there made it i'm impressed you're impressed i'm tired let's get this done so this will be a bow oh what the hell that's not fair [Music] come on let's get this over and done with yep [Music] oh [ __ ] see i told you it was dangerous you hurt just my dignity here we go there'd be water and now that's three you know you're pretty good at this old treasure hunting thing i'm a quick study one question though i reckon that you could pretty much do anything you want why are you so keen to get short iron back seriously my partner tends my own money against me my lieutenant makes off with a bounty nathan and samuel drake get off scot-free and you're asking why i want shoreline back what's on my watch i lost it on my watch alright what the hell is that thing you keep playing with it's my stress toy it showed up in the mail a few weeks after we got to australia all right we better get a move on we don't want to serve to get ahead of us you know i've had my fair share of screw-ups you just pick yourself up and move on i don't like to fail no one does not let's find a way to get back down to the car sounds good ah this is open now hi if you want to look anywhere else out there now's the time to do it right hey want to do a bit of sightseeing right behind you let's get out of here here we go coming should we dance try not to break it this time sassy you ready yeah just um taking it all in welcome to downtown hullabadoo last known resting place the tusk of ganesh spectacular huh what doesn't it look like there's a dam or something between the two ganesh statues must have been eroded by the false so how do we get in come on yeah look at the crown it's not wear and tear you're right maybe it was a watchtower but that's how the persians got in i have heard about this place for so long i can't believe i'm actually looking at it should take a picture send it to your dad great idea what you're one of those cultures who can't work a computer just take the picture show it tim in person then no it's a just a few decades too late for that look i'm oh oh god please no that's fine shall we uh head over to hullabadoo come hard to believe it's real imagine what it took to make this the craftsmen the engineers yeah their work still stands but they're gone maybe their king should have used their wealth to protect his people and not make such an inviting target on the stairs down what's left okay ready look for a way up up we go then i apologize up here coming oh come on this way you're sure it's safe you know you keep asking me that it'll save us both some time if you just assume it's not oh boy it's definitely not safe by the way i saw think you can get back up here yeah keep going i'll catch up yeah i've got you all right i can manage just accept my help fine come on up but only because you said please i didn't actually why'd you say ganesh was the removal of obstacles he's more than happy to place him in your way if he thinks you'll benefit that why the horse is not chosen for halibut you he's also the lord of good fortune the one you pray to for prosperity and success that's cool you having fun out there you know amazing fun right that was the craziest thing i've ever done in a good way or bad way i'll let you know wow they're doing great china we'll be doing better when we get to the crown surprised we haven't seen saab yet knock on wood dog will see him up here why is that he doesn't have a stone's performance i think i see a place we can swing over to the crown just a little farther to go huh oh thank you hold up and climb i'm slipping worth it impressive oh no how do we get off this thing okay easy does it all right feels more sturdy up here don't jinx this here's our way in courtesy of the persian army wow persians must have had a trebuchet trebuchet can't you just say catapult like a normal person a trebuchet is a type of catapult it can handle heavier projectiles like this one and fling them longer distances right you learn that in your military training i looked it up on wikipedia like a normal person ready incredible it's our old friends hara sharama and ganesh friends looks like they're fighting well when the hindu gods aren't off fighting demons they're sometimes fighting each other in there she isn't even armed i guess it's not really his style ugh uh through here hey look armament you were right knitting i have my moment this one persian ah looks to be a mix of persian and voiceless now we're getting somewhere hey another one of these doors now let's see oh good this one actually works nice to get some light feels like a crypt in here hey up here what the hell jesus this was it their final stand wasn't enough to save their empire but hair loss is our gain here's our way in nadine can you land a hand with this chap sure come on old fellow [Music] here we go excuse me sorry we must be getting close hopefully closer than these guys this device looks familiar let's hope it doesn't turn on the water in here well that's different what is all this if i had a guess i'd say it's some kind of lock mechanism to open that door okay on the left we have shiva gifting parashirama the axe and on the right we have parashirama chopping off ganesha's tusk wait with the x yeah the one that shiva ganesha's father gave to punisher rama yeah it's messed up that's family come on let's see about opening that door so how does all this work oh only one way to find out let's see what this does all right that slid the piece away from me it's shadow move too let's try this over you go i see what the shadows match them right so let's see if i can line them all up i think that's did it all in a day's work salah and the tiger here we go fingers crossed that supposed to happen no just don't get us killed you're no fun ready careful [Music] amazing what a shaver my thoughts exactly razer ross [Music] oh no no it's okay i think we're gonna be okay okay where the hell's the tusk i don't know none of this makes any sense yeah it does the hoisella sent us on a fool's errand i think you're right terrific no hear me out ganesh is the symbol of halabadoo and shiva that's the symbol of below which was the old the old capital exactly what if the king built this spectacular city and it was a wonderful target for the persians and the old capital was forgotten so this whole city was a decoy what if they let it get plundered to protect balor and their treasure i'm willing to bet the tusk was never here at all so where's below oh [ __ ] this is definitely not supposed to happen we're at the edge [Music] i'm okay go keep go oh you all right oh hannah is still alive raw talent a little bit of luck hey nice work partner and i put it there jesus what was that that's awful i'm really embarrassed about you right now correct me if i'm wrong but wasn't there a huge waterfall here there was what the hell is that aqueducts the water's channeling there from the falls amazing did we do this just now well technically i did cocky look sorry if i cut too close to the bone back there oh that's all right you know you two would have got on like a house on fire he was also a really stubborn [ __ ] you know none of this could have possibly gone unnoticed we should probably get out of here good point follow me right the water is being channeled toward the gate so let's follow the aqueduct copy that i'll take point [Music] so they flooded their city to protect their secrets you think the soldiers knew they were being used but check out this watch took it from that old man in the city dumb bastard didn't give it up easily you take left ah that works too nice job probably more where that came i from you all right sorted god they come up one two three come on this one all right yes let's go [Music] are you oh again oh [ __ ] where are we no idea but at least we're not in the line of fire that thing carved on the floor what are you supposed to do up here think there's a way through poor i'd bastards being left to rot in a cell to getting tortured duly noted hear that i do up here there's a breach the eye of shiva it's impressive my man worked for a week and turned up nothing i probably hired the wrong expert perhaps you know ahoy salah poet once wrote of a young king who showed mercy and thus ended our rituals but the old kings they understood that progress demands sacrifice is that what you tell your men all right so in times of war these aqueducts they would run red through the capital those who would not fight had to be used to inspire those who would [Music] let's make this quick no making this easy so slow yes that was satisfying sick bastard proud of yourself a little yeah come on you see to rule the people you must first sow chaos i will incite my civil war stamp out the weak bloodline of the young king starting with you oh i think so hey take it easy we've been out for almost half an hour half an hour yeah oh [ __ ] [ __ ] sab's got the disc just hang on oh we gotta get going relax all right think you can manage yeah i've had worse nights believe me i won't ask it's good to have you back there's there's two of you now right yeah okay let's go and get our desk and some guns and some guns oh can i just say you were not joking about assad i mean wow he looks so unassuming right that's exactly what he wants pretty sure his glasses are an affectation to make him look harmless or smart both but he is smart was a doctor before he took up his course so he left behind a lucrative career i'm sure at one point he thought it was the right thing to do hi you sure you're good to go good as i'll ever be just need to take it easy for a bit up here go slow the gates that way yeah one sec just want one last look at this place this is how it looked to the persians before they invaded ready yeah what's so funny ah all my dad's research and the tusk wasn't even here come on let's get that thing open holy [ __ ] actually that's a holy cow that's nandy shiva's gatekeeper that's got to be the entrance to the old capital it had to be triggered by the aqueducts yep ah [ __ ] assault's already heading inside okay well better get down there come on no what do you mean no same track it's the goddamned expert is same strike yeah peace you know what this is a good thing i can kill two birds with one stone nadine what what sam's kind of the reason why we're here in the first place oh you better be joking this was my deal sam went ahead to do recon for me on the disc but then he went missing and i couldn't leave you knew my history with sam and then you dragged me into the center your history with the save made you the obvious don't hold back or anything oh i wanted you know what nadine this doesn't change anything you'll still get your share yeah or maybe you and sam will cut me out as soon as you get the tusk come on man that's not how i operate that's exactly how your type operates and to think i trusted you listen i was going to tell you about sam i swear i was just waiting for the right time it's fine i could use the exercise

what happened with your father he was the guy that couldn't walk away the ministry of culture offered to finance one more of his expeditions because this time he said he was on to something big he was always on to something big perhaps bandits raided his camp and um local authorities found him weeks later and this stupid thing is all i have left him i'm sorry oh hey he certainly made his choice so listen fraser you don't if you're doing charging i think tell it to stop because i speak elephant look at it [Music] no wonder she was so distressed hey about the whole sam ah look i got it all right i've got my own [ __ ] to sort out as well let's not have that stand in the way anymore hey okay deal come on well if we accomplish nothing else today at least we reunited a family no just that bull

what much safer way to pet an elephant much obliged play it's been a while but elephants are smaller than i remember you're probably used to seeing african elephants these are indian elephants nice of a solve to leave some supplies for us load up if you need it good call up here ugh ugh uh [Music] hey upstairs i see light through the water hello balor you know it's not every day you get to see a totally hidden city that nobody else has seen for centuries apart from us off apart from herself and a few of his men and a few of his men you ready you just totally crushed that moment you know that right how do we get in i don't know looks like dwellings along the side so let's go up is good ugh that was good more of them damn it eggs hey party say hello oh no no take no up there watch it ugh more clear right back to it ah let's see where this goes must be a way into the city somewhere ledge with waterfalls that's the way forward never thought i'd see a police it's a shame in a way that the law is hidden from the world now we know why you have another gold i'm guessing it's one of the hoists in our kings how many kings did they have in there eleven the young king was the last in their line well his plan worked saved his city from the persians there we go up this way huh just keeps getting more and more spectacular damn it they've blown the entrance that must have been tastes great [Music] a bath or a well possibly both [Music] [Music] look i'm putting some kind of cenote fraser over here coming huh look there the queen and her handmaidens maybe these were the royal bards some statues of women for a change well what on earth is this what is it cannot script looks like stanzas could be poetry it's the sitar's distant ancestor maybe they gave performances in here fraser over here whoa look at this it's incredible it's an altar of some kind looks like the king suffered dearly for their people they weren't just protecting the tusk historians believed that it was a symbol of power and dominance but i reckon they misunderstood it was a symbol of their people their culture it was a symbol of them wait sort of this huh uh [Music] my dad was here something big all right why didn't that stupid bastard tell me he said it yourself he wanted to keep you safe i can't let us off get that tusk no no we can't thank you thank me after we get out of this alive fair point forget ganesh oh then i brought this through here magnificent all this grandeur hidden away from the world but how do we get over there come on it's deep enough [Music] hmm [Music] okay uh [Music] that's our way back in thanks for going first eh you're welcome hi you all right sorry i just need to get my head back in the game hey nadine ross oh my god what the hell your head back in the game now oh smarter huh [Music] i've got my eye on you kind of a tight squeeze here oh hello nice city you've got here huh [Music] ah whole place is floating on top of the doorway over here that'll work [Music] ah okay easy does it now what got water in my ears i hate that but i wouldn't give her a towel oh my god are you seeing this you know at this point i've run out of words holy god damn [ __ ] that's what [Music] i'll have to find another way up [ __ ] i just realized something i think i'll know what it is that we're gonna need that disc soon exactly over here nadine ah now we're getting somewhere i see a few more of those [Music] maybe it's because this statue is enormous but i just now noticed shiva's got a key cobra for a nickname okay now what well there's got to be more to this just need to figure out what it is coming i'm going to sew to the other side okay there's another crank up ahead i'm standing right here i know okay i better get a move on no going back now ah that was a close one nearly destroyed my pants oh i did i'll be right down slippery nicely done thank you uh aha here we go okay i've got this one bringing down oh this one's like the trident time to move come on jump to the drum i thought it was an hourglass it's an hourglass shaped drum oh [ __ ] here we go hang on [Music] [Music] and now we turn the water on for this side [Music] and here we go now we've got water running down both sides look oh shall we is that it we'll find out in a moment [Music] the third eye of shiva [Music] the light is shining on that statue across the way [Music] want to protect something they don't do it halfway come on what's all this then ah here we go the thing holding it's a prison you were right of course i was about what what you said back in that place with all the statues and exes things always come in threes three points at the tournament the light split into three beams and shiva's third one [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] got it [Music] well [ __ ] this one's busted let me see hang on you got that yeah [Music] okay that did something no wait for it just hold still for just a sec all this water it's a cleansing ritual oh you could put down the mirror now [Music] [ __ ] oh we need the discs [Music] uh okay we can get out through that door let's go [Music] hey oh [Music] well now that was quite the fall you had me worried come it's time for reunion he wouldn't give you up despite my efforts to persuade him sam jesus hey you made it dude it's all right he is like a girl is that right how about we get these cuffs off and i'll show you how girls hit the hell is she doing here you said fine to help my god help i must admit you are quite the schemer first you steal my desk then you have your expert run me around in circles huh that's clever perhaps there's a little indian blood in you after all sure i'll take the credit huh well let's finish what we started all right all right don't talk to me i was gonna say you look good was that not clear what's that smell oh i'm sorry i haven't exactly had access to running water and soap recently oh the people you could have brought with you she saved my ass more than once yeah you do remember that uh she also tried to kill nathan and i many many times and to be fair you two try to do the same to her yeah but that's not the point the point is that the second we turn our backs there will be a knife in there i can hear every word you're saying i know i trust her you know what fine i guess i'm just a little bit irked that we are walking away with nothing but i guess you know what that's like right oh my real classy thank you time and place children more that came from bike racks after school just hurry up oh that's harmless it appears the kings have one final test looks like you won't be needing us though so we'll just be honest oh on the contrary surely you know the story you see shiva gave barushram the mighty axe that struck garnish in the face bringing shiva's son one of the greatest of the gods to his knees another casualty of war don't seriously chloe he's just gonna kill him he's right but if you refuse you will watch them die inch by inch all right chloe don't okay [Music] [Music] shiva and parasharama [Music] chloe don't you give this shmuck what he wants quiet [Music] you're testing my patience [Music] so [Music] wait a minute he's yielding it's going to fall right ganesh quite an obstacle you've placed in my path [Music] [Music] are you all right yeah that was unexpected holy [ __ ] she's got balls huh i don't understand it's an idiot that's cause you've got it all twisted my friend ganesh allowed himself to be struck by the axe that makes no sense not to a selfish prick no see ganesh could have defeated parasharama easily but if he had that would have made shiva's axe look weak powerless gonna sacrifice himself to preserve his father's honor see even she gets it not a drop of indian blood in her [Music] um magnificent isn't it oh what nothing to say now oh if you like i can tell you where to stick it well my friends i would love to kill you myself but we must not anger the gods for you have brought me a great fortune okay then what are you doing you're going to flood the chamber i will miss you come on is this really necessary you know nothing is ever truly destroyed only purified and reborn just shoot us and get it over with right as the water fills your lungs you will have time to reflect on the choices that brought you here perhaps in your next lives you will fare better prick i don't know about you guys but i got a lot of regrets swimming around in my head right now tell me about it i was really looking forward to kicking your ass again hey you know i'm not exactly thrilled about drowning next to you either could you give it a rest guys i'm trying to concentrate what are you doing a little preparation goes a long way yes got it hold on take a deep breath [Music] oh [Music] [Music] everyone good they're

about heading to the old rail yard something about a arms deal he's selling the tusk much for preserving his culture hey just a second listen uh back there thanks for professional courtesy of course so we good no no figured if we hurry we can intercept them before they make the sale huh and there's our ride [Music] these are nice there railroad tracks stop here a server-level lookout throughout the area best store on the side of caution right right right and then we lose the tusk you're welcome to stay behind i'm just saying all right all right all right less talking more walking so all that time in a service car you couldn't get any until i'm advice uh well i tried i saw a decade almost never talked sharp in front of me i can't imagine why hey he trusted me enough to believe i was an expert in all this hoy style crap what's the law yeah i found the train tracks sort of kind of a shock seeing all these modern structures after the horse alarms portuguese 1800 so not quite modern [Music] how'd you [Music] he's not talking about himself or his cause it's like i get it man you don't have to sell me on it i'm just here to make some scratch i can't stand it when people pretend incessantly yeah i know right here we go this way copy that should have packed my machete a little help no problem [Music] much obliged wow oh hey where's sam ah right forgot about that hey thanks for

that is mine as well you're splitting closure okay i know you're new to this but that's not exactly how it works consider it a service charge you hang on a goddamn it's a bomb what a serve traded the tusk for a bomb fireworks this this is big yeah those tracks run right through the city through the market so we'll find the nearest town notify the authorities it'll be too late if that goes off it'll kill thousands and that is a terrible shame but we did get what we came for i'm what you are not seriously going after that train okay fine fine you have a plan doesn't seem to be much of a requirement in this organization are you really going to let her do this no i'm i mean she's got a valid point [ __ ] i don't know okay this is not our fight you said so yourself even if you catch that train what happens disarming the bomb is impossible you're right good good so we'll we'll call the authorities this is an alpha it's my fight that bomb detonates in the city it'll spark civil war i can't walk away i'm tired of walking away you'll die i can live with that hey save my share of the task okay just in case right what you're not gonna leave me back there with her out no i call shotgun fine i'll sit in the back what right follow the bridge [Music] anyone see a road anywhere i make my own roads well keep your eyes on your road then hey sam did you want to drive i mean too

we can grapple to it are you joking let's do this [Music] oh watch those snipers this chops on its last legs we need to bail now oh stupid idea was this yours right trading the task for a bomb commandeering a train must have taken a sort of months to plan this making it all the sweeter when we bollocks it all up i think we're almost there why budge let me help oh this is really heavy i got it okay oh it's way bigger in person it's a military grade all right here help me it's too heavy i can't disarm it be the detonate if i tried all right plan b then let's get to the engine again okay you go that's definitely the engine we can slide this way come on no no no no well did it shut [ __ ] hey roof hatch don't think about what you're doing just do it come on this one's welded shut too
