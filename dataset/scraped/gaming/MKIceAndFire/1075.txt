awaits you what soku tell me about him gladly my lord two and a half centuries ago Tsushima was terrorized by the Red Hand bandits of a Kashima around this time a farmer named Kosaku heard the spirit of a dead samurai calling to him on the body still clad in brilliant armor overwhelmed by the armors beauty for Saku stole it before long the red hand reached pisacas home knowing the farmers would lose everything if the bandits went unchallenged gosaku donned the samurais armor the bandits charged Kosaku sword arm trembled in fear he resigns himself to death but blow after blow glanced off the armor and gosaku did not falter the bewildered bandits staggered back tripping over their feet a mysterious sense of palm suffused to go sockos body and mine impressed my go sockos bravery the dead samurais spirit guided his blade before long Kosaku cut down the final bandage and the red hand were never seen again years later when gosaku died the farming families locked the armored way for safekeeping each family holds a single key to the lock now terror stalks our island again the farmers of Tsushima claimed to have seen gosaku eye on a hill looking for a mighty warrior to protect our

skilled swordsman on our island in every generation one Lord was taught their family secret a deadly technique called the dance of wrath that could cut through any foes defense the dance of wrath found its greatest master in Lord Tokyo saw yurikawa the whole beloved by his people he resented clans amorous power desperate to seize control he set off a bloody rebellion that claimed countless lives Lord she Maura's father and brothers fell - Eureka was dance of Wrath technique but with clan Sakai's a Shimura put down the rebellion and execute him lord yurikawa before he died the traitor vowed to avenge his conquered people from beyond the grave now they leave offerings to his spirit and shrines in all the Arakawa's ruins they begged for their enemies to die and the spirit of Eureka was vengeance answers their calls with the dance of wrath you believe these men were killed by that spirit they were merchants known for cheating their customers profiting from deceit so someone prayed for their deaths the shrines overflow with offerings to the spirit begging him for bloody retribution how do I find these shrines people burn a handful of straw in flower petals to make smoke so the spirit finds their prayers look to the sky my lord be careful yurikawa people haven't forgotten your clans role in their downfall there was a long time ago [Music] you
