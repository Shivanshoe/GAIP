my lord please help my lord i've heard people are climbing mount jogaku in search of the same power the mongols used to light their blades aflame a blade on fire that would prove useful in such a cold place what makes them think mount joker holds a secret the musician song his words must be convincing if people are willing to risk freezing to death perhaps i'll hear this song for myself the musician may still be at the base of the mountain though i can't imagine he'll stay for long how is your armor fitting my lord nothing stronger i'll see you again i hope it helps good day man okay [Music] hmm please almost lit ah will the fire not light no my lord the wood is too wet and my hands too cold let me try oh never been so cold you'll be better off somewhere warmer as with you my lord for now share the fire with me and listen to the tale of this mountain long ago fire fell from the sky and landed atop mount jogaku a lone warrior braved the dangerous crime and found the giant rock covered in flames he touched his sword to the fire flames engulfed the steel but left him unharmed he created a new fighting style he called the way of the flame the warrior took pieces of the rock west with him to china there he sought answers about its origin from learned monks and scholars after months of travel and research fire fell from the sky once more he led the people to it and showed them it was nothing to fear for he believed the way of the flame was a gift from the heavens and he shared its secrets with all who wish to learn handed down through generations the way of the flame has returned to sushima the mongols wielded against our people but rumor says the fire still burns atop mount yogaku waiting for any who can survive the climb so you wish to know if the tale is true will you make the climb not i my lord i told the story to a ronin not long ago and he began the climb though i fear the cold will take him i'll find what secret the mountain hides uh so cold need warmth soon so need to warm up getting colder need to warm up a fire soon so cold need warmth soon huh come rest by the fire thank you are you all right my pride hurts more than my body it's an unforgiving mountain what were you hoping to find at the top answers power anything a flaming sword would be useful in a place like this so it would i'm sure you'll pass the mountain good luck my lord so cold need warmth soon need a fire soon [Applause] please light never been so cold so cold need warmth soon i can't take much more cold someone built a dojo here i wasn't expecting to find anyone up here i've wondered if any would make the climb you seek the way of the flame invaders from the west with flaming swords threatened sushma they brought back the gift offered to them by my ancestor teach me a samurai will show the mongols the true power of your way take a piece of the rock and we will face each other in combat only then will you learn the way of the flame now to do the learn his technique [Music] is hmm break your sword against your piece of the rock once more the way of the flame our fight ends here my lord good the way of the flame is not meant for friendly rivals i will wield it well against the enemies of tsushima you have learned the way of the flame never forget it is a gift that fell from the heavens lord sakai is there something else called sockeye hey this place isn't what i expected my ancestors trained in the way of the flame here free of worldly distractions what of yourself i live to share my teaching with those who deserve it another may come who needs the way of the flame you return safely it was a treacherous climb but i've learned the way of the flame it's unruly and powerful my lord take care the flames do not burn you the way of the flame will only consume the mongols foreign [Music] here huh my lord something very strange is going on in sago mill mongols i don't know everyone walks around as though they're living in the thousand hells but they say nothing is wrong sounds as though something is very wrong i'll look into it hey hmm i am defeated our samurais you've been praying to my ancestors asking forgiveness for what i'm about to do what do they say i can't hear them perhaps your ancestors are silent because they can't do what you must [Music] i know where my sister is i have no incense left to burn no more prayers to make the kikuchi estate is this way how did you find your sister she was married to a man named ikeda a retainer for clan kikuchi your stronghold is near here under the mountain she always wanted in a state and with kikuchi's men falling at komada it made sense she would try and take kikuchi's for herself especially after she failed to take yours i asked iran it seems a new clan has taken up residence their emblem matches the one on the notes say she's turned it into a haven for refugees claiming she knows what it's like to lose her home do you think it's true we're about to find out why would your sister say she lost her home she had to leave home when she married ikeda you said ikeda was a retainer yes but you're the younger sister why were you the one to marry a samurai when we were young bandits attacked our estate hana hid with our parents i took up a sword only after i dispatched the bandits did a samurai guard arrive to help adatu was leading them hana saw him as a way to realize her ambitions but he only had eyes for me she was jealous then the seed of many betrayals i wanted to ease her heartbreak so i helped arrange her marriage to ikeda and she was sent north did you know the man you sent your sister to live with ikeda was a respected widower people spoke well of his kindness kindness is a mask easily removed behind closed doors what are you getting at jin i want to understand why she went to such extremes to destroy you after so many years there is only one thing to understand hannah murdered my family and today she will pay for it was there ever any sign of her betrayal we were never close but our relationship was always cordial i would see her at lord shimura's conclaves we'd exchange pleasantries i had no idea she held such hate in her heart but she was at your estate the day of the attack she came that morning to wait with me for news from komoda beach we were both concerned for our husbands it was the first time i ever felt close to her my grandchildren brought them gifts they loved her now i know she hadn't come for comfort but to witness our death the women in your family fought i saw that for myself i stayed with my son's wives while hannah took the children and ran for the stables afterward i found what i thought was her body the face was brutalized unrecognizable the gold sash was hannah's i buried her with my family she must have learned you survived the attack fake to death to escape you clever plan my survival was her greatest mistake we're almost there leave the horses we'll continue on foot [Music] guards at the gate be ready this is a haven for survivors help me open the gate quickly before more gods show up so she is helping people hannah helps no one but herself lady hannah show yourself kill them [Music] [Music] how many are there doesn't matter kill them all i've had enough kill them and let's be done with it [Music] please don't kill me where's lady hunner in the estate up the hill my lord tell the coward her sister has come what will you do when you see her exactly what she did to me she's still your family my family is dead she is nothing but a murderer hannah show yourself little sister you let me think i buried you who was it really a peasant woman killed by the mongols did you weep for me you have taken everything daughters and grandchildren not nearly enough the mongols robbed me of adachi's death and you cheated yours but finally i will take everything kill them stop her i will deal with him thank you okay [Music] hey you murdered my children my grandchildren destroyed my family a small price to pay for what you've done i have done nothing you stole everything drove me from our home took the life that was rightfully mine left me with that abusive drunk in this frozen land you would have to suffer an eternity of pain to understand the life i've lived the life you forced on me none of that is my fault it is and damn you for acting as if it isn't you've come to kill me so finish this it will be your only kindness i can't end your suffering but you can now you have nothing [Music] i never mourn my family i've tried to honor them meditate on treasured memories but she consumes them even now [Music] no you've accomplished what you set out to do you have honored your family given them justice now you can find peace this path does not lead to peace where does it lead i don't know i have to continue walking it to find out i don't want you to go i must but i will be there when you need me [Music] [Music] [Music] sakai we need to talk when i was your age people said i was an ex talayori nagao you're the best archer we've ever had yeah not even close but i'm damn good and i'm grateful for everything you taught me i was so dedicated to my study i never made time for a family the way was to be my heir her crimes i could not forgive her no summer i would [Music] i devoted my life to the bow the life it gave me was remarkable and the life it took from me family is more important sensei don't become like me don't let the ghost consume you hey somewhere a last-ditch effort to rally the mongols and restore her reputation if she's here we will find her and end this yes we will [Music] hmm so um i said over there uncle convoy wiped out by who all shot in the back probably ambushed japanese arrows lord shimura's men burn the cart flaming arrows japanese archers did this likely a group sensei has been here please excuse me my road it's a bad idea to sneak up on me i thought you were with a man who killed these mongols he was samurai but older an archer sensei where is he he said he come back to my house in a day or two why your house i have food a fire whatever his business was it seemed urgent it's possible he picked up tomorrow's trail where's your house not far but there's a storm coming and i need to check my snares first then i can take you there fine i'll go with you what's your name matsu my daughter what exactly did senseishkawa tell you nothing more my lord he wasn't the friendliest man sounds about right i never talked to a real samurai war brings unlikely people together it's my chance to ask a really good question don't mess it up what's it like to hold the power of life and death in your hands in a real fight when your life is on the line time slows you hear everything your enemies breath the wind and the leaves every color and shade is vivid sharp alive that's not the answer i expected there one of my snares check it quickly i don't want to miss ishkoa damn empty have to reset it you might have more luck hunting ah i could never do that so awful maybe try a different debate my bait never changes what do you use the illusion of opportunity there's your problem that only works on men this way my daughter it's not easy surviving up here it's hard everywhere i fled north when the mongols came alone my parents died when i was a girl been on my own ever since your family must be very important my uncle is lord shimra wait you're the one people talk about the ghost but you're not 10 feet tall with eyes like a demon no but the stories frighten the enemy so that's it it's just rumors and exaggeration to fight them i've had to do things i would have frowned on before we all have look they're stealing my cat drive them off my road please wait here they're starving hey please don't hit this my lord that's not yours we are sorry it's just a squirrel we have eaten grass and tree bark for days take it and go thank you my lord you let them escape we thought dinner they were starving and no threat doesn't sound like the ghost i've heard about not all the stories about me are true the blizzard is almost on us how many more traps do you have just one but it's farther away no one will believe i talk to you what's it like to be the ghost it's not easy but i wouldn't change it no doubts or regrets plenty but i'll do anything to drive the invaders from our home we should get back soon i don't want to miss sensei the last trap is just a little farther here we are hope we don't go hungry look at this dinner you got something we might eat like civilized people after all what's up there the mainland no mongols no wall somewhere i can start over say you make it to the mainland what then in kyoto i'll open a fancy inn learn to play the shamiseng welcome the undying parade of beautiful men and women while my servants robbed them blind sounds like kyoto's in trouble it's snowing harder we should go maybe your sensei will be waiting for us the weather anything worse stay close if i get any closer we'll have to share a horse what was that never mind keep going huh my lord mongols close to the house i'll deal with them stay back [Music] [Music] [Applause] no wonder they tell stories about you where's your house come on hey here we are let's get inside you seem too kind to be the ghost but the way you kill those mongols i do what i have to for tshima the truth is we're both survivors we have darkness in us if we didn't we'd be dead sensational said something similar but it sounds more natural coming from you ishkawa always said i underestimate my opponents i don't have an arrow in my back why not the mongols turned against me after you trained them to slaughter our people a mistake i tried to fix but i can't kill all my archers not our own you need me in the sensei but we don't need you i know where they'll attack next we can ambush them together you get a victory i get revenge i'll talk it over with sensei kawa jing you can stay the night no don't worry i can't um you won't find these elsewhere my lord yourself in darkness the dog sakai sakai you have news something like that i spoke with tomoy she's hiding in the north the mongols turned against her if you saw her why is she still alive her archers are preparing a massive attack she wants the three of us to wipe them out or she needs both our heads to get back in the mongols favor she could have killed me sensei but she didn't i have never been rewarded for trusting tomoe i don't trust her but we need what she knows and i believe she needs our help then she's a fool and we finish this [Music] [Music] hmm i hope it helps you have my thanks boss [Music] that guy you have word from tamui the three of us will meet then she'll reveal where and when her archers plan to attack you think she'll tell us the truth we'll find out and sakai there will be no room for error i came prepared sensei let's go hill where we headed north of umuhiko she sent her to meet her no gambling then might be a good spot for an ambush we have the advantage the mongols turned against her she is desperate desperate enemies are dangerous because they are unpredictable but tomoe has two choices enlist our help or betray us you spent time with her what do you think she can help us wipe out her archers the risk is worth it you're gambling with your life she could have killed me in jogoku and lost me this way she gets us both if she doesn't ambush us we hear her out and if this planned attack is real we cooperate after that we'll deal with her she betrayed her people she will answer for it what will you say when you see her i have nothing to say to tom away you don't want answers you haven't spoken since she joined the enemy any chance of talking ended the moment she turned on me i'm getting close eyes open we go on foot from here stay low a lot of places to hide arches here [Music] that's the gambling then no mongols that we can see stop here that outcropping to the right i'll position myself there and you dean if i was here to kill you you'd already be dead damn [Music] always so sure of yourself the one thing you never had to teach me your archers are planning an attack where and when um heading there now why tell us the khan betrayed me i'm taking my archers away and if we don't help you stop them they'll wipe out i don't believe you do nothing and watch what happens damn it the mongols followed me damn you tomboy [Music] okay [Music] my friends [Music] oh [Music] no more traps toy this wasn't a trap she fought back against the mongols sensei to deceive us so we lower our guard if i want to put an arrow in you there's nothing you can do to stop me enough the moogie cove could be under attack we need to move fine but if tomoe even breathes wrong now put her in the dirt both of you this way [Music] saving umukiko won't make amends for your crimes they forced me to teach your way of the bow did they force you to kill your own people at fault nakayama they were being tortured i offered the quick painless death and the mongol spared me i won't apologize for surviving  patrol um what's the best route to the coast if they see us headed for umukikov then more soldiers could be alerted agreed we should stay off the roads cut through this field how did you find my camp your people attacked me you tracked them i told them to avoid you two i had plans for a dozen more camps i'm glad they ignored your orders by the time we set up i wasn't in charge more ahead a lot more take them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] up the trees at the end of the field we can rest there out of sight you said you lost control of the mongols and cushy but a woman saw you there woman you burned alive that was not my doing not with your bow but you trained her killers most of the time i convinced them to spare lives not take them over here get down the mongols are out in force they're hunting me i thought i lost them didn't think to mention that earlier i'm mentioning it now wait here until nightfall we can use the darkness to our advantage will they attack the cove before then no they'll position archers make sure no one gets out plan their slaughter get some rest i'll keep watch sun's down ready you're in front the sensor and i will follow so you can stab me in the back if the mongols spot you first we get out of sight and drop them let's go stay close don't let her out of your sight sakai i can hear you good you take one i'll pick the other more on the way hide yourselves don't miss sensei you took that last one with a circling falcon shot sensei you saw that you changed your form too i shift the right hand down so when you release nobody said this would be easy we get in a fight here your archers will be alerted start the attack before we reach the cove we can't risk it what do you think sakai follow my lead don't fall behind [Music] you uh uh hmm [Music] my archers the moment we attack they'll retreat into town use it to defend against us innocent people will die see the barrels in their carts i'll circle behind one flaming arrow once you shoot they'll be on you if you stay back in the tree line i might miss i need to get close let me undo the damage i've done go you trust her i trust her desire for revenge so that's how she stayed one step ahead of us you taught her wealth sensei i know get ready [Music] [Music] okay hmm not bad sakai where's tomoy i don't know was she wounded near the end of the fight i saw her by the archway over there that leads straight into umukikov if any mongols tried to retreat that way maybe she gave chase knows that killing her archers won't erase her crimes but she got her revenge is that all she got she fought alongside us that will mean something once we defeat the enemy forget the mongols what does she want in umuki cove there's not much here besides thieves and cutthroats damn it and smugglers she needs a boat to get off the island you there yes my lord did you see a woman run through here a warrior she was headed for the beach this way fools she helped save um the mongols were hunting her we gave her safe passage to a way off the island we're always one step behind but there's still time to stop wait sensei we have judged each other harshly but the buddha tells us that our greatest enemies can be our best teachers i am grateful for your teaching and for the chance to fight by your side the final time i have been your student i would have become your daughter [Music] but the way of the bow is behind me now what lies ahead i am like an arrow shot from a bow who knows where the wind will take me it's over maybe she'll reach kyoto after all if she were anyone else i'd say that's impossible we still have a war to finish a home to rebuild i have no more lessons to give in this life except one promise me you won't repeat my mistakes i promise sensei she can take care of herself [Music] you
