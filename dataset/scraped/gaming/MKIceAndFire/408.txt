there you should be back in then we can begin come on big guy gentlemen shall we begin you have the broker bridge the system requires two users the pilot who uses the broker bridge and the subject who is connected to the reader this will allow you to interface with aidan's mind it will scan his brain and create a visual projection that you can engage with and that's how i'll be able to revive him well the hope is that you'll be able to communicate with him and perhaps identify or repair any damage how long does this usually take i'm eager to find out wha wait what you mean you've never done this before this is the first human trial the most exciting phase of a project god damn it you [ __ ] lied to us you never cared about taking rampart out of your labs you swan is here to be your

to do let's do it together we've got you okay all right let's do this wrench we're set up back at your hideout so where do you think rampart might be ramparts burn dallas bridges with his business partners in london so i think he'll try to start fresh somewhere else does he have a private jet i can't picture him strolling through heathrow reports got a private barge docked at the thames on the books moves company cargo off the books he smuggles in people contraband you name it jordy used him once or twice um is your friend jordy a sociopath yeah probably he's so scary but also sexy anyway so that barge is rembar's best bet to get out of the city discreetly i need to catch up with him rem parts barge just got clearance to exit the thames he's hit open waters [ __ ] how am i gonna catch up to him now swim i think i know someone who can help you out there was a boat captain that helped me smuggle into the city let him know you're coming oh phew i mean hey i look great in a speedo but i can't actually swim that fast my legs are too skinny just tell me what are you gonna do to him when you catch up to him kill him yeah duh obviously is that what you really want reggie rampart's a scumbag but you've worked with him you have a history with him even if it's justified killing him won't settle things the way you want it to you want to lecture me about that really this is why you're running support pierce senior no backseat revenge you look like a seafaring scallywag are you aiden's ship captain aiden we you say you need a boat yes please i need a boat to get onto a bigger boat and you are his uh family uh well not not exactly but i do kind of look up to aiden like he's my grumpy uncle so you know we're still equals but he's more like my second cousin brother uncle father figure ah still complicated let's go so i better find a way to disable this barge before rampart hits international waters find the barge controls in the navigation room target identified initiating search protocol electrical complications oh is my god get behind company device irregularity observed searching for target power supply overheating suspect extreme internal temperature listen this area is restricted [ __ ] i'll have a look doing a sweep of the premises [ __ ] locked out of the navigation controls i'm gonna need to shut down the engine itself but i don't know how to get to it you like being hands on i bet your drone would come in handy for this i am so proud of you right now i'm cheering up i knew you would come i'm glad actually i didn't want to leave london before giving you a parting gift oh well if it's of the appealing face-off variety keep it no defenses you won't think it's funny when i return the favor when the tissue necrotizes in your face it feels like a knife stabbing into you hot cold hot cold but you'll feel it a thousand times worse because i don't believe in an eye for an eye i believe in an eye for the whole [ __ ] face that's not very christian of you tommy ah that's it the barges lost main power override the final engine and ground this boat for good aye aye captain oh do you have authorization you're not getting out of this now barge is grounded it's not going anywhere i'm picking up on a remote signal coming from the barge and massive power spikes coming from the cargo hold he's activated something something big get ready for a fight so care for a demonstration jackson aiden how do i fight this thing nothing you've got will get you through those shields hang in there we'll find a way to get them down so excuse me stop right where you are all right tanks oh [ __ ] where's my back up come on i have this that's it the shields are down all right you ugly son of a toaster let's dance oh my god this thing is so big and angry you need to hit its weak spot that's not enough to take me down i'll crush your spine and make you beg for death i'm not done until i've made you suffer oh you like that move you're welcome man yeah why are you so hard to kill keep going you got it halfway that should help uh overheated it's taking a lot of damage that's it now just finish it off think your little gadgets can stand up to this get back here i'm not finished with you ultrasonic glass blast temperatures thank you oh it's almost down just a bit more holly there you are it's no use i can build another prototype you have no way of stopping me oh i've got one way yeah reggie so sure i was going to kill you [ __ ] would have been so much easier too you know i didn't start working with you for the money i mean sure i thought you were a spoiled [ __ ] with too much hair wax by the way but you had a dream remember you told me you wanted to see humanity reach the stars we're gonna do that together man i lie to you you naive [ __ ] prick i'll hunt you down and all your little friends back in san francisco sitara josh marcus uh cyan aaron dick i won't lie i didn't expect you to turn him over to i'll be in custody well i asked myself what would aiden pierce do and then i asked myself is that who i really wanted to be no offense big guy i think you made the right call even if i wanted to smash him into teeny tiny little pieces and scattered them all over the thames and turn them into seagulls [ __ ] well progress is a journey what's next on the docket for you heading home yeah i think i might hang around london for a bit grab up a few things but i do think i'll give marcus a call though actually hey yeah i wanna i wanna take a selfie from big ben and send it to him or huh maybe i should go to buckingham palace and steal a roll of some royal tv get him a souvenir great looks like whatever trouble you get into we'll have to fish you out of it oh that's so sweet what a nice family moment we really do make the dream team don't we jackson and his two uncles two uncles shh it's okay don't worry about i'm it well looks like the three of you got a lot done together color me impressed truly i
