Vincent's same routine with the beacon light it'll be on so be ready to walk or skulking about now once its installed in you're back at the radio let's touch base good luck gonna spend the rest of my days figuring out how to prevent the floodwater from shorting out my radio [Laughter] [Music] maybe it's malfunction I'm just saying maybe there's not a reason behind everything ah ah ah ah hey Casey feel like bullshitting for a minute yeah sure I ain't going nowhere I can put this book down lord knows I've read it enough times already what book is it the only book down here besides instruction manuals is this hardcore physics book called hollow real no clue who left it I must have read it cover-to-cover a dozen times already and it still blows my mind when the whole book is about this theory that the entire universe reality itself is nothing more than a hologram being projected on the surface of a black hole and it sounds [ __ ] nuts but the math supports it I guess I'm trying to wrap my head around it all science is not only my strong suit what about you your reader I prefer movies not much of a reader yeah I haven't seen a movie in ages Oh what kind of flicks do you like dark weird [ __ ] I want to be disturbed in chalice mainstream movies are all the same yeah I can't get into that stuff I don't want to think during a movie I just want to get lost for two hours eating popcorn oh yeah I would love some buttery popcorn right now weird thought you think they'll ever be another Hollywood movie made No the world is too far gone movies had their day we just need to be satisfied with what already exists well on that note I'm gonna go do some exercises I gotta keep limber I mean so damp and cramped down here my body's getting real stiff it feels like I'm [ __ ] 80 years old hey thanks for the diversion tourists and it's nice to be reminded sometimes there were still human beings in the middle of all this [ __ ] talk to you soon [Music] confirmed the ward hello tourists you there yeah what is something's really been bugging me wanting if you could dig up some answers do we have time to be getting sidetracked Casey the water must still be rising down there no one knows that better than me tourists until I locate another flow regulator not much to be done not figured you could put my mind at ease until then I need some information on what happened to the people who were in the reserve with me the other members of my squad when the water pressure was getting too much for the bunker to handle sections if it started to lock down we analyzed the systems and we were able to pinpoint the issue they went off to fix it and left me behind in the reserve but then the whole place locked down trapping me inside I tried to reach him by radio but it I got no response I need to know what happened to them after they left why do you need to know honestly what happened at my friend Kenneth this is what concerns me the most they were close the other three we didn't part of the best terms didn't see eye to eye tell me about your friend Kenneth he was like a big brother to me stood up for me when everyone else in here was out of their [ __ ] minds what do you mean out of their [ __ ] minds what happened down there Casey they made a fucked-up decision okay Kenneth and I were not cool with it but they did it anyway let's just leave it at that not in the mood to get into it past the [ __ ] past if you want her over to rampart High maybe you can dig something up the gym is probably the best place to start there was a disaster relief camp there that they were gonna search find out if Kenneth made it that's all I'm asking it'll help me sleep better maybe not I'll keep my ears peeled for what we need the meantime [Music] you
