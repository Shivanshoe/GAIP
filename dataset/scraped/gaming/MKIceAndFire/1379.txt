trying to make a point here just fire here you see what I mean he sprayed bullets all over the damn place you've got to pick your targets by aiming deliberately down your sights from a stable stance private our show our friends see how the Rangers take down the target crouch first then aim down your sights at the target that's all there is to it you want to talk us to go down you gotta aim down your sight aiming down your sights also works for switching quickly between targets aim down your sights then pop in and out to acquire new targets show on profit if your target is close to where you're aiming you can snap to it quickly by aiming down your sights now that's how you do you want to take down your targets quickly and with control now if your target is behind like couple remember that certain weapons can penetrate and hit guitar the private here will demonstrate last but not least you need to know how to toss a frag grenade private Alan pick up some frag grenades from the table toss the grenade down the range to take out several targets at once note that frags tend to roll on slopes so think twice before tossing one up here all right thanks for the help private Alan
