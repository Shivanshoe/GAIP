we're in space my god you weren't kidding nope wow like riding a bike i guess it's down from here you ready to jump tony what's what's happening well it's a long story how long was i five years which by your standards is just empowerment starting to think people just prefer me on ice see you're already making jokes but that's normal for you captain rogers don't leave us just yet monica long time no see can't imagine your buddy tarleton was too thrilled about using superhero blood to replace superheroes he leaves the details to me stop what you're doing now wait a minute georgie doesn't know about any of this and he never will all right got it let's go what the hell oh don't mind the killer robots hurry up i'm trying for a dead guy you're really pushing why didn't you start with them damn thing is jam help me out here grab the other side no time for a fight let's move watch out yeah god damn it what's that glass tapping can't hold your weight almost there captain hurry got it just lost the engines donate [ __ ] no no well good news is we're not gonna die in a fiery ball of death and the bad news we'll uh most likely suffocate first well at least it's a good view that it is damn it so close well since we're gonna die anyway you have any i don't know last confessions your jokes i just don't get them i know i read your diary why'd you smash the reactor cap a lot of people died tony there was something buried deep beneath the bay somehow linked to the reactor working its way to the surface every minute it's the earthquake i had to do something the entire san andreas fault was about to blow the ocean would have consumed the city millions would have died never doubted you for a second just had to hear it you know the hell is that well look who it is am i always going to save the day i expect nothing less from the god of thunder hi thor welcome back captain this was your regenerative formula george how long have i been your lab rat i knew you'd react like this you'd rather die than need something from them i trusted you you saved your life you can control machines with your mind just think you infected me with his blood it could have killed me but it didn't remember the dream george me one of them i made you strong you stole my hope and now i am going to give you the same odds that i will rip the had of superpowers even if it has to end with me hey there old friend steve not god it's good to see you listen if i had known you were alive that they had you this isn't on you tarleton didn't even know monica had me what a day the heist monica hired taskmaster to steal a terrigen crystal his men triggered the security protocols initiating the chimera's autopilot put that thing in the bay that was unexpected the heat signal it must have been what caused the earthquakes that took down the city what was that i don't know that i'd i just keep thinking if i hadn't all those people no this is not your fault that ship was never supposed to be in the air i would have done the same thing you're alive i knew it i'm sorry um come on you should really see this welcome back captain rogers i know thanks jarvis it's good to be back since the chimera is near crash into manhattan the situation has become dire i fear aim will use this as an opportunity to ramp up their persecution of all the inhumans we can't let that happen the world needs the avengers now more than ever we are preparing for our final confrontation with a i have completed my analysis of mr stark's plans to equip the avengers for this anticipated confrontation and we'll need some special materials to complete them thanks jarvis time for us to get back in fighting for let's see what we need excellent sir as part of the effort we might want to help our allies commander hill and dr pym are both reporting serious difficulty in coordinating our efforts due to aims draconian control over world communication networks how can we help they have requested we destroy ames main communication hub to help unite the resistance efforts let's oblige them old friend speaking of the media reports of our own thor odinson working with exam scientists in a remote part of scandinavia have started cropping up on the news this may be part of aim's propaganda campaign against the avengers but it bears investigation agreed let's get thor on this asap looking good captain great to see the old girl in the air again quite the rescue huh now that you're back in action old georgie boy's probably losing his mind he's going to be unpredictable we need to be ready for anything nat i gotta say i wasn't surprised you never gave up fighting didn't happen without a few stumbles i almost lost my way like the others well you're here now i feel better knowing you've got our backs you know i always thought your suit was a little over the top but i have to admit you make it work thanks matt yep just as clean and soothing as it always was bruce how you been holding up it was uh pretty touch and go there for a while kamala really helped pull me out of a tailspin i'm looking forward to getting to know her more she's a good one cap maybe one of the best welcome home cap glad to be here bruce good to be home again gotta get this installed i'm a bit out of shape ah my old encyclopedia set i still can't get used to this internet thing you'd be proud of what shield has become wish you could be here to see it ah oh yeah much better than a cryopod i gotta get this thing stocked with healthier options quiet before the storm i expect this place will get pretty chaotic when we get to san francisco i still remember that epic road trip to vegas bruce and i took a few years back really should have left the big guy at home hello there hey come on over thanks for the business it would be good to fight by your side again captain the feeling is mutual buddy avengers have been gone too long commander hill ames been spreading their lies about the resistance for way too long it has to stop it's time we replace their poisonous lies with the truth but their satellite array is fast as long as that network is in place they'll control the narrative jarvis has identified several aim satellite hubs that control their communications i see what you're thinking if we can take one out their network would collapse at least for a few hours we'd be able to send messages to the entire resistance temporarily so we'll have to make every word we broadcast count we don't have any weapons strong enough to take out a satellite so what's the play the satellite is connected to earth by a massive space elevator that's how we'll get up there [Music] so [Music] the first thing you'll have to do is acquire the launch code for this space elevator that'll be risky it'll be worth it hill the resistance is still fragile we need a way to organize our forces open lines of communications will be critical i assume you know where to find a set of codes jarvis did some digging a local aim based commander has some so we're gonna pay them a visit all right let's go get those launch codes look for a chest with gear nearby how you doing good fine okay maybe a little nervous there is a chest with gear close by not bad not bad at all uh uh had [Music] i still got it let's get this over with don't worry we got this hostiles um i'm guessing the big one's the base commander the one in this central area yes let's get his attention there is a chest with special resources close to your location great job [Music] let's do this by the book avengers uh what's up excellent work extracting the launch codes now the elevator is controlled by a multi-point authentication system powered by three junction boxes drivers will need control of them to fake the authentication to get you inside why can't it ever be easy sir aim is now on full alert you should expect heavy resistance at the transport center all i do is win win win it's now or never cap better get to the elevator before they shut the thing down [Music] entirely [Music] if they find out what we're headed for they'll change the launch codes don't give them the time let's take these guys down one of our resistance allies is close by and can use some help wipe it off get access to the three junctions keeping the security system locked down so jarvis can get inside aim's gonna try to kick him out so you need to keep their forces at bay we've got the advantage i need some help here theo work your magic you're safe now uh the more junctions the better ames got control of a junction they're trying to lock out jarvis all right jarvis is gonna start now you have to get aim off those junctions everyone great job sometimes you gotta run before you can walk all right let's get in there uh foreign all security locks on the elevator have been disabled you're clear to go cap all right this is it one super long elevator ride coming up um ah a warning sir this is going to be a rather rocky ride everyone hold on incredible no telling what kind of defenses this satellite has we get in set the place to self-destruct and then get the hell out clear crystal doors aim really likes redundancies don't they they do you got to take everything down or that satellite will stay up standing by cap as soon as you take the satellite out we'll send out a message as wide as possible this old dog still got a few tricks i got a problem here yes this is it [ __ ] the communication array is beginning to fall apart we're able to transmit to our outpost on the east coast and soon the world nice one get out of there it's about to blow warning station integrity critical please evacuate immediately jarvis broadcast the message certainly sir this is captain america to anyone out there resisting the tyranny of aim to everyone who's scared or doesn't know where to turn the avengers are back and we won't let you down again fellow americans we're here where protesters have gathered in response to a nationwide threat to our freedom this morning the heads of all major military agencies were held under duress by ames new adaptoids panic erupted when many awoke to large aim gunships hovering above our major cities as the military begins to mobilize a tense standoff has gripped the nation of course that's my tech that's is my cloaking tech wait a minute something's happening sir i'm receiving a distress call from a resistance sanctuary in new york ames trying to draw us out if we rescue them it'll look like where it doesn't matter what it looks like we see someone who needs help and we help so you do what you need to do we're leaving it dawn hey cap i got pim to send us what he has on new york if you want to take a look meet me in the tech lab on my way [Music] you
