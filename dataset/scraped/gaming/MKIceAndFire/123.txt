through a lifetime spent in the pursuit of knowledge one question consumed me how did our world come to be the old ones perished a thousand years ago triggering the extinction of all life she showed me how it was reborn a little outcast girl ignorant of her own importance through her i learned that life was only saved through a technological miracle zero dawn a terraforming system composed of nine subordinate functions each playing its part to reshape earth from a barren rock to a lush landscape tended and protected by the machines and with her i learned the deepest secret of them all the secret of her birth that she is a clone of elizabeth zero dawn's creator born to prevent a new extinction driven by hades a malevolent a.i given sentence by a mysterious signal of unknown origin and with a little help from me she prevailed in a great battle at the city of meridian becoming a champion for all humankind but as useful as she has been now i must leave her behind for as she strives to put right what haiti sundered i have made a new discovery one that heralds both destruction and opportunity [Music] [Music] i'm running out of time the elizabeth is dying [Music] people are suffering soon i'll starve all because of a terraforming system that's spiraling out of control and only i can fix it only i have your genetic code it won't be long before we hit the point of no return and then extinction i've been searching for months for what i need a backup of gaia the aiu designed to control the system [Music] but every time i think i have a lead that comes to nothing and every night i have the same dream i'm walking under a brilliant night sky through a field of flowers and when i arrive at the center i see you elizabeth [Music] waiting for me even though you've been dead for a thousand years [Music] you're the closest person i've ever had to a mother [Music] [Music] and for a moment i feel whole [Music] but it never lasts [Music] i'm always left alone [Music] this world is your legacy elizabeth i won't let it slip away the valley below is my only remaining lead my last hope to find the backup i'll do whatever it takes to get it i promise pharaoh the savior of meridian anointed of the nora you know i hate being called that stuff well consider it a punishment for running out on us the very same night we beat hades i grew up an outcast remember i'm not much for parties yeah that one was in your honor just saying so what are we doing must be urgent since you left so fast delving into ancient ruins or maybe it has something to do with the blight both actually but um i shouldn't oh no i've been dragging you a long way it's okay after everything you've done to help the nora and my family i swore an oath to help you no matter what you're stuck with me now like bark on wood [Music] okay but if you're going to come with me you'll need to be able to see what i see a focus never thought i'd get your second sight i'll give you another one later and show you how to back up your data data information on the device we've got a lot to cover um i'll have to explain everything as we go [Music] you see like this all the time since i was a little girl come on [Music] [Music] shall we [Music] all right i got a couple of scrapes on the way here we should find some medicinal plants stock up so it's time for your first lesson with the focus sounds good let's get started these plants don't look like the ones in the sacred lands the focus helps you see the ones we need oh bitter yeah well at least they make you feel better all right we should keep going you might want to grab more of these plants along the way yeah good idea look there more of the planet [Music] some of the blight is it's peeling off dead skin is that how it spreads [Music] those ruins that's where we need to go i see a few ways down what are we after exactly the backup well um it's an ai it's um it's hard to explain think of it like a set of instructions that can fix the world sounds complicated i've noticed you're uh on the way here oh oh this stuff spreads fast six months ago the land was fine now it's everywhere salvaging machine carcasses as usual and there they go looks like they left a carcass behind a lot of arrows in that machine better take a closer look someone took down this machine recently who else would come here i don't know i better craft some euros of our own there might be trouble of bad good thing we already picked up some ridge wood all right now to craft some arrows done me too arrows ready there's a ladder but can't reach it from here nothing a well-placed arrow can't knock free target the lock after you by the goddess what was this place the transmission the message i found didn't say only that a backup might be here we need to find a way in so um what happened after i left meridian well there was a fuss when people realized you were gone but then some of us figured you only would have left if it were for something important you're right about that [Music] but it's not just poisoning plants it's killing animals too then people will get sick too and starve we're not gonna let that happen find anything good a few supplies down this way machines have it on alert how do you want to handle it the focus can help us we can scan the machine before we make our move okay okay see how parts of it are glowing those are its weak spots [Music] [Music] it's eye it's a weak spot right look [Music] okay concentrate [Music] another one's coming how does the focus know all that it reads data on the machine like a hunter studying its prey yeah kind of so after the fuss over me leaving what did everyone else do well as soon as the celebration was over my mother led the rest of the nora home sun king put his people to work rebuilding the city and i set out to find you someone shot this machine too [Applause] another letter you said you've had a focus since you were a child right yeah i found my first one when i fell into a ruin got the others from an old cash not long ago that's good to have extras welcome to the far zenith launch facility for zenith i know they made some tech trades with zero dawn but why would they have a backup of gaia please register with reception for the tour i guess they want us to check in with them please hold for identiscan access denied please wait here for personnel to assist you dr sobek okay i guess they weren't on great terms with elizabeth well let's find a way in [Music] please hold for identiscan access denied credentials not recognized i guess it doesn't like me either i should be able to pry this open there's climbing gear i guess someone dropped in from above whoever left this here might have also shot those machines we found earlier so where are they now ugh what's that stench entire wiped out they must have come here to delve for scrap acid that explains the smell [Music] and it looks like something big came in from above crashed right through the camp and then through the wall i should take a look at the rubble in that gap whatever came through here brought this down as it went out if i can dislodge some of the debris we might be able to squeeze through maybe i can find something to help in the camp hey lloyd over here i think i got something it's some kind of osurum prototype i think this hook looks like it can latch onto things and the scare pulls it back hmm it looks broken but maybe we can repair it i'll get to the debris and pull it out that could work the focus can help us search the camp and identify anything we can use to fix the tool my focus picked up a couple of things to check out guy acid burned right through his armor part of a machine could help fix the gears machine cable stronger than rope all right i think i have what i need to repair the tool or maybe even make something better you could use this workbench there uh pull caster now to test it on the debris that worked better than i thought well it doesn't look like there's an easy way out of here i should scan the area we have to find a way to keep going this huh what's this thing for whoa good morning i'm osval dalgaard and it is my pleasure to introduce you to far zenith forget what you think you know about us our truth is simple we say reach for the stars even if you have to cross 8.6 light years of space to get there please proceed into the auditorium where we'll unveil our plans [Music] i wonder what's in this auditorium i better guess we'll find out oh i might be able to get up there i don't think i can reach that ladder from here wow that works that pull caster's youthful too bad there's only one don't worry i'll find you another way up what [Music] oh okay i gotta drop the ladder for varyl thanks so humans homo sapiens us we have always pushed the boundary as explorers pioneers trailblazers and now far zenith is taking the next leap into the future that's why we're proud to have resurrected the odyssey when our government's abandoned in orbit far zenith will actualize in less than a decade but that's only the beginning when the ship is complete we will send the odyssey and her crew where no one's gone before [Music] the serious system there we'll create humanity's first off-world colony the odyssey may take 300 years to reach it but when we look up at the night sky we'll know they're on their way and in the words of our founder the late peter chimboombe the truest form of immortality is data corrupt the playback stopped the old ones could fly through the sky between the stars uh well yes sort of that ship the odyssey it never made it to the other star something went wrong and it blew up is that why elizabeth gave them a backup of gaia for their colony [Music] error public presentation file corrupted member recruitment file available do you wish to reactivate yeah reactivate let's see what else they had to say [Music] we all know the projections economic instability new bio contagions rampant ais how long before another catastrophe creates unacceptable risk for the world's elite we here at far zenith believe escape the inevitable and so we reach for the stars now you've seen what we're building here infrastructure to support the odyssey's construction a state-of-the-art data center to facilitate rapid technological advancements and you've seen how we're managing public perception so invest and join us claim your birth on the odyssey preserve your way of life beyond the concerns of earth well they were right about the world ending they just didn't know how yet so everything they said back there about the next step for humanity it was all a lie these people only cared about saving their own skin yeah well didn't work out for them in the end that oldsfold guy mentioned a data center [Music] there the backup it should be stored in there won't be able to swim across i guess we'll have to find a way around come on the wilds have really grown over this place what is that [Music] up here [Applause] careful don't want those things to call in some friends from underground you take the left one i'll deal with the one on the right okay [Music] moving off i need to sneak up on it to take it out with my spear can't let it see me i should scan it first check its patrol path gotta get closer and stay out of sight just have to wait for the right moment gotcha mine's down too more of those machines ahead nothing that i can't handle are you ready for this so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Applause] got them all i've been meaning to mention i noticed you have a new look these days yeah i know didn't have a lot of time to shave when i was trying to catch up to you don't worry it's not permanent good sorry my whiskers offend you anointed looks like this little guy got caught up in the flight i couldn't escape i hope it didn't suffer long the osram must have used explosives against the machines they managed to get a couple looks like there's a barricade here machines must have broken through i'll keep this for later guess that osirim didn't have a chance to use it [Music] [Music] careful traps ahead huh i might be able to disarm them [Music] there managed to salvage some supplies dismantled it and not blow yourself up more surprised looks like another camp while we're here maybe we can make some scraps of our water might keep it handy against machines good idea oh i don't have the right supplies to craft a trap but it looks like the awesome shell off some machine parts i might be able to scrounge up enough materials from them i can use this okay i should have what i need to craft a trap there explosive trap made if anything walks into one of those it won't know what hit it don't think they spotted us let's see where its weak points are maybe we could place one of those traps you made in its path [Music] from wow [Applause] [Music] [Music] is we're clear let's keep going now you've been in a lot of old world ruins are they all like this huh that's a big storm picking up out there yeah and they're getting stronger and more frequent so the storms the blighted lands the rivers and lakes choked with algae you were born to fix all that yeah but i can only do it if i find that backup i think we're winding our way around to the data center we'll need to cut through that big building on the right out there hey varl there's data here you scan it with your focus this dick it mentions the tech that far zenith traded with zero dawn it doesn't explain how they got it back up i'll keep an eye out for more data let's see huh a lot of glyphs i'll tuck this away to study later looks like we've got to climb up [Music] you okay yeah guess we won't be going that way well it is a thousand years old like some kind of meeting room that door on the other side's locked the brainchild of dr elizabeth sobeck empowered by nine subordinate functions gaia the core of the system is capable of advanced planetary engineering an obvious advantage to our space colonization efforts operation phase one establish an asset within project zero dawn status complete phase two the asset will secretly beam cast a complete copy of gaia and her subordinate functions to this facility's data center if all goes well zero dawn staff will remain completely unaware of the transmission risks discovery of this operation could result in zero dawn withholding the already negotiated apollo database special care must be taken not to alert travis state the expert hacker in charge of haiti's protocol in addition extreme caution must be exercised in regards to dr sobek herself as one of the world's pre-eminent technologists she may have instituted unforeseen security measures a complete assessment is attached this concludes the executive summary i thought elizabeth sent the back up here but she didn't far zenith stole gaia eloy why does that woman look like you um it's okay bro we look alike because we're the exact same genetically identical but she was one of the old ones how can you be her because i wasn't born i was mate by a machine it's why i'm motherless why i was cast out as an infant i don't understand what kind of machine can make a person remember when i said the backup is like a set of instructions it's more than that it's called gaia and for a long time she cared for the world until she had to destroy herself so she made me to bring her back i'm the only one who can and this place is my last hope you once said the goddess spoke to you when you went into all mother mountain was that this gaia yes but she's not the goddess laurel [Music] there isn't one how can you be sure it sounds like she anointed you with a sacred task i've had a lot of time to figure this out and you will too with the focus but for now the reports said they were going to store the stolen copy of gaia in the data center so that's where we have to go okay oh look at that hey over here i found something you could use a weapon thanks merle we should keep moving after you [Music] [Music] oh down here i think we're almost back outside good look that must be the machine in the same direction [Music] on it [Music] oh that big machine must have attacked as they tried to escape they didn't stand a chance looks like we can cross over here so you said this backup is the last hope yeah all those places i've been these last few months there were supposed to be more backups but a thousand years ago a guy named ted pharaoh purged them all was he part of far zenith too no he was worse hmm oh imagine going up to the stars machines patrolling ahead we can tag them in the focus to keep track of them [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh okay now how to get out of here machine ripped right through the wall [Music] what's in here [Music] there's a ladder in the back so tell me something sauna was really okay with you not going back to the sacred lands as the nora warchief she understood why i was obligated to follow you but as my mother she wasn't pleased is she ever pleased i don't think i've seen her smile me neither huh three of those things and if they slaughtered all those awesome we'll never get through to the data center there's no way to slip past them they're too tough to fight head-on we could find a settlement convince some hunters to help us that would take weeks and we don't have that kind of time maybe all we need is that shuttle to fall that thing how i'll figure it out just wait here hey loy trust me and there she goes just need to get over to the shuttle to figure out how to make it fall into the basin huh if i can make it to that tower i should be able to find a way across to the shuttle [Music] [Music] huh [Music] hmm [Music] hmm there that ladder there's a rail up there i think i can reach it if i launch myself off that grapple point got it huh [Music] [Music] well that sounds good [Music] the storm's getting [Music] that was close one rickety tower down onto the next i won't be able to make that jump there is a cable here well nowhere to go but up [Music] looks like there are massive clamps holding the shuttle in place i think there's a control console nearby if i can release the clamps the shuttle should fall right into the basement oh great no machine's in my way [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh uh [Music] okay time to crush those machines down below [Music] the shuttle's caught up in those cables i'm gonna have to climb the tower to find a way to disconnect them scanning of my focus could help i'm closer to the shadows [Music] okay that creeping doesn't sound good i did attach those cables quick [Music] this should be the right spot [Music] one down i just have to climb higher and attach the second set of cables swallowing an ancient rickety tower with killer machines waiting down below [Music] [Music] huh almost there there's the other connector um [Music] uh finishing this the hard way i need to take this thing down to get to the data center that sack's full of acid i should target it first whoa for them i gotta take this thing down fast frost ammo where my focus might find something i can use around here let's see what this can do instead finally so uh [Music] the data center should be straight ahead i guess pearl's gonna have to find another way there huh once i get the back up i can reboot gaia fix the system heal the blight restore [Music] but it's still there okay i should find the server i have to be please be here [Music] [Music] it's here gaia version 6.9 initializing hello hi now what's this we got here a far zen conspiracy to steal a copy of gaia anderson functions naughty naughty you want me to handle this liz blasphemers brew the vipers with a mighty head i smite and pour troubles upon you this ain't no copy a guy you stole your losers but it's the mother of all logic bombs so good luck repairing your data and next time you start thinking you can outsmart a tape remember my salute hey loy the goddess there is no goddess i told you that already that's not gaia it's not what i'm looking for it's nothing but a fake [Music] ugh i got it floral i'm sorry you have a sharp bite sometimes you know but it was pretty amazing to see you fly off that tower and blow up the entire basin the thing is um there's going to be more of that i'm out of leads for all but i i have to keep searching and fast and whatever risks i have to take i will and it doesn't make sense to have someone with me someone who might get hurt this is on me farl nobody else hold on before in meridian you said there was a man who helped you silence you said you used to talk to him a lot about things you discovered from the old world things no one else understands and he gave you the lance you used to defeat hades he's gone varl i haven't heard from him since the battle against hades sure but spymaster murad back in meridian he's good at finding people isn't he varl i come on it might work plus you'll get to see some friendly faces again [Music] okay i i guess it's worth a shot we've got a long walk ahead actually [Music] i've got a better idea [Music] by the sun it's true she's come back bless us [Music] the savior of meridian has returned you earned this welcome you saved them not yet in the name of the sun king of god a royal welcome for the champion has an urgent matter to discuss dashing that makes two of us i've sent forth hunters for weeks the sun fall all the way to the sacred land searching for you something happened at the spire come i'll show you what's your step you saved us all to be sure but uh we're still cleaning up the mess it happened right after the solstice we were able to explain it away thank the sun otherwise it might have caused a panic [Music] one night for less than half a minute glowed in angry red from meridian that looked like a trick of the light but those who were closer atop the allies said it could not have been a reflection much to my dismay they said the light rose up from the tower's base from that we left everything just as it was what do you think happened i don't know the spire's supposed to send out signals messages for the terraforming system but hades tried to use it to wake up ancient war machines wait here while i check it out let us know what you find i've got a bad feeling about this i could pull this thing out of the box what transmission no he wouldn't he couldn't something was transmitted from the top of the spire i guess i have to find a way up there maybe i can jump to that ledge behind me uh is that a statue of me that's new what did you find not done yet but it definitely looks like the orb transmitted something into the spire that can't be good i guess i should be flattered by the statue it feels wrong especially when my job's only half done looks like a memorial honoring those who fell in the battle of the alight lots of brave people defended this place from hades machine carcasses romance from the battle of the alight it's really you you're a real life legend we were almost overrun by the machines hades controlled but we pushed through what there we go should be able to get up there now i thought silence was helping me when he gave me his lance it looks like he tricked me i transmitted something through the spire did he save hades why would he do that well if i can figure out where he sent it i can track him down hopefully the transmission node at the top will tell me huh looks like this panel's a jar can i go up through the inside an elevator let's see maintenance configuration [Music] the whole thing is opening i up what the carja will make of this there's the note i see you finally figured it out to be honest i'm surprised it took you so long to discover my rules you read the lands to steal hades how could you be so reckless reckless you're the one who tried to purge hades before its precious knowledge could be extracted the mysterious signal that walked for example a way to obtain one of those backups you've been having such a hard time funding if you knew why didn't you just tell me i've been having problems of my own these past six months the difference is i've made progress so once you're angry at my entirely necessary deception has faded now why don't you come out here and find me in the forbidden west and to learn all that i've discovered oh i'll confirm it yes well and according to make it simple enough even for you god [Music] it's no other choice better let varl and murad know what i found he went inside and it transformed almost like the day of the battle i can only be grateful that it's a stormy day a few will have seen the tower change from meridian what did you discover hades the danger didn't end here it went into the forbidden west and i have to follow i see that can be difficult the west is called forbidden for a reason tribe of ferocious warriors controls much of it the tanakh and they allow no trespassers past its border that said under the sun king of art a fragile piece has been negotiated and indeed the next embassy will take place in a day or two on the edge of the frontier where you two attend the gathering under his auspices the tanakh might grant rite of passage instead of hunting you and attacking on sight great just what i need more killers the sun king hey it's good to see you you left in such haste we never had a chance to properly thank you can we show the champion the spear now please eat them in quiet it's true we bear gifts decorum usually calls for a ceremony of offering at the palace but i thought you would prefer a less formal occasion bring them please avad this is all very kind but i lose it vanasha quick better hand them over before she runs off again really must you try it on that's beautiful on behalf of all the citizens of the sundance may these tokens remind you of our eternal gratitude perhaps you'd like to spend more time with your friends come speak to me when you're ready to depart i need to attach the master override to my new spear should be a workbench around here i can use shipments continue to arrive weekly from cut clip the sculptor wanted something even bigger twice the size covered in gold and jewels but i was quite certain you wouldn't appreciate that you were right i'm sorry avad it's good to see you but i can't stay long i see i'd hoped you'd remain in the city for a time perhaps at the palace meridian's still in danger but it's bigger than that to put things right i have to go west to knox territory by the sun that's a knock well perhaps murad already told you but after years of hostility we've negotiated a truce in hopes of a lasting peace another embassy will be held in just a day or two [Music] when you say years of hostility i assume you mean the red rates ah yes my favorite subject i wouldn't ask if i didn't need to know as you know my father raided all the border tribes [Music] suffered greatly resisting as best they could but none fought back like the tanath they rose up and assaulted our western front of baron light sweeping us from their lands them to talk to us again after that was tricky [Music] what makes this coming embassy so special not just like today this special because of the guest our delegation will meet with the tanakh just outside baron light we'll give them treasure and they'll return a prisoner for schaaf one of our finest soldiers soldier don't you mean raider no not in this case vashav is my cousin nothing like helis and his elk he joined the western expedition with the hopes of reigning in certain excesses but he was captured during heroic defense of our forward base at cinnabar sands and has been held ever since your cousin feshav how long has he been a tanakh captive five years to not emissaries swear he as well but i wonder that tribe is renowned for its brutality how did he survive well i'll know soon enough if you see him before i do tell him that i await him in meridian where he belongs if i see him i will how did you get the tanakh to talk again after the war the same way i got you to talk by giving gifts but to knocks like tiaras more like medals spices and relics looted during the fighting we've met with them on several occasions and the gifts seem to have eased the tension but this coming embassy is the most important yet the best sign we've had so far that the tanakh want lasting [Music] litterman peace happy you got him out of sunflow any happiness he has he owes to you he's turning into a fine young man which he'll need to be if he's to inherit the crown wouldn't the crown go to a son of yours first yes well i'd have to get married for that to happen murad keeps throwing noble matches at me but i find i'm always trying to make them into someone they're not [Music] at any rate i never aspired to the throne and i don't wish to sit there forever when edema comes of age i hope to step aside [Music] free of the crown i might finally be able to travel the world who knows perhaps even accompany you on one of your adventures you make it sound easy [Music] oh yeah i need to get going one moment eloy there's something i must ask you since you left i've thought of little else this isn't really the time but it has to be the way you left before there's no way to know when i'll see you again i'm not trying to stop you or hold you back but i need to know when your mission is over will you return to meridian and stay long enough for us to spend time to get to know each other properly perhaps avod the situation calls for a higher perspective the threat i'm facing endangers not just meridian but a lot of other places too a lot of innocent people what happens between us it's not important at least not yet you're right i'm acting like a fool it's supposed to be the king who calls for a higher perspective please accept my apology and my wishes for your success goodbye eloy as always our hopes ride with you [Music] yes hey lord well may the sun bless what do you say my humblest thanks to you great champion for delivering my mother and me from some fall and for defending our holy city against the forces of shadow did you see right you said it fine airmen and you're welcome champion will you teach me to shoot like a real machine hunter it's a man i uh i have to go on an important mission prince to save the world something like that [Music] but when i come back i could give you a few tips it would be an honor [Music] we owe you our lives champion and we will not forget may the sun light your way watch out for thunderjaws champion [Music] [Music] savior i hope all is well with you that's part of the death bringer we defeated this machine was the last line of defense for hades it dragged the orb up here and then nearly killed me but it's just a piece of scrap now there the workbench same time same place that's luther finasha thanks for being here wouldn't miss it even if you did leave us hanging after the big battle vanessa stop she's here now isn't she for the moment but i see that look on her face she's got business to attend to and it isn't in meridian you know i didn't vanish before because i wanted to i had no huntress please you don't have to justify yourself to us you saved our butts if you've got to go go with our blessing always you both look like you're doing well mr shiny pants here is now the sun king's senior military advisor that means people actually have to listen to him talk may the sun bless their sorry souls at least i say something of substance every once in a while what was that i just fell asleep while you were talking and how about you vanessa i've been looking after nasari and edeman two parts bodyguard one part bad influence huh i was gonna say nanny but i like your version better if i never pictured you as a nanny adam and must be special hold on now i'm not entirely domesticated nasari was the mad sun king's wife she has enemies i've had to foil a plot or two right you can try to hide it but inside you're as soft as a silk pillow oh you have no idea huh oh dear uh we were talking about edeman yeah okay i admit it edema is cute he's fun and he looks up to me i like him except when he forgets to wash his hands after hooking worms in that muddy garden behind a solarium [Music] it's been months since i was in sun fall what's become of the shadow karja after you wiped out the eclipse there were hardly any priests or officers left to terrorize the little people avad offered amnesty to all who were forced to serve the shadow so the commoners cleaned out the citadel and handed it back to him the sundom was unified avad wanted uther to take command of the garrison there but captain cuddly here refused rumor has it that he wanted to stay close to me here in meridian that's nonsense of course well i know i know you're out go away with you always an honor champion always a pleasure but please little huntress come back someday and tell us about your adventures if i can't get in trouble at least i can hear about yours [Music] i wasn't paying attention okay master override installed plus something new to store up and release energy uh resonator should help in a fight drink later [Music] are you ready to go or do you need a little more time i better get going and if i'm headed west it sounds like i'll need right of passage from the tanakh as you said where exactly is this embassy going to be held past the dance the canyon that marks the western border of the sundom you'll find the fortress of barren light at its farthest edge the embassy will take place just beyond its gates it's a long march a fortnight on foot a couple of days hard riding should get us there actually it might be better to rest here tonight head out in the morning of course i'll arrange it [Music] hmm [Music] am i the one to hold this crown of ash their [Music] these words don't seem like mine but the iron won't subside no matter no matter what i try [Music] emptiness in the storm [Music] the wave inside my soul carries on [Music] [Music] to find the path we lost [Music] [Music] who can take my hand in [Music] so sparks to steal never seen anyone use one of those to get around is that how i get to baron light uh yes i mean usually but not today and not yet and why is that well the daunt the whole valley it's infested with machines i can handle machines oh i'm sure you can but i'm under strict orders not to operate until the whistle down at chain scrape sounds the all clear look i didn't come all this way just to stand around and wait i'll crank that car down myself if i have to well but then who would crank it back up fine fine though should anyone ask it might be best to say you forced me i see smoke but not a lot of activity smoke's probably coming from something the machine's wrecked as for the quiet well there's a work stoppage in effect because of all the fuss what sort of machines are causing the trouble nasty ones and lots of them bristlebacks they're called strangeness is they're not native to the dot just showed up all of a sudden no hunters to kill them well we've got hunters just none that want to cross alvin boss of chain scrape he is self-appointed work stop which was his idea yeah well i'm just passing through got an embassy to attend you should have said that ain't gonna happen no time what are you talking about [Music] hear that that's your answer who is that karja's son priest cranked him down yesterday about an hour before the machine trouble started he's a very important man so he says that embassy at baron light he's the one supposed to run it great if you don't do as i say immediately the sun king himself shall hear of your insolence thanks to you i was forced to spend the night shivering in the tent exposed to attack i might have died oh me you refused to transport but not this this what this nora girl this savage besides scallywag what is that's a loi studio suadees a loi you know savior of meridian really well that lesson's the insult i suppose i came here for the embassy of baron light way i hear it so did you well not with the valley infested and so did aramon proclaim the sun priests most precious and worthy of safe keeping see scripture i shall head to barren light when the captain of the vanguard tells me the way is clear and not a moment sooner fine captain's a friend of mine you know where is aaron i wouldn't mind speaking to someone a little more action a little less scroll what is studious wadis studious what he sent aaron and another vanguard out of daybreak to clear the way and so it dave hey down the valley then yeah said they'd check the ruins on the left bank for tracks take it from there okay i here there's a work stoppage any way to upgrade my gear i'll bet the smith chain scrape would let you use his workbench as for the bristlebacks you might want to craft some acid arrows hitting their canisters with those will take him down quick thanks i'll find erin and i'll bring him back hey where do you think you're going what to the top of the ridge to wait in safety sorry operator's under strict orders no passengers for the whistle blows right that's right best start cranking why why jorf would you kindly escort studious to chain scrape and wait for me there you got it i will find aaron and i will help clear a path but after that no more excuses baron light embassy if such be the will of the sun it will be trust me i gotta find errand but it might be good to hit chain scrape first and upgrade my bow if you'll excuse me i need to contemplate [Music] i'll get us packed up and move us along [Music] [Music] [Music] so my stash those machines must have torn through this camp this family definitely isn't safe oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah i think i can climb up this cliff i wonder if there's anything interesting at the top what tiger can make use of this uh watchtower i wonder what's inside uh [Music] [Music] hmm this'll make a good die okay almost there uh some kind of device the metal reflects the sun send a signal looks like some kind of lens i guess i'll keep it for later [Music] i can almost see the entire fab huh huh huh that must be cheese grape drew said i could get my bow upgraded in there i'd be able to tinker with my other gear too if i find that these machines are made i might learn how to override them foreign [Music] oh oh oh [Music] so later it's a dead machine it must be a bristleback maybe aaron took it down wrestle box must have got these awesome i hope aaron and the other vanguard are okay grounds soaked with acid did the bristlebacks do this outlander approaching that the savior want to come in savior welcome to chain scrape savior open up guys dwarves orders good enough for me [Music] by the forge petra hey loy what are you doing here uh oh time there was something worth looking at in this dump it's nice to see you and not a moment too soon come on i [Music] damn brewery's the only thing i can count on in this place yeah i heard machines work stoppage oh those are just the latest malfunctions chain script's always been a few tools short of a kit and right there is the biggest tool of all our land not our problem the bristlebacks are everybody roland you've heard of him yeah but he's a story best told over a cold beer uh petra petra i'm just passing through i'm headed west oh there's an embassy at baron light i need to make happen and then i keep moving ah of course bigger gears to grind well flame hair good to see you you've got to move on petra but if you want a cold beer and a few laughs with an old friend come find me at the brewery your choice well this old one guy sounds like trouble maybe petra could use some support but first things first i need to find that workbench and upgrade my bow shop looks closed yep can i still use the workbench i ain't gonna stop you go there so so i'll have you know i am the smartest man exactly someone around here this should be useful now i just need to find aaron and help him clear the bristlebacks how am i supposed to work with a hammer in your state i don't worry about that until oven blows oh certainly so i'll come find you later [Music] oh move those took some of your stew last time i went into the wild kept me going for a week i felt like i could have put a strider in a sleeper hole enjoy it while it lasts sounds like you're serving up some uh impressive provisions here not a kid you can have the discount too but you'll have to come back later i think you have me confused with someone else alvin didn't send you no oh my apologies it's just that his minions won't stop pestering me now i've even worn out my special grill since i'm in the midst of a crisis perhaps you could skip to what it is you wanted some of your food of course are alvin's people causing you problems oh yeah they constantly demand my best but the equipment i need to make my signature dishes isn't built for batch cooking and don't get me started on the oven discount they feel so entitled to and if you refuse i make meals no trouble how did you end up in chain scrape heard about a new and upcoming town at the edge of the frontier where there's a town there's a tavern that was in need of work so i got myself out here and started cooking some of these people had never tasted proper bores and berries stew before anyway next thing i knew people kept coming back i guess they like my food more than ale your last customer mentioned your cooking really kept him going out in the wild where i'm headed i could use some of that i would be happy to oblige it especially since you have the decency to ask pleasantly but but my special group griddle is no more without it i can't cook any of my signature dishes i hate to think what will happen when i'm forced to refuse alvin or his goons even if i already had the right ingredients there's nothing i can do unless you can source me a temporary replacement what do you need for the ingredients a few pieces of decent wild meat and i'd say a big handful of bitter leaf stems that'll do as for the griddle a corrugated metal panel might suffice until i can have a new one forged you'd likely find one in a scrounger pile if you follow the river to the northeast don't worry i'll clean it first you'll have no issue finding boars and bitter leaf on your way assuming you're as much a hunter-gatherer as your clothing suggests thanks milduff i'll keep an eye so that's what gratitude sounds like and don't let anyone push you around okay if you say so uh so so i love them [Applause] oh stop for the stash i'm telling you you know what we need uh what happened to you that damn mind is what happened to it won't me the last injury if oldham keeps shoving those tongs into those tunnels what mine northeast the chainscrape where the river ends i told corvin we should stop when the first cave-in happened but alvin probably threatened to cut off her pay or worse how about you slow down and take me through it you mentioned you were injured in a cave-in yeah a couple days ago that's how i hurt this blasted leg corvin and the others were opening a new vein while i was checking on an older one as soon as their blast hit tunnel i was in collapsed might have dodged it if i wasn't running i'm barely a spark of sleep and you're pushing too hard and too fast and you're afraid corvin and the others might not be as lucky if it happens again mm-hmm hit the nail right on the head how come alvin's in charge don't these mines belong to the karja try telling alden that he brought in all the backing to get him open might as well own them fire and spit you ask him he owns us as well who's corvin he's a foreman and a damn good one the kind that knows how to deal with management when it gets unreasonable but alvin his demands go beyond unreasonable corvin's been doing his best to appease him he even blamed himself for my injury when it was alvin who ordered the extra shifts sounds like a good guy that's why we all put up with the long hours and lousy conditions but if the whole mind becomes unstable i'd rather suffer alvin's wrath than die buried in rumble i could check in on your crew if i'm in the area i would appreciate that thank you um what do you want alvin some kind of payment my dear magistrate you think i can be bought if you want that whistle blown all you have to do is have your soldiers remove the bristlebacks and sign the concession decree face it what other choice do you have hi savior what auspicious timing might we discuss a matter of importance to the sundom we might later very well i shall be waiting so the savior herself walloper of derval gutter of use maybe i've heard many tales of your beauty and heroics my fierce lady warrior orphaned freeholder at your service so what could have dragged you away from the fine silks and wine of meridian to this smudge of a settlement your saviorly attention must be needed elsewhere i'm here for the embassy and the embassy by the forge ah greater gears for greater matters yes that means you'll be moving on once i've dealt with any problems around here that need my saviorly attention ah the bristlebacks of course got to get rid of them if you want that embassy to take place well [Music] let's get to it hey and off you go not so fast [Music] you don't seem to have a high opinion of the magistrate well i refuse to play nice to some fancy-robed parchment pusher when my fellow laborers are being bullied intimidated and taken advantage of how noble of you noble born with a hammer in hand i was nobody handed me anything or dropped opportunity into my lap everything i've achieved i've done on my own and where is this hammer now the uh burden of leadership forced me to set it aside the carja risked nothing while demanding that good osram gamble with their lives out there someone had to step up and say no more you ordered the work stoppage indeed i did we're laborers not soldiers until the carja clean up their mess and give us the fair deal we deserve i'm not risking awesome lives fair deal you mean your concession decree it's not my decree it's on behalf of all the good osurum laborers of this land who do all the backbreaking work while only the carja reaped the rewards all we're asking for is the ability to share in this prosperity for a land worked by the people for the people right and just how much would be your share only an amount appropriate to my contributions to this community uh of course if chain scrape is on carja land should nicaragua be in charge who appointed you the sensibilities of good osram folk of course you think a carjacker can head this whole venture ah the magistrate can barely make the trek from baron light without losing a few screws so you have no real authority then people only follow you because you say so loudly anyone who has followers has authority i've been with chain scrape from the beginning i mean i'm practically its founder and it's honest folk know i'm indispensable to its success you said you founded chain scrape somehow i doubt that practically found it i said i alone saw its potential when it was just a smattering of tense in baron light's shadow i invested in the mine convinced some friends back home to do the same and here we are you could say chain scrape is what it is thanks to me oh so you're not just standing around and profiting off everyone else not at all sure i make a little return on my investment here and there but my main priority as it was from the beginning is to look after the well-being of these honest working awesome where's the whistle right in the middle of town but with the threat out there i'm not endangering innocent as room lives i'm going to clear out the bristle box and when i'm done this valley is gonna get moving if that's what it takes until then i'll keep looking after the safety of these good folk just be ready to blow the whistle better see what that carja magistrate wanted i bet he's in the tavern you wanted to speak to me well you know better than anyone it's a dangerous world out there and not just against machines james oderg this here's my training pit best place to practice close combat this side of the forbidden west say i wonder who'd win in a fight you the savior meridian champion of the east or the enduring master of the west who the enduring a legendary tanakh fighter the master of masters i've heard the tanakh have training pits just like this one it's how their warriors get so fierce see and only the very best from the pits get to train with the enduring so to find the enduring i should look for these training pits if i'm ever out that way you'll have to go far if you do the tanakh are split into three clans three clans three capitals three training pits my guess is you'd have to beat all of them if you want to train with the enduring if the tanakh don't kill you on sight that is but that's a far spark in the wind as for right now i also offer challenges to test your fighting skill who would i be fighting exactly you well i know you're the savior and all but you have to beat all the others first to challenge me rules are rules we only used old blades and practice arrows mind these drunken fools would run themselves through otherwise you'll have to leave everything but your spear and practice arrows at the gate but i'll look after your gear not to worry so what do you say up for some training i might be that's what i like to hear ignoring me again that energy doesn't last forever that spear can give you the edge in battle keep energizing it and then your enemies triggering those energy blasts should help you vanquish your opponents that reminds me get this from my stash when i need it [Music] that's always something hold tight i'll see what i can do [Music] gotta move before [Music] kill him however you want your wire's better though it's done got an opening [Music] thank the forge you showed up tripwire's handy but machine hunting is a youngins game come on over let me give thanks proper like see you're a practiced hunter took you less time to kill those scroungers and vanguards to kill one back so the vanguards came through here yeah just a bit ago down that bristle back headed south then those scroungers showed up to carve the carcass as they do then another bristle back ran through i'm telling you it's crazy around here so the vanguard went south probably this whole valley is swarming with them the vanguard seemed dead set on getting rid of them i see hold on there red if you're gonna go chase and cross the dot you're gonna want a trip caster not just any trip caster one of my make free of charge workmanship looks solid enough yep been tweaking the design since i left chain scrape more room to tinker out here and less chance of well accidents did something happen in chain scrape went like someone let me guess alvin back when i had a place in town he took a real interest in my wares kept pressing for the olvin discounts i said no i didn't like that so much i can't prove it but that chef bucket set my workshop on fire felt it best to put some distance between us after that cable car operator told me the bristlebacks just appeared yesterday do you know anything about them how is old carn back in the day me and him got into all sorts of trouble there was this one time anything about the bristlebacks no kahn said true i just showed up and ran amuck lucky for me i've got you and the vanguard swooping in time to time to save my backside i should get going thanks for the trip caster while you're blasting bristlebacks i think i'll head down to the hunting grounds did you know they have a trip caster trial come by later if you want to try it out maybe after i get things under control so aaron headed south should be able to pick up his tracks with my focus uh [Music] i can grab this from my stash leader [Music] so [Music] so trucks headed up the hill parents no focus can help let's see what this needs [Music] uh so uh sounds like someone's putting up a fight these bristle backs are everywhere another one down now this this is what i was forced for there's all that just to fill no boring mid-afternoon just the fight aloy eren ugh stay where you are i'll handle the rest those wrestle backs have acid canisters on their backs it should trigger a chain reaction if i hit them with acid arrows so uh [Applause] oh [Music] halfway so [Music] ah caught me at my best as usual well you did the hard part i just took care of the stragglers how bad is it this ah who needs ribs i'm good i'm good okay well i i know you didn't come all the way to the daunt just to watch me get wrecked so what's the story i need the embassy to happen so i can head west aaron what i did at the spire what we did it didn't end the threat [Music] it just slowed it down there's still more to do really well that's great i mean not the threat's not over par that's not so great but hey what whatever you're up against your spear my hammer just like old times aaron i need the embassy now i can't wait for you to heal a couple of days rest if that actually even if you weren't hurt what i have to do it's it's better if i do it alone [Music] alone now that figures erin i hate to interrupt the romance but i'm pretty banged up here i don't blow your blaze i'm coming ah this just keeps getting better huh listen i'll go to barren light get patched up if you want this embassy to happen we're gonna need this sun priest studious wadis oh i know him i'll clear the valley of bristlebacks then send what east to baron light i'll catch up with you there well i guess that's sort of like a goodbye i'm sorry you sorry that'd be a first where is this coming from hey just you know forget it yeah oh there's nothing it sounds like something all right fine now after the battle of the spire you took off you left without so much as a handshake i mean people like me we fought and bled at your side elon you just you just disappear what kind of person does that eren i left when i did how i did for a reason a good one oh thanks for sharing listen to me life on earth is in danger and only i can save it are you talking about exactly what i just said everything living is going to die unless i fix a piece of technology created by the old ones and time's running out well i yeah i guess that's the reason all right uh i'm an idiot errand by the forge i guess that's my cue maybe i should go with you to baron light no no hey you you need it elsewhere obviously we'll make it without you oh that doesn't sound good you'll have to handle that one on your own we'll only slow you down [Music] you
