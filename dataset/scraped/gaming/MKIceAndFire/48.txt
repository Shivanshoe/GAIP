ambassadors get yourselves comfortable my master will be with you shortly how do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands these federation types are cowards the

that didn't sound trivial we need to get out of here [Music] so much for the negotiation our lightsaber should make short work of that blasto or we can simply fight our way around it how should we proceed master yeah ah [Music] over there it's an invasion army we have to get down to the planet and warm in the booth let's go aboard one of these ships [Music] [Applause] oh no away [Music] ah

the senate to discuss the matter there the supreme chancellor has called for a special session of the senate to discuss the situation on nebu though i must be frank he has little real power and it is unlikely the senate will act on the invasion i believe our best is for her majesty to push for the election of a new supreme chancellor who can take control and give us justice ah here we are these

the explosion on the landing platform it is a great relief to know that you are okay senator amidala your tragedy on the landing platform terrible i think that count dooku was behind it count dooku was once a jedi he couldn't assassinate anyone master jedi may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces perhaps someone you're familiar with annie my goodness you've grown so have you grown more beautiful i mean well now that everyone's been reacquainted allow us to escort you to your quarters senator thank you mr kenobi but this seems unnecessary i don't need more security i need answers i need to know who's trying to kill me we're here to protect you senator not to start an investigation we will find out who's trying to kill you padme i promise you we will not exceed our mandate by young padawan learner i meant it in the interest of protecting her master of course perhaps with merely your presence the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed is it much farther master is mine and padme's company boring you already my padawan no of course not master i didn't mean we aren't far my apartment is just up ahead here we are shall we thank you for getting me here safely now if you'll excuse me i will retire hmm [Music] stay here there she is don't ever get away and be precise with your shots there are civilians everywhere we'll stop her master i promise great well if we could not crash before doing so i greatly appreciate it you need to relax i'm a great pilot you have much to learn about many things by young apprentice and flying is certainly one of them [Music] [Music] two [Music] watch out for that power coupling do [Music] ahead they've gone in that tunnel we almost have them [Music] [Music] [Music] keep on the mannequin as my flying improved faster and i'm still alive so there's that [Music] who hired you it was a bounty hunter card [Applause] toxic dart we'll have to split up escort senator amidala back to naboo she'll be safer there of course master r4 i think you can help me with something an old friend at the diner nearby knows all about this sort of things let's see if he recognizes this dog shall we um all right don't blow your top i'm going fast as i can that's dex let's see what the problem is you've uh caught me at a bad time my best waitress wanda has blown a fuse and i can't keep up with all these customers think you could help out an old buddy and take some orders to the right tables i gotta fix up old wander as soon as we get finished i'm all yours so what do you say great all you got to do is find out what each customer ordered and take them the right dish if a droid can do it i'm sure a jedi can better late than never that's definitely not a nuna drumstick if it is those nooner are not doing so good sorry definitely not enough layers to be my six six layer cake my jawa juice thanks this point it would have been quicker to fly wow let me add it any news on my six that's it thanks a lot looks delicious did everyone get their orders great i really owe you one and so this one took a fair bit of elbow grease but i'm happy to say she'll be back busting tables in no time now what do you want to talk about grab a seat and i'll be right with you tell me what this is what you got here is a camino saber dart kamino i'm not familiar with it is it in the republic no no it's beyond the outer rim these uh camino are huh keep to themselves they're cloners [Music] no r4 i don't recall camino on any of the usual charts let's head to the archives [Music] i've never heard of camino either let's run the coordinates dex gave us through the jedi archives see if we can find out more about it make your own [Music] won't take you too long just sit back and relax hey thanks for riding with us enjoy your visit to the federal district so where's your final destination have a smooth trip look at how generated on the way bye okay r4 upload the data dex gave us to the terminal according to dex camino should be right here but there's just empty space hmm lost a planet master obi-wan has how embarrassing there's nothing there gravity silhouette remains huh very good go to the center of gravity's pole and find your planet you will master yoda who could empty information from the archives that's impossible isn't it only a jedi could have erased those files but who and why harder to answer meditate on this i will [Music] need a ride cross planet hop in safe travels friend well i've had a fresh update so my existence has meaning again apparently yes this should be the right system keep your eyes peeled for our missing planet [Music] so uh master jedi i've been expecting you welcome after all these years i was beginning to think you weren't coming unexpected of course please tell your master that his order will be completed on time 200 000 units are ready with a million more on the way i'm sure he'll be quite proud of the army with built for him the army yes a clone eye but you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself now please [Music] when my master first contacted you about the operation did he say who it was for of course he did master seifer diaz ordered this army for the republic i'm sorry that's deciphered but he was killed almost 10 years ago i'm so sorry to hear that very impressive i'd hoped you would be pleased clones can think creatively you will find that they are immensely superior to droids i'm sure they're not talking about you onboard these clones how old are you oh yes we use growth acceleration otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow i see they are totally obedient taking any order without question we modify their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original ghost and who was the original host a bounty hunter called jango fett a bounty hunter i would very much like to meet this django fat and i would be very happy to arrange it for you apart from his pay which is considerable fett demanded only one thing an unaltered clone for himself curious isn't it unaltered pure genetic replication no tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration ah [Music] this he's come to check on our progress your clones are very impressive you must be very proud who hired you for this job i was recruited by a man called tyrannus do you like your army [Music] i look forward to seeing them in action thank you for your time django always a pleasure to meet a jedi i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for if our suspicions are correct he'll be wanting to leave quickly we best head to the nearest landing pad i'll handle this oh i can see why they wanted to clone him [Music] we mustn't let them get too far ahead let's go horse reflexes have their advantages now there's no time to waste let's follow him [Music] um um uh um [Music] ah [Music] [Music] dad i think we've been tracked hang on son we'll move into the asteroid field then we'll have a couple of surprises for them [Music] stand by this is going to be a bumpy ride [Music] he's around here somewhere i've got you now this won't be much of a fight homing missiles splendid type of charge great get out of here you're making my life more difficult than it needs to be [Music] you can't shake me that easily bounty hunter [Music] anakin would be loving this [Music] actually going into an asteroid field i must be crazy don't come any closer you're trying my patience [Music] [Music] what are you hiding who hired you i'm not here to play silly games your move why don't you just give up [Music] so [Music] [Music] get him dad get him r4 jettison the spare parts [Music] [Music] there's an unusual concentration of federation ships over there r4 hmm yes my lord i trust our plans are proceeding accordingly certainly with these droids the republic and the jedi won't stand a chance mom no [Music] you had another nightmare jedi

increasing threats of the separatists i will take what jedi we have left and go to geonosis and help obi-wan visit i will the cloners on camino we should hurry and get to geonosis obi-wan may be in real trouble looking to get across the planet rest whatever it is you look bored come learn some new stuff uh [Music] we decided to come and rescue you good job [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i've got

and well prepared well he's up against one of the most skilled jedi alive does he mean me or you okay [Music] it takes more than fireworks in a jet pack to defeat a jedi you telling master windu yes thank you master mundy supportive as always perhaps full ring would insult me more oh oh [Applause] huh [Music] the jedi have amassed a huge army my master will never allow the republic to get away with [Music] [Music] escapes rally more systems to his cause he will look over there i can't leave her don't let your personal feelings get in the way follow that speeder we must follow dooku into that stronghold up ahead prepare me we have a job to do anakin what do you think padme would do if she were in your position she would do her duty how are we gonna get up there master there will be something in that wreckage we can use come good to see you alive we were following dooku this way but we took a direct hit knocked us out of the sky like a sack of karelian spuds this gunship isn't much use now so if you need it for parts of jedi business help yourself oh we're trapped [Music] it is imperative that dooku does not escape we can worry about our exit later yes master which way shall we proceed master it matters not so long as we reach dooku before he flees the planet foreign [Music] [Applause] if he asks it was like that when we got here yes [Music] [Music] uh uh obviously

specifically the control room just up there i was supposed to report to the control room but this stupid door is on the fritz again where's a maintenance droid when you need one do you think these uniforms will let us use those terminals hey these suits of thermal detonators think they'll take that thing out [Music] so come on wow hmm well hello there what can i do for you to do [Applause]

[Music] not a bad bit of rescuing huh at least the information in r2 is still intact it's not over yet um we need to get this information to the rebel base on yavin 4 now and what information is that exactly the technical readout of that battle station i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found sounds complicated and not what i signed up for once i get my reward i'm out of here don't worry about your reward if money is all you want it's all you'll get now oh oh oh i've had a fresh update so my existence has meaning again welcome it's good to see you're still alive please hurry to the commander the generals are eagerly awaiting right this way they're waiting for you inside you brought the plans quick we must analyze them immediately the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet an analysis of the plans provided by princess leah has demonstrated a weakness huh a small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense man your ships and may the force be with you [Music] lock ass foils in attack position this is red five i'm going in right with you boss it'll be just like beggars canyon back home fighters coming in point three luke trust your feelings hmm this is red leader we won't be going anywhere with those turbo lasers us do your thing squadron hang on before the rebellion them all right i took out those turbo lasers good work but the job isn't over yet stay focused making our descendants of the trenches try and keep any tie fighters off our backs red five this space station is huge look out for more times moving on your position fighters [Music] so there's so many [Music] i'll take them myself cover me yes sir [Music] [Applause] look out kid [Applause] the central exhaust is closed when the others are functioning we have to get it open oh and lord vader appears to have joined the proceedings shoot the smaller exhaust you don't have all day to shoot the smaller exhaust

[Music] [Music] [Applause] um [Music] [Music] no sign of life out there general sensors are in place you'll know if anything comes i know around cold out too but princess leia is very concerned about master luke's whereabouts exactly we need to find captain self and tell him that master luke has yet to return if captain solo isn't in the hangar then he must be in the command center now follow me oh [Music] this better be important me and chewie are getting out of here soon excuse me sir princess leia is wondering about master luke he hasn't come back yet he might have forgotten to check in not likely are the speeders ready uh not yet we're having some trouble adapting them to the cold i will have to go out on tontons those signal towers if we recalibrate them we can boost luke's comlink signal and triangulate his location if you say so general let's go many creatures great and small reside in these planes some friendly like our tauntauns here and some not so friendly oh great did you at least check the area for the not-so-friendly ones when you arrived we were as thorough as we could be in conditions like this fantastic i lose an arm i'm blaming you hey you think we can get this thing working again those cannons could be useful scout joints great we can't let them leave the surface now things are starting to heat up well okay wait for him [Music] [Music] it couldn't just be easy could it you gotta melt that ice you don't say six [Music] we need to get to the top to recalibrate it oh huh [Laughter] that wasn't my stomach by the way stay vigilant that's one down but the signal still too weak let's find some more towers come on there should be a signal tower in there thanks rican keep warm gee thanks princess don't worry it's easy to get the cold shoulder out here oh so you think you're a comedian huh give me a break [Music] huh hmm [Applause] let me guess we need to find a way to get across this broken walkway right [Music] [Applause] uh huh [Applause] hey that doesn't belong to you now play nice and hand it over quick [Music] now we can get the power back online and climb this tower [Music] it actually looks pretty high from down here i'll be a gentleman and let you climb up this one [Music] [Music] huh [Music] oh ugh [Music] what is that a wamper and our reason to be hasty all right now let's get the last one luke's still out there somewhere i don't have time to talk about dinner right now chewie i'm freezing out here hey not all of us are covered in fur you know you finished work on the falcon he hung up on me how come you guys haven't defrosted these already in these conditions it'll be about as fruitful as herding wrath towers oh huh huh huh [Music] that's all the towers up and running and it looks like they've already triangulated luke's position and what are we waiting for let's go find him before the weather gets worse there's [Music] luke luke oh um ben you will go to the dagobah system there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me ben ben it's so good to see you fully functional again thanks threepio well your worship looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer i don't know where you get your delusions laser brain laugh it up buzz ball princess we have a visitor always thinking with your stomach an imperial probe droid i didn't hit it that hard it must have had a self-destruct

empire's coming let's get a snow speeder ready and head out there not in great condition we can fix it right r2 all troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance the heavy disks will leave as soon as they're loaded only two fighter escorts per ship the energy shield can only be open for a short time so you'll have to stay very close to your transports two fighters against a star destroyer the ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path when you've gotten past the energy shield proceed directly to the rendezvous point understood good luck great that's the engine fix well we'll need a new wing if we're gonna fly out of here we did it time to get out there are two oh we have spotted imperial walkers echo station 3ta go go go it's really heating up out there still feels pretty cool to me this is rogue two we got some ats and snow troopers looking a little cold let's go warm up copy that rope great job luke that was just they're trying to destroy our power generator stop those ats we need that power generator fully functional to power the v150 planet defender it's the only weapon we have powerful enough to hit that approaching star destroyer gotcha great work rogue squadron luke you have to stop those 8080s the base can't take much more all right boys keep tight now we're gonna have to pull these guys keep going luke [Music] good job luke you did it i'm glad that's over luke do you copy it's getting bad here and we got three more atas heading our way you have to bring them down wedge get ready don't sound so

going we're going prepare to make the jump to light speed they're getting closer oh yeah watch this i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged it is impossible to go to light great we can still outmaneuver them all right chewie you ready hold on this could get bumpy see i'll get us out of this no problem there is still more tie fighters on my tail but less than there was before i call that progress i don't want to be here all day we need to escape these star destroyers oh no need to stop them from tracking us so we have to shoot out their radar dishes and their turrets those things have quite the range trust me regular laser cannons won't put a dent in them you'll need to hit them with a proton torpedo my senses detect that we have taken severe damage what gave you that idea hey fly boy wanna start concentrating you two give me a break oh [Music] [Applause] one you're not actually going into an asteroid field they'd be crazy to follow us wouldn't they sir the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid never tell me the odds i can't believe we're doing this this wasn't top of my agenda this morning either princess let's take a look here excuse me man that better be good i'm going in closer to one of the big ones closer closer there that looks pretty good i hope you know what you're doing yeah me too [Music] there's nothing wrong r2

up camp for the night now where's the equipment great well i'm not swimming out to get it let's look around hopefully that'll keep away the bugs and whatever else is lurking out there now all i gotta do is find this yoda if he even exists away put your weapon i mean you're no harm i'm looking for a jedi master you seek yo oh i don't even know what i'm doing here we're wasting our time i cannot

father can never be turned from a dark side so will it be with you you're wrong [Applause] it was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator it is quite safe from your pitiful little band all groups assume attack coordinates witness the fire power of this fully armed and operational battle station fire at will commander [Music] that thing's operational good i can feel your anger strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete [Music] use your aggressive feelings boy [Music] you couldn't bring yourself to destroy

i'll figure it out you see that officer go through the door on the left guess that's our best chance of finding me some suitable attire you can tell the squadron centered jakku have returned i know the amount of sand those troopers have tread around the barracks is absolutely disgraceful i thought i was on tatooine when it went in there despicable behavior wipe their boots or empty their armor

portion or two out of one car plug let's head to nema outpost [Music] hey yep um let's see what you've got these five pieces are worth one half portion last week there were a half portion each what about the droid the droid's not for sale i'll pay for him portions come on baby water water oh let's get out of here we'll see about that [Music] helping you i didn't ask your help what is it jacket this droid says you stole it it belonged to poe dameron he was captured by the first order i helped him escape but our ship crashed so you're with the resistance obviously bb-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base apparently he has a map that leads to luke skywalker and everyone's after it luke skywalker come on we can't outrun them watch out so much for outrunning them another foot jumper but how are we going to reach it it's locked away i think i have an idea bb-8 [Music] roof [Music] whoa come on let's get to that quad jumper what about that ship that one's garbage [Applause] hey that's mine [Music] get ready you ever fly this thing nope bb-8 hold on [Music] are [Music] stay low it confuses their tracking stay low got it hey keep setting me up and i'll keep laughing this ship really moves just wait till i get the compressor off the ignition line i'm getting pretty good i believe there's a map to luke skywalker inside bb-8 yeah the resistance i mean we really need that map then we best get away from the first order not bad for garbage you're amazing you're gonna have to lose this get ready okay for what we're gonna go inside that downstart destroyer aren't we it's fine i scavenge them all the time we aren't going to blow a hole in that engine with these cannons we need something more heavy duty like a proton torpedo or something wait a minute these ties might be carrying the proton torpedoes we need the first order tie pilots are some of the best i've seen we gotta watch out they're right in front of us it's getting a little cozy in here he's with the resistance help me with this quick between us i'm not with the resistance okay i'm just trying to get away from the first order but you tell us where the base is i'll get you there first deal so where's your base go on bb-8 teller the illinium system yeah that's the one get us there as fast as you can [Applause] [Music] we're gonna make the jump to the eye union system everyone's trapping it's the first order what do we do where'd you get this ship don't tell me your wrath star's gotten loose oh great it's the guavian security soldiers get below and stay there until i say so han solo we want our money back now you think hunting wrath cars is cheap kanji club wants that investment back too that bb unit the first order is looking for one just like it and two fugitives if we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both games [Applause] i got a bad feeling about this this was a mistake huge did we just release another raptor three rathers four what's the difference free solo android is coming with us [Music] way back to the falcon that preferably doesn't involve getting eaten the doors are in auto lockdown till we get rid of this raft pretty sure i left an anti-wrath tower something or other than one of those crates you know we're getting somewhere uh [Music] hey look we're sending something up to you use it to move that wrapped up [Music] here goes nothing we're headed to the falcon find a way to meet us there but we don't know where we are that's the spirit uh there they are uh so [Music] oh [Music] uh maybe releasing those rap cars was a good thing estimate that when we get back on the falcon the ship isn't really up to code looks like he's got more than raptors on this ship so um [Music] uh yes they won't be getting their money back hey kids you you still alive yeah way down here great we need to clear those force fields chewie the containment units well when does being unsure ever stopped us huh uh uh huh we're close the falcon is just through there the falcon come on uh we need that crane uh are you sure [Music] help me they had me but the door that was lucky [Music] i found the falcon we made it [Music] dude i think i might be able to reach that lever hmm oh so what's that thrust we're going out of here at lightspeed inform the first order that han solo has the joy they want and it's aboard the millennium falcon [Applause] skywalker returns the new jedi cries by the grace of your training i will not be seduced the weapon it is ready we shall destroy the government that supports the resistance the republic [Applause] go overseas [Music] [Applause] fugitives huh has to get to the resistance base as soon as possible he's carrying a map to luke skywalker you want my help you're

i didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy solo why are we here again i guess you're droid on a clean ship clean you think it was luck that chewie and i found the falcon if we could find it on our scanners the first order is not far behind you want to get bb-8 to the resistance mask is our best bet we'll find her here in her castle let me do the talking and whatever you do don't stare at what anyone han solo oh boy hey boss i assume you need something i need you to get this droid to leia hmm no you've been running from this fight for too long please we need your help come on

the general she's going to want to talk to you come on bb-8 hans soda it is i see you must not recognize me on the way in due to my stylish red arm there's actually an interesting story who are you calling self-indulgent general i regret to inform you but this map recovered from bb-8 is only partially complete can't believe i was so foolish i think i could find luke and bring him home the scan data from snaps reconnaissance flight confirms finn's report this was the death star and this is starkiller base the weapon that destroyed the hosnian system oh hang on this this thing's 4k the first order they're charging the weapon again now our system is the next target okay how do we blow it up that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator they have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate i can disable their shields but i have to be there on the planet we'll get you there i am not sure master solo recognized me do you suppose he was confused by my red arm what would you know don't read anything won't you how'd you find what you needed wow the flooding tunnel is over that ridge we'll get in that way let's find ray where am i you're my guest i know you've seen the map and now you'll give it to me i'm not giving you anything give me the map never ah wait here [Applause] the scavenger resisted you she is strong with the force then the resistance must be destroyed before they get to skywalker prepare the weapon supreme leader i can get the map from the girl bring her to me you will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open i will remove these restraints and leave the cell with a door open [Applause] the longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have the shields i have an idea about that ah hey intruders all right big deal now one basma movie you're all useless sanitation you won't be able to take out fasteners trust me fire fire fire do you think you can destroy this battle station you are solely mistaken hey i recognize that guys so so get them pathetic i will deal with you myself we're going to need that power core if there's any chance of us capturing phasma stop hiding she takes one step on this and she'll be in for the shock of her life i think you're enjoying this a little too much kid but you like being in charge phasma get down here and let me show you how to deal with intruders the only way this plan is gonna work is if we use that power core uh wow oh [Music] one minute she's just walking under this inconspicuous bridge then blimp will you keep it down let's get her to the system control room we can shut down the shield from him there don't celebrate quite yet your pitiful band of peasants will never destroy this base whether you open the door now you want me to blast that bucket off your head lower the shields you're making a big mistake what do we do with her is there a garbage chute trash compactor yeah there is huh finn what are you doing here escape now hug later the shields are down almost in range hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get direct hit but no damage my friends got a bag full of explosives let's use it if you're going to get inside i need to find the junction box girl knows her stuff keep your hat on i'm coming let's make a move we need to be ready at the door once ray gets it open atta girl are you trying to blow us up [Music] hey when i dropped

me yes hmm thank you hit the target hard give it everything you got [Music] we aren't getting inside that oscillator just yet let's bend down the defense red squadron blue squadron do your thing aye aye captain remember when the sun is gone we got a chance [Applause] before they have a lot of firepower grab them and fire them at those towers the last of their cannons are down all right black leader there's a brand new hole in that oscillator we did it the oscillator doors are open i'm going in run you uh the falcons this way ah traitor oh [Music] that lightsaber it belongs to me come and get it fight me let me put you out of your misery second time holding the lightsaber and i'm fighting kylo ren keep learning no one will stand in my way not han not you you don't deserve to wield that saber give it to me he wants us to follow he's probably a trap but we can't let him get away i see his footprints he went this way over there a scavenger and a traitor youtuber this whole planet is falling apart we can't let him get away with what he's done you're a monster it's just us now han solo can't save me [Music] you won't win you can't watch me it's the ones who destroyed the base oh [Music] you sure you're okay finn i'm fine we have to stop him let's just find a way past this thing come on let's end this [Music] think what you could achieve with the proper training [Music] you need a teacher i can show you the ways of the force [Music] oh um [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] well i wonder what's gotten into him bb-8 says he has something to show us

i'll take chewie in the falcon i'll go find luke that's or two stay and watch the falcon okay for waiting luke luke skywalker oh [Music] happy beeps here buddy come on we pulled crazier stunts than this happy beeps what did i just say about happy beef just for the record commander dameron i'm with the droid on this one thank you for your support general all right we're within range just let me do the talking okay here goes nothing huh urgent communication from poe dameron of the republic fleet oh it's a very good likeness how is your mother sir obliterate them he's going for the dreadnought huh all right take it up the cannons now tally start your approach copy that man they really went wild with the cannons on this thing huh as well here comes the parade we're still evacuating the base almost everyone's joined the fleet we're just waiting on the last few ships evacuation almost complete just a little longer the evacuation is complete you did it po now get your squad back here so we can get out of this can do this we have the chance to take out a dreadnought disengage now that's an order uh bad connection gotta go squadron bring the bombs keep that type formation fighters protect the bombers it's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought so let's make this count this one's going in the scrapbook bb-8 we have to protect that last bomber it's our only hope they're targeting the fleet we need to protect that last bomber it's our only chance to bring down that dreadnought [Music] they just won't stop unless we close out their hangars hey bb-8 you're thinking torpedo time that's right this dreadnought is a fleet killer we can't let it get away [Music] doors open it's all down to you they can't get away supreme leader we have them tied on the end of a string the mighty kylo ren takes that ridiculous thing off you're just a child in a mask prepare my ship [Music] well done pal spin naked leaking bag what we need to get you dressed come on one thing at a time buddy let's get you dressed first we'll find you a jacket and some pants there's got to be a closet around here or something come on let's get you some clothes that don't leak what there's nothing in here who took it all tell me about it people have a habit of borrowing and not returning here if you look around the ship i'm sure you'll find some stairs lying around it says here that the last jacket went out to a pea dameron don't think i know the guy the jacket should be in that wardrobe there you know what i probably could have just opened the door instead yeah never really like that wardrobe anyway that should do it all right now let's head back to the closet so you can get changed in peace well i'm dressed so where now all right we've got to go back to the bridge for a debriefing we'll get you all caught up while we're there where's ray so huh they've tracked us through light speed that's impossible follow my lead it's [Music] so who's in charge next in command is vice admiral holdo thank you commander what's our plan stick to your post and follow my orders what are you doing here just uh doing some checks checking the escape pods this fleet is doomed i need to warn my friend ray if she comes back to it she's doomed too i'm turning you in for desertion i wasn't running away i need to get to my friend and warn her that this ship is doomed we can jump to light speed they can track us through light speed they can track us through light speed yeah and we're dangerously low on fuel active tracking hyperspace tracking is new tech but the principle must be the same they're only tracking us from the lead ship so we got to speak the po even if we got on the star destroyer to switch it off who knows where the breaker room even is the guy who used to mop it if i can get us there i can shut their tracker down why would a door be locked behind some target practice it's the only way to ensure everyone is training with their blaster you got that look on your face tell me what's going on the first order is only tracking us from one destroyer the lead one so we blow that one up i like where your head's at but no sneak on board disable the track our fleet escapes before they realize how do we sneak the two of you onto snoke's destroyer find the master code breaker you the fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left we gotta hurry i'll be here to jump us to light speed

escape through the sewer oh we don't have our grapplers we're gonna have to get them back from the guardrail hey huh the alarm if we set it off the guards will have to come investigate that'll draw

of these a sith wayfinder i'm gonna start where his trail went cold the forbidden desert of basana get that compressor fixed all right then let's head to pasano just been getting some new hints yay more forth servitude people like you what is this festival of the ancestors [Music] i've never seen anything like this i've never seen so few wayfinders so what now we talk to people maybe find out what drew luke here it's nice to look up at the sky and see kites flying around instead of first order ships coming to get me and my family this whole festival really takes my mind off their galaxy-wide occupation you know don't know if you can tell but i'm not from around here i suggest talking to a local they look like the knowledgeable types [Music] that weird hermit keeps ruining my vibe bumbling around with his mask on muttering ochi this and ochi that wish he would just goachie away this is one of the weirdest collections of folks i've ever seen and i witnessed the ewok duloc wars my neck feels bare all other outsiders have those beautiful necklaces on where do i get one of those well that was useless let's try asking a local what what it's the mask isn't it i'm going to find you and i'm going to turn you to the dark side my knights and i are going hunting for the scavenger we have to go back to the falcon now leia sent me a transmission [Music] [Music] he was carrying a clue that could lead to a wayfinder only two were made we followed his ship halfway across the galaxy it was abandoned out past lurch canyon i've got a bad feeling about this we've spotted the fugitives go there those speeders [Music] we have to get to oh they fly now they fly now another speeder i won't be able to fly this thing if i'm faced down in the sun like that calm down 3po i'll i'll get us out of this that doesn't fill me with as much confidence as you think sir we gotta shoot those feeders they sent more reinforcements [Music] oh geez i've seen that before [Music] thinking try to grab something will miss agony everlast where are the others let's find them [Music] i have to be in these tunnels somewhere we'll find them i'm sure of it you didn't say my name sir but i'm all right pope you helped make a route across there [Music] hmm you seem to know your way around this place huh [Music] i do not want to know what made these tunnels judging by the circumference of the tunnel walls that i said i do not want to know not [Music] bones i don't like bones never a good sign probably we might still be with way out this way we have to hurry guess we're not the first ones to end up down here horrible things have happened with this there's writing on it oh i know exactly where the wayfinder is unfortunately i am mechanically incapable of speaking translations from sits [Music] [Applause] [Music] i just transferred a bit of life force energy from me to him you gotta keep moving to find someone who can translate that dagger like a helpful droid i suggest we return to the millennium falcon at once they'll be waiting for us at the falcon i got a better idea we cannot possibly fly out in that old wreck we don't really have an option 3po hmm huh [Music] huh [Music] ray they got true [Music] huh oh [Music] that was the only clue to the wayfinder thing and it's gone so true the inscription lives only in my memory now in your memory yes i know a black market droid smith a black market droid smith he's on kajimi [Music] shoes all right i know what we should do follow me i know my way around kinda it's it's been a while the first order of taking

behind those troopers and take one of them out i'll get the other one get the cover quick just hang tight a second see those lookouts you shoot one and i'll get the other but stay back or they'll see
