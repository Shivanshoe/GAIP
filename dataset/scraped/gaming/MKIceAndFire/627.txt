a battle raged at the end of the first tournament the forces of earth realm were facing the greatest challenge [Music] uh okay look at y'all [Applause] wow [Applause] come here [Music] academy [Music] you won your first mortal kombat tournament earth has been spared but shang tsung is a poor loser this is goro's lair it is one of shang tsung's traps you must find your way off the island before it crumbles into the sea make your way to the wuxi academy [Music] behind you ah up here [Music] this is the way off the island it is another of shang tsung's servants [Music] [Music] next [Music] um [Music] [Music] uh long ago in the magic realm of outworld shao khan hungered for power for strength for all things dark and arcane the blood he spilled in his brutal conquest of outworld is impossible to measure or imagine as was his hunger once all he could see was under his control shao khan turned his attention to earth but the elder gods had created a mystical tournament to protect earth known as mortal combat xiao khan could only lay claim to earth if his champions were victorious in the tournament thus far earth's warriors have triumphed saving earth but some fights only require a lone victory and all can be lost with a single defeat you have ensured peace for earth once again this day but there is no power in these metals apart from the knowledge you must carry into every battle that no one is a champion alone if one of us is in chains none of us are free if even one succeeds the victory is ours liu kang you have defeated the sorcerer shang tsung you have saved this realm as your forefathers did from his evil you are earthrealms champion and hero thank you master aidan when next the tournament is fought it will be my ancestors that are honored sonia blade you were a warrior before the tournament began but here you have been tested and triumphed against enemies beyond earth's measure thank you master raiden i know you have your chief officers to report to but know that you will always have friends here and warriors willing to help you in your future missions sir johnny cage lay it on me raiden bow you idiot despite your natural shortcomings you have proven yourself a valuable ally against shang tsung you have the respect of myself and the shaolin order [Music] master family honor is not won in a single day it is one all the days of a life it is one in fidelity and faithfulness it is achieved through perseverance there is not a warrior here that would have survived if you had not warned them of the traps in goro's lair your family has been honored your friends honor you as well for the moment you have earned rest enjoy the peace you will find walking these grounds [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] defend the academy [Music] uh no not again this isn't right we defeated you [Music] uh keep them off me while i close the front gate [Music] [Music] keep moving needs your help you defy the elder gods you are violating the rules of mortal combat you traitor [Music] well done [Music] they took sonya and killed i don't know how many monks should my family feel honored now [Music] hmm do you trust me listen to my words as you continue your exercises for you will need to remember them later zhang is not as defeated as we had hoped i faced him while you fought the attacking mutants more i believe he now defies the elder gods themselves baraka could not have come with a legion of mutant scum had shang not been aiding him with his defeat in the mortal kombat tournament he will be anxious to prove himself superior to you and take his vengeance this will make him reckless and more dangerous than ever [Applause] i had hoped you would have time to heal your wounds in the tournament but i was gravely mistaken you must go to outworld we must take the battle there if we are to save earth i am weary after the tournament but rest is a luxury afforded only to the dead of course i will go to outworld and what of you kung lao what do you say of course take the portal to outworld the portal to outworld there may be a warning warning all magic carries warnings koblau we must be cautious but isn't this shang tsung's magic how can we trust his warnings i know how shang thinks i will not have as much power in outworld but here i have the power to make the way safe if i had let you enter before you would have been pulled inside out this is what i can offer you in the conflict to come [Music] listen master aiden if i am to die here then it will be for the honor of my family very well i believe that i will be of great assistance to liu kane after all your magics are too limited in our world that is correct kung lao but i can still give you my knowledge of this place i will try to hide my presence from shang tsung i dare not attract his attention and therefore endanger you and should you encounter sonja blade in this realm be cautious this place changes even the most honorable of warriors she may be a friend come mortals come face the princess of outworld and die i believe your presence here is still a mystery to shang tsung but you cannot defeat him alone there is an ally here who may be of aid to you her name is kitana kitana she is a native of outworld and a powerful ally against those who threaten earth can we trust anyone who comes from this place you said that if we this realm was not always as you see it now it was once a place of indescribable beauty and purity this world was corrupted by secret evil alliances be careful that the same does not happen to you you must guard your heart sometimes even from your allies yes follow little one follow me to damnation try to keep up mortal do not be late to your own funeral you're beautiful who are you i am kitana the loyal daughter of xiao khan the eternal emperor of outworld and you are enemies of this realm and therefore my enemies isn't she supposed to be helping us [Music] this is not over mortal she is under a holding spell she is being controlled you must release her from the spell and set her free [Music] wow [Music] [Music] uh huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] finally i am free but quickly the others will not let me go without a fight [Music] oh here let me help you thank you who are you i am lou kang i come from earth realm this is kung lao we are here to stop shang tsung from attacking earth shang it is not shang tsung that wants earth not shang tsung uh you better take a look at this one of them is dead the other is only stunned jay you killed her she was my best friend and you killed her don't touch me i should destroy you for killing jade she tried to kill us i am sorry you were under a spell of some sort you were trying to kill us where am i how did i get here maybe this one can explain and do not look under the veil let me go explain yourself jade was my kitana's best friend until jade was forced by shao khan to hunt her down and bring her back to him we were given a spell to control her shao khan isn't that your father i do not blame you for this jade i blame the man that forces me to call him father the one who killed my true father and stole his throne i blame shao khan for what he did to my mother what is it i am remembering a lot now where's reptile who reptile if molina is here so is reptile they are inseparable i am certain that they have both been charged with hunting me down [Music] i cannot let her escape wait there is more to this than we know raiden would tell us if there was you need to think more about what is happening and less about this girl you just rescued master raiden raiden kung lao lukang i have discovered that shang tsung has somehow used the elder gods magic boundaries to make outworld vulnerable i do not understand you can weaken him by winning victories against shang tsung's assassins it means that your every battle here affects shang tsung's power directly you must fight until one of you is victorious it is the only way to save earth we will be in competition with each other then shang tsung's power will be divided between you that will make him vulnerable and incapable of attacking earth raiden who is shao khan where's katana he is not to be concerned with kitana is still regaining her memory and trying to understand the effects of the magic she was cursed with you two must concern yourselves with saving earth realm through the portals you will find more battles more ways to weaken shang tsung yes [Music] it is reptile we find him maybe we find your girlfriend katana is not my girlfriend she may help us remember so what do we do this is what raiden was talking about if we defeat reptile shanks soon will be that much weaker i will defeat reptile you can watch that is what raiden was talking about this place is enormous i'm still trying to make sense out of what katana told us do you see reptile no you check over there [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so oh [Applause] wow now [Music] you killed reptile this is very good master why do you say that you are feeding the soul tombs this is all we hoped for how is this going to save earth realm i thought we were here to stop shang tsung i yes master raiden something is wrong yes but i am certain raiden will let us know when it is time master raiden i fear lukang that kung lao no matter how much he desires to serve his ancestors is becoming a liability to the tournament master raiden it is this place evil spirits swim in the air searching for souls to nest in you are the mortal combat champion you will need to remember who you are if you are going to defeat shang tsung the soul tombs are a source of shang tsung's power you must destroy them i can trust only you you are the champion of mortal combat you alone are strong enough to resist the corruption of this realm yes master raiden what up something is wrong i knew it trust your instincts kung lao trust what you know your ancestors will guide you the soul tombs are the source of shang tsung's power [Music] people of earth realm often ask what purpose does suffering serve here it serves a terrible and awful purpose when someone perishes here their soul and essence are collected and trapped in a place known as the soul tombs these tombs are a source of shang tsung's power the black dragon mercenaries came to rescue their leader kano but were swept up in shang tsung's manipulations just like we were master raiden shangsung did not have the power to defeat you in earth realm but here here he hopes to reverse your victory in mortal combat and take earth realm after your defeat so shang tsung gets stronger every time we enter combat and even more powerful every time we win how do we fight that do we stop fighting stop killing no your journey must move forward but there is a repository of souls that adds to shang tsung's strength go and destroy this soul tomb and shang tsung will begin to lose his power shang tsung [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you waste my time your souls aren't even worthy additions to my power kill them hurry we have to destroy the soul tombs [Music] wow [Music] [Music] are you okay ah [Music] [Music] ah [Music] um [Music] i wish raiden would warn us if it is not helpies it is baraka we have done just as he suggested master raiden i see i think this place is getting to raiden look who is that me you have failed to win the mortal kombat tournament take your place as my servant i should have won you are a fool to defy honor hunter is the very thing i fight for that is not you remember what raiden said they are our ancestors raiden said triumphs and failures i wonder what happened what was that all about i do not know but i get the feeling that this is something raiden wanted us to see i hope you are not telling me to trust in what i do not know again no we are part of an ancient mystery that is all i will not let you tell my father that he no longer controls me molina he is a monster everyone he touches becomes like you [Music] where is she going to the wasteland to seek help from goro the wasteland can help to do what to kill me you idiot and then to kill you why does she hate you so much she is my clone as long as i am alive it is as if she is not real a soulless husk if i die my soul and identity before the man that calls me daughter will become hers shao khan has spells that will allow her to claim my very existence then we have to stop molina before that can happen i knew you were going to say that [Music] wow [Music] test your [Music] excellent go my thanks warriors we are here to stop shang tsung will you help us i'm sorry i can't my clan needs me and they must know that we have been betrayed by one of our own but know that i too am opposed to shang tsung and everything that is wrong in this place know that the enemy of your enemy is your friend thank you i love doing something for nothing do not be a fool kung lao nothing is done for no reason we are here to secure freedom for earth realm and for this realm as well you know what they say about a cold day in hell this is it whoever you are it matters little i have learned to call everyone [Music] why did you do that yes why did you do that sub-zero is dead he died after the mortal combat tournament raiden told us scorpion killed him so who are you the man you saw die was my brother and i am not even certain he is truly dead i came here to avenge him and believe that he may still yet live in one form or another i've been told that if i can find some vestige of his power i may find him why think everyone is an enemy everyone in this realm is an enemy even those that i once called friends and allies on earth now hunt me and want to kill me why have you come to the wasteland to rescue his girlfriend for the last time she is not my girlfriend we are here to stop shang tsung there's a warrior named katana an ally she is in danger from her clone molina and a creature known as goro i know of goro they say he cannot be beaten in combat still he has not faced me your friend this ally does not stand a chance against him i see now that i may have been wrong about you you could have killed me and you did not i heard the red dragon clan speak about another prisoner they had do you think they might have been talking about katana if they have her you will need to go further into the wasteland and cross the sea of blood the souls of those who die here are put to other purposes the bodies are added to this lake of damnation how do we cross it there is an old boat near here i could repair it for you i will take you there and face goro [Music] [Music] uh our destination the exit must be up top we need to get there somehow [Music] [Music] scorpion he killed my brother i cannot go with you now if our paths cross again or i find goro i will keep my oath [Music] you cannot help me go scorpion has escaped to the nether realm [Music] gone like he was never here at all [Music] i know that voice it is goro wasn't so soon supposed to take care of [Music] this [Applause] [Music] [Music] you should have let me take down goro i am the mortal kombat champion i'm earth realms champion what what i think you had better start doing what i tell you do you have any idea what you are talking about only what raiden should have told you a long time ago you should not turn your back on me kulau nice try shang tsung i am not so certain i want you anywhere near me that is exactly what shang tsung desires listen shang tsung is trying to turn us against each other back in the academy he was impersonating me he can morph into anyone he wants i didn't know was shang tsung at the time i tried to warn you and then i realized if someone could look like me he could look like either of you two as well so i followed you through the portal and waited and watched so how long was shang posing as liu kang i think it was when we were separated while fighting goro i suppose that means we still have to rescue katana a girl is she hot you will find katana elsewhere i have something else for johnny cage to do follow me [Music] shang tsung's defeat is close but there is one more defense you will need to stop him you will find this key to shang tsung's defeat in the nether realm the entry to that realm is at the [Music] portals [Music] how is it that we can enter and survive in another realm i thought only evil or tainted souls could enter this one what do you think has happened to your souls every time you have killed while on your quest your souls have become tainted you must be strong enough to not let that control you you know raiden should not be able to do that what i thought he could not use magic in this world who's that [Music] don't take another step or i'll stop you myself [Music] sub-zero what happened to scorpion i thought you were after him i was scorpion is still here but i will not allow you to face noob saibot noob saibot for all we know this could be shang tsung he is trying to keep us from getting the key to save earth do not worry he does not serve shang tsung he is possessed by one of the elder gods there is more here than just shang tsung's attempt to invade earth realm the gods are involved how do you know noob saibot is not part of this because i i think he is my brother if you want to stop shang tsung defeat scorpion where is he the nether realm is infinite in size but scorpion will find you if you are here in this realm if your brother is possessed how can you help him he will most likely try to kill you again i will find a way to free him that could take a long time as long as it takes finding scorpion should not be as hard he wants to kill you [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] ah uh you have all you will need to defeat shang tsung and save earth realm there is a portal there that will take you to a place where shang will be at his most vulnerable i am uncertain about kung lao he seems different strange johnny cage told me that shang tsung was impersonating him do you think he is now masquerading as kulau i had not considered that possibility be on your guard that is all there is a door that would lead you to the foundry you must find it to defeat shang tsung your attacks are quick [Music] [Music] hello a gun that is not going to do you much good here or against me it's you kung lap raiden told me you'd be here soon raiden he's been guiding me through this place i've been sent to rescue agent sonja blade sonia blade is here that's what raiden says you know i'm better than me how long have you been here i don't know time is different in israel it feels like weeks and raiden has been with you the entire time pretty much he says he has little power here the best he can do is see pieces of the future and act as a guy i have to keep going i've been sent from earth to rescue sonia i am concerned about raiden lou kang i am not certain we can trust him raiden was right this is not kung lao this is shang this is my chance i will not be fooled again shang tsung what [Applause] listen to me you are not to fight each other shang tsung has deluded you he has been tricking you into feeding him soul after soul you have been empowering him he has been masquerading raiden master you insult me flee i am shalgon i will be your death follow if you want to defeat shang tsung follow me if you want to diet my hands [Applause] tail now world tech haven't they ever heard of ball bearings [Music] sonia you're gonna be okay i'll get you out of here not so fast grunt she's my prize [Music] you just messed up big time buddy [Music] oh [Applause] man kano was tougher than he looked thanks guys yeah thanks although i nearly had everything under control it was my honor to be of help to you yes it was no problem for us but now we must go and face shao khan listen i wish we could stay and help but i've got to get her back to base for treatment you fight with honor and you care for your friends i could not ask for more than that go in peace hey look us up when you get back to earth realm come over let's get you home girl you're lucky i can't take you down right here if i can't stay to help maybe this will come in handy what happened to raiden silence [Music] your presence here is unwanted uninvited but like all who come to this realm you serve me whether you are aware of it or not no we do not where is our master raiden ah your master you know his voice so well yet know him almost not at all your master is here he wants to see you he has another lesson for you master aidan the [Applause] he is possessed shao khan is controlling him whatever hold shao khan has on you master fight it thank you thank you for serving me so well [Music] to be myself again it is only right that this victory be mine and mine alone we destroyed your soul tombs you should not be this strong is that what your master raiden told you to do [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] as i said all within this realm serve my will even those that seek to betray me i do not understand impersonated your master raiden and led you on a quest for power the more you killed the more powerful he became he meant to use this power against me to become the supreme ruler of outworld now what am i to do with you [Applause] my people have spoken and a king must if only once every millennium or so listen to the will of his people [Applause] uh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yes oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] there is something in you that makes me feel like a conqueror again our friends where are our friends you can earn their freedom defeat me and they will be freed [Applause] how can we defeat you [Music] the elder gods will help you we have saved our friends the ones you captured your plans [Applause] easily as is it's about time [Applause] [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] kane what now master raiden shao khan has been destroyed you have brought life and prosperity not only for earth but for this realm as well my warriors and you have freed the spirits of your ancestors from their inability to lay their lives down for each other and work together [Music] you fought bravely liu kang thank you katana so what happens now i will try to rebuild this realm according to my true father's wishes i meant between us whoever said anything about their being and us she's hot and she picks luke hang over me what's wrong with this picture maybe i have time to find that clone of her somebody mentioned did i really free my ancestors this was the plan of the elder gods kobrau this was the reason you were allowed to follow the enemy's plots what the enemy means for evil a greater force will always turn for good you have freed the past and future well done champion of mortal kombat [Applause] now come it is time to return home [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] it was not by chance that this trouble came to be the blame falls squarely upon my shoulders for giving evil the chance it needed and therefore fulfilling an ancient prophecy raiden's realm champions had failed to stop the deadly alliance from fully resurrecting the mummified army of the dragon king in the end only raiden himself stood between earth realm and total destruction defying the elder god's wishes he alone challenged quan chi and shang tsung in mortal combat earth realm's last hope for freedom [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] raiden fought well against the two sorcerers and it seemed as though victory was at hand but the combined might of quan chi and shang song proved to be overwhelming even from a thunder god raiden was defeated the deadly alliance had won their victory was short-lived as suspicion and lust for power overcame both quan chi and shang tsung the former allies turned on each other the deadly alliance was no more [Music] and reveled in his conquest but it is said that there is only one true ruler of outworld and that ruler had returned [Music] the prophecy had been fulfilled the dragon king had indeed returned to outworld to reclaim his army and impose his dominance death awaited all who stood in his way [Applause] [Music] [Music] and so it was that a new alliance was formed out of desperation sworn enemies joined forces to combat a greater threat [Music] raiden began to realize that even their combined might was not enough to defeat the dragon king there was only one chance left raiden's sacrifice was in vain for the blast had little effect on the dragon king now onaga has what he needs to shape the realms as he sees fit i was the fool who brought him this power only i can destroy this threat born of deception [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i will win the mortal kombat tournament and free earth round from your tyranny is that so then it seems i will need a stronger opponent to defeat the great clown goro fight we're late [Music] [Applause] [Music] the master is always faster hi you must be shujinko the one master bo raicho mentioned i've seen you around before you and your friends are always pretending to be famous warriors in that park over there my name is apop master

realm academy of martial arts most of us call it fight school this is where students learn the more advanced techniques some of the best warriors in earth realm have studied here i am training in tai chi these days but i hope to learn many more fighting skills someday i want to be the greatest warrior in earth round i will show the real shang tsung who is the best and kick him all the way back to out world anyway i have to go to class now but i will see you later i hope you decide to join our school bye [Music] i am sorry shujinko but i cannot let you pass these gates why not the walls of this town are here for a reason to protect the citizens from foreign dangers you are too young and inexperienced to venture outside return when you can prove to me that you have learned enough and i may let you pass yes master bull rachel i will continue my training [Music] the elder gods yes they are the power that made this world possible as well as many others i have come to you on their behalf because they needed your help what kind of help do gods need the to save the elderly should chico will you accept this quest to say all that exists you will be a true hero what if i refuse then i will find another one of your friends perhaps the one who pretends to be shang tsung no not him i will be your champion what must i do you must traverse the realms in certain items of great importance but masterable raichu will not let me outside the walls of the town i will bestow upon you a great power the ability to absorb the fighting skills from any fighter you encounter this will give you the edge you need on your quest gona return to magical righteous and show him you are an experienced fighter i will damashi thank you i will not let the elder gods down back so soon i thought you had returned to the school i am ready to prove that my combat skills are good enough oh very well shinjinko show me [Music] flawless victory [Music] thank you master boricho you show great potential i i would very much like to train you myself perhaps i can mold you into the next great defender of earth realm train me personally i would be honored but first i have tasks to complete outside the gate not a problem i train all my advanced students at my home down the road meet me there later and we will resume your training i will see you there goodbye master bull raicho goodbye shijinko [Music] i see you have passed your test yes damashi the power you gave me to copy other warriors worked well i really felt as if i could fight like master bull rachel he was so impressed that he offered to train me personally but first you should begin your quest you must find six items of great importance think of them as tools of the gods there is an impending doom that threatens the survival of all the realms with these tools the elder gods will vanquish this menace where do i find these kami dogu they have been scattered throughout reality each one lies hidden in a different realm the elder gods are unable to retrieve these items themselves and therefore must elect a champion born within the realms to collect them they have constructed portals and the nexus to aid their champion in his quest once you have found the first countdown i will show you what to do until then good luck with your search thank you damashi [Music] it is good to see you again as promised i will now impart to you my most powerful techniques i am honored master bull rachel i train my most promising students here at my home away from prying eyes to assure that my secrets are known only to those i trust now let us begin your training [Music] [Music] congratulations shujinko you have completed your training it has always amazed me how quickly you learn you have excelled far beyond my other students these past five years it is as if you have been granted a gift by the elder gods themselves i'm grateful for your kind words master and i am grateful for all that you have taught me you have learned much as my pupil but my training can only take you so far experience is the ultimate teacher to further your training you must venture into the world through your journeys in this realm and others you will attain enlightenment may i suggest for your first adventure that you help me find my warriors medallion i seem to have lost it very well master i will help search for your medallion may i ask where you saw it last i seem to recall having it a few nights ago at the docks perhaps you can begin your search there i will stay here and look around the house farewell shuchinko and good luck farewell master boricho this must be the dock that master varicho mentioned i should ask if anyone here knows what happened to the medallion excuse me but have you seen master boricho's warriors medallion he says he last remembers having it somewhere around here oh yes he left it here a few nights ago and we were drinking outworld wine on the duck i put it in my water house for safe keeping but some brigands attacked me and stole the tackle box in which i kept my key attacking an unarmed fisherman what cowards is there anything i can do to help if you could get my key back from the brigands i could get you the medallion they usually do not stray far from the beach i will return with your key fisherman and these brigands will know the fist of shujinko i thank you young man uh who is shiojinko would you happen to have seen the old fisherman's tackle box that old fossil perhaps he should keep a tighter hold on his possessions wait do you admit to taking it what business is it of yours the only way he will get his tackle box back is if he can take it back he is much too old and weak to do that keep to your own affairs and you will live a lot longer i have returned with your key the brigands will not likely harass you further splendid young man come inside and you will find the medallion thank you young man when you see bo raicho tell him i will drink him under the table and next we meet greetings it had been five years since you began your quest for the kamidom have you made any progress i am afraid not damashi but i have learned master boricho's fighting styles and i have recovered his lost warriors medallion i was on my way to return it to him i see that is quite an impressive artifact i suggest you keep the medallion for yourself do not return it to horizon just yet such an item will give you credibility among master warriors i will do as you ask good very good i must leave you now but you will see me again good luck on your journey stop infidel only great warriors are allowed to enter the linguay temple i am a great warrior i have been personally trained by master baracho and have been awarded the warriors medallion to prove glorious medallion you are truly worthy of the linguist we could use a warrior with your ability step inside and you will be trained to fight as a linguist your teacher will be none other than sub-zero himself you have finished your training you are now a linguist warrior for your first assignment the grand master has commanded that you join our forces to the west they have reported finding an unknown artifact that may greatly benefit our clan we must secure it before our rivals do your password is ice dragon go now do not return until you have succeeded in securing the artifact as you command [Music] i wonder where i am supposed to meet these lin kuei it must be somewhere right around here [Music] halt what is the password ice dragon excellent you must be the courier we had sent for and a new recruit if i am not mistaken you are just in time there are red dragon not far from here and they know we have this item take it to the lin kuei temple we will distract the red dragon to aid your departure i will leave at once [Music] [Music] i have joined the lin kuei i have learned sub-zeros for that object you carry yes it is when it opens walk through to continue your quest but the lin quay must i remind you that your loyalties are to the elder gods not to them continue with your appointed quest yes damashi i understand [Music] enter the portal [Music] what what is this place this is the nexus constructed by the elder gods who aid their children on his quest to save the rounds to aid me these points lead to each of the rounds that conceals the coming each time you recover a copy dogu you must return it to the nexus and place it on that dollar doing so will unlock the portal to the next round for you to search which portal will open first place it would seem that the elder gods wish for their champion to search the nether round next i must warn you it is a dark and evil race i will be on my guard [Music] is not what you expected this place it feels dark as dark as every heart that inhabits it normally your presence here would not be possible [Music] so how is it that i am here perhaps your time has left a small stain on your soul corruption but you must not dwell on that what is important is your quest most likely door will not be found within the walls of this city you must venture deep into these wretched planes of hell if you are to recover it this is not going to be pleasant but i will complete my task i am shujinko pardon my intrusion but you do not look like a demon of the nether realm i am ashra i was once like the others before i found the means to purge myself of the evil taint that permeates all who reside here by slaying demons with an enchanted sword i will gradually transform into a being whom this realm cannot contain eventually i will be free and how is it you exist in this place you do not seem to belong here yourself i am from earth realm i see be warned shijinko the nether realm is quite hostile to outsiders if you are to survive against its denizens you will need special skills i offer to train you in the art of combat that will be most effective here i accept your most gracious offer ashrae then let your training begin i have now shown you the techniques for fighting the demons of this place shujinko may this knowledge serve you well thank you ashra i believe i am ready to brave the depths of the nether realm perhaps a test is in order meet me at the temple outside of town i will find you a suitable opponent we will see if you have indeed learned all i have taught you i look forward to this chance to test myself so this is the demon known as ashley you'll notice he extends as far as out world many of shao khan's never known allies have fallen to your blade russia's to deal with you yes i am aware of the demon known as irmak i welcome his arrival until then you will serve as combat practice [Music] that tarkatan was not a pure demon but a mutated hybrid of demon and mortal races there was not much to gain from his death were i to defeat the powerful demon ermack however i would surely ascend from this place much sooner if while on your quest you should encounter him lead him to me it is here that i am most powerful if i see him i will do as you matter of ask are you i am no beast i am shujinko from earth realm and i am in search of a powerful demon i have an acquaintance who wants to deal with him as commanded by the emperor shao khan we search for a powerful demon as well but we are bound together by sorcery and the lower planes of this realm drain magical power our bond our strength is fading we fear that we will not have the strength to destroy our enemy why do you say we and our we will explain later if you help us there is not much time i will most certainly help you what must i do help us find a soul stone a large red monolith covered with ancient runes we can replenish the magic power that binds our souls together and continue our trek do this for us and we will reveal to you our knowledge of combat as payment i will search for the soul stone this appears to be the soul stone that warrior mentioned i must inform him of its location [Music] greetings i have found the soul stone it is to the east not far from here we must go there immediately come we will reward you once we have regained our strength yes this is it a soul stone we can feel our strength returning what exactly is a soul stone many ages ago the first sorcerers toiled for the elder gods linking the realms with portals the lower plains of the nether realm are quite hazardous to beings of magic its inhospitable places they erected soul stones which restored their energies as they worked why did the sorcerers build the portals for the elder gods they were built from some unforeseen cataclysm we do not concern ourselves with such myths however now we will honor our promise and impart to you our combat knowledge prepare yourself as the power of burma is revealed irmak the demon you seek does it have a name her name is ashrae she has slain many of shao khan's nether realm allies for this he has commanded us to destroy she is looking for you as well she believes you are a demon and will combat you to purify her soul her misconceptions are of no importance you must reveal to us her location she is near a temple to the northwest she is waiting for you then we must leave at once at last i will defeat the demon irmak your death will bring me closer to purification and ultimately my release from this realm we are no demon surely you can sense that we are not of your kind nonetheless there must be some evil residing within you or you could not have entered the nether realm enough you have killed many of shadowcon's allies in your quest to purify your soul you will pay for your insolence is this the sum of your might ashra it will take much more to defeat us and more you shall receive [Music] it has been many years since last we met why have i not seen you in so long a time i take precautions to avoid this place it drains me if my island were to stay here for too long or descend too far into the lower plains i could be trapped here forever your avatar i do not understand i have without a physical body and am only able to appear to you by extending my spirit into the realms it is my hope that i will one day return to the physical world until then i must guide you as a simple apparition and how goes your search i have found the nether realm kamidogu so it on the altar stop where you are intruder i am the elder god's chosen warrior i have been set to protect the nexus from trespassers your presence has defiled this sacred place leave now or face my wrath you are mistaken i am the elder gods champion stand down [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am unharmed who was that warrior in the nexus i am not entirely sure i could sense that he was quite powerful but i did not recognize him he referred to himself as the elder god's chosen warrior does he think he is their champion if he thinks that he is mistaken as i have said before you are their champion you must continue your search in this round the realm of chaos chaos the nature of this realm is one of a constant turmoil the beings here oppose order and structure chaos is their religion you there stop where you are you must fight if you are to enter the realm of chaos may i challenge the infiltrator i have been endowed with powers from the elder gods themselves i may be able to drive him off for you i admire your fighting spirit you are most welcome to confront him are you the nether realm wraith who haunts this holy site another fool has come to challenge me so be it as i told the others i have taken this patch of dead terrain for the brotherhood of shadow we shall see spawn of hell black wings you have two choices stranger state your intentions or hear the shattering of your spine i wander in search of holy relics madman do not block my path i am havoc a cleric of chaos i would never think of confining a spirit such as yours thank you havoc i am shujinko i am a newcomer to the realm of chaos there are many newcomers as of late satan guards men for instance they seek to restrict the flow of our water something we hold is sacred water was not meant to be controlled shapeless fluidic nature is a blessing i make you an offer shuchinko take these four chaos pendants defeat each of the four satan invaders and place a pendant around their necks the pendants will shatter the bondage of order and reveal to them the perfection of chaos only then will they cease the enslavement of our water do this for me and i will teach you the ways of chaos as well who are these satan guardsmen they are soldiers of an oppressive realm that have come to impose their order they seek to control and alter our water supply for their own ends their presence here is offensive i will do as you request only if it suits you at the time i would not have it any other way may chaos break the rules that bind my friend you do not appear to be a said did havoc send you yes he has asked that i defeat these intruders and place these pendants around their necks i have been trying to sabotage this facility but thus far the invaders have foiled my plans if you could reduce their numbers i would have an easier time crippling their pumps i will try where are they now there was an invader in each of the four corners of the facility i will meet you here when i am finished dealing with them these premises are off limits [Music] [Applause] you have done it you have converted the satan guardsmen to the ways of chaos havoc will be most pleased he waits for you in the town to the south you have converted the satan guardsmen to the ways of chaos they shut down their facilities and came here for guidance i proposed to them a mission in their home of satan the realm of order they have already embarked on the quest i thank you for your assistance you said you would show me the way of chaos if i were to free their minds as if i would honor a deal you should know better than to bind a man of chaos to his word i will free myself of this oppression fight well done well done you tried to kill me nonsense how could i teach you the way of chaos if there was an agreement a structure to the lesson oh i think i understand i was learning from the unpredictable nature of experience not from a structured tutorial i did not realize you had no intentions of harming me when you attacked and therefore i learned to adapt to what i perceive to be a real threat you are correct except i would have killed you if you had given me the chance i was quite serious because you have survived my assault however i give you this key to an ancient labyrinth may it unleash chaos upon your journey [Music] [Music] so [Music] yes i found it in a labyrinth not far from here but i feel strange i feel like i have changed indeed you have many years have passed since you first entered this realm i suspect the lowry you encountered contained some time altering agent time has passed but you have not perceived it many years by the gods i do feel older it must have been that strange liquid i stepped through that is a distinct possibility it matters not you should return to the nexus and place it on the altar you have done well the elder gods will be pleased [Music] oh this is out world i have heard many stories about this realm this is the domain of the emperor shao khan ever indeed he is a thief a deceiver he is not the rightful lord of this realm there was a time when he was much like raising his to your earthrealm an advisor but he abandoned his position and stole um who ruled out world before khan of a powerful military the commander king in that age our world was unified under shah khan's rule however our world has become a dangerous and chaotic place be wary as you continue i will keep my eyes open damashi [Music] look at what we have here another straggler for molina to sink her teeth into i do not wish for trouble but i will defend myself if necessary i must warn you that i am quite skilled in the art of combat is that so we will see how long you can endure my attacks i will sharpen my teeth with your bones impressive you survived my assault you are a great warrior there is much we can gain from one as skilled as you i thank you for your kind words melina perhaps you would be interested in assisting our cause recently the walled city of leitchen has defied the rule of the emperor xiao khan he has sent us his tarkattan forces to take the head of the overlord there we would like to complete our objective without incident but we will use force if necessary would you act as our voice and convince this fool of an overlord to surrender his life to shao khan so that his subjects will be spared what if the overlord refuses to surrender everyone in the city will be slain the city walls are strong but they will not hinder our assault for long this is a most uncomfortable position for me but if it means the citizens will be spared i will see what i can do you have our word bring us the head of the overlord and we will spare them all are you the ruler of this city yes i am overlord safiro state your business shao khan has sent his tarkattan horde to attack my city that is precisely why i am here i have come to you with a message from the tarkatan forces outside your walls you have my attention go on shao khan has offered your people amnesty under one condition you must surrender your head my head unacceptable i will never surrender myself to shao khan not even to save my people the tarkata grow in number outside the walls of your city it is only a matter of time before they overwhelm your military and destroy you all for the sake of your people i strongly there may be another solution if word of our struggle were to reach sado the realm of order their elite guardsmen may give us aid if i can find that realm i will tell them of your plight excellent you will need something of value to offer his payment my city has been over taxed by shao khan and therefore i have nothing suitable here but there are rumors of a priceless object hidden somewhere in the living forest if you can locate it give it as payment to the satan for their assistance please do not delay not to fear i will bring help [Music] who are you what are you doing in the living forest i have been sent here to search for a valuable item said to be hidden in this area you are too late i have already found it my queen sent me to secure it from the tyrant shao khan it seems i have located it just in time die outworld mutant [Music] victory [Applause] i did not realize it was the kamidoku the overlord of lei chen had asked me to offer it to the satan guardsmen as payment for their assistance in defending against the tarkatan hordes it belongs to the elder gods and it must be returned to them you will place it on the altar with the others but i have given my word that i would bring back help from the realm of order how will i broker a deal with them if i cannot offer the kamudogu the point the realm of is without placing this coming down on the altar if indeed you wish to hate thee overlord i suggest you offer the command of this city to the same militia their principle philosophy is one of horror and control they will have little interest in defending a city unless they occupy furthermore they will not resist the chance to thwart shao khan but the overlord did not give me the authority to what he wants is of no concern to us the community is not his to use an authority we're over ideal to say that you feel so compelled but do not lose sight of your primary objective return world to its rightful place in the nexus and continue with your quest i will do as you ask damashi [Music] [Music] [Music] but i am new to this place how am i to abide by their laws if i do not know them this civilization has been built upon the concept of structure and organization deviation from this ideal is not tolerant i cannot stress enough that you must avoid any entanglements in their legal system i believe the likelihood of that happening is small but i will heed your warning please excuse my interruption but i am shujinko champion of the elder gods i bring a message from the king of lei chen requesting the aid of your guardsmen in outworld i am quite busy champion get to your point lei chen is under siege and in need of reinforcements to help defend it overlord zafiro has offered to give control of his city to your realm if your guardsmen come to outworld and defeat shao khan's invading horde shao khan long have we battled against his minions it would benefit all the realms to further suppress his advance i am commander hotaru i would pledge my aid to the outworld city but i still have work to do here help me end this riot by defeating the leader of the resistance and i will defend this overlord i would think a champion of the gods could end this uprising with ease i will assist you however i can excellent we will first need to train you to be a satan guardsman for you may not partake in an assault unless you are a deputized member of the guard that is our law then let us begin my training follow me [Music] congratulations you are now an honorary member of the satan guardsmen go now and defeat the leader of the resistance his name is darius when you have completed this task meet me here as you command are you the warrior known as darius and what if i am if you are the leader of the resistance i have been ordered to defeat you in combat and bring this riot under control you have found your man i am darius i look forward to resisting the arrest i have defeated darius commander hotaru well done it seems the rioters have been demoralized your service is no longer required as promised i will now depart for the city of late chen in outworld thank you hotaru i will meet you there [Music] you have returned it is good to see you again hotaru it seems the city is no longer under siege i drove off the invaders they will most likely regroup and resume their assault but i will stay to protect the city as long as is needed i have taken control of this city in the name of order as we agreed however kings of firo seemed not to recall that arrangement men often do not recall the details of bargains they make out of desperation it makes no difference the agreement is binding as punishment for his forgetfulness i have stripped him of his position i now rule this town in the name of sado uh congratulations otaru now if you will excuse me i must see to its governing if i am to keep this town under control [Music] come with us human do not resist you are outnumbered this is the overlord's emissary the one who brought the satan warrior tower to defend the walled city of late shen i have lost many tarkartan warriors to your treachery human you were to convince the overlord to surrender not bring him reinforcements he would not surrender i did not wish to see his people suffer for his decision whatever quarrel you may have had with overlord zafiro you had no right to punish them as well shao khan's order is all the right i need overlords of phiro defied him when shao khan discovers that our assault has failed our punishment will be severe i should allow my [ __ ] to rebuke to pieces yes allow your soldiers to do what you are too frightened to do yourself what i am baraka leader of the tarkata i feel no one least of all a human then face me in combat if you are so sure of your strength kill me yourself but if i emerge victorious you must complete one task for me agreed my warriors will enjoy eating your flesh when i am done with you you have defeated me human i would not have thought it possible tell me what i must do and tell me quickly before i change my mind you are a powerful warrior baraka i ask that you teach me your fighting techniques a great warrior i am human i will show you why i am the most feared darkharton in the shao khan's army enough i have shown you enough of my combat skills i must keep some techniques to myself i thank you for what you have shown me i will command my troops to allow you safe passage from our encampment go back to your portal and never return to this realm yes i will leave this realm at once there is nothing more that i need here i was about to continue my eternal quest but i cannot remember what it is a spell has taken my memory please find me a potion to restore it holy men ambushed me and forced me to guard a dragon egg but the dragon has been reborn and i am now free please find a potion to restore my memory [Music] what do you mean damashi you have sacrificed much in your service to the elder gods these long years therefore they are granting you that which you have desired since your childhood a chance to compete in the mortal kombat tournament and earthrealm and defeat the sorcerers i do not know what to say how did they know of my dreams of defeating shang tsung long ago i watched you from afar that you played with your childhood friends it was quite clear that you worshiped the warrior but unlike your hero you will be more than a match for shaykh you have absorbed the fighting styles of many great warriors now is your chance to fulfill your dream thank you damashi i will return to earth relevant once [Music] please excuse my curiosity but why do you cover your eyes are you blind yes due to the treachery of the sorcerer shang tsung you have met shang's song he preyed upon my desire to prove my superiority in combat he promised to show me the location of a powerful sword that would complement my skills the sword was entombed among the souls of my warrior ancestors shang tsung consumed their souls to increase his power the experience left me blinded is the sword from your tail the one you now carry yes the sword guides me over the years it has shown me the way to use my other senses in combat most impressive you are truly a warrior of distinction now i have but one goal to slay the sorcerer who blinded me doing so will free the consumed souls of my ancestors if you provide me with his location i will teach you to fight without your eyes i am to enter his mortal combat tournament when i find him i will return to you with any information i uncover my search for shang tsung will continue here in the north i suggest you look in the south west this is sacred ground stranger i am nightwolf i must ask you to leave this place before your evil taint defiles the sanctity of these grounds i do not understand i am shujinko i assure you that i mean no disrespect to your people i sense corruption in your soul shujinko a spiritual contamination that i have never before perceived i feel no touch of evil but my travels have taken me to many worlds perhaps it is a result of my journeys in the nether realm it is possible if you will allow me i may be able to purge this contagion from your being although it will take many years to accomplish many years it will delay my quest but i suppose i should take advantage of your offer [Music] you have accomplished much since beginning your spiritual cleansing shujanko though the taint of evil continues its hold on you my training has given you the ability to control it i am grateful for what you have done for me nightwolf i wish you luck on your journeys you are always welcome in the lands of my forefathers [Music] greeting stranger i search for experienced fighters to take part in a competition do you know of any i am quite adept at many fighting styles who are you what is this contest you speak of shang tsung long have i heard tales of your foul deeds i am shujinko since i was a boy i have dreamed of winning the mortal kombat tournament and ridding earth realm of your tyranny is that so then it seems i will have to test the great shujinko you are most welcome to compete but only if you can prove that you are worthy of such an honor fight wins [Music] [Applause] most impressive shujinko you are indeed worthy to compete in the mortal combat tournament i will enjoy consuming your soul when you lose i do not think so it has been my greatest desire to win earthrealm's freedom from you and your master shao khan of course i am not the only one who seeks your defeat i request that an acquaintance of mine be allowed to compete as well he too longs to challenge you would this acquaintance of yours be the blind swordsman kenji he has been searching for me for quite some time has he not you know there is little in this realm that escapes my attention though i must admit i was surprised to learn that he had survived our previous encounter return to him and inform him that he is welcome to face me on my island in the lost sea the tournament is fast approaching however he must hurry if he wishes to fulfill his quest for revenge [Music] it has been many years since last we met although i have sensed shang tsung's presence on many occasions i have not been able to locate him i have found him kenshi he has invited us both to his island to face him in mortal combat he has been watching you he knew that you were searching for him i had suspected as much this explains why i have never been able to find him he was always one step ahead of me i thank you for bringing me this news i will now teach you to do battle without the use of your eyes now that i have fulfilled my promise i must leave for shang tsung's island i only hope he has not been defeated before i arrive indeed you have a long-standing vendetta with shang tsung but i have dreamed of entering the mortal kombat tournament since i was young you will have to wait your turn my friend if he is still alive when i am finished with him you may take your revenge we will see shujinko i will meet you on the island i return to you because i sense that some change has taken place you are different in some way i have undergone a spiritual cleansing the warrior night wolf had detected an evil stain upon my soul he was unable to remove it completely but he has given me the ability to suppress it this is an unfortunate turn of events unfortunate an evil stain has been cleansed from my soul my sense of awareness is as heightened as it was when master bo raicho trained me the detain you refer to allows you to enter realms otherwise inaccessible to other beings you will need to regain it in order to continue your quest i suggest that you return to the netherlands it will restore the impurities needed to enter the board of cursive rounds once your request is finished you are free i cannot believe that you would ask such a thing of me surely the contamination i am already forced to carry is enough to access i never promised your quest would be pleasant you must fulfill your obligation to the elder gods return to them have you forgotten the mortal combat tournament i was on my way to shangsung's island to compete i understand your disappointment but your dream of defeating shin's son will have to wait for now you must fulfill your destiny i i will do as you ask be gone this portal is not for use by mortals who are you i am the thunder god raiden this ancient portal has been activated i must secure it to prevent intrusion from other realms lord raiden i am shujinko i am the champion of the elder gods it was i who opened the portal champion you say i think not a champion of the elder gods would possess the might of ten warriors and could fight with his eyes closed it is highly unlikely that you possess such abilities [Music] [Applause] you seem to possess much strength and skill shujinko forgive me for doubting you but if the elder gods have indeed unleashed their champion they must be concerned that the end of the realms is near your presence might be connected with the mortal combat tournament here in earth realm have you come to aid us i did come to fight for earth realm in the tournament but i have recently been ordered to the nether realm i am sure the elder gods have their reasons for redirecting you at so crucial a time it may be that the shaolin have already chosen their representative in any event i will keep a close watch over the tournament's proceedings shangsung is a treacherous sorcerer if he wins this time earthrealm will belong to shao khan if you need my aid when i am finished with my task in the nether search for me i will gladly assist you thank you shujinko good luck oh unless you have knowledge of the sorcerer quan chi's whereabouts do not waste my time stranger i have no knowledge of this quan chi but i may be able to help you find him i am shuchinko i have explored this realm before and have become quite familiar with it i have returned to the nether realm once again to absorb its impurities i will likely be wandering these wastes for some time to come if i discover this quan chi i will relay to you what information i can for a price it would seem that you have already regained some of the netherrealm's dark taint what price do you ask you are obviously quite powerful in this realm if i were to learn your combat skills perhaps i would absorb enough negative energy to lessen my time here teaching you the dark rage that has consumed me since my death will only serve to delay my vengeance upon quan qi i refuse your offer delay you it will but you will also gain an ally to aid your search you will likely find quan chi sooner if i search with you your argument has merit very well i will teach you my combat skills i warn you however the rage of scorpion burns deeply i did not realize that such all-consuming hatred was possible quan chi killed my family and clan and then deceived me into believing sub-zero was their murderer i have been corrupted by quan chi's wickedness now it is his turn to suffer it is a heavy burden you carry and one that will be lifted once i have destroyed the evil sorcerer go now and search for quan chi i will remain in the nether realm until he has found scorpion who are you what do you want i am shujinko i am searching for the sorcerer quan qi you have found him i do not recognize you as a brother of shadow who has sent you i sent him scorpion you thought you could elude me here in the lower reaches of the nether realm my strength increases while yours fades i will make you suffer for killing my family and clan i will torment you forever sorcerer back stay back i command you did you hear that it sounds like battle come we will feast upon the loser i encountered a ninja specter named scorpion from whom i absorbed much rage [Music] i do not wish to remain another moment longer [Music] mortal kombat has always been and always will be for millennia the forces of good and evil have been locked in eternal battle over the control of earthrealm some seek to use the tournament to destroy all that is good others seek vengeance power or eternal life time after time each individual threat has been vanquished an earth realm has enjoyed relative peace for many years but there is concern that earth is once again in peril and this time the thread of evil has two faces it is now known that the sorcerer quan chi has escaped from the nether realm since his escape quan chi has unlocked the secret of the ancient bloomstone discovered the ancient undefeatable army of the long forgotten dragon king and most disturbing of all formed an alliance with one of our deadliest enemies shangsong with their combined strength they plotted to overpower the only two beings who could prevent their total domination of the two realms the first was the emperor of our world xiao khan in a false show of allegiance they sprung their attack they then traveled to earth realm by way of a mystical portal known only as sorcerers and deities there they confronted earth's mightiest warrior and champion of mortal combat liu kang it has been shang tsung's desire to consume the soul of earth realm's greatest warriors with quan chi's assistance he achieved this goal lucan is dead [Music] [Music] they have since returned to outworld and are using the souls of conquered warriors to resurrect the dragon king's undefeatable army should they succeed they will have the means to conquer outworld and eventually the first round they will be unstoppable i can no longer stand idly by and watch this evil consume the world i have relinquished my status as elder god to return to earth and lead you all to battle against our old adversaries we must act now we must stop this deadly alliance [Music] greetings champion i have need of your assistance raiden whatever i can do to help you do not hesitate to ask my time in the nether realm is concluded [Music] has allied with another sorcerer quan shi who has escaped from the nether realm escaped i had just seen him there quan she possesses an item created by the elder gods an amulet that acts like a key he understands only a fraction of its potential but enough to use it to escape from hell is it a kamidogu it is not a kamidogu but it is connected to them by its function i am surprised that you would not know of it nevertheless i am preparing an assault on the two sorcerers in outworld though they have already killed earthrealm's greatest hero lou kang i am gathering together the few warriors i feel i can trust to attack this deadly alliance at their stronghold can i count on you to help i will go to outworld to assist you any way i can excellent it would be good to have a champion of the elder gods on our side that's fine enough stop where you are is there a problem sir name's kano by order of the sorceress quan chi and shang sung all denizens of that where will submit to the rule of the deadly alliance i am not a denizen of outworld i have traveled here from earth realm makes no difference my men will take it to the town of sundow quan chi and shang tsung have a job for you mate and if i refuse do you really think you can combat us all no i suppose not then shut up and follow me what's your name anyway i am called shujinko well shujinko welcome to hell along with all the other peons of this town you'll be constructing a palace for shang song one that is large enough to house his army don't even think about trying to escape i would hate to have to kill a villager because of your defiance do you get me i i understand good now make yourself useful get to work [Music] you are not from this town who are you why have you been enslaved here i am shujinko i am from earth realm on a quest for the elder gods i have been instructed to return to outworld to confront a growing threat here i seem to have found it i am lee mae my village was the first conquest of the deadly alliance they have enslaved my people for this i will kill them in due time what is your plan of attack the deadly alliance have offered to free my village if i win their combat tournament i have accepted their challenge but i intend to use the tournament as a way to get closer to them i will attack when they least expect it bold words young one but perhaps a bit foolish what makes you think you can defeat them both i will concede that i am not ready to confront them yet for i desperately need additional training perhaps i may be of some help over the years i have absorbed much combat skill then you must teach me shujinko help me to save my people from oppression i will teach you what i can we may but i do not approve of your intention to combat the two sorcerers alone i believe that course of action will end in misfortune you for your training master shuchinko please accept this token of my appreciation i thank you for the gift lime perhaps your confrontation with the sorcerers is not necessary i know of someone who might help to free your village his name is hotaru he once saved the walled city of lei chen from the tarkatan hordes i will journey there and ask for his assistance if you think he can drive out the deadly alliance then by all means find this hotaru and tell him of our plight i will do my best to convince him to help the guards are watching i must not draw their attention if i am to escape your village goodbye limey hotaru it is good to see you have violated my ordinance you were to go indoors when the toll sounded ordinance i just recently arrived i had no knowledge of any ordinance ignorance is not an excuse i am placing you under arrest for disregarding the laws of this city your trial will take place in the realm of order [Music] [Music] so what is this place why have i been taken from my cell you are about to enter the judicial court of the realm of order you have been brought here to defend yourself against the charges brought against you by commander hotaru after all these long years justice will at last prevail surely i will not remain imprisoned for a law as frivolous as a curfew i would not be as confident if i were you i have no desire to converse with a criminal am i not innocent until a court arrives at a verdict we shall see what [Music] these were the guards i was sent to dispose of surely you could have slain them yourself why have you killed them who are you i am dairu an associate of yours was concerned that certain obligations you have to him are not being met i was contracted to remove any obstacles you might be facing tamashii i cannot believe that he would instruct you to kill these men in order to free me not instructed paid mercenaries do not work for free this tamashii offered me generous compensation to free you do not be so sure of your chances with the judge i was once a soldier among their ranks until i was unjustly imprisoned you would have been incarcerated for decades for the seemingly minor charge i assure you i cannot say that i approve of your actions but i suppose a certain amount of gratitude is in order tyrone there is one other matter i am to give you this key to the courtroom door i took it from one of the guards i will leave you now but if you ever have need of my services search for me in the realm of order just remember to bring plenty of coins [Music] shu jingo i am disappointed with you otaru i thought i had trained you to appreciate order to obey the law now i find that you have killed two officers and have broken into a courtroom i did not kill those men an assassin named now you are consorting with known felons to free yourself had you simply waited for your trial you would have no doubt been found innocent in fact i had come here to testify in your defense now it seems that you will be facing a sentence of death if it has come to that i have no other choice but to resist arrest [Music] with the help of your assassin yes i do not understand how you could condone such an action are these the methods of the elder gods i am not an elder god i am merely your guide in any event do not presume to judge my methods you yourself have done many dishonorable things during your life long journey to answer your question however the elder gods would not have objected to the methods applied i may have done questionable things during my service to the elder gods but i have also grown much since my quest began i cannot believe the elder gods would not take exception to such brutal tactics the elder gods do not directly interfere with the realms nor do they judge the events that occur therein their duty is merely to assure that the realms exist and my quest plays some part in their duty i will not explain further all will be revealed in time take the commie dome to the nexus and continue your search yes damashi i will do as you ask but i cannot help but feel disenchanted with the quest [Music] [Music] oh it lies hidden in this realm the realm of identity but beware [Music] [Music] you have never fully revealed to me the true significance of the kamidogu after all these years of searching i feel i am owed an explanation if it will serve to emphasize the importance of your quest i will tell you what i can the capitol made possible the creation of reality the other gods use them to split the consciousness of the one being into what we know as the realms i do not understand what is this one being before the creation of the realms there were only the elder gods and the one being the one being fed off the elder gods it consumed them a war raged in the timeless void until six elder gods forged the comidogum and used them to sleep i am humbled by the scope of what you have revealed to me still i am left to wonder why the elder gods have needed my by the other assistance to retrieve the community and deliver them and to say what you do not know is that the elder gods had detected a plot whereby an individual sought to exploit the camino and merged all the realms in an attempt to gain ultimate power that individual may be here in india he must not be allowed to find the kamidoku it would seem that the kamidogu are quite powerful dangerous weapons in the wrong hands i thank you for being forthright with me i have no doubt that you will succeed you have served the other gods you you emerged from the portal to the gods how can this be i am shujinko champion of the elder gods i am searching the realms for artifacts that will aid in the fight against evil my quest has led me here i am princess katana if you are the champion of the elder gods perhaps you can aid us in our struggle there was a time long ago when the emperor xiao khan merged edenia with outworld for millennia he ruled the combined realms until my earthrealm allies and i won adenia's independence now shao khan has again invaded this realm he has learned that a powerful device lies hidden somewhere within our borders and may have sent his forces here to find it shao khan he must be after the identity and kamidogo his situation is worse than i had suspected how may i be of help princess katana my mother queen sindel has been taken captive i cannot free her myself because i must return to outworld to lead our forces there in a direct assault against the emperor free the queen so that she may lead the resistance here in adenia where is the queen being held she is imprisoned somewhere near the palace guarded by the traitor tanya you must defeat tanya in order to release her i will win the freedom of your queen of this you can be sure thank you shujinko and good luck excuse me but i am looking for the one known as tanya would you happen to know her whereabouts i am tanya do you have business with the emperor shao khan not exactly i come to ask that you release queen sindel she has been unjustly held captive by shao kahn's forces you are a fool old man i have been instructed by shao khan himself to guard her with my life you will have to get past me if you wish to free her so be it [Music] wins you are a bit old to be in shao khan's military are you not i am shujinko champion of the elder gods i have come to a release you at the request of your daughter katana she is currently an outworld confronting shao khan's army kitana lives you are truly the bearer of good tidings shijinko come we must leave here now before anyone realizes that i have escaped follow me and i will reward you for your efforts i am queen sindel i am grateful that you risked your life to free me i owe you my thanks it is an honor your highness please allow me to repay your gallantry i wish to bestow upon you the combat skills of an edinian knight do you accept indeed queen sindel i accept you are now a fully knighted odynian soldier shujinko and as such i have a task for you what task would that be your highness shao khan seeks a powerful item one that has been kept hidden in adenia since before our recorded history it must never fall into the hands of the emperor of outworld take this kamidogu and return it to the elder gods they will know what to do with it i will take it to them immediately what will you do now your highness kitana and i will continue the fight to free adinya from the tyranny of shao khan his men will be searching for me here but he has no knowledge of you you have a chance to escape if you leave now yes your highness good luck to you i was on my way to the nexus to place it upon the altar because you have recovered all the commodore i will receive a physical body and will be free to dwell in the physical world my rebirth is to take place soon in our world that is wonderful news congratulations damashi heard david [Music] it will be good to finally bring this quest to an end after all these long years i have finally found the last of the kamidogo my quest is almost at an end what is ending is your meddling in the affairs of the elder gods mortal scorpion yes and i remember you as well we met in the nether realm i taught you my fighting skills now i will give you your final lesson fight i have defeated him now i am free to complete my quest i do not understand the kamidogu should have been transported to the elder gods why is it not happening because you have not completely finished the quest who what are you ah yes familiar words perhaps this will help you to understand damashi what has he done to you let him go jinko please save me does not exist the avatar you see before you is merely a projection of my consciousness i manipulated this astral puppet from beyond the boundaries of death and in turn manipulated you i deceived you into bringing me the means of obtaining ultimate mastery over reality so it seems that i have indeed known you all these years then by what name shall i call you now tell me who you really are demon [Music] you may have them they do nothing you have wasted your time nothing happened when i placed them all on the altar not all if you had found the last piece the altar would have transported them to the elder gods but the last piece is currently an outworld in the possession of a fool sorcerer i will deal with him later for now i will take these artifacts you have so dutifully collected for me i am afraid they will not make it into the hands of the elder gods after all and so shuchenko your quest is done prepare for death the dragon king has not emerged from the portal perhaps he has lost interest in pursuing me more likely he has gone to outworld and confront the sorcerer who possesses the last remaining object i have been a fool blinded by the lure of adventure i have endangered the realms and betrayed the elder gods the blame is mine alone what have i done the dragon king now possesses the six kamidogu and has taken the ancient amulet from quan chi and outworld although each item is powerful beyond mortal comprehension individually they contain only a fraction of the power needed to create the realms to become all-powerful onaga must discover a way to fuse them into a single ultimate kamidogu i have been upon inonaga's scheme to rule all if i am to redeem myself i must continue to learn all that i can and prepare for this final battle against the dragon king my journey is far from over there have been many powerful warriors throughout the millennia but ages of mortal combat have begun to tear the fabric of the realms the critical point has finally been reached it was foreseen that combatants would one day grow too powerful and too numerous if left unchecked their intensifying combat would weaken and shatter the realms and bring about the apocalypse what else you got the elder gods demanded a safeguard be put in place to avoid total destruction one that would make use of the combatants insatiable bloodlust like moths to flame they would be drawn to battle at the apex of destruction alliances will be broken and old hatreds will be revived ah at last it has come to this final battle armageddon has begun [Music] it is done taven and dagon have been hidden the dragons oran and caro will be at their sides i trust they will be safe in the caves i only hope shao khan shows no interest in earth realm it is unlikely his attention seems focused only on adenia the pyramid is completed you are certain the battle will take place here dahlia i am i have sent blaze to monitor the realms when the time has come he will signal the dragons and the quest will begin are we doing the right thing argus your visions determined this course of action the powerful warriors to come the corruption of a mortal combat tournament the chain of events you foretell will lead to a conflict that will destroy us all these combatants must be dealt with i am talking about taven and dagon must they be involved our sons are the only ones we can trust furthermore they will prove their worth before the elder gods they will bring honor to adenia and to you if they survive we have equipped them well and the monoliths will hone their skills this must be done dagon and haven will remain dormant when they are revived they will embark on a quest to save the realms from armageddon may the elder gods watch over them david it is good to see you have awakened do not worry your strength will soon return oren what happened you were encased in stone to protect you from harm until i received the signal to awaken you you are no longer in adenia david i don't understand why am i in earth realm your father has a very important task here for you your brother dagon will also be participating it is a competition between the two of you from what i understand what competition last i remember dagon and i were summoned to father's throne room and there you were both rendered unconscious i don't know the details of this quest i was charged only with hiding you in earth realm and you when the time came that time is now no this is all too strange where is my father i wish to speak with him i will send you to his temple find the main chamber and place your hand on the altar your father will speak to you there and present you with a weapon to use on your quest no doubt your brother has been awakened by carl and will be sent there shortly why will i need a weapon very well or lead the way [Music] who are you i'm cobra no one crosses this bridge no one we shall see cobra i just got the signal from cabal the ambush has begun if you're not a member of the black dragon clan i'm gonna have to finish father where am i this is a training area father is that you no taven i am merely a reflection of your father my purpose is to train you for your coming challenge would you tell me what this is all about you will find your answers within the temple this monolith was created to help you hone your fighting skills there are others like it scattered throughout the realms they can only be activated by you or your brother now then let us begin your training was i inside the monolith how is that possible maybe father will explain when i find him in the temple you fight well i don't know who you are but there is always room in the black dragon clan for another ruthless warrior i have no intention of joining you and your thugs you will regret your decision fight strange-looking warrior at least i won't have to deal with his clan any longer looks like i've finally arrived at my father's temple i didn't know he had one here in earth realm i'm sure he'll explain everything once i locate him in the main chamber [Music] what are these images supposed to represent [Music] that looks like mother having one of her visions and this must be father speaking with the elder gods these sleeping figures might be my brother and i how long was i unconscious what's this it appears as if my brother and i are attacking some demon i have no memory of that what does all this mean where is everyone it doesn't seem like anyone's worshipped here in ages [Music] the time has come for you and dagon to prove your worth to adenia i must choose my successor as protector of the realm i give you each a weapon of great power you will find them on the wall behind this altar your mother has also left you items of great importance you will find them in her temple to the north what are they what is their purpose you must find blaze a fire spot created by your mother use the items we have given you to defeat him the victor will not only succeed me as protector of adenium but he will receive a gift worthy of a god go now and may the elder gods watch over immediate evac grand master sector the prisoner is awake good now i can get the information i need uh what are you i will ask the questions i need to know what you learned from the altar in the temple what message did you receive answer me you are going to regret having toured what information did you acquire from the altar headmaster sector the ship is being attacked incoming fighters special [Music] of the earth realm forces surrender immediately or risk annihilation remain at your post initiate code k0n185 affirmative i must get up this warship before it's destroyed i have to find some way out of this ship and back to the portal you are not leaving until i get all the information i need even if i have to beat it out of you fight finally i found a way out of the warship i'll have to get back to the portal and return to the cave maybe oren has some idea who these strange warriors are i can't help but wonder if my brother dagon has encountered the same foes i have welcome back you were away quite a long time i was ambushed more than once [Music] no his followers apparently abandoned the temple long ago warriors and red occupy it now this is not right something is amiss did you learn more about the quest where is the weapon your father left you there was no weapon i'm assuming it was stolen long ago as for the quest apparently it's a race to combat a fire spawn named blaze whoever defeats him will succeed father as protector of adenia yes blaze he is the watchers who sounded the call to awaken you but how can defeating him in battleground in the title of protector your mother was mortal you are only a half god transforming you into a full god would require require what what else did you learn i must travel to the north mother has left me an item in her temple i hope it's still there i will send you there now [Music] [Music] ah foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] um i'm sonia blade of the earth realm special forces you've got some explaining to do what are the tekunin up to why do you assume i have information you have some connection with sector he placed a homing device on you that i've been tracking since you teleported away from the cocoon and worship first to the heart of the mountain then to this frozen wilderness i can follow you anywhere now answer me what is sector planning i appreciate your assistance with the beast but i am afraid i cannot help you i know nothing about sector you're hiding something comply or i'll be forced to bring you in for further questioning i'm the son of argus you have no authority over me i have full authority [Music] you must have been sent by the gods yes in a manner of speaking you must help us our rabbit has been captured by the tengu you must free him i am not here to rescue anyone i am looking for a temple do you know of one a herald of the gods who searches for a temple only the abbot would know of such a place he could reveal to you its location but if he is slain by the tengu you may never find it you must save him very well then where can i find this abbott he is being held in the tengu encampment that way to the north thank you i appreciate your help now excuse me i am grateful that the gods would send a hero to free me i did not come here merely to free you i need information i was told you knew the location of a temple you must be referring to the temple of delia return me to my fellow monks and i will reveal its location to you by the elder gods very well lead the way old man we are here at last our place of worship the holy obelisk once again i am humbled that the gods would deliver me from peril yes the gods are great now if you will please direct me to the temple indeed the temple of delhia the lady of flame built to honor the edenian sorceress who foresaw the great battle legends tell that please i'm in a hurry yeah the temple is down this path i thank you for your help i wish you good fortune ah i see the obelisk begins to glow with the power of my fellow monk's prayers i only pray the tengu did not defile it with their touch [Music] taven you have entered an obelisk of your father's creation i have empowered it to train you further in the art of combat you're not really my mother are you no i am not your mother i am merely a reflection of the woman who enchanted this stone my purpose is to aid you on your quest can you tell me more about this quest only that you will find a gift in the temple it lies behind a wall place your hand in the recess to unlock the door your training will now begin [Music] stop where you are your dark allies may have escaped for now but you have nowhere to hide kill him outstanding wait stop you are free to go oh i'm free to go after i've already defeated your entire clan how generous of you my sincerest apologies warrior when i was told that you had attacked my man near the obelisk i assumed you were with the other two outsiders we encountered but clearly you're human you must be linkuei i haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to and what is a lin quay the lin quay are a rival clan of powerful warriors you fight with such skill i mistook you for one of their ranks we tengu have an uneasy truce with the lin kuei and we avoid their territory they reside in an ancient temple near here and where would this temple be further up this path it is not far but you would be wise not to venture near it the lin kuei are secretive and as inhospitable to strangers as we are i will be ready thank you for the information you are free to go [Music] [Music] what so it is true delia's son has returned to claim the prize and saved the realms i figured you would eventually come to this place taven you seem to know much about me but i know nothing of you friend i am no friend of yours i am reign a prince of edenia once i have defeated you i will find and kill your brother as well then i will claim the prize well prince let us see what you can do [Music] the tengu leader was right my mother's temple is here but it's now occupied by a clan of ninjas known as the lin kuei locating the item she left me will not be easy i'll have to fight my way inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] foreign you're alive ah what happened you were encased in ice who are you i am frost where sub-zero uh sub-zero the medallion give me the medallion you seem to be a bit delirious [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah at last an empty room maybe i can breast think again intruder you may have bested my lin quay warriors but you will not get past me and you are i am sub-zero grand master of the len quay and you are trespassing fight [Music] your tattoo what about it it resembles the dragon image on the door behind you who are you and why are you here this must be it this must be what this temple was a shrine to my mother before your clan commandeered it i assure you it had been abandoned long before we arrived i realized that my name is tavin i merely came here to retrieve something a gift from my mother then tell me where is this gift most likely behind this vault door the door on the right was unlocked when we first arrived here years ago there was nothing inside the other door has remained sealed despite our best efforts to open it it seems my brother has already been here to retrieve his gift strange that would mean he's been awake for quite some time i assume you have a key you could say that you have your gift now tell me for what purpose would a sorceress leave her son such a powerful set of armor apparently i need it for my quest something important is supposed to happen once i complete it though i do not know what that something is yet at first i assumed the quest was nothing more than a game but i'm no longer certain what do you mean a warrior named rayne mentioned something about saving the realms and i've also been repeatedly attacked by assassins in red i don't recognize their crest though it seems vaguely familiar a dragon i believe do you have any idea who they are i may grand master more intruders have preached the temple the east entrance friends of yours they are dark warriors yet they resemble our own lin-guay time to choose sides friend or foe i'll help then defend the lin kuei temple smash these new intruders [Applause] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] okay you will not escape [Music] david [Music] what were those you will join me or you will die we shall see [Music] i should thank you you probably saved my life who is he he doesn't seem human he is noob cybot a warrior from the nether realm he is my brother your brother why did he try to kill you he was corrupted long ago but now i have the chance to save him the lin quay owe you much tavin in return for your aid i will help you find the men who have been hunting you they are called the red dragon a clan of mysterious warriors i can't help you get inside their base but i can reveal its location where charred mountain it's unfortunate that sub-zero's brother has chosen a path of darkness i wish i could help him remove the corruption that fills noobs cybot's soul but now that i know the location of the red dragon stronghold i must return to oren he will be able to transport me there maybe then i will find some answers as to why i am being pursued david you've acquired a suit of armor it's the item mother left me to help with the quest are you ready to begin your search for blaze not yet the warriors in red ambushed me again outside the temple i met someone there named subzero he gave me information that could lead me to them he said they're called the red dragon clan his lin kuei recently located their stronghold it's in charred mountain i would like to visit them before i search for the fire spawn they may be the ones who stole my father's sword will you send me there as you wish [Music] an intruder defend the stronghold [Music] i sense that there is more significance to your actions here than as a parent i suggest you return to adenium immediately i would like some information first the red dragon have attacked me twice i'd like to know the reason and i'm not leaving until i find it such ignorance i will stop you by force if necessary i respect you fujin you are a friend to my family but i will not leave then you leave me no choice fight [Music] i didn't want to do that fujin has been an ally for many ages but i need to confront the red dragon this must be the entrance to their stronghold i hope they haven't been alerted to my presence i'll soon find out david dagon you look older i am older much older than you big brother so you were awakened long ago why are you here this is my stronghold your stronghold and these warriors i formed the red dragon clan many ages ago there must be some misunderstanding your soldiers have been hunting me there is no misunderstanding for years my clan has infiltrated every corner of earth realm searching for you scouting parties were placed in locations where you were likely to appear at our parents temples for instance i see you found your armor i wear mine always why would you send your clan after me isn't it obvious i intend to kill you what the prize will be mine taven i will not risk losing it to you grand master please excuse the intrusion speak lovato blaze has been found excellent i must make preparations see that my brother never leaves this stronghold alive [Music] who are you know tonight i am tavin do you know what the red dragon are doing here seems they're trying to create real red dragons they've been able to create a hybrid of man and lizard using their own clan members as test subjects and you were next they were trying something new on me but they'll never finish wait i have more questions for you [Music] well done [Music] i have done as you commanded then give me what you have found i i couldn't risk detection i didn't carry the records with me they're all up here kill him [Music] oh baby dragon close the portal dragon i command you carl get away from him lizard i am reptile and i do not answer to you frank [Music] karo you're injured i have been enslaved here by dagon he uses me to teleport his clan anywhere in the realms i can't believe you could be capable of something like this he is not the man he once knew what happened i am partially to blame long ago i lost mental contact with the fire spawn blaze i mistakenly took it as the signal to awaken your brother but it was too soon reviving him early had unforeseen effects dagon was unbalanced he was outraged that he had been manipulated by your parents and demanded to know the true purpose of the quest did they tell him perhaps whatever he learned must have disturbed him greatly he killed them both killed them impossible father was a god mother was a powerful sorceress how he did it is of little importance they are gone and i am to blame do not condemn yourself nevertheless i wish to atone for my mistake moments ago i created this portal to the nether realm for your brother he is there now you must follow him leave now i cannot hold the portal open much longer i will return to help you there is no need i intend to stay here and destroy this atrocity god has created in my name when i am done the red dragon will be nothing more than broken bodies strewn throughout the hallows of this mountain go now and may the older gods watch i am torn by caro's request to leave him in the red dragon stronghold he and oren have long been friends to my family together they have protected edenia from many perils not the least of which was shao khan's unsuccessful invasion years ago but even in his weakened condition cara will not be easily defeated i imagine he is combating the red dragon clan already may the elder gods watch over him welcome to hello is that shinnok why is an elder god here in the nether realm it seems as though he needs help how the mighty have fallen this day is ours die shinnok steven where did you come from i am weakened son of argus you must protect me step away from lord shinnok now you will pay for your interference flawless victory your assistance could not have come at a better time you defended me against the sheet of holy may and for that i am forever grateful i don't understand why did you need my help lord shinnok you are an elder god i am an elder god no longer i have been cast down punished for involving myself in the affairs of mortals now i am cursed to preside over this wretched never realm what could you have done to anger the elder gods boldly asked as always david perhaps even a former elder god may be permitted to ask his question first why are you here i'm looking for my brother dagon yes i remember him you competed with one another often you won most of the games as i recall but what makes you think he's here i followed him he's been corrupted somehow i don't know what evil led him to this place but when i find him he'll have much to answer for i will help you find him taven but first i will need to regain my throne demons and strange warriors have overrun my sanctuary help me clear out the invaders and you will gain my favor but you must listen to my instructions closely what must i do lord the idea that shinnok an elder god resides within the realms is beyond belief that he requires my aid is even more baffling but i will assist him any way i can it seems that demons and other beings have cast him out of his own spire i will defeat them all floor by floor if need be [Music] demons have overrun my spire [Music] [Music] destroy the invaders looking for trouble i hope careful taven this one is most unpredictable you know him i am havoc a cleric of chaos chinook will not regain control of anything so long as i draw breath [Music] havoc is down but there will be more like him in the chambers above who are these invaders why did they attack you there is no time to discuss that now we must make our way to the next chamber before more arrive quickly enter the portal get away from lord shinnok [Music] eliminate them [Music] we have reached the top chamber at last my throne will restore my strength your throne shiva a shogun here the spire is ours [Music] so that i may reclaim [Applause] my thanks to you taven you have restored to me what little semblance of authority i have left i am honored to be of service to an elder god former elder god but i do appreciate your loyalty and respect you may rise your brother yes he has been to the nether realm but he is not here any longer i sense that he has gone back to earth realm what earth realm i will send you to him but you must leave now thank you lord shinnok he is strong quite strong and a skilled warrior i told you he was a problem he passed all my tests destroyed my aberrations with ease more quickly than you did perhaps i am aiding the wrong brother what you swore you would help me fool your brother has been effectively delayed his means of teleportation has been eliminated forgive me lord shinnok i didn't realize it's just that your aid is vital to my success our success there is more to this quest than you know all things have led to this moment the prize is not merely some gift as your mother and father would have had to believe it will determine the fate of many immortals a fact i will use to my advantage i don't understand i have informed other warriors of the prize to hasten their participation they will think as you did that god-like power will be bestowed upon the victor it is a deception they are marching to their doom you shall be the victor and the catalyst of my ascension what must i do lord chinook strange shinnok knew that dagon had been to the nether realm but he didn't mention it until i cleared his spire of invaders now he has sent me back to earthrealm none of this makes sense i wonder if oren knows anything about chinook's fall from grace he said i'll discover the location of this cave i i think i've seen him before i believe quan chi wants to prevent you from leaving earth realm i've kept the portal open but i'm growing weaker you must go through now or you will be trapped here i promise you oren i will find this quad chi and make him pay with his life go now and may the elder gods watch over you [Music] fortress i must be an outworld i suspect quan chi is already inside i must find a way to get in this looks like shao khan's dungeon no sign of quan chi here quan chi hasn't been down here in ages i am molina um not that care to dance [Music] [Music] well done stranger the key you found it will unlock my cell door please free me how do i know you won't attack me you have only my word i am not here to do battle with you my task is to eliminate shao khan alone this i must see i thank you stranger i am shuchinko i am taven you plan to defeat shao khan whole realms have tried to overthrow him not only will i defeat him but a host of his allies they are in his chamber now plotting some coming battle i allowed myself to be captured from this dungeon i can enter shao khan soul chamber once there i will be able to destroy shao khan and all his allies in one stroke i suggest you leave quickly taven for i cannot guarantee your safety my safety i just defeated this entire foolish old man i can't reach them maybe i could focus the orcs energy on the statue if i trap the statue in the center of the room [Music] excellent [Music] enjoying the view who are you what are you doing here at ease show khan i am looking for quan she have you seen him he is with the emperor i am goro i have been ordered to let no one pass under penalty of death my death or yours [Music] well done those were elite guards if you say so i assume you are here to kill the emperor if anyone deserves to die it's shao khan but i'm here for someone else quan shi ah yes he is in the next room with the others as much as i would like to see him die i have been charged to protect the emperor's allies i am rachel general to shao khan's army the emperor could use warriors such as yourself as a rule i don't ally myself with egotistical mad men then i'm afraid i will have to kill you [Music] and that is why we must put our differences aside and join forces why should we believe you quan chi why should we trust you i will not join an alliance of traitors [Music] shang tsung shal khan my comrades we are all treacherous by nature and betrayal is to be expected but if we do not stand together at least initially it could mean the end of darkness i stand with no one i will claim the prize and with it destroy you all oh naga emperor not anymore you haven't been listening to what quantity has told us the forces of light also seek to acquire this power you cannot defeat them alone only if we join forces does one of us have a chance of winning the prize but which one of us ivanaga is the victor he could use that power to overthrow you i'll take that chance what of the brothers what can be done about them i have trapped one of them in earth realm the other is in eutenia we must go there now our allies are waiting [Music] to [Music] do not go through that portal raiden you look different but i'm glad you're here i need your help shao khan and his allies are planning something it is none of my concern i don't understand you've always fought against shao khan's forces now he's planning another battle and you won't lift a finger we must not stand idly by we must stop this no tayden i have struck a deal with the emperor xiao khan will honor earthrealm's independence when his forces have won when he's one what are you saying why would that lunatic spare earthrealm because in return i will prevent you from completing your quest [Music] cannot believe that raiden would side with the enemy since this quest began nothing has made sense my entire life has been turned upside down i want to abandon the quest but if i do dagon will win and he has become far too corrupt to replace father as protector at this moment the forces of darkness are invading edenia there must be something i can do to stop [Music] them [Music] at last home in adenia i appear to be somewhere near the ancient craters of the southlands my brother shao khan and his allies they are all here somewhere and they will all die here who are you i am scorpion i seek revenge revenge against me against the elder gods they betrayed me as reward for doing their bidding they promised to resurrect my clan they are no longer dead they are the undead for this treachery i will eliminate the elder god's only means of saving the realms from armageddon i will destroy both your brother and you i will not let you pass prepare to face me in hell [Music] [Music] i was hoping scorpion would kill you and spare me the effort but it looks as though i will have to finish you myself please why did you interfere the quest has been corrupted all did not go exactly as my creator had foreseen it you are in the wrong location i will transport you to the rim of the crater where the final battle will take place the quest will conclude when one of you defeats me there in combat we must make haste many warriors are gathering if i am defeated by one of them they will steal the prize and the true purpose of the quest will have failed armageddon will be upon you all i want nothing to do with this quest my business is with dagon no choice we are all bound to the quest the fate of the realms will be decided today and let's get this over with i have waited an eternity for this moment when this is over i am going to finish you [Music] how did we take on you used to be faster than me last time we raced through father's temple i believe you won seems like only yesterday it was yesterday i suppose it was for you but i was awakened prematurely over the millennia i've grown much faster much stronger this time my victory is assured the only thing that is assured is that you will pay for killing mother and father so you know yes i killed them i had to lord chinook warned me that they had decided to assist you you killed them over the prize with the very weapons father gave us to use against blaze and now i will use them to destroy you [Music] fight [Music] unfortunate it was not intended that the brothers combat each other dagon has fallen now you must fulfill your obligation obligation the quest destroyed my family explain to me why i should care your mother my creator foresaw the coming armageddon that through mortal combat warriors would unknowingly tap into the very forces that make reality possible those warriors are in the crater below engaged in mortal combat all of them but with that many fighting in one place this crater will be the origin of the apocalypse unless something is done to prevent it the elder gods had ordered your father to orchestrate a solution he decided to kill them all when the time came but your mother argued to merely strip the combatants of their special abilities for some were heroes undeserving of death in the end they conceived of a contest between you and her brother the victor would unleash one of two solutions like a coin toss one side would disarm the warriors the other would destroy them all [Music] which side of the coin am i it is unknown even to me your armor is the catalyst the fate of the combatants will be revealed when our battle is done so by defeating you i could be killing them all they are unimportant whichever outcome you will be seen in the realms but you must not let anyone else come back me then allow me to win and we'll put an end to this no taven i must act according to my creator's design take your sword walk through the archway and finish the quest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so now face me in water combat round one fight [Music] wins [Music] my world has been ripped to pieces i awoke in a foreign realm forced to complete a quest set forth by my parents argus and delia this quest though intended to save the realms has destroyed my family my brother dagon became obsessed with winning the ultimate prize of full godhood and murdered our parents and in his madness he sought to destroy me as well oren and carl dragons loyal to our family for ages were not spared from the curse this quest has wrought dagon enslaved karo to serve his own ends the sorcerer quan chi killed orrin who was my guardian though i had nothing left i was determined to complete the quest i faced many combatants fighting my way to the top of the pyramid until at last i alone defeated blaze in mortal combat the energy released by his death passed through me granting me full godhood the excess power then filtered through my armor and passed into the other combatants though this energy was to have one of two effects on them death or annulment of their powers a third unforeseen outcome resulted the quest did nothing to resolve the instability of the realms but as protector of adenia i vow to stave off armageddon until a solution can be found the realms are in constant flux they shift and change like an endless dream shell khan's defeat should have marked our victory against a threatened merge of earth realm and outworld instead it heralded a new struggle for independence shinnok will be displeased by your inability to take earth hold your tongue sorcerer raiden your invasion of earth realm violated the rules of mortal kombat shall khan your tar cotton [ __ ] has been routed by the forces of light even now your allies desert you quantity what have you done earth realm will never succumb to the forces of darkness quan shi now you'll face the judgment of the elder gods [Music] metropolis a shining example of human achievement this is where we made our final stand against darkseid and his army of parademons born in the fire pits of a distant world called apocalypse but what seemed like victory was only the beginning it's over darkseid don't be so sure kryptonian took you long enough luther you threatened the safety of earth for your own personal gain you allied yourself with darkseid i was only trying to ensure humanity's survival in the event that you and the other so-called heroes failed [Music] darkseid's activated another dimensional boom tube he's going to escape this isn't over superman don't be so sure [Music] you're destabilizing the boom too [Music] uh i'm amazed you didn't kill us save it luther you're going to jail but this time you'll be someplace much more secure than striker's island what don't worry i'll make sure your cell has a nice view of earth [Music] nice move liu kang it was really your move i merely redirected your own power against you and i could sense your chi i knew you were there i should never underestimate the combat skill of the white lotus i am surprised to see you so soon after shao khan's defeat i've taken leave from the edinian resistance to solve a troubling puzzle many of our forces have disappeared vanished without a trace we cannot sustain these losses and still hope to reclaim edinia many white lotus have also disappeared by the gods who do you think is responsible shao khan was defeated quan chi is rumored to be imprisoned by the elder gods only two factions remain that are bold enough to fill the void left behind the lin kuei and the black dragon precisely we need to know for certain if they're responsible they're from your realm which is why i need your help you'll need more than just my help contact sonia blade she has a better understanding of the black dragon than i i will search for subzero reports are coming in that dark side been defeated by superman though the invasion is in fact over the looting continues deathstroke how's it going yeah it's been a while i got all the money for you no no no please i got the money you should have paid up sooner you'd still have a head [Music] metropolis isn't your turf i suggest you run back to keystone city before something bad happens don't bother getting up deathstroke you're going to jail not without a fight flash to wonder woman i just went three rounds with deathstroke i'll contact metropolis pd i need you in gotham no problem i'll flash are you okay i'm i'm all right just dizzy you've been running from city to city for hours forget about gotham i'll ask martian manhunter i'm fine diana i just felt strange for a moment i'm on my way to gotham now busy night for the bat and even he can't be everywhere at once what he doesn't know won't hurt him no but it might end up hurting you in the long run hand it over catwoman sorry red no can do i'm protecting it i can never figure you out one minute you're a hero the next you're a criminal i'm a complicated woman you know i don't feel like chasing you anymore and i don't have time to explain myself we don't have to fight oh but i want to this is why i don't play nice with you hero types these are fetch a tiny some all right what's your deal you don't look so good mate i'll take that hey hand over the gym back off freak she took it so you helped her escape i don't like your attitude you need to be taught some manners you'd give cabal a run for his money my turns who is that man and what are you doing in gotham batman this freak trying to try to kill me and now i'm gonna return the favor no you're not it's clear something's wrong with you the flash i know doesn't kill he does now [Music] i thought you were a master of hand-to-hand combat i am snow out of place this time of year if my hunch is correct katana have you contacted sonia blade not yet but i feel i'm getting close closer than you think is this the way of the so-called forces of light exterminate your enemies it was you who attacked me ninja many of our warriors have disappeared and now i have found their assassin i didn't kill any linkway i heard your communication you and your special forces dogs were about we're investigating the disappearance of our comrades as well it seems we have a common enemy sub-zero the question is are you willing to work together to uncover the truth how do i know i can trust you because i'm about to save your life [Music] scorpion go now we will meet again later you allowed sub-zero to escape now you will suffer my wrath ah my head what did you hit me with wait a minute am i inside the cave why did you attack me listen i'm sorry i don't know what happened i just felt this rage it overwhelmed me i couldn't stop myself what are you doing in gotham wonder woman asked me to help and that's when catwoman and that other guy showed up i'd like to run some tests i told you i'm oh no yeah what's happening get away i can't control flawless victory whatever scorpion is wonder woman it isn't human what about flash i believe flash and this scorpion creature switched places through some kind of teleportation event keep me informed of your progress i will batman out another energy anomaly similar to that of scorpion's frequency in the heart of gotham what happened i feel so strange i have seen this trick before your illusion does not fool me shang tsung masters masters where are they why don't they answer because they no longer draw breath shang and soon neither will you may the elder gods bind you in another realm for your treachery sorcerer this is liu kang sonia here have you found kano i almost caught up with him but he disappeared i did get close enough to tag him i've been trying to initiate a techno portal to his current location but i can't stabilize it how goes your search for sub-zero the lin kuei are not behind this they are suffering losses as well i think there is a new threat i fought a warrior something resembling a red devil with a bolt of lightning on his chest at first i thought it was shang tsung transforming his appearance i have ruled out that possibility this is a different warrior altogether i clearly sense an abnormality in his chi the energy that courses through all things in the universe this aura is unlike anything i have seen before i will try to attune to it attune to his don't do anything crazy i will be fine you may be the champion of mortal kombat but you are not invincible luke hang come in luke hang something must have gone wrong katana this is sonia blade please respond katana here something happened to luke hang he may need help my techno portals are unstable and i can't risk ending up in the middle of nowhere can you portal to him unfortunately no there is a crisis here in outworld that demands my full attention i do not have time to explain understood i'll have to go there myself i will join you when i can sonia out if the portal was working properly i could get to liu kang immediately but the destination is too erratic i can't risk emerging in the wrong place or worse bringing something here it's a little late to be worrying about that who are you i'm catwoman and i really need to be getting back to gotham city so if you could just maybe security breach portal room initiate immediate lockdown you aren't going anywhere not tonight honey i have a headache all right then no one cages this kitty security will take care of you i've got to get to liu kang [Laughter] i don't have time for this nonsense oh no no you were supposed to die when the clown exploded sorry to ruin your night joker batman okay okay i give up i've heard that before this night just keeps getting better and better stay where you are yeah that's gonna happen oh how are you i am lou kang are you injured i can help you [Music] i thought i defeated you sorcerer by the elder gods i will finish no joker and no scorpion your little distraction means two deadly menaces are out on the loose at least you're not going anywhere green lantern this is batman i have a prisoner i need to examine in a secure location i need an extraction to the u.n orbital station i've been having problems with my ring it may have been damaged during the battle with dark side but i still should be able to transport you give me a minute no sign of liu kang or anyone for that matter i've got a bad feeling about this sonia here sorry it's jax who's this woman she calls herself catwoman i'll question her later she's not a priority right now something's come up what's wrong i need help locating liu kang follow my signal and rendezvous with me as soon as baraka sonya just get here as soon as you can sonia out jax won't save you this time i don't know what barack is doing in earth realm but it's suspicious if a new invasion is coming raiden must be informed something about him isn't making sense i could buy that scorpion came from apocalypse but this man is different according to you flash had the same kind of psychotic condition i'm not sure but we may be witnessing the beginning of another invasion i'll leave the detective work to you i'm going to look for superman computer run the blood sample from luke hang against the known alien blood types we have in the database no matches to blood type i need to know if we should expect any more visitors so you will release luke at once let me guess you're from the same place as lou kang and scorpion how is it possible insulated armor you will release first i need answers release liu kang or i will take him from you [Music] it's worse than i suspected much worse it seems this is happening across the globe with strange structures and artifacts appearing but the question still remains where is superman that's a good question where are you superman raiden where are you there may be another invasion of earth realm shao khan may be returning raiden can you hear me raiden with a lightning bolt on his chest this must be the warrior lou kang fought who are you i am captain marvel captain why are you here oh confused don't understand the rage the rage [Music] wins oh now maybe i can get some answers out of you [Music] cap what happened my ring's not working right but i got here as soon as i could green lantern beware the rage [Music] the rage i take it he means you what did you do to cap the same thing i'm going to do to you thanks for the save whoever she is she was ready to finish me you look bad but whatever is going on is affecting us all come on i'll take you to the u.n space station so batman and wonder woman can have a look at you sonia what happened what are you doing in raiden sky temple when i lost contact with you i was about to hey what's wrong [Music] i finally found you what are you talking about this time you won't get away fight enough explain yourselves i don't know what happened she just attacked me i i saw you as the enemy i thought you were a threat i can't explain it i'm sorry jax it's all right you seem to have snapped out of it she was most likely influenced by the same forces that have affected liu kang liu kang what happened to you i was captured by the invaders fortunately raiden rescued me he was being held aboard that vessel i came here to find you raiden and was attacked by two warriors they retreated to that space station i do not know from where these invaders come or who leads them but it is clear that earthrealm faces a grave new challenge our world is merging with another i can feel it but shao khan was destroyed we stopped him from merging earth realm without world the emperor may still live and these new warriors may be his reinforcements then let's do something about it sonya let's get back to the base we can mount a counter-attack from there wonder woman this is batman we need you immediately i can't reach superman and earth may be in for another invasion tell me something i don't know the invasion has reached thermiskira do you need help no i'll contact you when it's over wonder woman out leave this island at once or pay with your lives i am princess diana emissary of themyscira you are not welcome here surrender and you will be given safe passage back to your world aryan fool i am shang tsum and this is my island fight i'm tired wonder woman to batman the invaders have retreated into the jungle i have more bad news earth is in the process of merging with another planet by the gods our world and the alien world occupy the same time and space as fragments separated only by large large yellow energy risks i've seen them we need superman but no one knows where he is i'll search metropolis darkseid's invasion ravaged metropolis it's not like superman great hera are you all right let me help you it can't be we routed his invasion he was destroyed who darkseid i saw him more powerful than ever torn his realm asunder am i too late has he already brought the apocalypse to this world wonder woman to you in orbital space station i need a med unit at my location we have another victim of the invasion please come with me you're safe now i have been followed who are you no one will hurt you my name is wonder woman i am not so easily fooled assassin of our world your master has sent you to finish me but this battle will be your last fight please wait wonder woman this is batman superman's not in metropolis the fortress of solitude has been breached that's impossible superman may be in serious trouble and without him so is earth i'm on my way [Music] what have you done another one quan chi was right who are you i am sub-zero surrender and no harm will come to you the lin quay do not know the meaning of surrender fight [Music] cal what happened are you all right something's wrong my powers have been fluctuating ever since the battle with darkseid i came back to the fortress to try to discover what was wrong and sub-zero attacked what's happening to me it must have a basis in magic luckily i'm not susceptible to magic so he got what he deserved bruce believes he's part of an invasion force heroes all over the world are disappearing including the flash and our planet is merging with another possibly apocalypse apocalypse then dark side is back i have to get back to metropolis i'll rendezvous with you at the u.n space station sub-zero who is behind this invasion you are the invaders wonder woman this is green lantern the u.n space station is in chaos captain marvel isn't a president none of us i'll be there as soon as i can you'll be coming with me hal what have you done the rage will consume us all not if i can help it it burns inside me i need you to be calm tell me what you did to green lantern why did you attack him ah i don't know the ethereal forces are all unbalanced shifting i reach out to the gods and don't recognize what i see the rage you have to help me you should have finished him your world must be different than ours here we don't kill our friends wonder woman to batman i found superman but we have a new problem we've lost green lantern when i got to the wuxi academy you were already gone i did find some guy dressed in red tights though i had a medevac to the infirmary then i followed your signal to raiden's temple you gotta stop running off like that sonja we're a team you can't take on the bad guys alone i know i'll work on it go get yourself patched up meantime i'll prep the portal for a jump to that space station we'll take him by surprise sounds like a plan but i have to warn you the portal has been less than cooperative lately nothing i can't handle she's right log shows the portal was having a hard time focusing probably a side effect of the two universes merging the ethereal matrix seems to be more stable now just a few adjustments and we should be back in business there that's more like it impressive what the hell allow me to introduce myself lex luthor perhaps you've heard of me or a little company i run called lexcorp this area requires top clearance and i don't remember inviting you to the party my technicians at lexcorp picked up a massive signal emanating from this space indicating highly advanced technology i'm the hands-on managerial type so i came to see for myself and i must say i am impressed a teleportation device maybe you and i should do business it's a portal as for doing business maybe it's time i gave you a demonstration of my impressive technology i'd prefer a handshake but if you insist what happened they found our base somehow he breached our defenses who's he called himself lex luthor he runs some company acts like he's gonna take over the world looks like you put a stop to that only one way to be sure let's take out that space station sonia sonia you copy we've apparently been sent to different locations on the station i think the portal still needs some work we'll need to regroup stay where you are i'll try to hold on someone's coming we've set up a temporary holding facility as requested wonder woman it should hold captain marvel until he's recovered my thanks if this earth merge continues everyone's powers may be affected i'll be joining you shortly with our newest guest affirmative are there any special security measures [Music] well now this just got a whole lot more interesting sonia area secure what's your situation i'm fine we need to locate the main command center to [ __ ] this station's capabilities right stay where you are i'll follow your signal and come to you you're not going anywhere what's up zero i take it you two know each other is jax a formidable warrior as you will soon discover well warrior i don't know what your universe is doing to mine or what you're doing to this station but true warriors don't use guns and if it's a fight you want you'll soon be joining your friend in a cell sonia you'll never guess who i bumped into sub-zero what's he doing up here obviously i'm a captive it would appear that we are now allies appearances can be deceiving true but you would be a fool to refuse my help what do you think sonja should we trust him better the devil you know than the w don't all right then sub-zero tell us what you know only that these warriors are unlike anything i have encountered i don't know yet who commands them any ideas the most logical assumption would be that shao khan has returned to finish what he started with this new army now i need to find someone a sorcerer who may have answers sorcerer i don't like the sound of that like it or not we need him when there is threat of invasion he usually knows something about it oh ring brought me to the home world of the guardians of the universe but why two universes are colliding your fellow lanterns are elsewhere doing what they can to combat the crisis that would explain captain marvel's attack whatever's happening on earth must be affecting him more directly than the rest of us i have to get back to earth yes you do lex luthor and catwoman how lex and i were held captive in the invaders underground base their security was more pathetic than the gotham city museum we escaped using their portal technology i calibrated it to transport us to metropolis but there was obviously a malfunction we ended up here now i know i need to get back to earth if he's involved things can't be good typical you're no better than superman the universe is falling apart and the so-called heroes focus on the little picture all that power in his ring have you ever noticed how he uses it big hammers trains and idiotic animals what's the matter with you lex his eyes just like captain marvel you lack imagination green lantern you always have someone like me should have that ring over my dead body lex just the way i like it this is a foolish waste of valuable time the merging of worlds is contaminating the galaxy infecting your very substance with rage for the moment we can control it here on or but if unchecked it will spread across the universes then we'll stop it if it continues to progress at this rate energies throughout will be redistributed and corrupted no lanterns ring will be unaffected or remain intact nor will any other being in the galaxy escape neither universe will survive why is this happening we are uncertain of the cause but we believe this anomaly originated on earth at the moment of darkseid's defeat you know anything about that lex it is highly unlikely that lex luthor is capable of influencing devastation on such a cosmic scale you on earth must work together to locate the source of the disruption and destroy it before the merge is complete looks like we have no choice don't worry handsome we won't bite much earth sector 2814 is under your protection we cannot spare any of the lantern corps to help charge your ring and return quickly there is not much time that's more like it so what's it going to be hero do we work together or do i have to save the world in spite of you remember i don't trust you luther the feeling is mutual that's the you in communicator i have to leave you here if i were you catwoman i wouldn't turn my back on him i can take care of myself idiot home sweet home or at least it used to be before dark side got to it you brought it on yourself lex from what i hear you helped darkseid i never take sides i chose the lesser of two evils the worst superman would do is hand me over to the authorities darkseid on the other hand would destroy everything it wasn't much of a choice seems like we don't have one now either so what's the plan simple we find a way to turn this situation to our advantage [Music] do uh [Music] the lin kuei are not welcome here rayden i come seeking assistance assistance for what end your kind has challenged me before i'm not my brother but you are still in quay fight scorpions trail is weak but i can still track it this way wonder woman this is green lantern what's going on i'll tell you what's going on green lantern who are you name's jax and now that the introductions are out of the way we're shutting you down [Music] jax you again sonia blade to special forces jax is down don't try it lady things have changed since the last time we faced off sending reinforcements negative negative i can handle it myself not this time [Music] green lantern am i glad to see you hey cap how you feeling i won't attack you green lantern i think i finally have the rage under control it's all coming from this other universe trying to merge with ours it's energy creates this terrible fury you just want to hit something that's what the guardian said how did you figure it out their alien gods are creating interference with my powers and infecting me with their combat rage great out of control magical alien god powers so that would make you a danger to us and yourself none of us is safe from the rage until this is stopped i have to go back to the rock of eternity to get closer to the gods and see how we can defeat this combat rage there has to be a way good luck cap [Music] truly you are more powerful than your sibling but the corruption of the lin kuei remains within you and for that reason and in queen also have reason to be concerned about this new crisis indeed the linquay acts solely in their own self-interest regardless of the impact on earth realm why then should i give you the location of quan chi for the same reason you helped my brother to protect earth realm that rock formation in the distance it was not here before the invaders came but through it i've gained insight earth realm is merging with another world powers are shifting rebalancing i have felt the effects in shel khan's defeat and they have grown ever stronger quan chi foresaw the intrusion from the other world and that their champion would pose the dire threat and the lin kuei sent you to eliminate this champion yes much like this rock formation the warrior's fortress appeared near the linguay temple i wore him down and sealed him in ice you did not wear him down his power was siphoned away redistributed to others i must find quan chi to demand he reveal all that he knows very well sub-zero i will show you the way search for scorpion and you will find quan chi but be forewarned betray my trust at your own peril how do you like scorpion was here i can sense the nether but he must have vanished from this spot well isn't this interesting a masked man in gotham and from the look of you i'd say you're no hero you do not look so innocent yourself name's deathstroke sub-zero so who are you hunting or are you just looking for a fight it is none of your concern fair enough but i've been around this world and i've never heard of a sub-zero i'm not from your world then you're in enemy territory and i assume you are the enemy smart boy this is where scorpion first entered the mortal realm what was he doing here what is this place it's the bat cave [Music] your world is invading mine affecting everything and everyone in it don't think you'll take me so easily then i will do it the hard way get over here there were rumors that the elder gods had punished you i see the rumors were true i won't be bound here for long i believe you know my enforcer you share a violent history from what i understand you will pay for the murder of my family and clan that was not me who else could it be scorpion finish him fight [Music] [Laughter] the elder gods underestimate me you're free the realms have become unstable our world is colliding with another the merging fueled by combat the intense battle between such bitter enemies caused a rift powerful enough to shatter my bonds you used us i'm a sorcerer the world as we know it is in peril none will survive regardless of allegiance return to your thunder god tell him if he wishes to save his precious earth realm you'll have to ally himself search their cities find the princess she has seen our enemy [Music] he's gone the disturbance is clearing but for how long their gods will be drawn here i have to stop them billy batson wizard this is only the beginning you must stop darkcon [Music] is that dark side darkseid's essence has been fused with evil magic from the other realm this new being dark khan is the focal point where both universes freely intermingle his existence will turn this world into a nexus of evil if the connection between the universes is not severed and darkseid freed the rage will reach out and devour us all you must gather an army of both dark and light and find a champion who has defeated darkseid in the past then we must find superman superman doesn't respond to my hails wonder woman says his powers have been affected as badly as mine by this alien world if not worse but he's the champion earth needs and now you will suffer the same fate this place such evil flattery will get you nowhere this pathetic creature reeks of the gods i want whatever power he possesses we are your death even with your world poisoning mind i think you'll find captain marvel isn't easy to kill fight shazam [Music] captain marvel wins now finish him no i won't kill you disappoint me still your mastery over the supernatural is exceptional i won't let this insanity destroy my world i defeated your champion now return me to metropolis your challenge is not over let us see how you fare against the savage fury of baraka's blades impressive you would have fared well in my tournament but i'm afraid you could never have been champion of mortal combat in the end you would have faced shang soon i've had enough of your game shang tsung i've beaten you and your demons now before the combat rage overtakes me again send me back as you wish quan she said the nether realm would drain him but even here we could not defeat him how can we defeat a foe such as this we must return to quan qi he may have the answer great gag the princess where is she princess didn't i kill the last guy that called me that he should have known i'm the only joker around here oops where did that come from you will pay for that with your life round one fight [Music] ah hello joker looks like you could use some help i already have a few recruits how'd you like to join us diana you have returned not for long batman has requested my presence earth is being split just as the mascara has by forces we don't yet understand i've returned to ready the amazons for war great hera who are you what business do you have on themyscira i am scorpion i seek the princess i am princess of earth you may speak to me scorpion batman told me of your battle you are not the princess i seek you may not roam this island at will even though you are an invader i promise you if you come with me you will not be harmed you cannot harm me but i will show you the meaning of pain the princess is not here [Music] wizard wizard i need your help there are no wizards or sorcerers here this place is not for you listen to me your presence here places my world in great danger it is you who does not belong i am raiden god of thunder ethereal power courses through this place yet it is unfamiliar tell me for what purpose does this place exist this is a focal point between the realm of the gods and men the gods give me their powers witch gods please i'm losing control you're corrupting this place you have to leave i will make you leave now round one fight she is near you need some help stranger the princess if you know where she is you will deliver her to me you're not from this universe all the same i'd encourage you to get to safety for your own well-being you'd better come with me magic sorcery surrender the princess or die right [Music] [Music] witness the destruction i will not let him take earth realm as well i have found her well done scorpion but she has gotten too close to the enemy rage has all but consumed her i can control her for now what will you do with her kill her she may have lost her mind but she still has her uses i will not leave her to you yet baraka [Music] one of the enemy is near draw him to the nether realm where he will be weak kill him when you have finished with your prey meet me at braden sky temple the time has come for old rivalries to be put aside excellent work captain marvel finally one of the heroes is doing something about these invaders did you win what are you and your criminal buddies doing luther unlike the rest of the long underwear crowd i'm trying to save the planet can we kill him now don't even think about it joker superman you're supposed to be in jail luther the evidence didn't hold up you should be used to it by now nice try though easy boys let's keep our eye on the prize catwoman's right i know what we're up against our enemy is called dark khan darkseid's energy merged with energy from the other universe dark khan's mere existence is what's causing the two universes to collide that explains the attacks on me and the rest of you the strange fluctuations of our powers it was you your heat vision you blasted darkseid's boom tube and sent him hurtling into some unknown universe this is all your fault you accuse me you help darkseid invade the earth remember fight fight fight fight both of you calm down you're being poisoned by the combat rage poisoned by what the dark energies from the world merge we can't fight among ourselves we need to work together to find dark khan i have lives to spare how do we find this dark corn if dark con is made of dark side's energy there's a good chance he's on apocalypse i know where we can access one of dark khan's portals i used it when catwoman and i escaped if their portal can take us to oahu it can take us to apocalypse deathstroke you and joker secure that portal this device will lead you to the base report back to me when you've succeeded you want me to assault an enemy base with him come on we'll kill things blow things up oh it'll be fun catwoman you're with me can't be too safe in this town too many criminals superman and captain marvel you gather your hero allies and wait for my word all right lex i'll trust you for now you get to the portals i'll go to the fortress of solitude and pull up everything i know about darkseid no killing if one of you steps out of line believe me i'll know then you helped him escape it was not intentional i swear to you you have betrayed my trust sub-zero did you a service katana you dare to come here sorcerer not to fight i assure you then for what purpose by now i am sure you are aware of the merging its effects are far-reaching even the nether realm is vulnerable i care not for the wasteland you call home katana you believe that you are in control that your allies are enough to stave off the coming destruction think again thunder god [Music] katana i will destroy you all this is your doing sorcerer it is no spell of mine she is a harbinger of things to come it will only get worse what is this i've used the last of my power to purge her of the rage i am at your mercy raiden why would you do this to win your trust what is it that we face perhaps she can show you at first i thought it was the emperor but it is someone much more powerful dark con the portal raiden disrupted did not destroy the emperor it created a monster dark khan's energy is slowly grinding the two universes together agitating us until we become enraged and fight combat releases the rage hastening the merging then dark khan must be stopped not yet we must first eliminate his forces but to do so will require the unthinkable bitter rivals must fight as one to focus the rage against our enemies so it shall be we will seek out dark khan's forces hunt them down in pairs liu kang you must fight alongside shang i will do as you asked brayden this could prove interesting this is the location but there's no base and here i was so looking forward to murdering someone you don't like me much do you does anyone over there they must be the source of the transmission then let's get down to business sweetie all right joker here's your chance to kill something if you can pretty flower for the pretty lady get the hell away from me you my wrist portal i

our side for this one luther if not i'll be the first one you'll answer to batman is so infuriating tell me about it by the way lex i'm nobody's bodyguard certainly not yours of course not you know the enemy's base and how to override their defenses once i've taken what i need i'll rally the so-called heroes to handle dark khan for me and you can we've got company more intruders their souls are forfeit our souls are forfeits is that ninja humor because it's not very funny we don't have time for this stupidity fight one down lex behind you you'll have to do better than that [Music] [Music]

job to do people to kill your forces got the better of me before my powers may not be at full force but as you can see i have friends the warrior sub-zero warned us about let us finish what he could not fight at least they were more of a challenge than your masters do not test me shang tsung i should have killed you at the academy what stopped you shang tsung your treachery ends here how how can this be you are more powerful than before i was weakened when last we fought but energies are in constant flux as a result of the merging now i am revitalized surging with power i could finish you right now you wanna finish you got it leave him he is defeated now you face a more deadly adversary you defeated him you defended me it was not something which i enjoyed i owe you my gratitude save your pathetic graciousness were it not for dark khan i would kill you now our objective is complete we must return to the others here it is just imagine what i could accomplish with the ability to travel anywhere instantaneously i'm going to download their schematics while you do that i'm going to do some reconnaissance amazing it's more advanced than i thought this is luther i'm transferring the portal technology to the lexcorp servers with this i'll rebuild lexcorp nothing will stop me except me jax i thought i'd lock you up you may have escaped once but it won't happen again i've been admiring your portal technology it's going to prove quite useful to me over my dead body if you insist your cybernetic arms intrigue me fascinating musculature emulation perhaps i'll take them with me luther flash what have you done to catwoman isn't it obvious she's a criminal just like you you're out of the loop red we're all on the same side shut up luther i'm taking you down all right luther we all got your hail let's end this now get us to apocalypse here's your pet clown out someone please kill him for me back off joker and flash are infected we can't trust them we've all been infected batman it's a risk we have to take not to worry batman my fight with luther apparently purged me of my combat rage or whatever you call it gentlemen if you're finished wasting time we have a job to do open the portal luther take us to apocalypse yay we're all going to hell and if you're not a good boy we'll leave you there we couldn't stop them either they overpowered us how can this be it was a skinny one dressed in purple with green hair stronger than you'd think i have fought him before jester with a twisted face a cloud you are defeated by a clown it may be as you said chiang sang energy shifting causing imbalances i don't need you to make excuses for me and i don't need your approval kano calm down you don't want to do this you think you could have handled him you can't even handle me we shall see as much as i would love to see you two kill each other there are bigger issues to deal with agreed sonia here they were at the base a guy in an exosuit dropped me then they used our techno portal i think they're headed out world then that is where we must go we all know what is at stake if we fail none of us will survive then we shall go to outworld [Music] [Music] great hera something is definitely wrong here i like it you would this is what's in store for earth if we don't stop dark con grinding two universes together will eventually rip them both apart a portal dark khan must know we're here he sent his forces to stop us fine with me let's take them out wait they may not be aligned with dark khan who cares they tried to kill me let me talk to them [Music] what happened this is our it is worse than when i left this is what will become of the realms if we do not stop dark khan over there dot com's forces their commander approaches i will speak with him but be ready to fight [Music] i'm superman we need to know your intentions i am raiden god of thunder with me are the mightiest warriors in all the realms [Music] we have come to challenge you immortal combat you will be defeated don't be so sure raiden if you want a fight you'll find my friends and i are up to the challenge ah luke what's wrong i can sense something something big it's here calm you seek to destroy your me unleash your aggression fight the rage flowing through them raiden and his allies battled the invaders with a diabolical elation but as the dust settled it was clear that neither side had won the few comrades still standing try to free themselves of the bloodlust dark khan is heading to that fortress we should follow him an obvious course of action but having been suggested by you shang i must consider that you are leading us into a trap you have good reason to doubt me long have i fought against you but this time i swear we fight together no you are in league with dark khan you lured us to our doom if we are to perish then so shall you sorcerer this is the end shang tsung i will finish you raiden stop shang tsung is not the enemy this time step aside liu kang no i will not let you kill him then you have turned your back on earthrealm broken your vow and betrayed me fight round one braden stop fatality what have i done you have wasted precious time we must destroy dark khan take the battle to his fortress you were right but this fight is mine alone it was my lightning blast that created dark khan do not be a fool you heard what quan chi said we must fight together no the rage will only turn us against each other i will face him alone [Music] you alien this is all your fault your stupidity created dark god now the earth is doomed and people say i'm the villain you are a villain lex not this time this time you brought ruin to the world my world you've ruined all my plans and i'm going to make you you paid me trouble for the last time superman stop back off you're under the influence of rage you have to fight it my powers are finally returning to full strength and this is where it ends luther now i'm going to finish you once and for all if you're not going to fight it then i'll beat it out of you look at yourself look at what you're doing you're trying to kill me stay down if you lose to the rage then the earth is doomed i'm not going to give up i never give up and neither do you bruce i hear you you're right it was my mistake that created that thing i have to stop it not alone darkseid himself nearly killed you this con creature is much more powerful thank you bruce damn impulsive good luck the time has come to correct my mistake you you're not going to stop me superman raiden the rest of your forces were defeated so were yours nobody won here then it is between us now that's fine with me round one fighting [Music] wins such ferocity the hatred the anger your i won't let you destroy the earth [Music] so you don't fight for him neither do you seems we have a common enemy and a common goal on your feet this battle is not yet over you will fight don't give in to the rage raiden it can be overcome focus we must focus if we fight together we can channel his own energy against him sounds like a plan raise each other or face me it makes no difference you will fight round one fight raiden wins raiden he's gone the others have disappeared as well the rage it's gone what is this place darkseid's throne room the two universes must have separated everything's returned to normal [Music] you aren't darkseid i am so gone that you will bow to me [Music] [Music] superman he's gone shao khan's throne room the realms have been restored who are you i am god's side i am god if you are anything like shal khan you will find no refuge here your fate will be decided by the elder gods [Applause] [Music] [Music] you
