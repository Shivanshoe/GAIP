okay dammit come on internal temperatures dropping unless i get out of here fast i'm gonna freeze to death i raped one of their weapons take it how the hell did you get this thing working i'll explain later we need to regroup go back in not until we get you fixed up i'll get us out of here what's the hold up no man my boys are expecting you at the evac center over there my suit power's falling fast no man cover me i need to regenerate damn i'm taking cover watch my back oh freezing off just not a heat source ah i'm taking cover come on let's go we gotta get out of this ice so we have to find cover hold them up nomad we have to get across that bridge the son of a [ __ ] look at that thing they're coming let's go man come on oh anderson so [Music] get across the bridge [Music] soldier over here you rapped your team what's left of them strickland said you guys were coming hell we never thought you'd make it out you fighting my guys in there it's 200 below inside that thing everything's dead everything human that is what did you fly to there what the hell are those things i wish i knew where's your co sergeant keegan he's inside idaho command this is sergeant we're overrun and i need immediate to risk another bird we got casualties waiting to extract make your way down the valley to the evac center understood major am i glad to see you guys sounds like we're on our own here we could have used some of that high-tech armor when the ice hit i've got orders to get these men down the valley to the evac center they're pulling everyone out we got more hospitals oh hold him up [Music] i get over here we're moving out watch out holy [ __ ] there's more of them go go all units this is this is roger that there's the crash light let's go hang in there we're on our way energy please get me out of here i'm trapped the pilot's dead i think something's outside ah come on no man move helena you okay i'm trapped the door won't open i can smell fuel please get me out of here hold on hang on i'm almost get done [Music] over here down down [Music] we don't have much time profit you go with her i'll lay down suppressing fire till you're airborne see you back at the carrier nomad good [Music] luck hold them off here it's nice to feel wanted major forces have already evacuated the valley but they left behind some artillery units our boys are using them so do not engage jesus right get down it's not going down it does keep coming pull back pull we can't hold this back much longer know that they're streaming into the valley we got to defend this point so we can extracted so here it comes show that faster format i want rpg's up on that hill jackson hold down that ring someone man that artillery unit this is okay people we're pulling out we're gonna get everyone off this island and regroup no man boxer 14 is preparing to leave this is your last check to get off this island alive now come on i'm on my way major come on sir in here what in the name of general pat is that [ __ ] thing get out of here vulture this bastard belongs to me what about you major i'm a marine son i'll walk on water if i have to i get off my [ __ ] island while i drive i think we can make it [Music] how'd i do we're still alive lieutenant i'd say you did good thank god you made it take a look at this one of the pilots brought it no in get a load of this ugly bastard yeah okay so i can keep it still trophy hey be careful the admiral is not bringing this thing on board you got something to say collins no sir i didn't think so what the hell dead now ain't it we saw the same thing with our generators in the mine these creatures drain energy from nearby power sources you could have mentioned that before we brought it on board nomad diablo wants to see you down in cdc that video feeds you sent backs causing a bit of a stir better get down there you go on i'll see you later come on the admiral is waiting glad you made it psycho where you've been i spoke to profit i think he's really losing it what happened inside that sphere shook him up it's all about going back to the island helen i think she's figured out how these things communicate electrical signals or something she reckons she can mimic their communications so we can fry their circuits sounds like a long shot if you ask me nice the lexington's under attack both for the radius they're transferring all their turtles to us all right there's a hospital ship on route from japan it's gonna take time so we have to make two i want a trauma center now yes sir dr rosenthal report to cdc dr rosenthal to the cdc all right fellas it's in there mate i'm gonna go find prophet before he does something stupid i'll catch you later if you can hear me you've got to get everyone off this island there's thousands of these things and they're waking up it's an infestation no mad you did a fine job out there son thanks to your video feed the joint chiefs have recommended a nuclear assault as soon as i get final confirmation from the white house we'll reduce these bastards to dust admiral we shouldn't rush into any decisions here we need time to explore other alternatives you want to second-guess the president the joint chiefs i'm not sure you understand the gravity of the situation doctor just over a week ago military intel sats detected abnormal heat signatures from that island at first we suspected the koreans were testing nukes cia and nsa got word it gets better four days ago nasa picked up a high frequency signal emanating from the center of the mountain the beacon is directed at a star somewhere in galaxy m33 that's almost 4 million light years away it could be a distress signal a call for help you said the samples you found were millions of years old that's true but this technology is so advanced it can't be terrestrial what if they were stranded here and now they're calling for help whatever they are wherever they're from we need to act quickly i have planes armed with nuclear missiles on standby with respect sir there's no guarantee a missile will even breach their defensive perimeter you want guarantees by a toaster i'm not gonna sit around and hypothesize while the safety of our planet is at stake this is ridiculous those things have drained every power source they've come into contact with the whole mountain is one giant power sink look at the schematic this energy source runs through the entire structure of the mountain look at the shape of it compare it to the creature we brought on board my guess is this thing's biological a living entity that feeds on power we can't predict what will happen if we use nuclear weapons against it you care to predict what will happen if we don't i think there's another way i just need more time there is no more time doctor sir we just lost contact with the uss lexington i want all non-critical personnel out of here right now i'll be in the armory come find me when you're through with this [ __ ] that means you too lieutenant [Music] i saw your seal heading down to the armory he's probably waiting for you siri you guys were inside that sphere oh man those nano suits are something else yeah a ransom preliminary test there's some kind of accumulator never seen anything like it oh he got it working no matter you made it we don't understand it either the firing mechanism is quite complex it would take us weeks to reverse engineer it yet you managed to modify them in the field you even integrated the power source with your nano suit remarkable yes i'm a natural to put it mildly okay your suit should be fully operational with a few minor enhancements i've diverted extra power to your hydro thrusters as requested you're good to go major dr gillespie i need to run some tests on nomad's nano suit i was told you'd be able to help certainly take a seat lieutenant we're anxious to retrieve the environmental data from your suit's recording unit [Music] hey boss where you going i'm gonna finish this i reckon nuking the entire island is about as final as it gets what admiral morrison does is not my concern his nuke won't even scratch the surface prophet wait so what can i do for you doctor i've identified a signal pattern used by these creatures when they recharge i think it makes them susceptible to an energy overload is there any way to transmit one of their signals via the nano suit shouldn't be a problem let me see what i can do what if i need to alter the frequency remotely fairly straightforward you can send signals from any computer with a wireless connection that should leave you room to experiment what exactly are you guys doing to me if my theory is correct you'll be a walking weapon to fight these things and we'd better pray morrison knows what he's doing [Music] you shouldn't keep the admiral waiting doctor i can finish up here okay nomad meet me up at the bridge as soon as you're ready pretty girl not many of those in my field if i were 10 years younger i'd ah there she is put her on the rack over there prototype tack cannon designed to be used in conjunction with the nano suit we're still experimenting it hasn't even been field tested it fires a projectile tactical nuke works like a grenade launcher but with a lot more bang for your buck whatever will they think of next can i try it out no well i think we're done here lieutenant i'll leave it to dr rosenthal to fine-tune your transmitter thanks doc no problem you better get up to the bridge the admiral isn't known for his patience go easy on that thing it's volatile relax i know what i'm doing and this is admiral morrison a few moments ago i received authorization from the president to launch a limited nuclear strike against the hostiles on the island obviously the decision to use nuclear force is a very serious one we are still unsure of the exact nature of our opposition but based on intel gathered by our special ops team we believe our planet is facing an imminent and very real threat whatever happens in the next few minutes i know that each one of you will perform your duty with honor and professionalism now i need you all to report to your battle stations and brace in here lieutenant the admiral is expecting you sir major barnes this is admiral morris put that veto down immediately made your part what is he doing sir should i scramble an intercept let him go crazy bastard just signed his own death warrant about time lieutenant we're almost ready to launch that major of yours just went awol raided the armory took a vtol and headed back to the island profits going back there you have to delay the launch he made his choice lieutenant admiral i'm begging you to reconsider it's too much of a risk what if this is exactly what they want what if we're playing into their hands i don't have time for what ifs doctor the pentagon has authorized the use of nuclear force i have my orders we're ready sir what if you're wrong admiral can you live with the consequences proceed with the loans aye aye sir this is constitution command that's a green light deliver the payload i hope you're right about this you me and the rest of the planet [Music] i think we just made it stronger sir we've got multiple contacts in there eight no 12. oh [ __ ] everybody down [Applause] enemy side hold on whip it free get a fire crew in here now shake it off nomad this whole ship's going to hell in the hand basket those things are breaching our hull from every direction get out there and fight soldier we cannot lose this ship the doors jammed lieutenant don't just stand there force it open my uh like that so wow some of our engineers are trapped on the lower tanks take a deck elevator down to the hangar lane let's do that roger psycho no man i've been working on the remote transceiver i think we can manipulate the recharge mechanism via your nano suit if you get in trouble let me know i'm always in trouble uh oh [ __ ] i thought you were one of those creatures you know man damn you made it i heard you were dead hey hey nomad been waiting for you there's a radiation link in the core we can't hold these things off much longer the reactor is going to melt down unless we can shut it off you'll need to swing around to the other side tell me what i need to do first you need to disable the circuit breakers in the exchange room that allows you to restart the reactor safely don't worry i'll guide you through it you should be near the circuit breaker now the red radiation warning light will be flashing next to it okay that should do it right rod arms are now open head over to the reactor room and initiate the scram sequence okay that should do it right rod arms are now open head over to the reactor room and initiate the scram sequence so okay i'm in the reactor room what next hit the red button scrap sequence initiated good work though the control rod should bottom now damn it the roads are jammed there are hostiles everywhere i think they're draining power from the reactor i'm transmitting a signal through your [Applause] suit think it's working don't sound so surprised yes sir okay the reactor shut down transferring power to secondary system great job nice job pushing those rods down boy but i need you up on deck we got another wave of hostiles inbound get up here [Music] energy critical nomad the guys on the flight deck sound like they're taking a beating you better get up there been an honor to work with you the blastoise [Applause] so [Applause] come on lieutenant we need you out on deck there's something coward [Music] hurry we're bailing out though man i'm gonna grab a veto and get a soundboard we'll wait for you i am not [Music] holy [ __ ] oh [ __ ] how did i know you were gonna say that service stay close to that thing it seems to be working uh i'm bringing that down are you crazy just go oh [ __ ] they brought out the big guys through your suit i'm on it so all right i think it's working i thought you'd never ask okay i'm working on the second one second shields down come on mate take down [Music] oh [ __ ] hang on okay the hatch is open come on come on you can make it come on psycho go go go [Music] so oh pull me in [Applause] [Music] [Music] there's a naval fleet on route from japan they'll be here within the hour i'm setting coast to intercept no we know how to beat them now we need to keep fighting i'm picking up a transmission what is it you ain't gonna believe this way he's alive looks like he's inside the sphere lock under his position going back [Music] [Music] you
