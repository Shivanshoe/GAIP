let's do this i'm taking you off the board give it your best shot soldier it'll be right between the eyes put your faith in the shaolin like hell i'm gonna trust them they seek only to heal you i'd known i would have stopped you had no business attacking katana the intel i had was solid come with me before it's too late i don't need rescuing i am rescuing others from you you heard about me that your skills are formidable the benefit of being a specialist shao khan's army will stand against you i'll fight them to the last man if i have to you are not invincible shao khan had better withdraw if not then what you'll need a good supply of body bags you wanted to fight me to test myself against your world's greatest warrior your call you're here on a mission i'm sure as hell no tourists what are your orders you have crossed the shaolin they chose this fight not me that is impossible your hat it's a lethal weapon only when i wield it that's some mouth you got there people find you intimidating those with any sense do yes i got none then it is nearly time to face the revenants if it's a fight they want they'll have it care to give me a sample we should be in this together i cannot sanction your actions then you better stay out of my way guerilla tactics will be useless here i can handle a straight-up fight we will soon find out i have heard stories about your skills here to see if they're true whether you intend to employ them against us my problem is not with you you dare threaten kotocon ever occur to you to ask your wife have you ever battled a lot of magic no can't say that i have shall i give you a taste a most impressive specimen there's nothing here for you then farewell my lovely so you're a vampire i am a blood mage not a vampire the difference being i was warned to steer clear of you you have a wise friends doesn't mean i won't finish the mission i reckon you must love your job what makes you think i like kelly because you're so goddamn good at it you and me we're nothing alike now that's [ __ ] we're both killers but i don't kill for the thrill of it you a crack shot i never miss looks like i got a fight on my hands you're a sharpshooter how about a bullet to the head to prove it that's not gonna happen there's more like you out there the swarm numbers in the millions this war isn't ever ending what brings you to the realms i'll never talk all men can be broken you survived the hive been through worse in worse places than that truly you are hard to kill what do you want with me to feed your flesh to the high that is seriously [ __ ] up you will not draw first it's who draws last blood that matters neither are in your future why were you sent here only i can complete the mission or perhaps you are deemed expendable i'm not happy it's come to this in retreat there is no dishonor like hell there isn't who the hell are you the fire that burns the sun if you say so your bow must be quite valuable it is but it's not for sale i will have it human [Music] you're making a bad choice you cannot best be in combat i'll do whatever it takes you've got six hands right eight once i have yours coming you do not profit from your skills i'm a soldier not a mercenary you are a fool you do not belong here i can't leave until the mission is done retreat before it is too late cronica offers peace in exchange for what blind obedience do not be a fool abide her will do not try to stop me stand down and i will save your soul i'm beyonce never battled anything like you you are not prepared to face an elder god doesn't mean i won't try are you expecting me to surrender for you to give me the mother of all battles i'll give you a war you won't believe your war with sheriff teasel was avoidable he drew first blood not me your response was disproportionate to his actions fight against my country is she nuts it is suicide to ignore my creator's commands at least i'll die with honor i have borne witness to all of your battles then you know this war has just begun and also how it ends someone's been looking for me either you surrender or we fight try me it'll be a scream well well what's your price to tango i fight for country not cash oh adorably quaint i have doubts about you is that a problem soldier when in doubt i kill it's time to finish this to challenge me you must have no fear i've just been trained to ignore [Music] you
