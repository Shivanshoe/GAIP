think it's time someone came forward [Music] i i've been working on this heap a long time before the war we refit and rebuilt ships rest in the galaxy then came the empire and engineers became

what jedi gave their life so that you might live [Music] that strike will be your last [Music] [Music] come now let's end it get on board [Music] captain ah uh [Music] okay shut that thing off and grab some seeds thanks for the help but who are you people my name is sir junda and this is my captain greece dreidus how you doing yeah the manager's my ship but you better pay attention to this lady here so who are you cal kestis who was that back there an imperial inquisitor she's a force user hunting jedi survivors and now that she knows who you are she will not stop until she destroys you how do you know so much and why did you help me we track imperial communications we heard the inquisitors were heading to bronco so we made our move oh yeah what's the bounty on jedi these days anyway that's gratitude for you look i get it you've been surviving on your own for so long that it's impossible to trust anyone and it's what's kept you alive but this is about something bigger than just surviving like what like rebuilding the jedi order you too anybody else oh we're not good enough for you the jedi council gone so i'm all you've got captain set a course for pagano aye aye in the meantime try and relax go you're safe for now you got to move on and live your life find your destiny you were talking in your sleep weirdo ugh so [Music] [Music] that's all i wrote it years ago you touch an object and witness events connected to it you feel it's history it's an echo and the force from the object not many jedi have that skill how would you know that i was once a jedi but not anymore do i know you no but i knew your master gyro depaul he was a true guardian of the republic he was a hero listen something happened to me during the purge i survived but my connection to the force is damaged when i meditate if i let my guard down i lose control and it's like i'm back in that moment you survived cow and you're not alone not anymore we'll come up on our destination this is pagano a jedi i knew discovered it before the purge you won't find it on any maps the empire doesn't know this place exists no so what's the plan will you hide out here we're done hiding cal see that structure over there i believe that vault holds the key to rebuilding the jedi order but it requires someone strong in the force to pass its test and since you're not a jedi anymore that's why you need me i know you don't trust me and i'm not really sure i trust you but we have a common enemy and a common cause i'll share more of my plan after you reach the vault but until then there's someone here i think you should meet may the force be with you [Music] yes i'm looking for a jedi then but if there's already one here why does here need me this looks like a safe place to meditate just need to focus my mind [Music] hey bd1 i'm kel [Music] uh yeah i'm okay i'm just i'm looking for someone no not you i'm searching for a jedi i think hold on you know the jedi what do you know wait hold on did you just slice that thanks [Music] that's the vault sierra mentioned whoever i'm supposed to find must be waiting there [Music] [Music] [Music] so i sent something over here that's a really big bug [Music] any ideas got to get across this gap somehow the zipline whoa how'd you know that would work wait you didn't careful over there that doesn't look safe just like back at the scrapyard [Music] i'm coming [Music] um whoever lived here use this room for storage we have food and supplies hey that was pretty brave you okay wait i can help you with that will you let me oh okay hmm well your scomplink is busted but this should help you get moving for now [Music] okay try that the vault yeah that's where i was headed to okay so first we got to figure out a way out of this place [Music] um [Music] [Music] uh bd that's a little small for me don't worry i'll find my own way out tight fit but this should work those vines look like they lead somewhere hope they're sturdy [Music] yeah i'm all right healing stim they're full of surprises that's better thanks little droid okay let's try this again oh okay hop on board [Music] so how'd you get here remember i've never known a forgetful droid can't argue with that that's where we need to go i can feel it hmm you mapped everywhere we've been i can't make it over there we gotta find another way hmm [Music] [Music] louie run for it ah i'm looking hey there bitty one okay [Music] can't get it to work [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and look see something in there try again it's difficult master yes the path is difficult it may seem impossible but with persistence and the force as your ally you will overcome any obstacle you will master any path now do what you must to reach me [Music] faster more intense now reach my position i did it persistence in the force is my ally just remembering all tricks [Music] think you can show me that shortcut again [Music] this area was used for meditation there's someone familiar with the jedi order [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'll check it out [Music] gracie there oh it's on we're not finished yet okay okay he probably would have won probably [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] amazing [Music] you all right petey well done whoever you are you have passed the test i left behind and gained access to the vault and this recording one of many encrypted logs stored in the droid i am master ino cordova i may not know your name but i know your purpose the fate of the jedi order lies in your hands this place this vault is a sacred temple built by a vanished civilization known as the zepho meditating here i was granted a premonition through the force a vision of doom i have placed inside this vault a jedi holocron containing a list of the names and locations of young force sensitives throughout the galaxy ahead you will find the inner chamber of the vault but also another test i can only trust this holocron to someone who has followed my path and understands seek out the hidden tombs of the three sages and learn to perceive the mysteries of the force as the zepho once did in this droid you will find everything you need to succeed on this journey go to the zepho homeworld there you will find peace in the eye of the storm good luck jedi and may the force be with you [Music] i guess you were the someone i was supposed to meet you know i've been alone for a while now without any purpose just hiding [Music] there's no way to live not for a jedi or a droid maybe cyr was right maybe we're done hiding hey you want to meet some uh friends of mine [Music] [Music] i think i found what you wanted me to see sounds like you did we'll be waiting yes uh please [Music] my friend it appears that zepho had some interest in dathomir strange for such a peaceful culture to have any sort of fascination with a place so god i'll check it out [Music] should be a lot quicker than the weigh-in is this place the jedi used this place to study the sphere above i can still feel the excitement [Music] hmm [Music] so i think it looks like it smells worse than greece does yes where boggling was killed is it trying to defend its family so [Music] hmm uh uh hmm [Music] it was after boggling eggs in the pack fought back toss me a stem bd1 i need some med speed one stem crate should be here wait can you carry more [Music] thanks speedy one [Music] hmm [Music] whoever owned this bag brought it from coruscant they were frustrated with the jedi council uh [Music] uh [Music] you passed the test so you knew about bd1 come on board we'll talk inside oh 81 this is greece hey greece what is that get off myself i can't get out of my shop get out of there get out that is bd1 he's with us i don't care who he's with do you have any idea how hard it is to get oil stains out of bertolli mean fabric not really oh i hope you found something better out there than this droid oh calm down breeze he did tell us cal the vault was built by an ancient civilization called the zepho a jedi named ino cordova hid something inside of it what did he hide inside a holocron from the archives it contains a list of four sensitive children the next generation of jedi i knew it ah cordova you old fool you knew him yes a long time ago i was his apprentice cordova was a loner and that little droid and i are probably the only ones that know about pagano hold on wait a minute wait a minute a hollow what a holocron it stores information but only accessible to jedi hang on i think i have one around here use the force [Music] this is master obi-wan kenobi i regret to report that both our jedi order and the republic have fallen with that list of force sensitives we could rebuild the jedi order and defeat the empire okay no problem let's get it well except the holocron is hidden deep inside the vault and to get it we have to follow cordova's path he mentioned something about the planet dathomir and a zeppo homeworld all right well where are we going now i'm just asking cause i was thinking maybe making some food look before we do anything i need to know something how come you're no longer a jedi i had an experience that changed my perspective so i cut myself off from the force but you still want to rebuild the order i believe that rebuilding the order is the best chance we have against the empire what do you believe i believe i can't keep hiding from the empire so i don't really have a choice cal as long as you're alive you will always have a choice are you with us we're in dathomir zepho it's your choice let's take a look [Music] you remember me i came to pagano looking for my former master ino cordova hi to you too you two must have spent a lot of time together alone on that planet you must have left right after you were activated do you remember the last thing cordova said to you good luck jedi may the force be the log left for cal nothing else time to land get up here think of a storm brewing down there this might not be the best time to land something strange those winds are interfering with our calms hey cordova mentioned something about peace in the eye of the storm well i can just make out a settlement in the middle of it then we have to get there copy that couple moms ain't gonna kill you kid unless the wind picks up can you tell that bucket of bulls to keep his opinion to himself i'm sure everything's under control it's under control it's just a little tricky okay hold on hold on hold on [Music] landing crazy money baby but i'm still getting a lot of interference on the comms it's gonna take me a minute to get them back up [Music] i'll search for signs of cordova in the meantime good i'll be in touch once i crack this [Music] cal over here you did good work on pagano the more information we gather on cordova and the zepho the closer we'll get to stopping the empire i've heard of ancient cultures but don't know much about them i only knew that cordova was obsessed with the zepho believing their teachings to be important i too was intrigued by the mysteries of our galaxy you better get moving there's a lot to learn here good luck watch out bd you don't look friendly i'll check it out can you hear me the empire they found zeppo if they were following the mantis we would have been swarmed already did they be looking for the tombs let's hope not we just got our cons working i'm pretty hurt way too close uh [Music] mother used this fabric to keep her child warm they were on the run from something you're a life saver you know that looking good buddy [Music] [Music] foreign i won't let you kill me hey okay now look [Music] there's still no results i wonder what's going to happen did you see that too stop it i'm not leaving here alive i'll never stop thanks petey one i'll take him down it's all lice the empire just wanted this land [Music] i'm gonna find my opening okay i'm done [Music] hi bd1 nice job where are you taking us the empires forced the villagers from their homes frightened refugees shipped off to work camps or worse so huh so you know those big says you i'd rather live than try to kill one of those come on let's get him it's you and me now where did you come from [Music] can you slice this sorry about your scalp link but standing up to that bog rat pretty brave [Music] [Music] my friend in the rotation since i left pagano i've uncovered more about the sephora than i once believed possible what [Music] that looks like a problem [Music] skinning again [Music] i'm hungry do you think someone's sneaking around can i get some aid [Music] me [Music] so i'm looking one open hmm whoa that's got to be one of the zfo i guess we're on the right track huh forever that was close [Music] [Music] come on [Music] foreign [Music] enemy approaching this won't end well i should do this kill lucky block uh there hannah take [Music] i can't push it [Music] [Music] it's not possible i'm gonna find my opening you're not getting out of here i'll break your card uh i need help good job in accordance with the emperor's will we've occupied zepho redistributing its inhabitants this planet has failed to yield significant data or relics for project auger its electromagnetic winds have rendered the bulk of our mining technology useless meanwhile more stormtroopers lose their lives to dangerous fauna we will not be able to fulfill our directive here it is my recommendation that we disband the project and leave a token outpost to keep scavengers from stealing our if they hit technology but their eyesight is terrible so if i can get out of the way i'll be fine yeah just don't get hit did you see that too he's really injured so ah i found something what do they know no mention of cordova i don't think the empire knows he's been here then we have the advantage for now [Music] [Music] that's interesting we're on the right track can't get through there's a storm up ahead something about a crippled empire's equipment i can feel something pulling me there beyond the storm follow it let the force sharpen your instincts all right best yes huh another one of these i wonder if they connect [Music] v1 [Music] [Music] come on never seen a storm do that before yeah it's incredible my friend i believe this to be the earliest zepho site we've uncovered yet despite my reservations i cannot chase the pagano fault from my mind its visions shape the direction of an entire culture i must understand why [Music] i'm in the tomb it's massive and the empire no sound of them down here what about cordova still not sure what i'm supposed to find he's a little eccentric tell me about it but he wouldn't send us here for his amusement keep an open mind you see that now [Music] [Music] it's not just wind rippling through these chimes voices from the past [Music] [Music] these were using zephyr meditation rituals i think they were training force users [Music] yes hmm [Music] [Music] huh ugh it's a lightsaber can't solve everything never seen that before uh three [Music] find something [Music] wow what's this [Music] um ah focus the jedi do not seek aggression but we stand against it the force is there to shield us the obstacles in your path define the path what stands in the way becomes the way now try again good continue [Music] faster now complete the test it stands in the way my friend take a look at the detail on this mark the distinctive striations it can only be a rosha tree from kashyyyk it's time to call on an old friend if the zepho had contact with kashyyyk there is a good chance chieftain tarfal will know about it [Music] another one what's this there this guardian was destroyed long ago zepho crafted this artifact as an offering to the wind it was destroyed intentionally for some reason [Music] [Music] [Music] this [Music] yes i this relic is extremely old but i get the sense it was part of some type of training ritual for zeffo force users [Music] so uh huh hmm come here be one [Music] my friend this tool is utterly fascinating huh so [Music] [Music] huh [Music] this was deliberately destroyed you can still feel the hate of the act [Music] [Music] what did you find the zephyr went to kashyyyk cordova mentioned someone named tarfal a wookie chieftain they were old friends i think he's still around there's only one way to find out we have to go to kashyyyk uh did we just open the way for the empire reloading [Music] [Music] i knew he would run you're a coward [Music] getting a strange feeling from this one ancient zepho gathered here i wonder why [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] um [Music] what's this [Music] an imperial officer was trying to hide a relic down here it was a cave-in thinking trapped never escaped [ __ ] hold on oh it's shaking can i get some help [Music] what's that i'm looking [Music] he was killed by a cave-in imperial excavation is making these tunnels unstable [Music] [Music] hey can they [Music] so [Music] ah how are you feeling bd1 good i'm glad [Music] rage get in here [Music] see her i just took down the trooper wearing black and red armor the same type they might think purge troopers are enough or they could be stalling you on purpose stay wary that's an excellent find it will need my personal evaluation [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] what is this continue excavating i want rare artifacts not useless trinkets [Music] you know so [Music] [Music] cool [Music] you need [Music] uh jedi i got attack him quickly don't let him wasn't expecting this it's a giant zephyr statue kind of thought there would be zepho stuff inside need some meds be one better yeah you're right i think i could replace yours with this let's get you fixed up [Music] wanna try it out [Music] [Music] jedi take that good work i see you [Music] time great come on seer there's a transport ship leaving the empire's base i heard they plan to bring zepho artifacts to coruscant what does that mean that the emperor is interested in zepho maybe this door is not budgie [Music] just don't be next down [Music] 81 just making sure he's still there do not concern yourself with a missing artifact i'll deal with it personally you uh know any jokes bd i don't know why classic huh oh [Music] i'm liking this time for a stim nice assist [Music] [Music] [Music] someone put it there on purpose come on um need to slice this door [Music] [Music] forever [Music] [Music] hey greece you busy well i was trying to watch you know no i'm not busy never busy so uh you need something i'm standing next to two crashed ships looks like you weren't the only pilot who had trouble with the wind here whoa whoa whoa you're just realizing that where have you been i mean it doesn't get better than me yeah okay all i wanted to say was thanks uh you know you're uh you're you're welcome kid but i i you know i gotta go i i gotta think so gotta see ya [Music] the villagers built this memorial to the clones on the venator see him empire isn't the only thing we have to worry about this tunnel flooded suddenly but could have caused such a thing something smells like old oil sorry buddy not you it's this water [Music] [Music] i need time [Music] let's see here i'm under an imperial dig site he got a lot further than we thought we can't worry about that now the empire's identified you as the jedi from braca they're searching for the mantas as we speak can't you move the mantis it's too risky to start the engine its power discharge will draw their attention immediately i'll be back as fast as i can [Music] [Music] yeah got a scan would you mind cal we've got a walker firing on us and our weapons are down is that him tell him he better get his butt hold on i'm on my way yes i need help [Music] nice work out there kid hey you got some real moves on here just tell me that this visit wasn't for nothing i found the tomb of zepho sage they definitely used the force an advanced civilization of force wielders who mysteriously vanished no wonder master cordova became so obsessed with them what else did you find before they disappeared the zepho journeyed to the planet kashyyyk oh cordova had a wookiee friend named tarfal maybe we can find him shake i look things are really bad down there the the empire's muscling in on those wookies big time then we better get ready for a fight i think this lifestyle suits you fighting that walker seems to have made you more confident so how are you holding up man with the force yes with the force i know you said it could be overwhelming haven't gotten myself killed yet rather not talk about it yeah well i understand more than you realize oh why'd you choose to stop using the force when the purge started and our clone troops turned against us my padawan and i took several younglings and we went into hiding but we didn't last long imperial patrol was about to discover our location so i tried to lure them away from my padawan trilla she stayed behind with the young wings but they caught me and they tortured me he wanted to know about the others and how many were left but mostly they wanted to know about cordova and where he went but you escaped now it was a prison riot i saw my opportunity and i took it but they almost broke me and i am not the same as i was cal your padawan did she survive [Music] no but that's why we can't give up we can't let the sacrifice of those closest to us be for nothing [Music] please i'm trying to collect my thoughts uh uh-huh huh everything okay yeah i'm great just enjoying some peace and quiet cordova had supplies hidden all over pagano could be worth a trip back to explore [Music] you know my piloting hasn't been this good since i graduated first in my class until the tier on space academy i wasn't aware later on had an academy yeah it was new back in the day you probably don't get around that area much so what did you train on name it fighters freighter short range long range whatever i flew circles around everybody you flew frames uncertainty yeah it's all they really allowed me to do i was so good though you should have seen me get over here kid we're about to land you're making good progress i'm glad you're with us we've got a galaxy to save not an easy task are you sure you're up to it i'll be okay it's better than hiding on bronca i've been to many different planets in the galaxy searching for well you unless we stop the empire we'll all be gone hidden or not i'm ready good you must have come here a lot with cordova no actually he never brought me here he did tell me about it i was the only one who knew of its location he trusted you i suppose he did he trusted i'd believe him and finish what he started hopefully he was right bd1 thinks so he's one bright droid [Music] oh hey there little guy we'll find you at home [Music] this is the same kind of sphere and socket from zepho what do you think it does [Music] with this you and i are gonna be unstoppable there [Music] ah hey hey so hmm [Music] so [Music] so uh huh need to open this repair kit he hoped someone would pick up his trail but left beaty wanted to guide them my friend i flew with all haze at the coruscant and presented my findings to the council [Music] find something this help belong to cordova feels weird to say about someone i've never met but it's kind of comforting i agree this place is special i added his skill to mine i want to keep a piece of him with us [Music] [Music] ah [Music] so this tool was used by someone eager to reach the vault let's keep making progress time to go great hate sitting around like [Music] this what what what is that thing saying i don't know why people have droids tell that to him he can understand you he can look i didn't mean anything by it droids just freaked me out what doesn't you sound like an imp they deactivate droids just because they can that makes him one of us tough break i take it back you're all right buddy all right we're here get in your chair [Music] oh tell me we're not running that blockade oh only as a last resort i break the mantis's transponder to transmit imperial signals hey griez yeah keep your power signature low and act like we belong just like vodka no it's right i don't need another set of hands just please keep your eye on the scanner all right all right all right i don't see anything they're preoccupied with something on the ground we're clear [Music] that doesn't look good the empire is devouring kashif its natural resources in case i've been enslaved or displaced that was a close one kid aren't you supposed to be watching the monitors gorilla fighters wookies and off-roaders ambushing an imperial convoy walker's approaching their position tarpon could be with him awful could be anywhere like deep in the ground like we're gonna be if we get caught up in that battle down air we don't have any other options and and they'll die without our help so what's your plan sabotage we used to scrap walkers on bronca i'll just jack one get a load of the kid he thinks we're back in a clone wars captain get us near those walkers wait what listen those walkers double his troop transport so once you get inside be careful for no freeze breeze to work as magic hey do me a favor stay alive down there i'll add it to the plant right if you're jumping you better do it now kid you ready for a swim bd [Music] hey [Applause] [Music] you ready to do this ah [Music] how do we get on top [Music] okay now we're what [Music] uh just a little more yes we keep going [Music] climb to the top [Music] [Music] so there's no pulse your turn to report fatalities this is l97240 reporting in we've got confirmed casualties it's the jedi one reading a new ship on scanners brought more firepower than we thought how's our hole looking badly damaged we're at 70 integrity and falling that should still be enough to stop out these insurgents keep us steady yes sir [Music] it actually worked okay [Music] let's do this that's the blasters so that fires the cannons [Music] hey who are you someone who just brought nada to the table who are you come with mickey empire we're venting on an imp landing pad up but hey would mine buy support copy that let's make them even angrier forward [Music] [Music] four troopers [Music] we have to protect the gorilla fighters [Music] it's headed for us you do anything hold on yeah i'm okay you all right no you're not doing that again [Music] you just wrecked a perfectly good walker got a name calcus saw guerrero what are you doing on kashyyyk looking for somebody what are you doing here my companions and i came to kashyyyk to disrupt and peel supply lines [Music] so who are you looking for the wookie chieftain named tarfal it's awful is impossible to find there's a reason he's invaded the empire for this law he's a freedom fighter he's the freedom fighter a symbol of the wookie resistance striking at the empire from the shadow lands huh see her greece this is saul how you doing what do you want with tough jedi business jedi are dead not all of them get that over corpse my master gave it to me this pad supports an imperial refinery that runs on rookie slave labor intel suggests that some of the captors there are guerrilla fighters i should help them one of them might know how to contact tarfal it's possible oh wait a minute hold on wait a minute the manage works wonders i mean it's a great ship excellent pilot but it is not built for close support we'll stay here and monitor imperial transmissions with a bit of luck will intercept any distress calls appreciate it milo tennis and i will scout ahead to prepare the attack join us when you're ready go go [Music] glad you're all right yeah yeah good to see you too this place is a dump your plan worked and now you want to follow saul

[Music] you've seen what the empire has done to kashyyyk these stories are playing out all over the galaxy my partisans could use a jedi on our side i'm honored but if you have our own mission i can't walk away from not yet the office dance keep it in mind cal i'm mari kosan and this is commander troisik [Music] uh sorry i'm not quite fluent choi six says he'll do whatever he can to find tarfal and vouch for you do you think he's still alive have faith cal we'll be in touch with your ship for the cause [Music] you've been fighting for so long have you learned anything from war nothing unites people like tragedy everything the empire takes from us only makes us stronger each injustice spurs others to join our cause if we stand together we can win just like today thank you i've been monitoring imperial communications and i picked up something project auger has been reactivated the empire may be close to finding another zeppo tune looks like we still have work to do [Music] you think saw in the others will be okay always looking on the br huh hey uh thanks for everything hey bd this here cal good to see you back in one piece mari kosan contacted us we know you couldn't find tarfal i love risking our lives for nothing it's fantastic it wasn't for nothing maury and troisik will come through i like your optimism you could all use a little of that now and then hey i'm a positive guy too i'm positive that if i die i'll be very upset what you did good cal we might not have found tarfal yet but you saved lives today don't forget that thanks where to kid [Music] back to zepho huh the empire might have found a zepho tomb we can't waste any time heard about a high stakes game from when it saws fighters a few extra credits good and hurt you know gambling grease use your head one of these days the haxy and brood is going to catch up with you those slubs i'll hear them coming from a parsec away i don't need your gambling habit causing us more trouble with murderous criminal syndicates you're right you're right i know it i just want to blow off some stress every once in a while you know anyway all of that is in the past i'm sure it won't be a problem get over here kid we're about to land there's a long journey ahead of us [Music] these ancient tombs didn't survive all this time because they were easy to find it's a challenge i'm willing to take i can see that i'm glad you believe in what we're trying to accomplish i always have ever since i was youngling i trusted in the force those names on the list they're a test and i believe i will succeed i like your confidence a journey like this one can challenge you in ways you've never been before i understand i think i'm ready we've got your back call yeah you and me we're unstoppable together don't you think kid huh the man is in greed every time perfect landing you could say that ever piloted a ship before no mostly just scrapper transports in vraka oh kid you got to get in the cockpit sometime feel the controls in your hands and the galaxy in your grasp oh it's unbelievable sounds good let me know when huh no not mine not the manners no way i'm just saying you should try it sometime but with someone else's [ __ ] hey so there's stormtroopers here either must have cleared out to search for the tomb that's good for us but the cave will be crawling with them i'll do what i can to monitor their movement something about this doesn't feel right the empire doesn't give up ground i know i feel it too watch yourselves okay that's the way all right after all the crazy things we've done you know it look up there cowards [Music] you're gonna regret being here just come out shouldn't have come here uh [Music] so i'm the target i'm gonna get him get up we'll here you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] need you to charge the speedy zephony and skull killed in some kind of horrifying disaster while [Music] hey pd let's go it's that's so much better unfortunately the same is true for our vessel despite the damage i recommend we see this through together you know i'm not one to back down from a fight so [Music] so help me [Music] nina says [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] you cannot provided think you can help me [Music] general are you injured i'm fine commander where where is marsup where is my padawan my man is scouting the wreckage now we'll find him [Music] i'm getting a transmission now probably the squad oh hang on it's from the supreme chancellor [Music] foreign um got something to help me pro droid they're watching spd um [Music] [Music] um [Music] so [Music] [Applause] all squads are ready commander was killed by a lightsaber just what we needed i think we're getting close i noticed it earlier this feeling in the pit of my stomach at first i thought it was griez's cooking now it's getting even stronger i think the closer we are the worse i feel you can't mean anything good [Music] look [Music] he's yes [Music] wow help speedy you want to climb up a zip line [Music] this motor should do the trick how does it feel there's got to be a way to the tomb now think you can help me petey [Music] come on let's get him okay he moved we'll beat you [Music] aim at fire let's get him it's just me captain i think we found a way in a stormtrooper used these while scouting the area looks like he may have found a way into the tomb ready for another stem and there we go [Music] wow [Music] oh jedi not enough cut down thanks bd [Music] a worker left their tools in a hurry they were anxious to locate relics but also careless of the history buried here hey so my men will double their efforts we'll get inside officer crane how predictable oh yes i know your name your past and most importantly about cordova tell me where did he hide the holocron outstanding [Music] i'm disappearing fine move faster [Music] [Music] that will be [Music] you can't run forever [Music] ugh you're learning not quite as gifted as says last apprentice but not bad you've been keeping count i'm surprised you didn't tell you sarah was never good at keeping secrets and you know her so well huh she was weak cracked in an imperial torture chair surrendered the location of her naive padawan they would never have found me [Music] if it wasn't for her she betrayed me you're a driller in the flesh i won't let you manipulate me so sure are you when faced with a choice to protect herself or her padawan she chose self-interest she'll sell you out too well i can handle myself can you afford to take that chance your new master harbours great darkness the look on her face when she saw what they had done to me as i am now she turned exposing her true nature she used the dark side she cut herself off from the force oh how long before she cracks and betrays you too is that who you want beside you when you find the holocron what would jaro to paul say you have no right to mention his name i wonder what would he think if he could see his padawan now skulking in the shadows with a betrayer granting her access to a legion of impressionable students i won't let anyone touch them [Music] i thought the same thing was thanks for the help back there vd you saved my life and got us closer to the tune [Music] we found it feels different than the other tomb i don't know i don't like it i found it but i see her why didn't you tell me because she's a liar you how i rerouted communication the moment you tried to contact her slicing encrypted transmissions was always a past time of hers she taught me once there's no technique sarah has that i haven't perfected [Music] [Music] stay back jedi yes let me see my friend these devices appear to simulate this planet's gravitational pull i can't help but see it as a motif you're running out of time for what my scouts located an artifact of interest at the rear of this tomb even now i'm studying it learning his secrets it seems cordova was rather taken because perhaps enough to hide the holocron amongst their boats yeah we'll see how much you learn keep your distance i've got him shoot him down i'll be blocking everything i'm sure am i even close to hitting him [Music] [Music] we're never getting across this gap better double back and tell the squad [Music] hmm afraid to face me yourself had your droid not intervened i would have killed you with ease it's okay buddy just ignore her [Music] they're coming it's our job to trail you you're not scary you're not getting out of here alive i found my next victim so [Music] i feel [Music] huh huh huh yes imagine the artifacts the empire would have missed if it weren't for yours sure it's worth the cost i hear project auger came at a high price storm troopers and workers expendable resources you're a monster i am what made me i see you jedi can't stop me forever [Music] yes got him already you are leaving here alive [Music] i've taken the artifact back to my ship for analysis doesn't matter what you steal you'll never understand it yet you do you'll find out soon enough i'll take those odds uh uh [Music] so [Music] i noticed something while examining the sarcophagus it's a very convenient location to dispose of nuisances you lured me here was this your plan all along you truly have the wits of a scrapper [Music] [Music] candy don't let him escape to the jedi [Music] padawan where is the force everywhere it is within me it surrounds me just so it connects you there will be times when emotion pain or exhaustion trick you will feel cut off isolated this is an illusion your lightsaber lies there out of reach but you remain connected through the force feel that energy around you and summon your weapon [Music] force forces within you around you connecting you to your weapon [Music] relax padawan you must ignore all destruction [Music] force is with me it connects us yeah i think so [Music] [Music] you survived not part of your plan luckily i always allow contingencies get ready come on [Music] [Music] we don't even have to try here you cannot bypass this outpost aah we'll take you down mind helping me out [Music] this was an offering to the stage buried here the time was considered precious you're quick yes [Music] it's your turn the jedi here huh i got it you won't escape [Music] ah foreign nice throw beady um could use a little healthy good job find something my friend what i found here is disconcerting this was lit as a sign of respect and reverence for the sage buried here foreign uh remains of a zephyr soldier they were killed for stealing an offering to the sage hmm here it is i have finally found an intact representation of this sacred zepho artifact my friend look closely this is mitchell at the vault unbegunner you can see an object in their hand based on this imagery i believe this object allows a force wielder to perceive the mysteries of the fork this is the key and the guy the zepho-astrium but who would destroy images of it and why requires more research however our next step is clear find an astrium if any still exist in astrium you ever heard of it me neither pretty key yeah i understand that looks like we know what we have to find [Music] so [Music] [Music] very good padawan you've cleared the way what are you talking about i needed this tomb raised and now that i have what i need you're of no use to me can you reverse what she's done thanks hope this new encryption keeps dropping good the probe droid processing unit what's it like hacking other droids anyway yeah i'd feel weird about hacking people too for a good cause though right [Music] feeling okay we should check in with the mantis shrila probably knows where they are you sure that comes fixed they're not answering something's wrong we need to get back nobody around think it's some kind of trap seems like we've been walking into a lot of them lately wait do you hear that [Music] we've got an intruder here i'll end this quick [Music] um [Music] identify yourself you're mine i won't let you escape so can i guess the md1 [Music] never thought i'd be so happy to see a crate it fits thank you [Music] here it comes oh you're in trouble here it comes ugh [Music] pd where are we [Music] 81 [Music] little buddy where are you bd gotta find a way out of here wherever here is is that a power cable something back there that did it here's cold stale might be deep underground [Music] that did something door opened up let's see if i can find a way out of here feels like i'm being watched that's not good right pd beauty one is that you i found you are you okay let's get you out of there hey oh i'm happy to see you too let's get that restraining pulled off of you [Music] more droids let's get out of here before the same happens to us think you can handle this speedy what would i do without you it's got power now need you to charge the speedy hear that sounds like someone is home after all hey i recognize this band [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and who are you who am i baby i'm the boss of this operation you have greasy forearms to thank for bringing us together i will as soon as we get out of here we have a special challenger for you tonight an enforcer from a ban gone era a jedi let's see what he's got oh somebody can baby his toy show i'll give you a show [Music] tonight we celebrate those fallen challengers of the past and the great sacrifice they made to make us all maybe you should come down and face me yourself i'm too busy counting my credits this is not your day before jenna so impressive jedi this is something else the best is yet to come i believe you know our next challenge perhaps what did he just do oh that's it now bd what did he just do [Applause] it's is no escape i will chase you across the galaxy if i have to [Applause] hey greece you're famous down there yeah they're an ugly group huh they smell like used droid oil at least they're okay yeah a complication we could have avoided luckily we found him we have another complication the empire knows about the holocron that's not good the entire mission is now at risk and i had a nice chat with the second sister trilla what did she tell you she told me she told me you betrayed her to the empire is it true she'll say anything to jeopardize this mission is it true she was my apprentice before the purge you should have told me we're getting an encrypted message from kashyyyk [Music] cal we found tarfal and he is willing to meet you but that's not all the empire overran our position at the refinery saw retreated off-world some of us have joined the wookie fighters in the forests be careful you too wow later later we have our lead okay this is fine everything is gonna be fine [Music] hey kid hey oh my god can we talk can we talk i don't know what's going on between you and her i mean i figure it's some kind of jedi thing but i don't think this is the right time for not any of your business i think it's my business and we're all in this together aren't we hey cal i made a mistake and i almost got you killed i'm sorry may we all make mistakes right or maybe not you hey why don't you cut us some slack i'm not saying do it for me but you two are the best thing that ever happened in my life before you came along all i cared about was a tight hand on a stiff eater that's a game term i know what it is cal life's not a game before you two all i cared about was myself easy money now it's different ready to go [Music] anyone else hear that weird noise earlier i didn't hear anything but my meditation helps me focus out many distractions i don't know it's not a normal sound the manus makes sounded like it came from inside too like a stowaway they'd have to be pretty small greens this ship isn't that big maybe it could be i have been missing some food lately weird smells oh detroit smell not that i'm aware of and they definitely don't eat all right i'll do more investigating if i find something i'll let you know can't wait all right kid sit down we're here i'm busy i got to figure out what to cook next let's talk later cam normally i wouldn't waste my time with the likes of insurgents but i'm looking for a jedi

we're supposed to meet tarpon [Music] glad you made it this is chieftain tarfal i'm on a mission from master ino cordova who was looking for a zepho artifact finding it could help save the jedi [Music] cordova found wisdom at the top of the origin tree you should seek answers there it's massive i don't even know where to start well you might be able to find a way up through its root system but most of it's underwater you'll need this breather thank you what will you all do now the only thing we can keep fighting good luck hope we meet again [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh mm-hmm have i mentioned to you how awesome this is because you're pretty great [Music] [Music] you uh not even tarfl can keep them out forever they won't stop until everyone's wiped out [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] those things give me the creeps whoa strong words coming from you [Music] jedi warm up i'll let you win traitor hmm do you think the empire were to come after kashyyyk so hard if we hadn't intervened the jedi are supposed to be symbols of hope but i led the inquisition here maury and tarf will put their trust in me did i just endanger them again [Music] the inquisitor [Applause] [Music] he's on the move [Music] a worthy challenge [Music] hmm what's this a bronco scrap rat playing jedi i told the grand inquisitor you wouldn't be stupid enough to show your face here again especially after we wiped out that feeble resistance love it when i'm wrong [Music] much better [Music] hmm what is that thing night sister's searching we should call one second thought she listens to their transmissions better find out on her own [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] speedy [Music] [Music] uh for generations the wookies made a pilgrimage to the top the tree guided them ugh good scam bd fastest huh we all know if it's friendly that's the thing that took down tonight's sister [Music] [Music] ah get up try again just keep failing master do you good keep failing keep getting back up that is the only way to succeed do not allow yourself to be weighed down by ego and pretense let go of what you fear to lose and rise up now again good now reach my position you can do it just got to keep getting back up edie as long as we get back up we're still in this fight i'm finally back to where i was before the purge before master depaul died [Music] [Music] [Music] it's hurt i think we can help it to the sky [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] this fell from a wookie as they climbed the tree some type of test [Music] [Music] [Music] making a new friend [Music] oh from the clone wars war never ended here everything we did did any of it matter uh [Music] uh yeah [Music] no we have to be careful i don't want to spook it hey it's okay we're

could do they're giving us a lift [Music] there's still so much the empire hasn't touched [Music] let's look [Music] looking for something at last i found my quarry the astrium used by the sephora sages millennia ago i hold in my hand a piece of galactic history [Music] or i will never be able to thank toffel enough do you know what this means my friend no need to return to darth darkness clouded every attempt at finding the astrium inside kujit's tomb but the force the force has provided a new path kuch's tomb no found you again you're done hurting this world i don't know what's got second sister thinking you're so important she likes her souvenirs but i'm not in it for the memories and honestly you're not worth my time so let's make this quick [Music] are we fighting or what [Music] come back here not bad for trash what about for a jedi is there a difference ah [Music] stem [Music] [Music] getting woozy bring the pain help petey aren't you enjoying this video [Music] this scared of getting burned i need help is that all you got [Music] it's over being an inquisitor taught me no setback is too great when you've already lost yourself a limb's easy you know i was a jedi it'd be fun to bring you in watch you look like the rest of us oh angers you just wait till the isolation torture mutilation i won't let you touch them you can't stop the empire i can stop you [Music] just took down an inquisitor i thought you were dead [Music] glad you're okay we should get back see your angries are expecting us huh get [Music] i can't ready anymore take him down [Music] moving to

[Music] [Music] cordova believe the key to the vault is on dathomir you find your wookie yep things are bad down there empire's everywhere inquisitors ultrilla the second sister is gone for now but she's still chasing us i defeated the ninth sister cal and i was captured by the empire i resisted i swore to myself that i would die before i would talk but then this dark shadow came and he was worse than any nightmare i could have imagined and i still fought but in the end i came apart and i gave them trella and i know there's nothing i can do to make that right but cal there's still a chance we can save the others on the holocron hey look the ninth sister said something about becoming an inquisitor like like it's inevitable but you went through the same thing she did and you didn't join them cal it's okay sir we'll find cordova's holocron hey get your lasers off my lunch [Music] where to next [Music] wait a minute you want to go to dathomir i'm surprised cordova went there he must have had good reason i am staying put on the mantis once we arrive red sunlight cannot be good for your skin this place used to be home to a powerful cabal of force wielders known as the night sisters they used the force what like jedi no these witches served only themselves their powers focused on deception illusion manipulation sounds like someone i used to know during the clone wars the night sisters made a deal with a sith lord who betrayed their trust in the end they were nearly wiped out in a massacre dathomir is a deadly place we should be careful don't have to tell me twice ah coming up on our creepy destination grab some seed kid on the ship indoors i got walls i got jedi i'm fine yeah hey cow you and her is everything all right i need a second so looks like sorktormo really wants a piece of you you don't know the half of it kid how'd you ever get involved with that guy look i didn't grow up with much i mean i had my great-grandmother to lean on but that's it you had to know it wouldn't end well with gangsters like the hexian brood cal we ain't all jedi most of us got to scrape by and occasionally make some bets we wish we hadn't i understand you can count on me if the brood comes after you again yeah thanks cal cal you have a moment you've come a long way since bronco but the path is far from over i want you to know the difficult challenges ahead i can handle it i know what you can do i'm not denying that and i know what has to be done i've done it before cal even the strongest of jedi i'm not trilla i'll be fine i know you're not i didn't say that i'm not asking you to say anything it's okay sir really just be safe cal that's all good thing we weren't standing there what is that thing count on him being friendly oh uh draw stem what's this [Music] this door's not budging [Music] i'm feeling weak [Music] uh huh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hmm um foreign tonight sister practicing her craft [Music] [Music] rudy a warning looks like the zephyl were here strange this place seems abandoned but you trespass jedi you must be a night sister i had heard you're all dead not all dos amir is forbidden to you leave at once well

hide it that would explain your survival who are you no interfere just a traveler studying the nature of distinct cultures dead philosophies you study the night sisters i study many things what yes that night sister or she was only a child and the war came to this world she had to watch her whole family perish what do you know about those ruins agent beyond belief the night sister and her warrior kin were seduced by the power that lurks within the ruin or suffer the same thing how do you know so much about the night sister observation i've seen many things since coming here what does that mean must it mean something too many great minds have gone astray in pursuit of order i gotta get going [Music] [Music] this mind helping me out oh great timing someone was drawn to something here energy from the ruins [Music] so [Music] oh an outsider looks climable but not without equipment die you'll run in the swamp can't believe we made it you sure know how to have fun uh you will go no further stand aside no he was right about you who what jedi are thieves and selfish liars who bring nothing but death back off if you attack me again i'll strike you down oh i won't do a scene but my murdered sisters they will have the revenge hey more undead leave this place [Music] [Music] uh yes you will pay for their death [Music] [Music] how does that night sister keep following us sierra called them force wielders i've never seen it used this way before we better stay on our toes wait do you have toes any idea what that flying creature is let's hope we don't find out foreign [Music]

okay enough for this who are you really taran malachos former jedi like yourself we have much in common i doubt that oh we both survived the purge my troops betrayed me i was forced to strike them down and i escaped to this desolate place the darkness here it almost took me but i conquered it you're the one the night brothers follow yes or these savages only respect strength and as we both know the force is a most powerful ally now you use the force to seize power that's that's everything the jedi stood against dark times they will consume us if we do not stand with each other [Music] i don't need your help that broken lightsaber has a different tail you saw something in there didn't you something terrible [Music] there are many such places here in davomir [Music] join my family i can teach you how to control its power join my family and i will teach you to control the power familiar words malikos sister marin you overstep your bounds for years you said the jedi orchestrated the massacre that killed my sisters yet here one stands and you seek only to bring him into your family you were told to deal with it clearly you lack the power little witch power you are mad marikos has unmade you and my misplaced loyalty has allowed you to lead the knight brothers astray unlike the jedi the night sisters of dothramir do not turn on their kind our bone is eternal your sisters are dead yes their graves are all around you time to go [Music] [Music] foolish girl this power is beyond your control when you face one night sister of darth amir you face her soul hello [Music] [Music] so you can jump high see her see her tell grace to get the mantis running what's happening a night sister she raised the dead they're after me whoa whoa whoa and you're leading them here captain prepare for takeoff [Music] [Music] [Music] get us out of here what'd you do kid i got dead witches crawling all over my ship just go [Music] what happened did you find the tomb your master's lightsaber i saw him bastard to paul i i saw the day he died i saw what i did now it's destroyed i couldn't save him cal you were only a child no i know i could have helped him if i'd been stronger and braver if i would have listened to him i could have helped him i know it cal it's time i told you everything that happened to me when i escaped the empire they brought shirley in the room and when i saw her eyes they showed me what i had caused she was an inquisitor and something in me gave and i lost all control and i tapped into the dark side and i killed them all every last one of them except for her and for years i couldn't forgive myself i was a wreck because i had all this rage and i tried pushing it down but there was no hiding from myself and all i wanted to do was die but then i learned about the holocron a spark of hope that there could be a future that we could move on get up i can't change what i did no more than you can change what happened to your master it's in the past but cal you have to make a choice to move on how you're gonna start with this you are going to build a new one [Music] [Music] cal you will be tested yeah but i'm ready i don't mean just here every jedi faces the dark side and it's very easy to fail you're still struggling with the dark side even after cutting yourself off from the force we will always struggle but that is the test it's the choice to keep fighting that makes us who we are [Music] i guess it's about time i find out who i am [Music] [Music] this is the jedi temple it's been a while but yeah i remember every jedi comes here as a kid or they did i wonder where jedi [Music] looks like a way through over there i'll be careful with the ice [Music] [Music] so [Music] this is the worst blizzard i've ever seen the storm the temple bell feels connected somehow [Music] uh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] so [Music] the great jedi meditated here he returned at points throughout his life to contemplate his many adventures and trials [Music] good job eddie yeah it used to be beautiful the warmth is nice i remember this room master yoda melted that door to let us into the caves not with a force with that crystal the light passed through it and carried its warmth i bet we can do it too [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow got something [Music] [Music] so [Music] there's heat coming from those cracks under water but it's freezing up here i can feel it it's calling to me we must be close [ __ ] i can't pick any camper crystal it chooses you [Music] [Music] hey pd let's go just a little shake it'll be okay [Music] let's hope it holds [Music] [Music] close one call's getting stronger let's hurry [Music] i feel like i'm surrounded by ghosts [Music] oh i'm not all right [Music] it's hard to be here thanks buddy how did they find us here yes [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] where did you last see him he was heading into the caves he called up but i couldn't find him [Music] [Music] uh [Music] a young wing dropped this during her test she was so scared of failing brings back some memories that's it i can see it shiny [Music] [Music] through there i can feel it we're almost out of here i promise [Music] don't come any closer [Music] [Music] [Music] trust me [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] no [Music] it's over failure is not the end my friend [Music] that's good yes goodbye the time has come this may be the last you see of me i can sense the doom of the jedi order is upon us no failure is not the end it is the necessary part of the path hope will always survive in those who continue to fight like you petey one [Music] i believe you will find someone just as brave and persistent as you have been and you will help them as you have helped me but your memory will be completely lost are you sure you want to do this [Music] beginning total memory encryption only with a trusted connection with your memories be restored believe in you as i always have and i believe in whom you choose to replace me [Music] goodbye old friend your memories you wish them for me i believe in you too puppy [Music] yeah you're right there's still a chance [Music] there's always a chance [Music] come on [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it beware you [Music] jedi will not quit he's gonna get me [Music] down the intruder yes better catch up [Music] some help please [Music] i think you can handle this speedy [Music] always on point [Music] clutching incompetent [Music] price [Music] yes [Music] [Music] do your magic bd it's here we need to get out of here they've taken over illinois are you all right no they spotted me and that's not all they're mining kyber crystals captain prepare for takeoff [Music] [Music] what [Music] jedi warm up you and me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] look above us yep i think he's trying to run [Music] [Music] get the jedi [Music] after the jedi trivial opposition inferior jedi [Music] your eyes of surviving are [Music] [Music] what low much for you you're lighting up imperial channels they're sending everything they've got at you are you in greece safe we're laying low but the storm's clearing we won't have any cover soon what about disguising the mantis signal that trick only works if they're not expecting it i have another idea [Music] hmm i've sliced through their encryption i'm scrambling transmissions but it won't be long before they're restored hopefully it'll buy us some time thank you there's stormtroopers everywhere kill them with our planet cow don't let them forget that [Music] he's [Music] [Music] stop resisting [Music] they've broken through and called reinforcements every star destroyer in the sector is on their way here if they get here before you do no we didn't come all this way to get captured i'll be there see her we've got company tell greece to close the mantis what with the empire on your tail are you crazy kid trust me we do we'll close the ship hit me [Music] yes you did it [Music] we did i wouldn't be here without all of you i used to sit on bronco dreaming about storming coruscant with survivors from the jedi council instead the orders hopes rest on a gambler a fallen jedi and a failed padawan a bunch of screw-ups you can say that again it is the only reliable one he let cordova wipe his memory so he could stay behind and guide us but you're both willing to sacrifice everything to keep going even when it seems impossible failure's a part of the journey i get that now thank you all of you hey wasn't there a gigantic crash ship on zepho think there's any good loot in that thing [Music] that's amir who wants to go there death in you huh it's time i faced him yes you're ready to face your past what about you and trilla i don't know if i'll ever be ready you know what you need to do to start healing and i'm so proud of you for that i have my own path i'm here for you if you need me all right kids sit down we're here [Music] we'll be fine we'll be fine uh ah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] can't feel it could use some help buddy that did the trick foreign master you were wrong to return here unarmed not unarmed you think that lightsaber proves you a jedi no chasing you memories that have haunted me since braca i won't run from them anymore then let us see what manner of death your courage brings show me what you are truly capable of the answer i will never forget the losses become a part of me it will honor your teaching and your sacrifice remember persistence reveals the path there's so [Music] we shouldn't be here this place is cursed don't be scared remember we have a deal you promised to teach me your magics [Music] fallen sisters this man has promised to grant us our vengeance but only if i teach him our magic forgive me i must ally with malikos [Music] [Music] you chose to return brave but not wise maybe marin right i'm calcus what you were told about the jedi was not true so you say cow maliko said many things too tara malacos might have been part of my order but what he is now i have no idea [Music] all i do know is having a lightsaber isn't what makes you a jedi [Music] then what does we were peacekeepers we were betrayed by those we protected hunted down by the empire i i might be one of the last of my kind [Music] i was only a child when they attacked an armored warrior brandishing this descended upon us and cut down my people my sisters until i was left alone with the dead then malikos came and promised me revenge if i shared our secrets with him in return i know what it's like to lose everything and malaccos was wrong to use that against you we don't have to be enemies [Music] we will need this there she goes again i'll be watching let's get out of here monico's lies ahead you could turn back i can't lives are at stake whose lives innocence force sensitive children who will be hunted down and murdered as we were nice my friend i have never been one to shy away from the pursuit of knowledge something terrible happened here a massacre they killed their own kind for promises of power [Music] welcome home let's begin your training what in these ruins temps you so i could ask you the same thing there is power there beyond jedi understanding power i control i would offer you the same thing don't you understand i'm not interested in power i want to restore the order restore the jedi order [Music] are you poor fool it's over jedi fell long before the purge who stifled my tradition deafened by our past glories blinded by endless war maybe but it's never over malachos we stand here now the chance to learn to rebuild from our mistakes jedi learn there's no future for them how can you not see that it's time for something new you and me we can build something different something better no [Music] and that's amir will be your grave [Music] [Music] lucky hicks [Music] [Music] a little help edie totally useless try that again [Music] fight me [Music] i was wrong to think you could stand with me you have no right to drop the mirror no right to our magic you're not dead yet [Music] [Music] you are not powerful enough buddy [Music] i already felt that a little help bud [Music] see padawan i am [Music] uh [Music] let him lie in the dark with his secrets until death takes him why'd you help me to rid of the mirror of that parasite [Music] what are you really doing here calcus the ones who built this tomb the zepho they created an object called the astrium it opens a vault on a distant planet inside is a list of four sensitive children across the galaxy but the empire is looking for it too what empire the empire the one bent on exterminating force sensitive so no one can stand against it then it will come for dathomir before long as the war did i will help you find this astrium this place it's [Music] so [Music] [Music] we finally found it it is real marin this could be the key to the next generation of jedi i'm happy for you and you're jedi but nothing can bring back my people [Music] after the purge [Music] i was alone for a long time in hiding i was i was scared that they found out who i was or what i was what changed a very good friend of mine told me to go out and find my place in the galaxy and you listen well no but life has this funny way of forcing you on the path forward anyway now here i am i at least expect it a path forward i will join you you will [Music] i've spent years waiting for a chance to avenge my sisters i'm finished waiting [Music] i wish to fight by your side night sisters and jedi do not travel together but survivors we adapt yeah yeah i guess we do what do you think bd i agree [Music] my crew they might take a little bit of convincing them then we'll convince them [Music] so so [Music] there's no way forward you were testing me and you passed congratulations are you gonna help me with this thank you i need help this woman you travel with who is she see her wait how do you know about her i have seen your companions malikos wanted me to attack them but they posed no threat i see her um well she used to be a jedi it's a long story i would [Music] i'll meet you at your ship uh uh [Music] [Music] [Music] you found it whoa who's this what's that supposed to mean it means i'll be joining you see her grease this is marin she's a witch isn't she a night sister your fear is unnecessary i couldn't have gotten the astrium without her we fought malachos together i trust her and we trust you you will have to earn it okay fine grab some seed i didn't try anything funny welcome aboard they like you [Music] i don't know what you're saying let's go see what we can find [Music] you know even after all the action you two bring i still get a thrill watching the games yeah as long as you keep your habits in check oh yeah no of course i'm i'm just a spectator no gambling or nothing going on really yeah we're talking pure entertainment nothing gets me going more than watching a couple slubs square off just slick moves brute force captain i am slightly troubled by your enthusiasm for something so barbaric oh yeah i mean it is true totally barbaric but still kind of entertaining so now kid it's time to land you think it'll work it worked for cordova you can make it work she's right oh hey is anybody hungry i was thinking of whipping up some scar steaks i'm sorry am i interrupting no captain and we couldn't have gotten this far without you oh all right it's true grease thank you hey i hope you get in there and you find that hollow thing holocron are you sure it's something you should find what do you mean the children on that list should take them from their homes to train as jedi won't they be hunted like you it has to be kept out of the hands of the empire it'll help us put an end to the empire oh hey uh change of plans we're arriving oh please yeah i take my sticker air huh okay now we're cooking [Music] so uh there's something weird about this place the energy is different here yeah it's different than dathomir yes damir is intricate its ancient power emanates from the shadows bogano feels more simplistic and yet i can't figure it out the ghana was special there's a reason the zeppo built their vault here where your holocron waits hidden what are you getting at this planet has remained nearly untouched for centuries were the lives you seek to protect really in danger before you intervened we're definitely not on dathomir anymore no we are not is it how you imagined the rest of the galaxy i mean it is so vast i see now my life on dothanier was limited i felt the same way about leaving baraka the world can feel small when you're trapped by the past i think i will like my time aboard the mantis hey oh wait up i know you're about to get that hollow cron nice you remembered you joining me oh no no absolutely not no i just wanted to say you know those those kids were supposed to find they're lucky to have you they're lucky to have us we're in this together grease i'd be lying if i said i wasn't hoping you'd say that because you know they're gonna need more than fancy magic tricks oh yeah practical guidance role model someone to look up to you know ship flying's a complicated art but that's only if i stick around i remember that good good okay good luck buddy got a second you've been through a lot to get here but the vault is still an unknown cordova put the holocron inside that's what's important i have to get it cordova built danger into this test to protect it you're worried about me i don't want to train all those young ladies alone i'll be fine sir plus i've got bd with me i know just be careful this might be unlike anything you two have faced before thanks we're ready the both of us take care of each other oh hi there [Music] huh yes i'm sensing something weird this is gonna sound strange but i think it's the astrium the closer we get to the vault the stronger it feels careful buddy we still don't know how this thing works here we go bd [Music] amazing the vault itself is built like a giant holocron we're close let's check it out [Music] i offer this record of our civilization to those who will follow despite our wisdom and technological achievement we face extinction dogma blinded us to the path of balance and gradually we allowed our pride to corrupt us the greater control we sought the further we found it i need the randoms of my people into the great unknown hoping that we will finally find peace i shall teach them the ways of the force master we shall begin with physical preparation what is the force the other round everyone master kessius do you think the empire will find us [Music] thank you it's the empire the inquisitors have found us master shall we fight them [Music] they're coming to the trenches keep going protect yourself [Music] capture the younglings kill the rest [Music] yes sir you can't hide [Music] [Music] surrender now and we may spare the youngest that's right on your [Music] i'm knees what is next for us mr kestis why i don't want to be here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so i had a bad feeling i'd see you here oh how uncharacteristically prescient of you here i thought your greatest virtue was your dogged persistence as you stumbled from one debacle to the next guess who made a mistake not killing me on brock and then i scanned mercy i waged one meaningless padawan against a prize that will win me the emperor's favor you think i'm gonna let you walk away with the holocron of course not we both have our pride but yours has cost you the lives of all the force sensitive children on that list as well as your own like you said trilla i'm persistent weak technique [Music] still running [Music] another [Music] [Music] careful with that thing it's been through hell [Music] don't go we need to stick together no i'm going to lure them away and then i'm going to circle back stay with the young ladies trilla may the force be with you don't leave us what's going to happen it's okay it's okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] chilling [Music] no [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i need a spin buddy suppressing fire [Music] stop come on does not look good he's here i saw what happened between you and trilla like you both went through i'm so sorry i was arrogant i was foolish i could never understand what you went through she has a holocron i don't know where she's taking it i'm responsible for the path that trilla is on and what she does next is the cost of all of my mistakes our mistakes are in the past and it's all of our responsibility and it's about what we do next that's important you taught me that's here you're right i know where she's taking it there's a fortress where they take jedi where the inquisitors come from it's a place of torture it's the place i escaped i just never thought i'd be going back there i won't be going alone i'll have a friend with you no i'll have a jedi with me neil [Music] [Music] by the right of the council by the will of the force calcus rise jedi knight [Music] you are ready so are you [Music] [Music] [Music] this cordova guy is really putting some wear and tear on my ship he always wanted to explore the whole galaxy and did you we explored many planets tombs and temples related to the zepho and jedi but i hit a limit to him there was no limit the poor crazy old guy was left alone he was always alone even when i was with him who cared about his work in the future or anything else he didn't have the time it was always on the move ghana was the first place i ever saw that looked like he settled even for a brief moment get over here kid we're about to land this isn't good with the defenses they got our usual tricks just aren't gonna cut it i can help what are you thinking a ritual it will hide the ship i hope a ritual she has a knack for this kind of stuff what hol wait wait a minute no hold on now what is this going to require a sacrifice one of your arms will do nicely wait what don't be so serious join me up front [Music] [Music] sisters mother lend me your strength sisters mother lend me your strength whatever she's doing it's working what do you think the odds are my money's on you kid let's go buddy once we're inside i'll engage their defense level and then sabotage their sensors so the mantis can extract us you find the holocron shall we stick together i feel the pull the lives of every child on that list are at stake whatever happens in there and whatever you see don't worry about me just get it and get out closer on the fortress it's time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] world so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] airlock
