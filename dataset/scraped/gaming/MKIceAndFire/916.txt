once i wrote the history of sushima i right of the battle for its survival something cruel something horrible threatens the people of our island the ghosts of our fallen samurai have returned all from another world to save us [Music] when the mongols landed on our shores they unleashed a terrible host of oni upon the land these demons were a threat to our very souls and the ghosts of sushi rose to fight it some say there is only one ghost but in fact there are many first i will tell you of the samurai we fought for their honor family and home [Music] so samurai do not know fear and bravely meet any challenge but defense is just as important as an attack uh some attacks cannot be blocked so warriors learn how to dodge these blows the ghosts carry many tools of war can i interrupt f4 the spear can be defeated with proper [Music] training the ghosts strike the drums to call for the commies aid samurai are capable of channeling the power of kami through their katana draining their opponent's life [Music] the most skilled samurai master the ultimate expression of explosive force ghosts are not idle in their victories but purposeful in the expression of their achievements feel my place samurai fight for honor legacy and their noble lords the history books are filled with the heroic feats of these courageous warriors hunters are one with the bow they slay oni from across the battlefield with a single well-placed arrow some say the ghosts possess abilities far beyond our own they are able to focus their senses and detect an enemy's presence from afar when they control the high ground hunters arraigned death on all their foes ghosts claim valuable resources from the dead it is said the ghosts can scale sheer cliffs with inhuman speed in these times of war stories of the ghosts inspire villagers warriors and lords across tsushima some have begun leaving gifts as tribute a hunter delivers varying attacks with their arrows some arrows pierce the thickest armor while others contain the spirit of the fire coming hey hunters create arrowheads made of lightning to stun their foes never saw it they focus their aim so multiple arrows fired at once still hit their mark while the hunters strike from a distance assassins creep close to kill their victims without a sound assassins are shadows in the night they abandoned the samurai code for the art of stealth and deception [Music] assassins stalk unseen through the grass hidden from their enemies until they strike a skilled assassin can end lives like a whisper in the night the ghosts often take to rooftops and avoid the gaze of watchful guards they fly quietly from roof to roof as if carried by light winds they've lied across ropes and rigging with effortless grace all to line up the perfect kill and visit death upon them assassins can vanish into the air becoming invisible spirits able to inflict the ultimate surprise an oh greatest skill is to become an unstoppable force of death moving like lightning between foes assassins are both respected and feared for creating a new art of war based on stealth and adaptability one final ghost fills our stories with heroic deeds the ronin fought for the people and the spirits of tsuchima these warriors heal their allies and some say can even raise the dead [Music] all ghosts work as a team to develop the ideal plan of attack help me with this let's go on when their ghost falls in battle their allies and ghosts mark important locations for their allies to find ghosts can summon the spirits of kami to aid them in battle we're stronger together may be masterless but they do not fight alone in times of great need ronin heal their wounded allies [Music] huh the ghosts fight side by side against the evil that threatens our home awakened by mongol hordes who ravage our sea and shore on these slaughter old villages demons descend from the mountains and haunted spirits rise from ancient graves fushima needs these heroes now

and terrible power but what this power was a ghost did not know for now their only hope was to find the twins alive a mongol cart traveled up the road escorted by foes protecting mysterious cargo [Music] could take that one oh um don't shoot [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] with their enemies slain the ghosts were free to search the cart [Music] inside they made a grisly discovery human

the mongols targeted divine artifacts and how the ghosts rose to stand in their way as the ghost neared they were met by a single monk over here a mongol scout was pulling this cut he ran to warn his friends when he spotted me as the ghosts knew a scout meant more mongols were near they're coming please don't let them defile the temple grounds another group of mongols appeared intent on killing them out yes suddenly charged at the ghost the demon's eyes were as red and fiery as its massive shield uh the ghost ran to hell there's another though there were many stolen relics the statue was nowhere to be found like the statue it's sacred to our people the ghost continued searching below the temple easy [Music] the ghosts discovered the rest of the caravan's guards [Music] oh it's here but where were they taking it along with this statue the ghosts found a map with the path the mongols were taking i know that area on the map i'll show you the way many believe temple statues hold great power sometimes even containing the spirit of akami other times that of a demon the ghosts arrived at the first marked location on the map and planned their attack if the map is right the mongols will pass this way soon uh [Music] um huh um they're coming get ready [Music] oh the ghosts defeated mongol and demon alike but more enemies were on the horizon the ghosts heard the rest of the caravan approaching um your soul time they had no cuts with them perhaps the things they stole have already been taken ahead research oni found many ways to travel between the heavenly realms some even convinced humans to release them from their prisons the ghost reached their final location on their map in the umugi swampland i dare not go any further it's up to you now [Music] kill them if you wish [Music] for centuries countless statues and relics littered the grounds stolen from the temples oh [Music] met the ghosts in battle eager to protect the stolen statues and relics eager to

eye or even today some claim they feel the power of oni pushing against their prisons eager to enter our world once more thanks [Music] relax for a moment listen to these tales what legend would you like to hear this is a tale of how the ghosts fought man and spirit alike a mongol named sukhmatar had found a way to enslave the dead before they could be reborn he hoped to create an invincible army that would allow him to easily conquer sushima with every enemy he killed tsukubata gained an obedient soldier the ghosts felt the heat from the rising flames the dead littered the ground bloodied and terrified a mongol called out for help he believes we are too weak to kill us all and control our spirits [Music] through the fog came the spirits of the recently slain they stepped over their own corpses to attack the ghosts bye [Music] let the spirits rest their mongols hand a scroll outlining the path of sukhovathar's army the ghosts set out in pursuit somehow zooka had found a way to create unreal vengeful spirits they followed his every order mongol bandit and samurai alike fell under sukhumvatar's control [Music] the ghost followed the path until they came across a small quiet village but the flashes of lightning revealed they were not alone your soul is mine the ghosts found an unfinished offer an emulator meant to keep the spirits away huddles of blood darkened the pure white snow leading out of the village huh bloodstains led toward the window as if someone had crawled there to escape [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] ah hey oh god absolutely [Music] oh tightly in the man's hand was a blood-stained scroll covered in strange symbols the ghosts struggled to make sense of the cryptic writing certain they were linked in some way to the spirits in the distance the ghosts heard the sounds of a mongol patrol approaching your soul is fine the ghosts watched as spirits of slain samurai emerged from the fog to fight their mongols the bodies of the dead mongols bore the insignia of bata their ghosts were on the right track sacrificed allies and friends alike to increase the number of spirits under his control for he desired an army compelled to obey his every whim one that knew no fear and could never retreat the ghosts finally caught up to sukpotter's forces they moved into the burning town eager to free the spirits from his grasp the ghosts sensed overwhelming suffering from a nearby building cloaked [Music] oh yes [Music] the ghosts found the remains of a family burned beyond recognition [Applause] countless innocence brutally impaled pain frozen on the faces the fog around the large building slowly dissipated from the homes on the hill screams pierced the airport the ghosts were angered by the slaughter of the village the spirits vanquished the fog faded [Applause] away [Music] so [Music] uh champion lofted from the nearby docks obscured deep in the fog huh [Music] huh the remaining villages mangled and broken were left to rot in a net like fish the fog around the docks floated slowly down the river [Music] [Music] uh huh ah [Music] [Music] suddenly zuke barter's voice boomed throughout the village come ghosts once you are dead i will display your bodies as a warning to others that even the ghosts are helpless before water hairy footfalls approached the ghosts readied themselves for battle [Music] dreadful warriors had covered his escape the ghosts moved on from the decimated village knowing more would suffer the same fate if sukubata wasn't found and defeated [Music] i have many legends for you to enjoy i'll share any story with you the ghost had defeated many of such her spirits but many more gathered aboard a mighty fleet where they readied a final assault on tsushima the ghosts decided to take over one of these ships and use it to assail sukhpatra's fleets [Music] uh huge fish awesome day there's a target oh they don't see us shadows [Music] with the mongol crew defeated the ghosts set sail down the coast the ghosts needed no crew for they had the help of the kami a strong wind filled their sails and with each passing moment they grew closer to sukhapat after a day's travel the ghost came across a lone ship with its sails up they quietly boated the enemy vessel the ghosts found freshly killed bodies in cages their trapped spirits illuminated by hanging [Music] let's go [Music] oh the final enemy fell a voice cried out from a nearby cage the spirits vanished into the fog but their second ship raced to intercept the ghosts as a fiery bombardment laid down do the ghost supported the enemy ship strange lantern swung on the seemingly but in the fog the ghosts saw the figures of spirits oh the ship grew quiet no more spirits emerged challenged the ghosts they returned to their ship eager to set sail oh the ghost set out to find the rest of the spirit fleet and took part out here there will be nowhere for you to run ghosts the sea is an ant the ghosts made landfall at a known pirate call from all across the seas pirates have gathered eager to serve sukbator for he had promised them riches beyond belief and all of sushima as a safe haven and all the dark led the ghosts deep into a graveyard of ships run aground and on them mongol ronin and banded spirits forced by sukhpatr to fight alongside one another [Music] two [Music] oh the mongol spirits were put to rest and sukbatar's army weakened uh wait a moment [Music] oh [Music] [Music] rid this ship of banded spirits oh oh [Music] ugh the spirits of the ronin were released to the wind uh you haven't won yet the ghosts uh oh shadows his control over the spirits lifted and they departed tsushima the ghosts celebrated their victory but knew they'd face eo herself soon enough [Music] the deeds of the ghosts are many let me share one with you choose and i'll tell it one of my favorites the ghosts arrived at forte mito dake in search of eo's infernal scrolls the demon had delivered these writings to her fathers so they could aid her plans if the ghost would steal this rose they would know eos plants but the fort was guarded by deadly fire spirits didn't think the fire spirits had seen the ghosts the gate slapped shut the ghosts would have to find their way through the wall oh [Music] hmm the gate was shut the path barred the mongols ordered powder to feed the fire spirits but it could also be used against them [Music] with a resounding boom the wooden gate shattered the next courtyard was overrun with guards the fire spirit was destroyed but there was another close by thanks their brothers fallen the remaining fire spirits became enraged unleashing a relentless bombardment of flag destruction once again the path was blocked [Music] the closer the ghosts came to reaching eos plants the more furious the spirits grew some say the fire spirits were created by mongols but it was eo who gave them life infusing them with her fury and rage forging a weapon to destroy those who had wronged her another fire spirit lay crouched in the tower across the courtyard oh the ghosts destroyed another fire spirit another wooden gate blocked the way the ghosts found powder to destroy the gate [Music] huh [Music] the gate is splintered and the way opened the ghosts arrived at barracks eo's infernal scrolls were hidden nearby [Music] those are not for you my warriors will kill you all leo's army would reach tsushima by building oh [Music] that text is sacred i will destroy you for defiling it [Music] the ghost found eo's writings they revealed she was building an army in the blood realms eo's army would reach tsushima by building a bridge having recovered eo's infernal scrolls the ghosts only had to defeat the remaining fire spirits you planned to use an ancient ritual known as hito bashir a blood sacrifice to the gods that strengthened the structure so it would not be broken the ghosts reached the top of the fort and found the iron gate sealed shut [Music] eos forces emerged from a blood portal the gateway to the realm potential oh oh [Music] eo's army made its finals into the shadows god so trying to disappear neo's army was pushed back for a moment and the portal was clear the ghost saw the opportunity to destroy it blood portal was destroyed and with it eo's connection to sushima was severed but the ghosts realized their path was now open they could pursue eo to her realm and stop the onibaba once and for all [Music] the deeds of the ghosts are many let me share one with you you
