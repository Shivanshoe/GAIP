impossible they're just covering their tracks looks like a storm's approaching you and lydia have known each other for a long time right forever yeah that's how it is with me and cam i don't remember whose yard we started playing in first i can't believe i dragged him into this damn can probably handle more than you think so second location should be a mile ahead [Music] ah come on i can't believe we just missed them good it means we got him on the run watch out you cost of evacuating you gotta stop them from tipping kayaks [Music] so [Music] so that's one we can't let these guys tip off high not after tracking him all the way here okay that's all of it hopefully we can still get the drop on kai [Music] this is the last site dom i just hope we're not too late [Music] there's nothing here no he's here all right letty we found kai's hiding place gather the troops we're going in everybody quiet what is it something's not right get back [Music] everyone to your car how are we supposed to catch a speeding train do you want kai or not not to be lame here but what are we supposed to do a train can't run without an engine can't interpose in fighter jets or something even if they scrambled now they'd never make it out here in time so it's just up to the four of us isn't there an interpol rating party or something we are the rating [Applause] everybody spread out somebody really likes their train we gotta stop that gunfire already on it that's one we'll draw their fire get the next one one more to go that's it not gonna pull those off yo cam let's see what you got okay give me a distraction and i'll disable them train's heading into the tunnel we should take that ranch to the left come on let's hope this works hurry up cam relax hacking is an art well art faster do you realize how hard it is to deploy code under these conditions got it he goes in and it turns the lock good job let it get on board find kai i'll stop the engine got it we're gonna jump onto a moving train why you coming i'm not letting kai [Music] escape buddy [Music] [Music] oh my god i got you let's go get caught i can't get close enough to those sentry guns to disable them i got an idea of

whoa my readouts just went down you gotta get this off the train what no we're going after guys it's an eclipse device what the hell is an eclipse device is that the thing jamming our systems how are we gonna stop the train now can disable it without power i can't do anything you've got confidence got it what no kai is mine your vendetta more important than saving millions of lives god damn it we're hurting time more than you realize by taking this believe me i can hurt him more vienna this confirms that the tadakul are supplying the terrorist organization we suspected and that means we know where this device is headed we know where kai is going and we'll catch up to him i promise we don't have time for this it takes two people to uncouple the carriage fine [Music] there it's a maglev we gotta detach the coupling at the same time okay ready three two one watch it they did it let's pick them up hang on v i'm coming to get you hold it still i got you trust me you can do it they'll catch you come on you let him get away look i get it you want to avenge your friend i know how hard it is to lose someone but the device confirms that kai was a supplier for something larger and scarier than you realize try us if you want to slay a beast you got to cut off its head his name is emile elias ormstrid he used to run rockets all over europe back in the 60s blackmail extortion murder for hire but never prosecuted never caught witnesses had a funny way of turning up in the morgue about 20 years ago he moved his operations to america and claimed to go legit but hobbes found evidence he was involved with owen shaw in the search for nightshade components and he's been making some new connections what does this orange shirt have to do with that device we've got someone on the inside with his current crew and we know he's been trying to get his hands on eclipse since we stole it from him though it means kai will be heading to ormstrid empty-handed and that's a meeting
