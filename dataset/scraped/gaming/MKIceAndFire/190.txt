ours it will be under our control humanity will cower before your legacy they will burn their praise and defiance will be all but a memory [Music] we have a new problem we we need to get out of here i'm working on it work faster these pelicans nearly on board and the power's still out [Music] it's locked down requires a hack okay and you can do that no new plan scuttle the ship you are going to destroy this ship with us in it [Music] i'm going to die here there are cooling pipes running towards the main engines so i'm gonna warm things up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] my greatest achievement is lost to us in his wake since the greatest army ever a force fueled by fury his spirit burns in the heart of the banished it is here since he sought my council when we plan the revolt against the covenant these words even though i feel them in my heart we will never kneel again side by side get ready okay okay fire up those engines chief maybe we'll survive [Music] so report a spartan know something better the master chief returns we thought you did tossed into the void it here you stand humans call you their savior covenant demon the banished prey destroy this craft if you

get out of here [Music] locate unsc infinity infinity class super carrier crow size 7150 not found near field perimeter scan 1986 unsc tags detected status deceased the master chief lives atriox assured us of this death are you not angered you know i feel invigorated promised us revenge superiority he threatens everything you question my leadership atriox is dead it is his fault that we are stuck here the feminist will never bow to anyone again not the covenant not the products not here this ring will be operational please [Music] from distance i want to know everything about him failed if we stay out here any longer they're gonna come back they'll find us and they'll kill us what is it you're searching for signal located uploading there's nothing there you're looking in the wrong direction we need to go home plot the waypoint requesting manual flight control override do it autopilot engage wait what are you kidding me why would we go down there the banish plan to wipe us out all of us and what you think we can stop them on our own i told you we lost we need help not heroics no we do our duty protect humanity whatever the cost i can't be the only every atmosphere we have a new mission soldier what's down there a weapon a weapon how many guns do you need what is wrong with you remind me to never pick up this person this is a terrible idea they're coming for us all of them incoming all directions it's so safe pull back okay okay [Music] [Music] hitting your way [Applause] so oh [Music] more reinforcements this weapon of yours must be worth it whole place looks like it's dying like it's clinging to life somehow how is that possible each ring is different i see an entry point in the wall ahead get in there find this weapon then we can go right [Music] [Music] oh be careful they're still coming you really pissed him off back there [Music] [Music] look at this place it's beautiful and broken very very broken i need to move there are vanished ships everywhere [Music] you're all right um um [Music] me [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] if you knew how you were going to die foreign [Music] yes [Music] [Music] this is is what are those things this is four on the right i've heard the stories but man this is crazier than i imagined [Music] how do you know this isn't a trap i don't great i hope this weapon of yours is worth the risk i'm reading multiple enemy ships heading this way too many it's been six months where have you been what happened where is cortana the rogue ai known as cortana is gone she's been deleted how by you of course not did you hit your head or something don't you remember my instructions were to enter this installation imitate cortana and lock her down for retrieval yours were to take her back to the infinity for deletion so if it wasn't you okay then there's something else on successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete here good good my programming failed i'm not supposed to be here you need to delete me no no i was created for one purpose and that purpose is no longer needed my mission is over we have a new one the banished are planning to fire this ring we need to make sure they don't first of all what's a banished second you may have noticed that a significant piece of this installation has been damaged making that impossible and third to fire this ring they would need an activation index cortana had the index i had parts of it as well something stopped your deletion we need to find out why but this wasn't the mission the missions changed they always do are you sure [Music] [Music] did you do that no removing me triggered a response from the ring i need you to understand there's not much that voice is cortana's no it's not her just dust and echoes what did you say what it's just pieces of data cycling until they run out of power it's all around us today i was called an emotionless atonement they solved 75 healthy subjects they will not all survive i understand that and have played peace with it mostly there is one subject that i find myself hoping does live through this he is perfectly suited for what [Music] he has been assigned a number there's something up ahead i can feel it calling out to me um [Music] these are the banished affirmative they smell even worse than i imagined you can smell them well an array of sensors in your armor can and i analyze the input you smell fine by the way [Music] look over there that's the source the bridge is out yes it is maybe there's a way to power it back up nearby me [Music] is it safe i think so yes [Music] it's safe this this is part of me i don't know why i don't know how but it is me it was the last part i remember being deleted let me just you are here because you were chosen our enemies are getting smarter and more numerous every day what i am about to show you will help turn the tide of war i have been working to harness the strategic power of a ship born ai onto the battlefield are you ready yes dr halsey [Music] unlike previous ai models she will reside between your mind and the suit directly communicating with your neural interfaces think of her as a new set of eyes to aid your reactions and upgrade your reconnaissance she's not the driver but a way to level the playing field what do i call her ask her she named herself hello master chief i'm cortana [Music] together you become our newfound hope together you become our key to humanity's survival she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it [Music] what happened i touched it and was that real it's just data it's it's just here clusters of recursive code but this on the other hand this is the framework i use to trap cortana it contains a copy of the activation index at least fragments of it what should we do with it do we need it well based on what you've told me so far the bigger question is do the banished need it do it [Music] [Music] that was something let's go did i miss something there's a file that's been unlocked but i don't have access we need a route out of here okay let's see there's a breach close by it should lead us to the surface give me a second and i'll get this bridge activated we've got company chief meet me at the plinth up ahead surprised [Music] [Music] oh how you got here fast not the type to waste any time huh no noted let's go [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay [Applause] oh [Music] has found the object even in my darkest moments when i feel the most lost atriox's wisdom continues to impress me i regret that i ever doubted him his talk of forerunners of the lies of secrets hidden in this forsaken ring atriox hear me your will is absolute the banished your soul eternal oh no what's wrong this gravity lift should be powered up we need to find a way to bring it back online go [Music] this object it's part of the ring's life force it's called a power seed [Music] all space all times [Music] chief stop how is is that a spartan we need to find out what happened [Music] she was carrying an enhanced shield module let's see what i can find out about her accessing this is spartan bonita's stone recon specialist her vitals have been offline for nearly a month cause of death was an energy blade but different stronger a single strike she never saw it coming we're here that elevator should take us to the surface there you go [Applause] [Music] [Music] here [Music] ah oh [Music] you need to call down the elevator look for a control terminal [Music] this elevator is drawing power from the ring well it was the seed is missing what are these things genetic repositories forerunner storage vessels silexis how do you know this i was stuck in that room for six months surrounded by them let's just say they talk a lot [Music] this is combat medic lucas browning if you find this you need to understand they've forced me to help them with it whatever it is they brought it up from whatever's below when it opened god it was something different i've never seen anything like it you need to believe me it's not my fault [Music] that should do it let's get back to the elevator [Music] get that cradle powered up [Music] this isn't forerunner it identifies as banished can you operate it in my sleep not that i sleep but oh i don't need to it's already on its way down incoming but what if it's a friend it isn't he did not specify in how many pieces it's too dangerous chief oh [Music] you were right he was not friendly by the looks of him he was some sort of leader they called him tremonius not anymore that's almost funny sierra 117 understood i've been trying to reach you you vanished i thought i was on my okay i got your location on my way be ready [Music] [Applause] but this one's open what do you think was in it another problem why so cynical it might be something good trust me it won't be what a tremonium how do we get out of here terminal over there just give me a second i should be able to get control from here so tremonius has fallen a victim of the master chief's might do not fool yourself he was not the best of the banished not by any measure it occurs to me that we have not been introduced i of course know of you spartan your legend the fear you inspire is admirable the hope you stir in the hearts of your kind misplaced i want you to know my name too to know my legend how else will you beg me for mercy i am esheram war chief of the banished this is my world now and you have little time remaining in it [Music] look at this place it's so full of more monsters coming to kill us you're gonna need to clearly somewhere to land incoming become ready [Applause] uh [Music] [Applause] get ready um [Music] we're safe everybody safe at last [Music] think you can get away from me ready [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] we will build this fortress in the very shadow of their failure a monument to their frailty and cowardice where so many of their kind were cut down ashram has decreed the name in your honor harmonious so that it may inspire other leaders to do what you have done all the remains [Applause] [Applause] approaching [Applause] hey [Applause] [Music] shot him [Music] who kill you is big hero that's the last of them is it safe is anything don't answer that if you can find me somewhere to hack in i think i can guarantee this base will be safe for your friend to land uh let me see the banister using a modification of the covenant's battlenet protocol pretty easy to push through and done i've removed this location from their system we're safe here lz secure [Music] so [Music] oh solid ground [Music] as good as this feels please tell me we can go did you find the weapon you were looking for can we go hi cortana [Music] this is all her fault it isn't cortana tell him but it's classified permission granted i was created by dr catherine halsey to mimic this installation security to trap cortana for deletion i was successful cortana's no longer a threat and now she's going to help us stop the banished of course she is i think i'm with you i didn't even know what a banished was an hour ago and even i can see the odds aren't great yes yes you should listen to her you're gonna get us all killed oh this is fascinating you're trying to survive but i was programmed to die really one person with a death wish wasn't enough no i was just figuring what i'm supposed to wait i'm picking up a unsc distress signal location the source is four kilometers from here here is the distress signal's point of origin this is our current location this was until two minutes ago a banished forward operating base i say was because now it's ours chief what is she talking about now here's the cool part there are more unsc forward operating bases that have fallen into banished hands well pause they have paws each one is associated with a territory here is the location of the unsc signal i've been tracking and here are two more fobs market let's go let's go what [Music] there [Music] ready and waiting chief get on board and we can leave you're messing with me right first you say you want me to follow some signal then you leave me here waiting well go ahead it's not like i have anything better to do [Music] [Music] [Music] that's beautiful isn't it to some i have a question i was created to lock down cortana but i don't know why what did she do that was so wrong she was our target i understand that but is this classified because i don't have all the information this is insane i see vanished everywhere did you hear me everywhere what intel did dr halsey give you before your mission halsey only tells people what they need to know fly a pelican straight into enemy territory no one will ever notice great idea big guy i still don't understand why you had to delete her it feels like something's missing guess what they noticed they all noticed and we've got a bad instructor up ahead armored very heavily armored it'll have to wait i suppose how close can you get us how close we're at and you're asking me how close put us down here here we're still doing this hope this works because it's as good as it's gonna get it's close enough it better be i'm getting out of here we're close to the unsc signals origin source unclear there's just too much chatter on all banished channels i keep hearing the tower it's probably the main structure we saw as we flew in um look down there look close to the fob we detected you take out those monsters get me to that terminal and i'll show what i can do [Music] oh [Music] um you made short work of that huh now to business let's lock down fob golf i don't need an eta on the weapon 37 minutes 52 seconds captain i don't suppose you could speed that up i imagine that's a question for her sir but fair enough is the escort fleet in position i sir we've got six millson frigates in the advanced group ready to move [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ducks out here let me see yes i was right all i need to do is chat with the banished security protocol and by chat i mean push it out of the way because it is really not smart and there we now have ourselves a second fob was that you affirmative so what you're going to just rebuild the unsc piece by piece that's his call i'm just trying to be helpful speaking of which each fob seems to be linked to the battle net and if i do this we can piece together what the banished are up to for instance over here is some kind of banished outpost purpose unclear but it's well defended so it's definitely worth looking into and blowing up and here is what i can only describe as someone that the banished value highly noted his bio is interesting if you want to see for yourself it's waiting for you in the database they're tracking unsc transponders too caches containing valuable equipment and intel oh no it looks like there are multiple unsc squads engaged in trying to survive they need your help chief are you ready chief what do you think i already told you that the odds aren't great for them then let's go find out what that signal is drop off approaching your lz chief so so uh we just picked up a unsc distress signal the signature suggests a squad of marines alive no response on comms but if they are it's a sure bet they need our help let's find them [Applause] [Music] all banished forces eliminated the squad made it thanks to you consider yourself back to hello affirmative oh he's swapping sure foreign uh [Music] so this ship is confirmed up on that outpost we learned about at the fob looks like some kind of salvage operation what's our move shut it down oh the banished really want to protect their fuel silos clearly so what are you going to do about it disappoint them nice you need to manually raise each silo first silos oh [Music] together it was not the covenant that finally delivered upon this promise this was the result is our fortress our sword [Applause] oh [Applause] oh [Music] i smell like an hour oh is happening um [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] take out that silo it looks like the banished are tearing down and repairing vehicles here not for long marking the repair bays let's do this [Music] [Music] gotcha [Music] our scouts have identified two key sites that seem quite promising advise your troops to salvage any human machines laid low in battle the material will be needed for repairs [Applause] [Applause] are they banished digging for something [Music] [Music] [Music] enough hiding [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do you see that one m808 scorpion in pretty good shape too could be useful if you like that kind of thing oh i like it humanity is the high clans will reward me for this oh i like it mine [Music] [Music] [Music] ransom keep is officially offline we did it chief well you did it the banners just wait till i get my clue ready to go damn princess [Music] uh so bob up ahead we could use an lz in this region i believe in you [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] i think that's all of them get me to that term captain's report inf 101 mark timestamp encryption lambda alpha i've spoken to commander palmer who's assured me that our spartan contingent is ready to go commander sarpong offers similar sentiments regarding our infantry and odst divisions this foreign lock is already well underway with the next stages of breaking trip but each time out i wonder if we've pressed our luck too far and now of course comes my favorite part of my day debriefing with dr halsey have a good doctor's unquestionably brilliant but at an ever increasing cost another fob in unsc control and in the shadow of that banish tower the closer we get to it the stronger the unsc distress signal becomes the source has to be inside i just picked up a new fob on the network you're doing right or if you need anything orders received eta on your ride very soon do i pass inspection spartan let's go [Music] [Music] getting out here [Music] nice hang time chief make any underhanded deals lazy feather face i guess tower was a more than appropriate name look at that place the signal's coming from within that main structure somewhere up top we're gonna need to find a way in [Music] uh [Music] you and me hey what's this uh [Applause] come on [Music] is [Music] you guys can't possibly think you're gonna win this fight [Music] [Music] um [Music] capabilities [Music] so the demon is here did you think i would let you walk right into my tower [Music] my facility is locked down there is nothing you can do here he seems confident yes he does but fortunately it's misplaced when the lockdown triggered there was a power spike in what i presume was a security building i've marked it on the map [Music] i call that a woman the lockdown is controlled from the security building near the front this is where the lockdown was triggered today [Music] the lockdown protocol should be simple to reverse let me see three two one done oh what is it this this place is an interrogation facility run by our elite friend back there chacklock his reputation is not good neither is mine [Music] you're going to need to manually activate the gravity lift i've marked it on your map [Music] this location acts as a holding facility prisoners are captured funneled through the chat block and then on to somewhere they call the house of reckoning which is suitably ominous and banished sounding [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] thank you find a way to activate the gravity lift [Music] [Music] switch on your lips [Music] over here [Music] [Music] let's go the gravity lifts powered up [Music] good to have you back more spartan armor and the source of the distress signal we're too late a deployable threat sensor it appears to lock onto and highlight any targets in range could be useful this armor belonged to a spartan named hudson griffin sensor logs suggest he was alive when the armor was removed forcibly it's a long shot but he might still be alive [Music] wow [Music] this is not a place [Music] [Music] he's about what you would expect for an elite who specializes in torture [Music] [Music] let's get it [Music] [Music] [Music] a signal and expose your weakness [Music] um god [Music] [Music] [Music] now too much [Music] [Music] [Music] oh no spartan griffin he's still alive we need to get him out of there where's check lock unknown welcome to my tower master chief it is where you will be broken it is where you will give up your secrets [Music] i see you soon the wall's retracted watch your back he could come from anywhere okay griffin's threat sensor can help you locate chat [Music] [Music] approach the final blow will be mine [Music] [Music] we need to get him out of that machine ah shut this thing down working on it okay be ready i'm going to cut him loose you're alive the baddest i tried to stop them i tried to easy you're safe now the banished they have something they call the conservatory that's all i know it's picked up north of here dig site i couldn't stop them but you can you have to consider it done that's good good the others the sperms did you i'll find them echo 216 all channels can you hear me i repeat can you hear me [Music] chief big guy your motion tracker isn't moving ah come on come on give me anything geez i respond please did you find the source of the signal whatever is down there either has to come with us or be left behind can you hear me a dig site on the ring this conservatory must be some sort of forerunner installation what do you suppose they're after it's time to go [Music] so i'm guessing that whatever the conservatory is the banished won't want us anywhere near it then they'll be disappointed yes they will oh there are is free i do not trust her but i must believe in patriarchs plan his sacrifice must not have been in vain especially now his faith in what we learn from the ark is all i need the harbinger is but a first move to secure our position our future did cortana know about all this when she chose this ring did she expect [Applause] as i look upon this endless world that question consumes me they called it a silex sure i call it something that should have been left well enough alone the leads the jackals even the damn brood seemed scared of what was inside [Applause] their leader he just stood and watched as they held my hand against it [Applause] we got a fruit sniper night they got me god mmm [Music] lay down the fire and cover me [Music] down you're here eyes up chief more of them what's this you've given these marines hope chief they'll remember that i think we have a shot hopping in i'm aboard let's go i'm with you chief disembarking [Music] thought we love her i'm ready to kick some ass teeth let me kick some ass [Music] he was right fighting time is nearby chief be careful he's got quite a rap sheet thousands of unsc personnel died at his hands time to make it right oh [Music] oh so hmm [Music] oh we're going to help [Music] [Applause] [Music] um oh [Music] [Music] killed by humans chief enemy reinforcements target eliminated now the crew [Music] [Music] target and crew eliminated life on this ring just got a little safer for the unsc hey did you get a look at that modified weapon the target was carrying pretty inventive even for the banished so i copied it i've sent updated schematics back to our forward operating bases should give us an edge i'd suggest sending a thank you card for the upgrade but you killed the intended recipient so we can skip that part don't forget we've got a solid lead to follow up on at that dig site the spartan mentioned [Music] [Music] it's taking fire [Music] do you hear that it's coming from that communication tower unsc distress signal nearby chief marking the source more of them chief well here goes nothing um wow [Music] uh i was too close for comfort even after all they've endured these marines just won't give up neither will we advancing and range chief this one's a particularly murderous grunt high sumpter bricklard he's one of the unsc's most wanted don't underestimate him all chief eyes up chief more of them that handles the target let's get the rest of the squad [Music] the smaller they are the less they have to fall i think that's how the saying goes anyway that's the last of briglard and if his bio is any indication that's a good thing so so foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hey where are you going the banished are searching for something called the conservatory let me guess you're heading there too affirmative well don't worry about me i'll be here waiting alone we'll be in touch just just don't leave me out here for too long okay i mean it we still have hostels to deal with chief like [Music] oh no more hostiles bob echoes ready to be brought back into the fold that'll do it bob captured looks like we're right on the edge of the island a chunk of what used to be a single contiguous structure can you imagine the force it would take to blow this ring apart must have been quite a show you guys need anything keep me posted let's get you mobile standby for vehicle drop ready to move i'm on foot you hear that banished radio chatter they're scared they should are you sure about sending them in alone dr halsey if everyone does their job correctly john will not be alone captain i just questioned the value of splitting them off from the rest of blue team that wasn't the initial plan plans change besides i have something else for blue team in mind so do i which is why we've taken advantage of their unexpected availability to assist elsewhere i do not remember agreeing to the reallocation of our best spartans my spartans for an operation i am not even aware of plans change doctor the stronghold we detected at the fob is up ahead chief the redoubt of sundering inside i'm picking up multiple unsc signatures i'm out of here holy crap look there the marines this must be where they processed prisoners before sending them to the tower we've got to get them out of here [Music] come back [Music] only prolonged oh die faceless [Music] get ready more reinforcements inbound on the field oh come on [Music] [Music] i'm picking up one last unsc tag inside that central holding structure under heavy guard [Applause] i don't see anybody now for our friend i think that console's rigged to his cage [Music] [Music] oh you all right marine yeah i am now chief we thought you were dead thank you the redoubt of sundering is out of banish control we're two for two on gate crashing prisons the marines probably want to burn this place to the ground but at least there'll be no more prisoners processed here something up chief [Music] [Music] humanity [Music] we [Music] signal nearby chief marking the source [Music] oh me reinforcements inbound all clear those marines owe you their lives chief [Music] let's go go go just give me a sec jack sniper all day what's the matter scared of a bunch of you holy marines [Music] that one's not coming back that fob belongs to the banished it should belong to us [Music] ain't coming i ranked [Applause] is okay um [Music] [Applause] bob charlie is now a banished free zone hit that terminal and we'll make it official [Music] fob captured one more foothold for the unsc according to banished records we're right in the middle of some of their most active transport routes on the whole ring these days they mostly support escharam's excavation efforts but for most of the war it was prisoner transport escheram's not going to be happy about losing it i just picked up a new fob on the network you're doing right or if you need anything requisition confirmed only way with your hardware [Music] awaiting orders [Applause] but you do what you do best always sir [Applause] can you believe in holzi's plan sir we're detecting unusual readings [Applause] guardians i [Applause] [Applause] making a mistake ready to ride [Music] here it comes can't see them from here that banished facility up ahead looks like a mining operation that must be the dig site the spartan was talking about what are the banished doing here they are doing exactly what they've been doing since they got here scavenging tearing everything apart to fuel this war how could they they're ruining this place and for what when that's already happened [Music] it's kind of quiet isn't it there that tunnel the banish must already be down below this should be impossible forerunner alloy is almost indestructible what do you think they chief i guess we need to deal with that mining laser oh and these guys it looks like the laser's controlled up in the central structure chief this cannot just lead up i've got this [Music] [Music] ah um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] through [Music] the explosion uh [Music] [Music] let's try to shut it up [Music] [Music] looks like the laser controls are by that just give me a sec something's wrong i can't shut it down then we destroy it way ahead of you there are two power regulators down there all we need to do is manually expose each regulator's cooling pylon to trigger a cascade effect and by we i mean you and by trigger i mean shoot or blow up you get the idea the master chief has returned but strangely it does not it invigorates me gives me no purpose i could not have wished for a more worldly adversary patriarchs i now understand why you did not kill him on the human craft you wanted him to witness your victory i
