worms and unless i'm mistaken you did all that for me you are mistaken the dragon was simply on our path nothing more you deny it all you want but you saved me and that deserves compensation what are these braided mistletoe arrows straighter than heimdall and perfectly waited oh thanks oh okay hold on uh oh not that um have you seen my brother again yeah he said you lost your talent oh and that

trolls and ogres and a dragon i feel like we could be anything now we win because we are determined disciplined not because we feel ourselves superior sure i know it's just it feels good to be strong you know yes i know [Music] look yes [Music] [Music] [ __ ] oh i'm gonna like this strange though that one didn't completely blow up that crystal i shot it once it's going again huh yep yes oh oh i will never get tired of shattering things with this uh another one here this one's called emea mother tried to tell me this one but i think i was too young are giants coming out of his armpits i think that might be odin stabbing him what's that [Music] boy yes sir this is good to know [Applause] oh so it's getting colder we must be near the top not long now mom look the summit we're so close enough your quiver strap broke when we fought the dragon it's all right i can hold it stop broken quiver will slow your draw pain we endure faulty weaponry we do not this will do for now good good go steady boy mind your footing here we go i'm not ready there must be somewhere you hear those voices too right yes be silent is it getting colder you know why we're here that sounds like the same man who came to our house you said you killed it shh you've brought company this time must be important if the sons of thor deem to grace me with their presence tell me you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy the tattooed man tracks show he now travels with a child where would they go next why would i know that you're the smartest man alive aren't you smarter than all the dead ones too you help me i help you tell me where they are and i'll talk to odin your father won't let me go balder and he won't let you kill me you have nothing to offer me so take your questions take your threats take these two worthless wankers and piss off when no one's looking we'll be back for your other eye don't you forget we're everywhere we really are ah the very topic of conversation a tattooed man traveling with a child boy check their path make sure we're all alone but we just saw them leave do as i say he doesn't know where you are and i would keep it that way who are you me i'm the greatest ambassador to the gods the giants and all the creatures of the nine realms i know every corner of these lands every language spoken every war waged every deal struck they call me mimir smartest man alive and i have the answer to your every question why does the son of odin hunt us okay there are a few gaps in my knowledge but one's had me in prison here for it 109 winters i'm a clever lad i can piece it together promise just given time nobody there just like i said the boy's mother is dead she wished her she wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms oh then you've come to the wrong place little brother the highest peak in all the realms is not here in midgard it's in your name realm of the giants no that could not be what she meant take a look [Music] this is the last known bridge to youtube in all the realms see that mountain looks like a giant finger scraping the sky that's the highest peak in all the realms no here can we just take that bridge we have a bi-frost when the giants destroyed all other british to their realm they locked this one up with a secret rune if it still exists only a giant would know it and all of them left midgard a long time ago true but today the winds of fate have picked up a strange vortex of coincidence that is it's only one person alive who can get you where you need to go and luckily for you my schedule's wide open [Music] we're going to yoden right it's your best and only move from a tactical standpoint it's the one place the man who cannot be killed won't follow you what do we do yes first you need to cut off my head wait what odin made sure that no weapon not even thor's hammer could free my body for these bonds but fortunately you don't need my body the trick is we need to find someone who can reanimate my head using the old magic magic there's a witch of the woods she knows the old ways and she'll help she might do what a child but if she fails he will be dead he tortures me you know every day brother lordon himself sees it personally and believe me there is no end to his creativity every single day this this isn't living very well oh i can't watch this brother in case you can't resurrect me there's something you know boy the longer you wait to tell him his true nature the more damage you do he will resent you and you may lose him forever there is much about me i would not have him now so you value your privacy more than your son [Music] i'm going to cut off your head now good enough [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're going to find the long-lost realm of the giants that's that's inconvenient yeah that's just what i was going to say do you remember the way to the witch's house yes the woods with the blood red leaves south of the lake i know just where to go hope she made it back for malfunding can bring my mirror back you seem nice before you cut off his head huh i can't believe it was balder that came to our house the acer gun balder and you fought him and won yes one of odin's sons thor's brother and now he's hunting us with his nephews why is this happening if we can raise the head you can ask him okay you know it's silly but i secretly hope we find a giant somewhere in that mountain i guess they really did leave midgard except for the serpent you may be the last of us kind are you the last of your kind too is that why you don't like to talk about my kind i mean your family before mother now where you came from mother a father now is not the time for that yes sir whoa i'm on a [ __ ] break don't hear me screeching at you whenever you're twiddling your shortened curlies leaving boy no pat well you already soiled my solitude so you may as well join me you're not hungry good it's not what i was offering saw your brother again congratulations and i'm sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again hmm let's see the damage little tanker throat wouldn't know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chut eating well enough i guess good all better now what the [ __ ] else you want huh times you get so wrapped up in his work center he has a descents to sip us up and if he does remember good luck getting him to cook his own meat guess i got all the stomach in the family along with the smarts you miss him what that spit pistor what do you know i just mean do you mind trying to concentrate here already on a break from my break what's it gonna be this time that's it hey where's your beast of burden what do you mean i hate her fat bits of around just a while ago what is wrong with you boy or milk ran your eye she was your friend then she'll be happy i'm so well fed [ __ ] bricks boy you got a real sentimental streak know that don't get yourself confused out there i'm getting back to it let's get you squared away then you got a fine deal there here yeah next time boy what is the path back to the witch first we need to find a boat do you remember the way back to the witch from here that way behind the big statue of thor do we have time for another story huh a short one there is a tale about a woodsman he asked the trees of the forest for a branch to make a handle for his axe instead the trees gave him a young sapling so they could keep their limbs the woodsman made his axe and then he returned and chopped down the oldest trees in the forest hmm just because trees are old doesn't mean they're smart we could talk about here huh the water dropped and the serpent rose right i knew that i know she's really powerful but you really think the witch can bring a head back to life she seems competent in her craft and we have nothing to lose if she can't bring it back to life can we keep that no but you may feed it to the fish okay up ready [Music] oh i bet this will lead out huh follow me trailers oh oh boy it's another one of those maps go ready ah are you smart oh huh turn back ac guess the guys aren't welcome here oh there he is i hope he remembers us boy over here interesting how's it going charlie is your witchburn here what is that name that's what he told me it was what it sounded like in my head anyway charlie focus up oh that solves that adequate another one of those samples what does it say falcon hawk and turtledove swim aloft and oceans above what does it say yes sir death to the raven god lord of the hang i'm sure we'll find the answer around here somewhere be ready here boy oh the rest of the rooms were hidden over the hill that's vendor when back to the sand bowl huh sir look what it did um read it sir save their neat things upon all who trespass father she is here it's so good to see you again i knew you weren't dead hello oh can you bring a head back to life i'm not sure i understand what wait where did you get those the arrows give them to me now that you are a gift do as she says boy these arrows are dangerous they're wicked you find any more you destroy them understand do you understand say it i understand if i see them i'll destroy them it's all i ask forgive me please take my arrows in their place i have no need for them anymore ah now what's this about ahead do you have any idea who this is did you kill him at his request he claimed you could revive him me are you sure you heard him right please take him to the table hey miller it's been a long time since i've practiced the old magic hold him there let's have a look well thankfully his head hasn't decayed much and his brain is still intact nice clean cut cutting off his head of all people i sure hope you know what you're doing now hold his head under the water and don't let go i mean it that's enough oh it works let me see him mimir you there yes good oh hello flair been a long time you look well what i did i did for them as far as i'm concerned death suits you better i'd bow if i could your majesty forgive me had i known the witch in the woods was freya herself i never would have suggested this freya the goddess freya you didn't know either sorry when word gets out that my mirror is free the wrath of odin won't be far behind you are god leader of the banner once yes but no longer you do not think it's important to tell me are you really going to lecture me about that we are leaving boy now you're welcome why did you do that we cannot trust her because she's a god everybody taught you nothing boy but she's helped us a lot she lied some people value the privacy best not to judge brother when i require your council head i will ask fair enough get me to tears temple in the lake of the nine and i'll get you to rottenheim as promised we know there's nothing what's there only the last living giant in midgard who better to tell us the way the world surface wait do you know how to talk to him indeed he speaks an obscure tongue more ancient even than these mountains none are left in midgard who speak except of course for me who do that's true you wouldn't know it to look at him but jorman gander is a sparkling conversationalist atreus follow me boy over here yes sir oh [Applause] almost there i can't jump over with those wooden boards in the way it is it's another one of those samples wow uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so my mirror why did freya spin your face no speak of balder he claims nothing harms him hi balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical boosting of a god everyone has a weakness not him i'm afraid baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical you just said that mimir did i what is the source of this power well as i recall it involved parts of my brain must still be coming back to life just need a moment to finish waking up i hope he's not broken whoa how do we speak to the serpent there's a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge take me to it finally that horn okay what's good i'm sure that's a load off your mind moving on then good i put my lips to the horn [Music] [Music] why is he doing that gordon had that statue made in honor of thor and seeing as the world suffered absolutely abhors the fat he was probably sick of looking at it but doesn't that hurt well he and thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them no they will anyway so i guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet you want me to ask him no our only concern is your name [Music] all right wish me luck [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] he knows the pain of your loss he'll help you curious what is it nothing to be concerned about what is he doing making sure we're headed in the right direction listen closely now we need two things to get us into the land of the giants first we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to jottenheim second we need to carve that rune into the special gateway that one of the people we first met you correct except the giants in their infinite wisdom saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate luckily i know where it is and it's not far he looks kind of mad for a moment there now that he thought i said you were friends of odin you'll forgive me never spoken the ancient tongue sober wait look the water's dropped even further you can see more of the realm towers and statues i haven't seen new places to explore along the shore where is this chisel find me a boat and we'll go from there so when we get to the boat we can either look for that special chisel now or go exploring for a little while i'm happy with whatever you want to do which way to the chisel keep rolling towards the statues of the oarsmen then thread pass between them you never did tell me why freya spin your face well she blames me in large measure for her present circumstances and not totally without reason all goes back to the long war between the acl and vanir prior to that wars for the acl were easily won but the vanier had proved their equal and exacted devastating damage both sides suffered tremendous losses and for many of us quite frankly war was simply no fun anymore with a rather senseless waste of precious life wouldn't you agree brother precisely enough was enough and at last odin's most brilliant advisor became determined to find a more enlightened path he set about to broker a peace between the gods took some convincing but ultimately odin was persuaded to marry his deadliest enemy a certain vanier goddess legendary not only for her fertile beauty but her genius at the very vanier magic that odin had long aspired to master freya married odin what was in it for her it was a sacrifice to protect her people a selfless act of love truly she deserves better than she got but of course there's more to that story you want a beach here uh let's go who's that hey it's a fragment of a language site we should look for more like this look here yes sir treasure map all right that spirit the one whose mom was killed by thor what about him his story be a reminder the lives of men mean nothing to the gods i know father you know but do you listen yes good i can't believe odin and freya were ever married love and hate are more closely intertwined than you might imagine for instance odin hates the giants and they him but thor's own mother was the giantess the organ one of odin's great loves so thor's have gotten half giant where once fjorgoon was gone lonely ages passed and as war with the vania raged i could see what he really wanted and after no small amount of convincing they are agreed for a while there he really turned on the charm he seemed happy he seemed interested in making her happy he granted her so many wishes i could scarcely recall them all the piece held and i truly believed all had worked out better than i could have planned but odin's true face showed itself again in the end oh he won freya's trust and she taught him some of her vanir magic another choice you would live to bitterly regret sadly despite his wise counsellor's best efforts to persuade him that peace was the only true path to stave off ragnarok odin never let go of his obsession with yotenheim the taste of vanir magic led him to new forms of experimentation and new levels of depravity so what uh a dangerous beast we will take him down together [Music] my god oh oh [Applause] i'm not ready that was a long one oh huh okay obviously the marriage to odin didn't last but how did friend up a hermit in the woods oh that was a singular piece of cruelty even for odin as if the marriage wasn't punishment enough freya was better to him than he deserved she stuck it out through all manner of indignity all in the name of maintaining peace and safety for her people but odin's madness his tyranny his corruption of her magics it became more than she could stomach and at long last she broke it off odin's wrath was fierce and his curses upon her one more than she dared to fear but her magic was so much stronger than his after so much time together he knew her vulnerabilities and exploited them to craft curses she could never break oh like not being able to leave midgard but still he robbed her of our warrior spirit freya cannot fight even to defend herself no living thing may she harm by blade nor spell in a world this belligerent what choice does she have but isolation poor freya i guess if i was her i'd spit in your face too i lied so would i wow it's like there is an entire city under the water island a forgotten city what was it called now well i forgot enemies ahead [Music] i'm not ready fire in your box boy sir hey it's another treasure map stuff [Music] i have a favor to ask just a small favor really do you remember the dagger you gave me the dagger stabbed into the reaper's back his own son killed him yeah i haven't forgotten that one well i traced it to a group of reavers that operate out of the north re stronghold i'd wager that's where they took their hall from fafnir storeroom along with that wet stone that i could use to help you another treasure hunt pointless well not if syndra really can make us better equipment with that wet stone plus the reaver's son he murdered his father think that's a keeper fine piece of work if i say so myself what can i do for you and we're back to you what a surprise that's a deal [Music] oh oh that's fine always happy just to chat i have a question if emir was the first giant where did he come from in the beginning there was gnungagon the great void there were no realms yet only primordial forces there was fire and there was ice and there in the void they met and produced water more than water the mystic lifeblood of something entirely new from this water emir took form and became a being of pure creation and chaos mother and father to all that came after even the ace here ah every god man and beast came first from amir's flesh though it was the aesir who thought themselves so superior that they should hold dominion over the rest of creation it was odin who took arms against his creator and spilled amir's lifeblood with his spear unnecessary evil he would say to bring order to the realms in the earth torn flesh odin would fashion the realm of midgard for his own called himself all father as if he was the creator and not the creator's destroyer the small covetous tyrant oh sorry my boy ah you know i think it best we just end it there actually oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] sorry my god [Applause] wow [Music] oh [Music] another piece of the language sniper good i always wondered what became a family wait fafnir storeroom fab news the very one but cindy said he was a dwarf he was and now he's a dragon funny how life works isn't it he's chained up perhaps we should keep an eye out for binding shrines and free the poor bastard islands ready yourself boys how did your friend become a dragon in here oh he's no friend of mine this little scrote was a constant source of annoyance amongst acr and vanier alike then why three him trust the recently liberated brother no one deserves to be held captive like this even a greedy little dwarf come dragon here boy huh at the red look like they walked straight out of here never answered the boys question head how did this dwarf become a dragon i don't know for certain though i'm wager his penchant for stealing magical artifacts had something to do with it must have stolen a trinket from the wrong vania goddess oh oh i'm ready time to set him free think he'll remember you i don't know lad a lot's changed since we last crossed paths i had legs uh hmm i'm not ready nice shot yeah [Music] oh sir there you go yeah well the dragon hasn't done much for his personality ah and you are full of stories when will you tell one that entertains i beg your pardon you just insulted you yeah i got that so you want a cork up do you very well my brothers i'll tell you the story of brunia the brawler the real story there was a huge battle right he's shrine at him in the middle fighting our face here a pretty story but no brunia you see was born with neither head nor heart so the giants had to complete him with stone it was strong to be sure but also a perfect simpleton odin met him wandering in midgard one day found him so amusing so harmless so gullible that he invites him back to his powers in asgard there he gets from near his fill of need and guards him into all manner of busts and antics all for the amusement of the court i was there i saw the laugh as rooney leapt upon his shield and swore he'd kill us all and take our women folk back to yottenheim then thor shows up and does he laugh oh no thor takes one look at the drunken stone buffoon and brings down the owner on his head so hard that he's got chunks of lunir in his own skull to this day oh it's so startled by the face full of rock he doesn't notice from near's body topple right onto him with a sickening crunch and again the roars of laughter echo through the palace halls that's an awful story my mirror nothing like the one's mother told me let that be a lesson my son truth is seldom so pretty as myth enlightened you who walks among the living my beloved gulving calls to me she yearns for peace yet her remains lie in pieces i beg of you make my gulvig whole again you want us to collect our bones gross golfing sader magic knows no bounds she can reunite you with those you've lost really how boy i can smell your grief child rest assured her magic is strong enough to create bridges between life and death if only for a short while boy we are leaving they've taken three of sweet gulvik's bones and spread them across the lake bring me her bones child gulvig okay here we go yes please my fair gulvig this realm suffers without her spirit father maybe we should look for those bones why didn't you hear him we could talk to mom again if we keep an eye out if you wish boy i will not be distracted by this fool's errand this chisel we seek what is it i'm glad you asked actually i have just the story for you there was a giant once new family a very giant giant who despite his mountainous size was without question the greatest stonemason this world have ever seen proud farmhour hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge onto his son a young kareem thor at the heart of a warrior perhaps the father had too much fear in him son too little either way the quarrel of the air spiraled out of control and the overworked stonemason struck his son having thrown ran off into the night feeling shame and regret family of chased after his son but in his emotional state soon found himself wandering midgard lost and alone sadly he caught the eye of the one person who didn't want to meet alone that night so far from home and what happened next you'll see fell he crushed a charming place famed for worshiping the vanier god in europe who always took credit for planning that one the truth is the sweaty full bag just got lucky muscles up ahead we seek a chisel the tip of one yes a very very giant chisel [Music] [Music] his idea what happened to the survivors oh thamur was a frost giant when he died his final breath froze above uh there he is find the tip of that chisel that's the magic we need enemies [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i'm not ready [Music] this is the last one tell me when [Music] betrayal here what does it say yes sir to new york we offer back to sea's bounty ah yes it was believed that new york calmed the winds and seas for the fishermen they loved and worshiped him here hey pardon the world tree stuff wow get over hmm oh how are we getting down there i have a plan you do do not act so surprised no offense brother i don't even think thor with mjolnir in hand could get through that much ice then thor is a fool this should be entertaining boy here we go uh three more times [ __ ] now uh [Music] [Music] you again [Music] wow that was uh something that the fight here catch well that was a waste of a perfectly good how were you not seen there is nowhere here to hide oh that it's a little trick my people can pull a special way of not being seen you can be invisible more like i can step into the realm between realms and your mind doesn't understand what it's seeing so it sees nothing at all that's how we avoid ever having to actually use the weapons we craft it uh it doesn't seem to work on dragons though your brother wanted to know if you're getting enough to eat i guess i could tell you what brock was asking about me was there mead on his breath you let him touch this again come on then so that's how brock was in the temple right after the water he stepped between realms okay now shush i need complete silence for this there you go i'm feeling creative today and what do you have your eye on ah what shall it be anything you need young sir done and done i don't suppose you could try keeping that clean if i say so myself i think that's a keeper [Music] oh we can't forget you what did we miss happy to provide [Music] [Music] hey we found something interesting oh really i love something interesting so this plan of yours can you guess it knowing you it doesn't involve standing around here correct but how do we move forward boy armor really liked jewelry didn't he even braided his beard with it i happen to think he looks dashing you know for a snow covered corpse careful my shop's right here we heading into that building yes i think there's something inside that'll help us break the ice and get to the chisel tip no i'll keep thinking focus up boy [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] we are done here i came here on a diplomatic mission once trying to broker a piece between asgard and vane i wore so many lives lost what i didn't know was thor had already gone on a killing spree of giants what did the giants have to do with the war between the gods nothing at all word that's the tragedy they took no side in that madness but odin's paranoia is surpassed only by thor's lust for blood huh huh ugh huh huh what now oh we got most of it well a stealthy planet is not now we must free the other strap we do hmm why are we going up from what we need is all the way down there think well the chisel tip is under thick layers of ice so melting it won't work correct there weren't any shattered crystals nearby for me to shoot so that's not an option correct i just leave smashing the ice we need something ridiculously heavy to oh i get it now how are we going to turn the hammer so it lands near the chiselton not possible we cut it free write it down and figure out what comes next after say your plan involves a whole bunch of luck then you are welcome to suggest a different one what now hold tight uh the client seems ill advised little ways oh no the floors collapsed there's a sand bowl but how do we get to it we cannot boy what does it say when time itself is discerned the forward path is retrograde retrograde it's backwards those symbols the seasons yeah but the order's all jumbled shouldn't it be winter spring summer autumn why start with winter it's from a song mother used to sing don't i know that one winter light quiet head doesn't like music either it do it house house venter sumo no that wasn't right there that word it means endure try it well done write it again [Music] how is this possible my guess temporal magic dangerous stuff the high vanier gods used to play around with the ability to freeze time happened to be a favorite of neward himself in fact used to why did they stop well turns out stop in time keeps the sun and moon from streaking across the sky unfortunately it does not stop the wolves that chase them always looking to sink their teeth in after that they decided it was best to leave time alone i can't get to the ball oh oh [Music] before the floor collapses

incidentally all those magically sealed doors we've seen can now be unlocked like that one around the corner you can get through that door there now that you've got the chisel [Music] you killed maggie that he did he was a god but you killed him mine are acl perhaps but i and his father's thor may not at all him this will not go over well in this guard i defended us nothing more i fear no judgment judgment no but if vengeance is any concern since when can you kill a god uh ugh oh [Music] huh once you retrieve the whetstone please take utmost care while handling it it is a priceless rally after all which way back what speaks to you now watch where you throw this thing anything you need young sir what did we miss now there is something else to tell you i don't think the lad's doing too well if so then keep up hey i just realized magne didn't come back to life that is interesting it's known the acr find their own way to valhalla no valkyrie escort no processing at the gates of helheim that may be significant wow oh yes [Music] so [Music] look back into the giant's head what what is this place fisherman would bring the day's catch into this port and use that contraption to send some of it directly to the yarl's main kitchen the rest were sorted and sold there is an exit under the thumb find a way across there's an opening i can get it there's a path to the exit on the other side there's a rope in here i think that did it ugh back under his palm we're almost there everything we just did climbed around a dead giant wrote a giant falling hammer fought some bad gods what do you think mother would say that you have come a long way thanks there's something over there [Music] here boy another one ah you know this one don't you it's tamil the giant stone base is he building a wall around you man it was to be his masterwork he only wanted to protect his people too bad the first part got burned i'd prefer the last panel was burned such a senseless pity this place it feels like like a prison that would explain the hefty magical lock on the outside but it's more than that i have this feeling like something is waiting for us down here you've a knack for ominous statements lad what kind of something i'm not sure something powerful whatever you feel boy we will handle it we have come this far yes yes father huh uh a valkyrie imprisoned she actually did it a valkyrie but i thought they were just spirits take caution lads a valkyrie in the flesh i can't think of a more formidable opponent she does not attack does she even know we're here [Music] almost ready [Music] not yet huh [Music] let's oh on my way [Music] you have freed me from my corrupted form you have my eternal gratitude but my sisters remained trapped as i was take my helmet find them free them the fate of the valkyries rest on your shoulders [Music] the fate of the valkyries sounds pretty important that's putting it in my opinion what do you know of them a fair question and yet not one easily answered i know more than most but much of their history is veiled in secrecy my own experience with the valkyries ends with my imprisonment you are avoiding the question ahead as i said brother it's complicated i don't know why or how they become such wretched creatures but perhaps if we can feed more of them you want us to find more of those things the fate of the valkyries lad a more worthy endeavor there is not it will be dangerous well that hasn't stopped you before right that's the spirit what now then maybe freya let's have a look at the boy no i feel better now i just needed to catch my breath where do we go next well now that we've got the giant's chisel we need to learn the traveling so we can carve it into that special gateway atop the peak and open realm travel to the land of the giants you don't know it the last snow but the serpent did mention that the giants had entrusted that secret to tear isn't here dead hi but his hidden boat is very much in reach the doors are beneath his temple submerged in the lake for generations until our snake friend shifted his weight there we shall find the fabled black rune of jochenheim oh there got another favor to ask you two what do you want dwarf i got another lead on my old pal on vari meet me at the lawn soother mines there's some fancy dancy loot in it for you another lead but we already found him well found his hand anyways i'll explain it the minds these ones is just south of the river pass now you two want something or you're just gonna stand there all gag-scrapped and slack-jawed what'll it be pull the ring off on vari's hand at the vellunder mines fella was always tampering with souls and dark rituals and matters of the night see just the sounds of his hammer flattening metal were enough to stoke my fires all blissful [ __ ] you better clear out before i get all frisky what more you need well next time [Music] follow me adress oh oh here's vault is behind that magical lock [Music] wow i can't believe we're setting foot in tears fault another one of these it's here but the middle panel is missing wait i thought two was a god not a giant ah but he was loved by everyone including the giants other than me he was the only one they gifted with their special sight hey i wonder if the giants left a triptych about me somewhere too go ahead actually come look let me show you how to read this that is not necessary taught me so much let me teach you something andreas come on you already speak it learning to read won't be that hard i know how to read boy just not this tongue you're halfway there already then okay so the rooms represent a lot of different things some gods some animals wait oh am i going too fast sorry not that you smelled something yeah i do smells like rain you ruined everything i earned that [ __ ] hammer but now everyone's gonna think i only got it because maggie's gone i'll be a joke but if i kill you no [Music] that your father's doing or did you get it from your mum she's stupid and ugly shut up you don't know anything about my mother oh it's true but i'm gonna get to know you really well you're gonna be my new brother right after i finish killing your [ __ ] whoops mostly car broken stay back no no this isn't over brother the boy [Music] you have to get into freya quickly there's no other way um take the boat freya's isn't far odin's eye is on you brother especially now that he's taken to killing his kin as forest is a blind spot for him this is our smartest move and if anyone can heal him it's hard what is happening to him i've seen it in mortals that some conflict of the mind expresses itself as an ailment of the body never in a god by god believing himself mortal i can only imagine we're almost there [Music] somebody just called the serpent so the fever burns hotter he is shaking it's serious we must hurry [Music] open the door we need your help it is urgent i'm still a god go away the boy has followed you freya he's here [Music] this is no ordinary illness the boy's true nature your true nature fights within him [Music] [Music] i did this to him [Music] will you help me [Music] of course there is a rare ingredient found only in helheim the keeper that protects the bridge of the damned i need its heart hell the realm of the dead do you know it note this one it is a land hum and yielding cold fires cannot burn there and no magic in all the nine realms can create a blaze as for the dead your frost axe will be useless you'll need to find something else [Music] then i must return home dig up a past i swore would stay buried who you were before doesn't matter this boy is not your past he is your son and he needs his father [Music] this rune opens the bridge to hell height when you are there do not under any circumstances cross the bridge of the dam there is no road back understand boy you must hurry through my garden there is a path leading to my boat take it return home dig up your past do whatever you need to do just bring me back the bridge keeper's heart and your son may survive and last we spoke i was no you were right to distrust the word of a god no need to explain not to me not for that i will keep him safe that's the mother's promise [Music] you
