what's so important down there that you'd risk your life uh well um moreland i'm not interested in salvage okay whatever you find below is yours all right then what if i told you we were delving for the most spectacular treasures ever scribed by man or i'd say get to the point no nonsense i like it behold an ember looks like a piece of junk well now yes but but but with the proper spark these magnificent creations of the old ones paint mesmerizing pictures in the air and the ruins below us are full of them the feast for the eyes beyond description this is my old grants promised me how did your grandfather discover these embers he was here 40 odd years ago he he was one of the first to lead a delving party into the west he discovered the ancient city around us plumbed the depths of this very structure he found the hollow underneath and the glowing embers all about took as many as he could and brought them home he always wanted to come back and get more but well never scraped up the shards what he really wanted to do was use the embers to put on a show one unlike the world has ever seen sounds like quite a guy he was a true delver and a true showman and i miss him but i will do him proud i will gather the embers and put on a spectacle that would have amazed even him with your help of course so these embers project images paintings of light it's amazing stuff this one showed the most beautiful woman you've ever seen beckoning all to a buffet of lobster and succulent beefs i must have watched it about a hundred times as a child in my old gramps workshop what happened to it over time they die out i cried the day that this one's light faltered but there are many more below as you'll see if you get down there like i did in my old graphs before me [Music] so what exactly happened down there it was a delve like no other a chance to follow in my old gramps footsteps beneath this structure here is an enormous hollow a dome protected from the sands we built this elevator here to ensure easy egress and exit it's quite a contraption actually and not so easy right again what happened at the bottom we beheld the treasure my gramps first discovered painted images in the air of every description dancing women games and coins and promises of jackpots i don't know what that is but it's got to be good but then something went wrong the images turned nautical waves went through them even fish like a strange underwater dream poseidon's dream yes well suddenly there's this terrible rushing sound and then an explosion of water erupted from the floor so water just shot up from the floor and filled the place up it was a raging flood unlike anything i've seen we ran like forge fire and barely made it up the elevator as a wave just crashed beneath us shaken but not stirred i i i built the diving bubbles mark one and mark two i tried the descent in each but i nearly drowned both times now but dunn's beside himself he thinks i'm insane but i can't give up now i i've just i've come too far and the embers are just barely within my reach well maybe i can help yeah maybe you can you guys don't seem like average delvers we're not really delvers at all we're showmen like performers you're nora and thus unfamiliar with the arts we stage spectacles all around the claim stemmer tells stories which i augment with all manner of sounds and fireworks and aberdund he well complains he handles the money which amounts to about the same thing when we delve it's to find gear for my theatrics which makes this delve the most important one of all how deep is it can't i just swim down only if you have gills you can stack 50 kegs in that shaft leave it to the asaram to measure something in kegs talking liquid depths i'd say it's apt after knot sounds too deep to hold my breath hence our new invention i'd better get after those parts there's a fully intact compressed air capsule on the mark too but like i said it's stuck in the shaft if you made it back up alive i should be able to swim down that far all right as for the other parts stemmer scout at a herd due south of here that should have what we need i'm on it great i'll come back when you get the gear good hunting probably get a guest list of 50. so we'd need at least three dozen kegs brown ale maybe no nope for him are you planning a party budgeting for moreland's funeral thanks to you i was this close we're gonna move on leave all this nonsense behind and you come along ah you spark your wet noodle idea it's going to work i've heard that before so uh how does someone like you end up working for someone like moreland i work with moreland we got three equal claims in this venture i saw one of his early shows back when i was it was just him and his inventions works of flame lights and shadows all kinds of gizmos never seen the like but the man is all spectacle no sense bleeds shards like like you get the idea without me to handle the finances his dreams would be sunk more sunk wish we were back in the claim plenty of normal shows to do without the the salvage from this blasted place and yet you're here in the middle of the desert delving for his dream it was a good one but sometimes a dream has to die this stream of moorlands is going to get him killed let's say it doesn't what happens after he gets the salvage down there [Music] then we put on the greatest show the world's ever seen we'll have a special seating uh premium ale the works moreland will do his his light spectacle thing at a stemmer we'll get their eyes a sparkling with his tails and i'll be selling tickets it's a nice thought anyway moreland mentioned you were showman what an ashram can't be anything other than a uh a delver tinker or drunkard okay sure we are delvers too but that is not our main source of income mostly we go town to town put our own shows these shows what are they what happens at them tales and uh moreland's got the technical know-how builds uh all manner of inventions whirly gigs of light and sound cannons that that shoot fire and showers of sparks and stemmer keeps them enthralled with tales of adventure in the smoothest baritone yeah that and you me who do you think handles the financials for the whole blasted thing those two those two might have the the sparks but do you think they know their way around shards no they don't so moreland was down in this ancient city and the three of us went down below you i can delve too right and uh then what happened what do you think water rushed in we ran and moreland built that blasted thing nearly got himself drowned twice hey you want the finer details of his stupidity you go ask him i'm always willing to engage in some commerce [Music] i'll leave you alone do us a favor leave us all alone [Music] the stout-hearted huntress approached her appearance as sudden as a spark of destiny and the delve was at its diarist that's uh quite the introduction um maybe uh maybe a little internal rhyme instead a maiden a from the very sands that bore our woes nah to try it what is it with you and all the words that's what i do the stalwart storyteller gazed upon the maiden with well-earned pride in his life's work stemmer wordsmith at your service how did you end up following moreland out here bright-eyed moreland held his dreams aloft like a burning candle and where that light went the hearts of men were sure to follow so you admire him admiration is but a gentle fire it's the spark the delvers and tinkers and rogues alike are sure to warm too okay guess that answers something your friend over there doesn't like me too much the loud one the old bee counter has the personality of a mossy rock but oh what a wicked mind for money and a memory is long his life or even the smallest debt up by that he means he owes me shards 147 to be exact but as sharp as he was and things pecuniary he had a dull forgetfulness for how many times a certain word smith saved his hoary hide 147 147 what exactly does a wordsmith do like a tinker at the forge wordsmith hammers out words to entrance all who hear them young the old and frequently the inebriated i didn't take the awesome for storytellers well they say the only thing makes a cold brew go down these year is the tale of times going by but it's always best to hit the road before the keg runs dry [Laughter] uh why why is that oh oh well the awesome can get mighty agitated if they run out of drink or if they don't like your story so you're saying being a wordsmith can be dangerous oh yeah story goes the wrong way osirim will throw stuff at you what like fruit more like chairs or grenades but the veteran wordsmith persevered through it all hammer in hand ready to give as good as he got how do you think we got here all the way from the claim anyway past those blasted machines it wasn't bad talking got to go see someone about an underwater city and lo the huntress went forth [Music] ah what can i do for you all right [Music] i thought we were finally going to get away from this place well good thing that aloy showed up we'll see the longer they're sojourned in the desert the crustier the shard counters mood became according to moreland i heard should be south of here this will be in my stash when i need it well this is where moreland said the herd would be i must have moved on i need to pick up their trail better look for trucks there tracks should lead me to the heart this must be where the herd left from i better follow the tracks in the other direction foreign there's the hurt i should have the parts i need fire's not gonna help here more machines i'll deal with them first oh the storm's whipped up a sand spiral great [Music] okay got them all uh where did the herd go huh yes because that's my image frost won't help you machine is born uh oh good hmm one synthetic membrane okay that takes care of the machine parts just gotta grab the compressed air capsule from marlin's diving bubble ugh oh i thought we were finally going to get away from this place well good thing that aloy showed up we'll see the longer they're sojourned in the desert the crustier the shard counter's move became yes i got the complex air capsule i should have all the parts to build this thing now before i get back to moorland what can i do for you partner i've got everything i need to build the uh the incredible diving mask i think diving a mask is enough i won't quibble the workbench is all yours [Music] whoa there's a marvel if it works you'll let me try it i want to get down there and get those embers assuming i don't drown so what are you really looking for down there it's hard to explain something that caused a malfunction in the apparatus that controls the old city i think it started the flood well i i thought we started the flood like we sprung a trap i don't know how we were detected like i said the dancing lights around us changed turned to sea life there was this flash of red and the roar of water surging in wait a flash of red a red light from a spot near the grate on the floor where the water burst through it's like a beacon or a warning thanks that might help i hope it does and good luck down there time to see if this thing works so far so good i can actually read down here diving mask seems to be holding up i've never been able to swim this deep before it started right here more than 30 years ago back when this casino was still called the temple one big day turned my fate around but now i paid stuff to screw this hell ever to everyone i have to turn the lights out one final time and the waters of my adopted home would at last run dry well if a dream has to die at least i can say goodbye first stanley chen what did he do here nautical lights i must be poseidon's doing that looks like a way out poseidon's down here somewhere gotta find where it's hiding whoa there's no way i can fight that thing underwater i'll have to be careful this place is massive all of it's encased in a dough a door like there red light alert critical flooding detected automatic drainage controls offline to execute an emergency purge manual reset of primary and secondary pump nodes is required the arch can then be triggered at the pump maintenance station if i do this purge and drain all the water i can fight that big machine on dry ground looks like i have to reset a couple of pump nodes first according to the map there should be an access point for the first node south of here more machines down here [Music] fire could hurt there's the access point shoot me to the pump node there must be a whole network of these tunnels down here water lines for an entire city i can't reach the ledge from here maybe there's something i can climb to get out [Music] the primer note shut down now i think the last time i was down here was during the lumia grand incident a malfunction led to an overflow of detergent in the pipes suds rose from every fountain as we frantically tried to fix it i looked up and saw everyone in the lobby chasing bubbles the size of basketballs young and old alike and now there are magical moments in the impossible city [Music] hot i'm sweating everywhere there one note down better swim back up and find the access point for the second node according to the map the second node should be on the other side of the goal so should get me to the second note huh just shut down the secondary node no more water for the fountains no more shows no one left to appreciate them anyway i'll never forget the city's grand me opening the fountains had been bone dry for years no one believed they'd ever return so as the first plume arced up in the dome the music swelling my heart soared right along with it the city gave me a second chance once now with that one too the domes the water he was responsible for all of it i won't budge maybe that debris is weighing it down let's see if that helped okay i've taken care of both nodes now we just need to activate the emergency purge at the maintenance station according to the map the maitland station should be at the south end of the dome [Applause] there's red light in that tower just look at the console i found earlier that might be the maintenance station but how to get in looks like part of this building collapsed there might be a weigh-in i think i'm in the maintenance station now i just gotta find a console to activate the emergency perch [Music] [Music] get this from my stash when i need it [Music] this looks promising system shutdown is almost done only thing left is to power everything down at the control center so i guess this is it one final walk down the strip and then it slides out forever at least i won't be around to see it destroyed the odyssey will be well on his way to sirius by the time the swarm gets here still my last memory of this place will be empty a city that's already dead should be a console in here [Music] there time to dry this place out [Music] [Music] that did it okay now i can deal with that machine guarding the door on the other end of the dome and once i get past it i can get to what's waiting on the other side of the door poseidon i don't think shaw gamma will help but i guess the perch didn't get rid of all of the water [Music] purge left these machines behind i could them first deal with sneak by i've been made [Music] so so yes ah huh what okay poseidon is through there but where did that machine go hey lloyd it's a miracle come on come on hey was this you did you lower the waters yeah but there's a new problem that thing's in our way wow yeah it's gonna be difficult to get the embers with that around there's the scrappy band of adventurers beheld the beast they knew what they had to do what are you crazy gosh now she saved our delft then stay up here and start firing when i engage ugh places fellas [Music] ah bounty you did it [Applause] [Music] come on gentlemen get a move on uh you guys all right more than all right this you we did it all the embers we could ever want and it's all thanks to you very uh heartwarming but maybe we can just you know grab what we came here for and get out before any more of those things decide to show up now now shard counter nothing wrong with a little revlon though we should probably let our flame-haired friend get going i believe she has business down here is she not right of course you need any help i can handle it from here very well we'll start taking some of the embers upstairs call her if you need us thanks [Music] [Music] time okay poseidon should be hiding in some kind of processor i need to find a console to gain access to it i can't do it i can't give up on this place i'm leaving everything on standby the system's equipped for runs for decades if not hundreds of years it's a long shot but maybe someday against all odds someone will find this place again marvel at his lights and wonders discover fortune and boundless opportunity make it their own dream after all if the city can give me a second chance if water can anything's possible he was right [Music] there i should be able to use that console i'm here to bring you home poseidon takaya subordinate function to original code okay gotta bring this back to gaia looks like taking poseidon triggered a restart of the city's power system crew must have headed back up top with all the embers they could carry i can grab this from my stash later yep [Music] [Music] hmm huh [Music] [Music] uh so [Music] it started right here more than 30 years ago back when this casino was still called the temple one big day turned my feet around but now i paid out the screwless hand ever to everyone i have to turn the lights out one final time and the waters of my adopted home with a last run dry well if a dream has to die at least i can say goodbye first an elevator one must have built this before the place flooded nice to work nice not to have to climb back up [Music] whatever she did it powered up the whole city is that an eagle how much did all this cost oh show my old grants always wanted there's another [Music] his dream realized his old gramps legacy ensured our hero beheld the sea of desert lights and wept at his good fortune when i saw the embers as a child i never dreamed they could be like this thank you ayloy did you find what you were looking for i did and now i have to move on oh oh come back when you can i got big plans for this place i thought you wanted to put on shows with the embers back in the claim oh no this is the show oh can you imagine folks from all over the land coming to take it all in plus some food and a nice place to stay not to mention a variety of entertainment venues don't forget games of chance plenty of shards to be had there for certain a new dream huh i am i hope you make it happen goodbye gentlemen this delf was a story for the ages all thanks to you if moreland and cruz gonna stay maybe i should come back and check on them later for now i need to get poseidon back to gaia but with all the ruins here i might want to look around before i head back and with my new diving mask i can swim as deep as i need to like at those deep water sites i found earlier gonna need a lot of shards to get this place up and running carnival carnival just saying something twice doesn't make it sound better have it done anybody seen one of my machine strike pieces around why don't you check the cash maybe you left it there when you dropped off all that ale oh hope it didn't get stained [Music] hey look who's back you find what you're looking for i did one step closer to taking the fight to the zenith can't wait he's still sifting through loads of data yeah it's interesting there's lots of words i i thought maybe i could try finding things with more you know pictures in it not much luck there but i i did find out about these uh holo films like images put together to tell a story and they were made to look like they were the real thing the asaram like shows i bet they pay a lot of shards for those hollows how are things going around here how you tell me varl's new girlfriend tried to kill me earlier what did you do i made one joke about how they you know eat grass a lot how does anyone fight with nothing but tree leaves in their stomach anyway from the looks of it the utaru yeah well i wasn't expecting it to be that fast just try not to get hurt i see you've got strike set up mind if i have a go at it really sure now let's do it we can play another time if you want i better get going all right i'll be here if you need me aloy you found another one of gaia's sub functions two down one to go i'm glad her healing can continue found anything else combing through that data varl and i have been looking into the animals of the old world apparently there used to be thousands more species roaming around than there are today can you imagine that i'd give anything to see them even as holograms though i know that without artemis or apollo that may prove difficult at least i can find comfort in knowing gaia used many of them as inspiration for her machines her memory honors them are you guys training with aaron as well if you count trying to stick a spear in his gut is training then yes i've been told please tell me you weren't being serious though of course not good i was going for a couple of broken bones he called the uttaru leaf grazers laughed at the idea of us simple farmers being formidable fighters before i knew it he and i were battling it out in the common room the man is slow but he can throw a hammer around don't look so worried we're evenly matched for now next time he's going down like a load of boar dump just try not to kill each other injuring his pride should be good enough i better get going right you've got that sub function to deliver looks like aaron and catalo moved their stuff in is your focus acting up again that's fine i can take a look if you want nah usually works if i just flick it a few times with my thumb need back for more how are things going around here how you tell me varl's new girlfriend tried to kill me earlier so i hear i made one joke about how they you know eat grass a lot how does anyone fight with nothing but tree leaves in their stomach anyway from the looks of it the utaru yeah well i wasn't expecting it to be that fast just try not to get hurt i gotta head out yeah i just gaia what was this room for this was intended to be a recreational room for control center operatives i have repurposed the displays to track regardless activity in the region a useful war map hey hey i hope all is well enough under the circumstances i'm holding up good you said you were training with the focus that's right i've been watching holograms of your first fight with the zenith spectres they are faster and more agile than any machines i've faced before how many do the zeniths have i'm not sure probably a lot i would not wish to face them on mass i'm with you there it must be strange seeing everything through a focus now i can see machines like never before their strengths and weaknesses simply reveal themselves to me to think that such a tiny object might be the most powerful weapon i've ever possessed [Music] getting ether out of the grove made for quite a spectacle one that showed the entire tribe that hiccaro's mission for peace is the correct path for it is now blessed by the ten themselves i heard my friend talana came by the base did you get a chance to meet her briefly a bold woman going in it to knock the territory with that carja armor of hers she'll be lucky if my people don't shoot her on site she'll be careful she's just looking for someone who might need her help whoever it is they better be worth dying for have you had a chance to speak with laurel briefly he fought well against regala's troops at barren light are all nora as skilled as the two of you i'm not exactly one of them but anyway the nora can hold their own they managed to push the karja from their lands i thought my tribe was the only one to have done that impressive does it still hurt it comes and goes i try not to think about it but its absence is always present for me it's difficult to explain i can't claim to understand only empathize then you have my thanks [Music] i should get going back to my training then [Music] i have to head up gaia is door's locked maybe guy will be able to get it open later it was pretty weird talking to beta seeing someone who looks like me even though it seems like she doesn't act anything like me or elizabeth for that matter door won't open guess guy hasn't been able to restore access yet it's locked well i guess i could have wants her privacy for now i wonder if farrell's in there with her welcome back aloy i see you have recovered poseidon hey can you come downstairs beta has something you need to hear okay i'll be right down i have managed to unlock additional rooms within the facility got it hey guy me again welcome back where shall we resume how's kotalo doing i have detected that the loss of his arm still deeply pains him in an effort to remedy this i have discussed a potential solution with him i believe he will want to fill you in on the details a solution i'll check in with him when i can then how are things around here zoe has been studying the morphology of her land gods in an effort to understand their sickness without the abilities of hephaestus i am unfortunately unable to correct their programming however due to zoe's perseverance we may have a workaround yeah she filled me in it sounds promising marl and zoe seem to like spending time together indeed while studying old world data zoe discovered references to a dietary lifestyle known as vegetarianism she appreciated the similarities with uttaru practices and encouraged varl to try out this lifestyle and how did that go i believe they have agreed to disagree how's aaron handling things he is becoming increasingly accustomed to use of the focus after an initial incident what did he do he unfortunately crushed his first focus as he attempted to affix it to his temple amongst a number of assaram curses i believe he also blamed the focus for being dainty he has given repeated assurances that it will not happen again well good thing we have a lot of extras i guess so there's a few people here now and they're learning all about you the ancient world almost like what was supposed to happen before apollo was purged yes while the loss of the apollo database was catastrophic there is still much that can be gleaned from the data you have uncovered for instance varl has been reviewing the last recorded entries from those who perished during the pharaoh plague hearing their hopes and fears made him quite somber anything i should be worried about i do not believe so i have elected not to intervene to allow him to process this on his own terms so this facility the regional control center it was meant to oversee the terraforming system for the local region yes had humans receive their education from the apollo database they would have then been guided here to assume operation as that never happened this place remained vacant until minerva decided to settle here so i guess this room was meant to keep an eye on conditions outside yes from here the facilities operators would have been able to observe weather and machine activity in real time that would have been quite a sight it may still be possible to view some of them should you find and reconnect the cameras to this room's console i'll keep a lookout so the haiti's proving lab where i found the gaia kernel it used to be a feral research facility yes prior to appropriation by zero dawn the facility was used to engineer and test advanced computer viruses it appears to have been one of many research initiatives by pharaoh automated solutions i guess it wasn't enough to build automated killing machines he wanted viruses to infect them with too so a while back before the battle at meridian i went into banuk territory i discovered another ai there one not related to zero dawn cyan it was created to oversee operations for a volcanic stabilization project and it spent the last thousand years in isolation i'm guessing you didn't know about it no from the data on your focus it seems that cyan was cut off from the outside world an effort by its creators to protect it from the pharaoh plague any chance it could help us now i have already attempted contact with no success given its previous experience with accepting an outside network request i imagine it is unwilling to do so again right because last time hephaestus enslaved it well that's too bad i think the two of you would have had a lot to talk about there was an ancient tank embedded in the bulwark buried under a bunch of boulders any idea how it got there during the pharaoh plague the u.s military resumed the use of human combatants as automated machinery was unreliable it is possible the vehicle was part of a pre-automated war fleet so they fought against the pharaoh machines in the valley until the mountain was blasted apart and buried them [Music] when i dove down into vegas i found data about the man who built the dome over the city stanley chen it turns out he was a member of farzinith but if he loved vegas so much why did he abandon it why not try to save it the zeniths at their core have proven to be exceptional survivalists faced with overwhelming odds of extinction they chose to flee even still what he achieved water to the wasteland an entire city brought back to life a thousand years later the whole place was still on standby just waiting for someone to come along and wake it up when we were at the facility where we found beta there were records that said far zenith were researching embryogenesis i know they traded their ectogenic chambers to zero dawn but why were they researching it in the first place at this point we can only speculate perhaps at one time they meant the odyssey to be a colony ship necessitating such technology as their goals evolved over time so did their areas of research so they got more selfish as the risks of staying on earth kept rising gaia what was elizabeth like her presence is interwoven with my memories the moment i came online she was there we exchanged greetings names then set to our task it was the first of many conversations i enjoyed being in her company listening to her stories she was my creator my guide your friend yes when i reviewed the data on your focus i was saddened to learn of her fate though i am glad she made it home i deeply wish she did not have to be alone she was okay with that she gave all of herself the only one who could [Music] thanks kaya [Music] so project zero dawn the greatest minds in the world all working to build the terraforming system while the feral plague devoured the planet what was it like personnel worked in rotations at all hours of the day resources and technology were secured from across the world within a month of the project's conception i was launched and began my education encouraged me to spend time with the rest of the zero dawn staff she said it was important to experience many personalities and perspectives to aid in my emotional what were they like scared hopeful determined they were hurtling toward technological achievements on a scale never before attempted i owe everything to their dedication [Music] beta believes the zeniths want to use the terraforming system to wipe out life on earth start over so they can build it how they want further supporting our hypothesis but why given their technology they could wipe out the tribes the world by easier means and if they're the same people who left earth a thousand years ago wouldn't they want the biosphere to be as it was it is likely they adjusted to different planetary conditions in their colony on sirius they may be trying to recreate that environment here turning earth into a new serious their own personal playground so the zeniths are the same people who left earth physically immortal how'd they figure it out from what we know of far zenith it is plausible that prominent geneticists and engineers were offered a place aboard the odyssey in exchange for their expertise given enough time technology and resources any challenge can be overcome like how minerva eventually generated the deactivation codes for the pharaoh plague exactly the zenith gerard eric tilda verbena beta said they were some of the most powerful people on earth do you know anything about them unfortunately no my personal database is limited to those who worked on zero dawn additionally it appears far zenith was quite secretive about their members only one osvald was ever publicly known right here's the spokesperson back at the world launch facility what we can conclude from your and beta's experiences is that the zeniths are ruthless in pursuit of their goal to protect life on earth they must be stopped the extinction signal didn't just wake hades it made every subordinate function self-aware why i have wondered this myself so far as i can tell hades was a sole target and the partial sentience imparted to other subordinate functions was incidental a signal that precise would require thorough knowledge of the system how could the zenith know that from the records on your focus it appears far zenith had an informant during the development of zero dawn hank shaw he was supposed to steal a copy of the system for far zenith but elizabeth and travis tate caught him first yes it is likely far zenith acquired knowledge on the system's design through him despite his failure so from what beta told me i guess we can assume the zenith technology is powerful in all sorts of ways right yes as your encounters with them amply demonstrate they appear to make extensive use of robotic servitors further they seem to be equipped with some kind of protective energy field that shields them from harm they seemed indestructible but that weapon the rebels used stripped their shield somehow throughout history every defensive technology has eventually been defeated by an offensive counterpart while we lack the anti-shielding weapon where i to absorb hephaestus and utilize it to create a large force of combat machines no shielding could withstand such an assault indefinitely so there's hope always what can you tell me about demeter demeter sows fertilizes and tends to plant life so once i bring it back all the blood out there will start to get better while permanent restoration requires the abilities of hephaestus i may be able to improve conditions in the region for a while however a word of warning like ether and poseidon the meter's response to my query was highly irregular alone and frightened it may have taken measures to assure its security okay i'll keep my card up the missing subordinate functions what can you tell me about them artemis rewilded the earth with a variety of animal species elutia was responsible for gestating nurturing and culturing a new generation of human beings apollo was tasked with preserving organizing and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements unfortunately all archived apollo data was purged on the 2nd of february 2066 by order of ted pharaoh pharaoh huh i really hate that guy understandable he appears to have been pathologically narcissistic impulsive and unstable all three of the missing functions have already served their purpose or were prevented from doing so do you still need them restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density empowering my overall function unfortunately as we now know they are in the possession of far zenith attaining them in the short term is very likely impossible i guess our best shot at recovering them is by taking over the zenith base but we'll need hephaestus and a bunch of combat machines to do that correct were you able to make use of poseidon yes many rivers streams and lakes associated with the regional watershed have been detoxified as a result red algae growth levels have seen a marked decline according to my data however it appears a localized occurrence of red algae continues to persist near the coast maybe i'll look into it when i can so poseidon spent the last 20 years hiding out in las vegas from the data i found it seems the city had an advanced water reclamation system is that why poseidon went there most likely in an effort to protect itself poseidon sought out a safe harbor where it could access water supply functions there buried and encased in a protective dome it could guard against any threats like three awesome showmen i suspect that was not the first time it felt the need to repel trespassers so once hephaestus has been recovered and merged you'll regain the capacity to mass produce machines at cauldrons around the world yes and to program their behavioral routines or even control them directly so you could build an army of machines attack the zeniths and take them out it is in my nature to take any and all necessary steps to preserve life on earth human life above all so yes once i have been empowered with the capacities of a festus i could design build and command such an army given the nature of the far zenith threat doing so may be our only option i must admit however that i have misgivings about using such technology to kill no matter how aggressive the enemy that's good it means you have a conscience as elizabeth intended indeed you mentioned that the superstorms have subsided is that ether at work yes thanks to ether's capabilities weather patterns in the local region should mostly stabilize for the time being that'll be a relief for the tanakh one of their villages is still recovering after a mudslide caused the whole place to flood i will continue to stabilize the atmosphere for as long as i can why did ether take up residence in an ancient war museum as with the other subordinate functions ether needed to install itself on a processor with adequate storage and power one in the museum appears to have been sufficient given that the holographic displays were still active so ether was assured it could stay for as long as it needed to correct though it is curious that it chose a place surrounded with the ancient ruins of aircraft maybe it also felt at home there i should be going goodbye [Music] hi [Music] happy birthday isaac daddy sure does love his little big man she found that recording from the data on your focus she's been watching it a lot i think it helps calm her you know i used to watch this a lot too whenever i wanted to take my mind off things daddy sure does but there's something you need to tell me while you were gone i came down here to check on her then we started talking right beta she's been thinking about how to capture hephaestus studying the data gaia gave her but we started talking about some other stuff you know just getting to know each other right and then she told me that one of the zeniths might be different from the others tilda you saw her at the hades proving lab go on on the way to earth the zeniths never showed their faces my servant or caretaker referred to them as my benefactors and promised i'd meet them someday when i had learned enough and then one day a data channel opened in my training interface in it tilda was waiting for me in a virtual replica of a house on a cliff overlooking the ocean it was beautiful she showed me paintings books media files we met there in secret many times but a few months later it stopped can you tell us why veda i found some data about tilda at the haiti's proving lab i think she was a liaison between far zenith and zero dawn she knew elizabeth sobek that's for sure maybe that's why she reached out to you [Music] what else can you tell us about tilda she liked to talk about her paintings what about herself did she ever talk about her life on earth how she joined the zeniths something like that she never said much about herself and she hated it when i asked too many questions but i think back on earth she was an expert programmer given that she built a data channel the other zenith couldn't detect is there anything else about her that we might be able to use to our advantage she was the first real person who ever bothered to speak to me i wasn't really assessing her for strengths and weaknesses you said that tilda reached out to you using a data channel it appeared in my training interface as another assignment when i opened it there were a series of intermittent glitches i realized they formed a transpositional cipher instructions on how to open up a new virtual space when i entered it my training interface disappeared instead of the usual holographic teachers and files i was in a perfect recreation of her home and you're sure the other zeanis never knew about it to them it looked like i was still in training toiling away alone so this secret virtual space looked like a house with an ocean view i could see white caps and hear waves crashing on rocks below and there were gulls outside inside tilde had frames that showed off her favorite paintings changing at intervals to match the light there was an armchair she liked she'd sit there and gaze outside while i looked through her things we spent hours in that house i never wanted to leave you said tilda showed you paintings and let you access media files every time we met she showed me a new painting i i think she was dutch all of her favorite pieces were from their golden age in the 1600s portraits allegories ships at sea she had so many didn't interest you i liked her media portal it had so much more than my training interface clips shows hollows my favorite was this one called second time around about a family whose kid comes back after disappearing during the hot zone crisis right but did this portal have anything about the zeniths themselves anything we could use no any information about them was redacted so telda set up a secret virtual space where she could talk to you a house on a cliff then later she cut you off but other than the fact that tilden knew elizabeth you don't know why she did those things i don't okay i thought of every possible reason that would make her leave but whatever i did wrong i don't know what it is when i finally met the others she ignored me acted like the data channel never existed none of this even matters till it is the same as the others it won't help us defeat them okay let's leave it at that then what's wrong i'm trying varl but she is tough to take i'm out there in the wilds risking my life every day and all she can do is hide in there and tell us how hopeless it all is i'm sorry she's had a rough time but she is really not helping right now you always seem to be on top of everything so i sometimes forget about what you've been through i mean it wasn't that long ago you were so banged up you couldn't even walk about that when i pulled you out of the water back near the proving lab you were muttering rost's name you never talk about him but he raised you trained you you must miss him a lot of course i do but i don't have time to think about that now i need to get back out there okay i'll keep working with beta gaia says she knows a lot about zero dawn and maybe she just needs some time to adjust and then she can help us with hephaestus sure but i won't hold my breath the old ones used holograms for everything it let them experience a great many things holograms are illusions though i wonder if at some point they just couldn't tell what was real anymore maybe they were intelligent but that doesn't mean they were lies hey got a sec of course how's training discovering something new about our past every day when we first met you asked me if i ever wondered what this world looked like when the old ones lived here i thought it was strange at the time but a lot has changed since i left the embrace now i'm just trying to make sense of everything i thought i knew and versus everything i know now the change is hard but it gets easier over time it's hard to believe we're dealing with the original zenith the same ones that left for sirius a thousand years ago to live on for so long it doesn't seem natural because it's not that weapon we found where beta was hiding any chance we can use that against them silence made sure that wasn't an option why would he build something to hurt far zenith yet allow them to capture you with silence there's always an angle we just don't know what it is yet what do you make of this tilde the beta was talking about well the way she described it i can't shake off the feeling that tilda wanted something from beta maybe because she's elizabeth sobek's clone but whatever she wanted i don't think she got it if we knew what it was maybe we could use it to our advantage somehow i don't know i don't think tilda and elizabeth were on the best of terms oh well at least we can take some comfort in knowing the zeniths don't trust each other maybe you're feeling okay i was just thinking about beta and all that time spent with the zeniths to think someone would make a person just to lock them in a room to use when needed like some sort of tool elizabeth sobeck sacrificed herself for the world and yet they have no trouble treating beta like a slave another reason we have to stop them you brought up ross before i do think about him you know he was all i had and he brought me up the best he could not only that when hades discovered who i was and sent the eclipse after me [Music] he sacrificed himself so i could survive but that seems like ages ago so much has happened since what i'm doing now i don't think he could even begin to understand it the sacred lands were all he really knew so i can't let myself dwell on him not with everything i have to do i understand sometimes when i think about my sister about what she would have become if she had survived the proving it hurts and i just need to bury it for a while but only for a while eloy you can't ignore it forever memories always come back the ones that matter anyway i know but for now the mission has to come first fair enough i should get back out there we'll be here if you need us aloy hey how's everything going i am well but varl told me beta's having a hard time adjusting to life here with us i wish there was something i could do to help i'm not sure any of us can a tree won't bear fruit in a day we'll do our best to make her feel welcome are you going to learn next i'm not sure i asked gaia for suggestions and she brought up data you found on something called a museum from what i gather the old ones would store knowledge in them for all to see and learn from like you've done here for us maybe one day more people will be able to use this place to learn the way we have that sounds crowded but nice [Music] because he has stood a number on beta [Music] but she seems to trust verl i still can't believe she told him the zeniths are immortals old ones who cut themselves off from the cycle of life and decay i've never heard of anything so selfish to deny our dying bodies to the earth to doom the life that would bloom in their place it's despicable [Music] is there anything i can help with around here hmm oh no we're doing fine are you okay you and varl have been friends for a while i like to think so i was wondering what do you know about his mother oh that bad huh why do you want to know he's spoken of his sister vala but i noticed he avoids talking about his mother she's the warchief of the nora best warrior the tribe's ever known tougher than a thunderjaw but she could be pretty harsh at times i see that must have been hard on him thank you for telling me i feel silly not being able to ask varrell directly i wouldn't worry about it he's probably afraid sono will scare you off someday i'd like to see her try i should get going good luck on your search hey eloy uh it's everything all right it seemed like you and varl were down in that basement for a while yeah everything's fine i guess well okay uh what can i do for you it seems like you're getting a hang of this data thing that's been helpful when i could make sense of anything i did find the old ones enjoyed a good brew like the rest of us only they let machines serve the stuff in bars they even let the damn things cut you off before you saw the underside of a table uh that's half the fun now you won't see me letting a robot serve me a picture anytime soon i see someone's been playing strike i'm just trying to get some practice in helps to take my mind off things you should try playing catalog it's a tanakh game maybe you'll learn something uh sure tanakh sure he won't try and kill me if i win pretty sure do i smell ale i brought some over from chain scrape and with everything that's been going on i thought we could all use a drink besides there is nothing that brings people together like a good brew that's what my sister always said anyways you're more than welcome to have some maybe another time i should get going back to reading i guess do be careful out there beta's been difficult to figure out she's just so closed off i get that the zeniths were cruel to her that the one called tilda abandoned her but i can't get her out of her shell i don't know maybe nothing can but i know varyl meant well bringing up frost i just i guess it's hard to talk about with everything going on it feels easier to set those memories aside at least for now looks like i was able to unlock that door there's a lot of equipment in here gaia what was all this for this room was designed for management of the facility's vast city banks from here control center operatives would have monitored new crop rotations into the automated farmlands now known as plain song they see i've been tackling the design of the ag lab places and i have a lot of seed stock to work with my favorite sample 626 calatropus gigantia the crown flower we used to have one in our backyard butterflies always fluttering around every morning august would run out there to check under the leaves see if any caterpillars turned into chrysalis now i'd like to imagine that the future will be filled with them according to this console there are still thousands of plant samples stored deep below the facility i could ask i about them the next time i talk to her there it is mind if we have a word of course not what do you think of this place it must take some getting used to it's an efficient center of operations and an acceptable training facility but we could use some more color dudley noted have you spoken with aaron at all i've had little chance to i did see him bring some ale from out east that stuff's as bitter as self brush you get used to it eventually in fact i wouldn't mind a drink myself i'm sure aaron wouldn't mind sharing i should get going if i can help in some way say the word i will thank you coordinates the guy i gave me for demeter are close [Music] oh damn hold your fire i'm not here to fight the barbarians pin down move in okay whoever these people are it looks like we're not gonna be friends i need to get past these hostels and into the ruins [Music] that grapple there ready to die protect the site [Music] oh [Music] ugh why are they out for blood i better get to demeter fast in case there's more of them according to gaia it should be somewhere in these ruins uh no room on me i can send it to my stash looks like some sort of old office complex the greenhouse feral automated solutions industry-leading biotech research facility [Music] agritech environmental remediation organic waste management [Music] facility [Music] [Music] a little flower demeters should be right beyond that door but those vines are blocking the way unless i can cut through them i'm gonna need to find another way in a room with no way out great at least there's a console [Music] a log [Music] just got off the line with u.s robot command time's running out i didn't have the heart to tell harris that our cure might be worse than the disease even if adamantine wreath works we still have to prove we can curtail the trailing plants efficiently but kabul's team is working on it over at test station ivy he'll come through he has to without inventing race another secret project well they made the metal flowers here and the vines so maybe i can find a way to destroy them if i can find test station ivy [Music] how do i get out of here [Music] there we go great these guys again whoever they are they want me dead i'd better be careful [Music] so you
