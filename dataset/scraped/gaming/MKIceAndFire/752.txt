was blood spilled no we took werm without resistance these saxons accompany their lord as we stand beside guthrum so this fort is not the sum of his ambitions guthrum's plan is to bring the saxons to the table if he can win the peace without a fight he will do so and how likely is that just now they sit on their thumbs in the church talking in circles come i will take you to him who is good from meeting here is it alfred that's right the king of the west saxons has agreed to negotiate seems we have him on the back foot gotham should be careful alfred speaks with loki's tongue gotham is not a

will honor it we will leave this town you have one day do not test the king's patience further or our men will return to wear them with forks and if you doubt my conviction know that the avon river near uffentune runs red with the blood of your countrymen their commander what did his men cries he fell yes that was it remember you have taken my silver in return i expect your honor i will await news of your retreat in chippenham uber debt it cannot be gods i will tear that saxon skin from his bones if this is true alfred hisses with a snake town but he gains nothing from this lie when use of this spreads through the camp no saxon will survive the day you swore upon the cross oh i have no intention of cowing to that milk sack now more than ever i will take his throne and his head in winchester alfred used me as a tool and cast me aside so let the betrayer be betrayed we'll burn this village to the ground after that we take care of alfred destroy everything get round the side

and my claim it will not be enough you must find a weakness yes that is why i called you here do you booked at the opportunity to bury the saxon king i must first hear a plan to balkan alfred spoke of chippenham a squat hovel of sheep and peasants so why does he go there and not to winchester your scouts must know they're the best in england a holiday feast their saxon christ mass alfred will warm his heels by the fire while uber lies cold in an english field i've called upon my allies to join us in this fight but i must know where to send them is chippenham our final prize it is but uh i will need my men for the coming fight as well the hostages alfred took if there is a chance to save them we will not lose more friends today where are they held a place further ahead through this forest

called you raven feeder once at porchester you were as hot-headed as thor you have become a true leader evil as much to come get from before we can rest with need in our hands and songs in our ears i will cross alfred's skull with my bare hands if uber is dead we cannot dwell on this even if it's true if you want the throne only strategy will deliver it o bloody wrath will steal it i will follow this alfred hound his heels revenge burns within me a wise man once told me we do not dash ourselves against hopeless courses we arrive unexpected strike swift you turn my words against me now wolf kissed i took them too hard in my darkest times my friend and segu he is back with you my brother's story is a long one and for another time ridding the land of a strong ruler will make wessex harder to tame you almost sound like you respect him ivor i've come to understand the trials of leadership it is hard not to when you cradle something as fragile as life within your hands fade me be my eyes this is the blockage the hostages must be in these buildings what is your plan we can tread quietly so as not to alert the guard but i can rate this place in moments with my crew i will follow your lead i should not be seen in this area um um uh died go enough skulking these saxons do not deserve compassion i will wash my blade in their blood come on ugh yes are you kuthrom's men aye free us and

your people at the camp even a surprise takes preparation your bravery your leadership evil you wear it well you have grown much since last we spoke you judged me fairly guthrum harsh though your words were but i do not make the same mistake twice how is your brother sigurd he lives a changed man but he is free of full case torment that at least was a deed well done will this all be worth it in the end everything we have done everything we have sacrificed to win this land sometimes i dream of soothe black furrowed earth and blood seeping from seedlings poisoning our future we must believe our way of life will survive our fates are woven but our deeds forge our destiny ah and so to our final battle we will wait for you at the camp we must speak another matter that needs my attention i will meet you at the camp uber meeting his end at the avon river west of huffington the worst but i must know oh you from your debt and yet you came london is quiet enough and stow here felt the sharp stab of conscience could not let you down evil that's not what an honorable man does so here i am despite my reservations and you broder i did not think you would be here either i have seen to my brother sent him to valhalla with grave goods i am done with sorrow haver now i am bloody angry you have come again at my call i have but this does not sit well with me evil this is a christian feast and the people here are not soldiers i come only for alfred innocence will die for your ambitions i am your ally now but after this i must turn back to mercier i have much to repent so long as i do not lose your friendship your oath will be fulfilled after rochester i was not sure he would come again i've chosen my side i would soon a better hog than allow alfred to pillage the land of love guthrum will trample alfred's ambitions like weeds in the dirt mercier might rise further yet perhaps you shall one day sit upon the throne of all england king rich the drunken ass i'll raise a cup to that you suck look you saxon bedwetters here is a real warrior billy what tales are you weaving for these served downed saxons do not make me regret supporting your yeldom hey roy you know i will take your childhood scrapes and secrets to the pyre good i would hate for something to happen to you in the coming fight ha such fiendish ripple tree between you two you laugh in the face of fear tweak old man death's beard i will do my mother and my lord proud today evil the lord knows i've not been the best of sons good to see your spirits high fight well my friends and we'll feast together in victory you soft cheeks and grow boys have you brought your mothers with you my mother is worth ten of your men i do not doubt it i have seen those strong saxon hens clucking round the hearth as you farmers play with your [ __ ] ah and she'd welcome you in colchester villi better than those sour lip thanes who haunt our hall stand tall a light heart lifts all those around them ah evil who would not be joyous raving at your side and how do you feel about bringing sorrow to the saxons on their holy day it darkens my mood i have learned some of the christ's lord's teachings he preaches peace where our gods delight in battle let their delights be ours then we have many battles to wage before the end and i will be beside you for them all my axe ready and my heart stout there you are able lufena pure it warms my heart to see you well well as ever better since we skinned those order rats i hunted down more in winchester on alfred's behalf now we come to take his kingdom how quickly a coin can flip when tossed from hand to hand only a fool is a betting man i hear alfred thought to use me but he will find differently at chippenham you ava a lot my love i know i know this last of ray i hope the death will be cleared i long to return home it is good to see you i gave you my word besides alfred's faith is strict and he has no love for pagans you have changed much from that guard-whipped boy that is good to see i was always him but my faith was like a veil i am glad you helped me lift it and now another education you'll see how we norse bads fight i am all a quiver with anticipation do you believe the saxon lord is uber really dead i a few survivors found their way to us the great man is gone the last vestiges of ragnar's legacy begin to fade we have lost many fire bloods this land has sapped our strength there will be too few of us to settle when we are done avor you made it unscathed they came from all over england i never thought it possible avor that you would rally saxons and norse under your black feathered banner they see the tyranny of this elf king he would crush them all under heel and plug their hearts with his god so what is the plan avor when is their feast day a few nights from now but their revelry has already begun we should attack now that is unwise soldiers pace the paths of the village then the night of the feast on the cover of darkness that is when we will strike uber will not have died in vain we await your instructions avor let us plan our approach but whatever happens alfred is mine they are not expecting us we should not meet much resistance on the way then quietly through the fields it will already be too late once they see us your young saxons can be our eyes to the west better to keep their soft hands away from the conflict my scouts reported that a few nobles have arrived for the festivities already good if we capture the thanes there will be no danger when i confront alfred and we could persuade them to support a new king of wessex i will subdue the lords take dear love and tafter with you they could prove useful in convincing the fans rhoda take your atkins stove and capture the garrison make quick work of any saxons that dare cross into the village gladly haver we each know our parts may they blunt their swords against our might tonight wessex's last resistance will crumble i follow you ivor and i be ravening wolves and croaking ravens stand firm your axe arms strong and together we will win this final battle and remember alfred is mine soma with me everyone else go quickly to the village advance be on the lookout for any stray guards lufena cure keep a strong flank get to the village and wait for my signal i shouldn't be seen here let's smoke the rat out of his god's house show me what lies ahead alfred face me and i will spare the last of wessex my torch did you think my king would turn his back on you evil when your knife is smeared with the blood of wearer stand aside goodwin i come for alfred alfred is long gone and this good christian feast a cup of honey wine to trap some wasps where is he calling his allies to his side all those who wish to see wessex under one god you cannot win england with your sorry crew of deluded farmers and godless fools at least i wouldn't leave them to die as i scurried through the corn husks like a rat you have no understanding of duty the loyalty i freely give his plan for england for the world is worth the cost of my life then sing your tuneless hymns come raven feeder do your worst i have no fear of death for this battle is only the beginning only darkness will come to claim you ah yes died you are beaten goodwin beaten no not so by my death my lord may live alfred used you fool he threw you in my path for what he only delays what is inevitable kill me then it makes no odds for here you stand bloody and breathless no closer to my king no closer to his throne this island will never be your home evil you will not subdue her with vicious force or win her with cocksure words we saxons will always stand firm shoulder by shoulder against thieves and tyrants whose envious eyes fall upon england no i will use you as you used me a few hours in the company of my men and you will lead us to your sparrow king that i cannot allow uh they came from every house and hovel foreign for glory god grant me strength uh with room i need you fighting with the rest these men will not surrender and one little [ __ ] blog barricaded himself behind that door down i will find a way in so god damn you you oh hmm i need to see if broder has taken the garrison good work guthrum i hope the rest are bad as well i'll find them eat this come get up this is no time for weep wailing i i cannot and there is a blackness closing in around my eyes it frightens me forgive me homeworld i should have been quicker no no you were my staunch protector rich avor onwalt listen to me you survived the battle of bottleston do not let this scratch best you now i'm so cold as winter comes so soon you will warm yourself with mead and dancing yet my friend perhaps not ava it may be i will sit beside my father soon will he be proud of me he will pull you to his breast sob bright words of welcome and until you no man ever had a worthier son i am glad to have known you ava my truest there was nothing more you could have done friendship has a hollow ring there's no threat of losing it i need to see if broder has taken the garrison hmm what can i do anymore the garrison has more defenders than we hoped my men are being slaughtered i'll find a way to open the gate from the inside hurry these waves of reinforcements are hell sent hey thank you get back here oh make sure the garrison stays under our control i need to help the others your luck let us finish this okay yes the lord is my strength yes the last of these that's it they're fleeing they are routed the city is ours essex will follow look from y'all we are not without losses some of them grave their king is fled his patsy struck down defeat to rings loud in their ears and i will be their lord before the spring is here go from hear me so much she's gone zoma dead she has gone to the endless feast and is the better for it i must speak to those still living it is done brodia you fought well i saw him avoid in my darkest moment brother stood beside me and all was as it used to be and then the battle ended i feel him no longer there will be other battles i and there you'll find me haver in amongst the blood and death bruise here at my shoulder until the valkyries claim me you have given me more than i would ever have asked for how will i repay it keep him in your thoughts for when a man is mourned his deeds cheered and his songs sung he cannot die lufena gods i i did not know is he harsh what good can words do for key to silence he is gone for what days i was given to spend with you for each breath that carried your sweet whispers i give thanks no more your fingers in my hair no more your arms around my waist the days will be cold hereafter all color dimmed goodbye my only my heart ends with you what is left will go on your first battle eleritch you fought well and with honor is this the glory you didn't seek you can keep it i saw hoonwall die the light dim in his eyes that could have been me you will never be the same but you will be stronger for it i have wasted so much time in pouting like a child no more ava no more do you think there will come a day when winning will not be enough well you can always fight with me if you want to taste crushing and loin soiling defeat my very presence would make that impossible enjoy this victory ever whatever it brings you only a coward thinks you live forever okay you were a forward bro snow is taking matters hard you know how sensitive he is a man of faith and stout morals small wonder he is tormented his support for you has taxed him hard i will take him back to london maybe he will find some comfort there you are his comfort arcane not the city you watch he is in good hands my thanks though you came to my aid when you were free to turn away and still it breaks my heart to look upon what we've done today was it the right choice i do not know but it is done now if alfred had his way there would never be friendship between norse and saxon you fought for peace be proud of that i wish i could and in time perhaps i will you're not injured bruises that is all i've taken the lord into my heart and he watched over my sorry bones those who fell sit beside him now and one of my heathen friends i used to believe in damnation for all who turned from his light but there is a wondrous communion in friendship honored even though your godson preaches peace and we shall do that christians and pagans side by side never persecuted your christ would smile at that i think your freyja would too he shall come to judge the living and the dead deolave there's a solemn air about you to disturb such holy revels with blood and murder i fear god may never forgive me for this had your guard taken alfred's side we would not have won so it may be you did his work after all alfred still lives and now i am twice his enemy give me one more fight and i will gladly make it a third he is defanged and of little threat to us now that slippery eel may yet surprise you atonement is a long and lonely path and i must soon leave to take my first steps upon it your debts to me up hate i wish you well on your journeys my heart is heavy many fought for us and died they deserve peace are you ready to honor them yes there's nothing more to say time to send our friends to their great reward will you do the honors nothing awaits them they lived they died and now their bodies will burn to cinders saga ends here well do not share that with them victory is ours but it came at a great cost so my alcona who stood at guthrum's right hand she will live on in our memories from now to the end of days and to hear warrior husband and a friend he made the ultimate sacrifice i here repay it and to hoonwalt whose kind heart has now led him to his father's side may his god welcome him with open arms let us send them on their way all our beloved dead our fallen warriors and speed them today now so guthrum when the reeve died did he take comfort in knowing he would soon see his god he was strangely peaceful in the end as if death meant nothing we stumble through our years ravenous grasping spilling blood stealing gold and it is never enough this life is never enough would it not suit you to know there is something beyond all this not war and valor but quiet and peace i think i think the afterlife men hope for is only a reflection of their regret in this life all i wish for now is to live among the friends i've made that is what counts alfred made me swear fealty upon the cross of their god's son he held such faith in it a plain unadorned thing it burned between my fingers as if i had pulled it from the fire a feeling strange and powerful but gone in an instant i have not felt its like before what will you do now whatever i must do england is my final home ava and i will do what it takes to remain i should return to swannborough and tell her walt's fate better the news comes from me than a stranger i must don't be a stranger ever swan bro i no gods no don't say it please ever don't say it i am sorry oh my my poor swan oh god he thought bravely and turned the tide to secure victory your dear hoonbot died a hero and will be so remembered oh gods i know he would have fainted to hear such praise from your lips thank you ever thank you he walks among warriors now yes the lucky man i imagine he does i know words are poor solve for a wounded heart i will leave you to mourn and know that we are here for you always it's you you need us between you and me ava always thought you'd be a good job be well my friend evor did bassim contact you in norway he said he would be joining you yet here you are and i have no word from him i thumb this will be hard to hear but basim attacked us in norway vengeance for some transgression of ours imagined or real you mean you mean you slew him yourself sigurd and i together i know this comes as a i do not understand why would he do such a thing he loved sacred he loved you i do not understand it myself perhaps one day we can speak about this with more clarity but for now i am deeply sorry i have to go then go in peace you are a good boy good day my love hampton shire has fallen and with the kingdom of wessex but the cast was great maybe too great for all we gained rest then you have earned it on the backs of so many time will tell if it was worth it should we take this to your chamber hmm no need you
