[Applause] you have arrived at your destination bloom complex all this time she's been holed up in bloom ever since larson sold well me to bloom she's maintained close ties with the company this just gets better and better we need to narrow down where larson is hiding on the campus try to pull some data from bloom's server banks on it [Music] ah [Music] i'm quite excited to share this with you the board of directors the facility will be an extension of my quantum computing lab and will house certain other endeavors that i prefer not to share during this presentation this is valuable real estate you have under your feet it's as if you've been waiting for me to put it to good use what's this thing larson's got with secret underground facilities i swear right get to an elevator that can take you below ground nobody's here searching elsewhere we're all clear over here there's nothing here i'll [Music] oh disgusting so uh check neural upload status 90 not good enough load processor temperature dear god she's uploading herself jesus fox a few minutes away from immortality if you don't kill her upload will have no way of stopping her or daybreak so mate you've uncovered a gold mine of data here i'll harvest whatever i can while you save the world suggestions the neural upload is being rooted through the quantum computers in this lab packing them would stop the psychic bathroom becoming augmented super intelligence but no pressure or anything what was that corbett's disentangling connections we were today this isn't an accident you're here aren't you you didn't heed my warning so what are you doing redirecting memory access [Music] you should have stayed away you are making the biggest mistake of your life and you will pay daily for it stop now please before it's too late what did you do restart upload come on restart upload security to the quantum lab security to the quantum lab code red oh you're big [Music] don't [Music] i'm being i surprised okay listen to me what you saw in my lab that was nothing more than the early stages of a very important experiment it may not be pleasant but daybreak is the future of the human species the only future is look around corruption climate change nuclear war humanity is doomed to self-destruction but daybreak can change that help me bring about the next stage of human evolution we can save lives we can ascend that sec you're seeing all this she's dying you brought a friend everyone you killed and tortured all of that was to save your sorry life you're pathetic this isn't about me with our minds in the cloud humanity can enjoy any natural disaster we can be safe free and happy forever i don't give a [ __ ] about humanity your psycho brother wants what she wants and [ __ ] everyone else including your mother you still have time to make things right reactivate my upload let me live so i can continue my work mate you can't believe a single thing she says now shut down our life support finish this [Music] whatever you decide she can't stop you i can't stop you the choice is yours yes do what's right please don't don't do this [Music] dead good i'm proud of me nothing left to do now but take a few selfies with the corpse quickly though security's on the way be careful come on [Music] [ __ ] clever trick ugh [ __ ] classic london [Music] oh spread out search protocol what the hell happened out there it's done larson is dead thank [ __ ] one less liar in the world still though i can't help but think of those ai she created lobotomized enslaved [ __ ] now you're the most compassionate assassin i've ever had the pleasure of working with don't get soft on me now this was a professional arrangement let's keep it that way laters in the last adventure of detective bagley and his occasionally helpful human sidekicks we discovered that a billionaire tech mogul and a war profiteer both had secret plots to exploit human suffering and murder thousands a shocking twist i know speaking of the people we most suspect mary kelly's slave trade is bound to be any day now and we also just received a distress signal from a coffee shop of all places maybe the wi-fi is down or something is that relevant spagley yes obviously there's more to it than that but i knew i had to make a joke or you just chewed it out i've marked both leads on your optic is um this is strange one of our servers is being pinged constantly from the wi-fi of a particular star roger coffee why do i care yes i thought it was noise at first too but then i decoded the pings it's morse code three letters repeating over and over go on s o wait for it s suppose we should check it out forward me the coordinates you're it ready to go always hey you must be rubbing off on me because i just wanted to say you did go back there i'm glad to know i can trust you lot you're free to use the 404 hubs and complete contracts i'll be out there fighting the good fight hope i'll see you out there too laters i'm here what now that doesn't seem to be any obvious peril does there have a seat and i'll ping back the ip sending us the distress signal refuse to put up with this i missed what's the deal with this burner phone bollocks it's a crypto phone it's secure every device on ctos can be compromised if we're overheard we're dead both of us who is this not important what matters is that i have inside information on s-i-r-s and i believe the people who framed you are rogue officers and loathe as i am to say it dead sec may be my only hope to stop them you have my attention no more no less good i had coordinates to a meeting place on a device in that establishment ugly bean what are we getting into all right that's a wrinkle so this size bloke says zero day are a bunch of secret service [ __ ] i mean i suppose it does make sense the bombings were too sophisticated for randos but sirs could pull it off officially sirs or the signals intelligence response service uses surveillance data drawn from ctos to identify large-scale terrorist and criminal threats then they send albion to shoot the threats in the face for example and in the wake of escalating violence in london the sirs is extending the right to use lethal force to law enforcement and albion securities unofficially srs uses your data to read your mind and arrest you for having naughty thoughts so we have means and opportunity which leaves motive so as a fascist pricks but they're supposed to stop groups like zero day from doing terrorist shite why cause one when you meet this guy ask we have a situation signs of a struggle no trace of the sirs contact sirs may be onto him if you get access to the area's surveillance infrastructure i can rebuild the scene in ar i'll see what i can do all right mate what are you doing here i ain't seen nothing of what do you mean wait you don't look oh bollocks you're undercover aren't you trying to see if our talk eh ain't gonna happen all right take it easy i ain't seen nothing jesus let me help you you better back that's done it now return to the scene and i'll reconstruct what happened to our contact i repeat all units we have reports of a hostile in your area responding to the call over things just escalated checking it out suspect is unsighted unsighted sweeping area no sign of the target yet ctos are data reconstruction in progress that appears to be our contact [ __ ] it out yes it certainly doesn't look like his best day does it analyze the clues in the ar workspace to find out what happened to him this is a non-lethal weapon so odds are he's still alive though he may not want to be [Applause] they've taken our sirs contact away but they may still be nearby i can reconstruct the vehicle's path from unsecured cctv recordings that should allow you to follow it ai giant broken tech announced today that they are cancelling daybreak the neural mapping technology designed to allow people to live forever a spokesperson for the company told press the decision to shutter the project was made out of respect for the memory of their founder the late sky larsen what the company has in store following the death of their illustrious leader remains to be seen [Applause] uh [Music] the reconstruction is nearly finished and so is our contact if you don't hurry it looks like our contact assailant stopped here but i can't see them nearby let's analyze the data to see if we can find it data reconstruction in progress our contacts assailants are switching vehicles to elude pursuers which is standard operating procedure for private military perks like albion albion not sirs you sure what can i tell you they're mercenaries if you keep looking you might find out why they're interested in an srs whistleblower i've completed a thorough analysis the vehicle have concluded it is a van come on bagley give me something to work with well i also mentioned that the minute traces of sand in the tire tracks indicate that it's been on a construction site recently but you know me hate to sound like a smartass i've been scanning nearby construction yards for albion activity and long story short some dozie get has forgotten to turn off the security camera the makeshift torture room i want to see it i'm not going to use the camera you're malik a serves officer and a leaky [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not me i swear to god please please only a matter of time before it breaks bagley cordless initiate search protocol nobody's here searching elsewhere give up now moving on moving on no one's here [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh ugh you hear that noise that's it using lethal target's not here you're in trouble now [Music] running to cover up and down i'm taking fire search it's cool it's called calm i'm dead sec you called us of course you shouldn't have come here now i don't know for sure i betrayed them we just saved you no you've just damned us both look i'll upload the intelligence onto an anonymous ftp they'll explain everything nah you're gonna explain it first my name is richard malik i'm an intelligence analyst i believe zero day or rogue sirs officers who framed you for the bombings to seize power now they're murdering or blackmailing anyone who threatens them which now somehow includes me okay we'll see what buggy says about the intel just don't make me regret this man that i can't promise has made his way out and now i suggest you do the same [Music] oh uh hey [Music] all right okay i guess that was pretty cool can we look at the stuff he sent us please all right one second bagley analyze the intelligence to set up a briefing [Music] asap look i'm all for a sport of excitement but this seems genuinely dangerous we should walk away nah he needs our help may i present the third option just use him an srs whistleblower even one you don't trust could still help us find the [ __ ] that blew up half of london and framed deadset for it you don't have to invite him to your birthday just use his information solid plan all right [Music] i'm here are you ready to begin here's the gist malik's intelligence checks out a rogue faction of slrs officers framed deadset for the bombings to consolidate power over the government but now they've noticed that some people are standing up to the new order and they're blaming you i believe these are the people you call zero day i don't know their names but it's safe to assume they have a ring leader and in my experience overseas removing the leader sure take out the leader take out zero day but why now two weeks ago a shell company connected with zero days operations imported 40 kilos of semtex from an old soviet block depot but it never left london which means zero day is planning a bombing that will make those earlier bombings look like a bonfire and i think i know why as we're all now painfully aware false flag attacks are a common propaganda tool for death spots kill a load of people and the rest fall into line behind whoever says they won't let it happen again in this case zero day which means we both want to discover who's pulling zero day strings and stop them we need to get hold of the personnel dossiers of anyone connected with the earlier bombings in their cover-up then malik and i can analyze their common connections and work out who's in charge of zero day and i'll be on the con to observe so if malik's right zero they are some kind of shadowy cabal of spies who blew up half the city to secretly take control of the government but now they're pissed off that someone's standing up to them so they're going to do it again that's awful i agree you think they'd come up with something besides another bombing bit of a double beat isn't it is this our fault somehow like zero because we're standing up to them cut that victim flaming [ __ ] i'd rather get blown up a thousand times than lie down just so some wannabe tyrants can stamp on my face surprise you [ __ ] between my work with 404 and tracking down sky larson's neural map nightmares i thought i could do with a new workspace i could do with your help as well i just clocked a hit and run by a black cab happened a while ago but the news ain't picking up on it what about it oh i don't know maybe because all of london's black cabs are driverless run by ai dedsec i got a call about a possible kidnapping i'll send you the caller's info sounded like it was connected to something big we have a real chance to seek justice here cool cool we're on it [Music] you
