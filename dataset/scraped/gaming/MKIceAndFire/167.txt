it's pretty simple just hit the button right there on screen and we'll get moving in the meantime one of dre's people are gonna bring around the car the phone got stolen from we can do some forensics on it see if we can get a lead that way the more angles we try the greater chance we got is succeeding [Music] hey it's me your headset working okay i ain't got to tell you this but you need both

fib is tracking absolutely everything we get access to their system we'll know it all yeah but how okay their hq is totally secure they won't let you pass the security unless they want you to get past it for like an emergency or something i'm going to fake a fire drill they use smart systems these days totally hackable okay once that's happening they land onto the roof and go down through the skylight with the glass cutter you set them up with nice hey you got that [ __ ] we'll speak again when you inside okay you're looking for the communications room it'll be a security door [ __ ] if i got this right it's in the corner over on the east side [ __ ] they updated the security protocol i can't hack the door until the fire drill's over i look don't worry that's what i packed the bombs for let's blast that [ __ ] sometimes you gotta do it old school yeah the thing about old school is it's kind of loud we'll deal with it get to a terminal and plug in the thumb drive sweet i'm in i just need a little time okay how long before the fire drill's done yeah it's not so much the fire drill more like the squad of armed guards coming to investigate the explosion all right partner you
