and a bunch of his strengths you can see here this is back to just a really quick mid you can hit confirm and then this one's really good it's forward too it has really good range and it's got a couple of options and uh this version has yours in his normal attack because yours is four or four which is like a sweep kick where he knocks you down and he's a battery where he literally surfs on a wave and then he has this really cool back one four and the neat thing is this you can delay it and then appear on the other side of them so you can choose to switch sides or not now we're turning his throws and this is notable because uh like a few characters so first up is the around the world kick i to me this is the classic thing move um in this game one of the new things that we show that he's actually kicking you through a portal and you're coming out the other end so the move finally makes sense okay that sort of makes sense he also has this new water ball where he travels full screen and then captures the end of the izuna drop it's kind of like reading man you can use it to be punished or uh to end your combos and it has a question below if he goes full screen or if it's his armor breaker so if you're in the middle of the combo and you think they're gonna break away you can use that to punch you and then lastly here he has this really cool projectile i think this is one of the neat things about him it's a very fast good recovery high attack but he has two different ways to amplify it you can either let it and this is his evaporate where he literally turns into a pillar of water and he then becomes invincible projectiles and even normal attacks will just pass by him so you're going to have to either hit him like he's recovering or hit him as he's coming out of it it's pretty awesome and trolly so this variation is all about his uh quantum rifts and the water realm and he gets this new move it replaces the uh the bubble and it's like a big full sprint full screen but like half string slash it's got good pushback on the block when he amplifies it and he can actually do it in the air and what's cool is he can do it in the air two different ways you can go straight across or you can go down like a dive kick and it's very very quick and he amplifies it he gets the second hit then he gains this portal and once he has this on screen it'll absorb projectiles as you can see right here and the difference with evaporate is these gets to move around so variation two has this advancing palm strike and what's neat is he can actually delay it then he has this splash move and this actually leaves them standing and the rain gets advantaged you can use it to end all strings but it also re-scans if they're in the air so after a jungle combo you can do it and then that prevents them having any knock down at all so so this is his entire splash where he squirts this water out and this is awesome for preemptive anti-iran if you with a jump if you think a jump's coming you can absolutely regulate the air if the amplifies that you get the combo so what's really cool is this doesn't conflict with the around the world kit and that means he gets pretty swaggy combos because you get two different combo things so there's a lot if you want to use first off this costume is awesome i love the hood so first you get this tidal wave which is a really quick low with great receptively great range with the implies that it has a hundred active frames and this is also great for people that like to duck and then he also gets the classic nk trilogy water bubble uh which is a high so if they won't stop dubbing it you can use the tidal wave and that's going to regulate you know mid mid screen and the neat thing about the bubbles and amplifies it he can choose which direction they're going to fall he gets four different options so he can throw him back over his head uh straight up or down in bounds there's four different reactions there's four different ways to combo them you could throw them out of the corner you could throw them into the corn you could do max damage you can get [Music] [Music] foreign
