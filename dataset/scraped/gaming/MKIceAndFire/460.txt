after years of poor economic performance exogeny has announced that its research colony on pharos is finally returning a profit new discoveries and a dedicated colonization effort have finally paid off for exogeny exogeny stock rose sharply with the announcement with investors pleased at this surprising news [Music] commander i'm reading a signal must be our solari infiltration team check out those defense towers drop the mako we'll go in hot and take them up i'll get you in underneath their radar commander [Music] got a clean drop commander stay out of range and continue evasive maneuvers until i bring those aaa towers down i know the drill meet the camp once those towers are offline joke around so so no there's our target so [Music] [Music] i'm reading that the grid is down commander on approach to the solarian base now out ready to continue on your mark commander shepard me [Music] [Music] that's it nothing between us and the solarian camp now commander normandy's touched down at the base but it looks like we're grounded the salarian captain can explain what you get here so what are we supposed to do now stay put until we can come up with a plan are you in charge here what's the situation i'm captain kirahi third infiltration regiment stg you and your crew have just landed in the middle of a hot zone every aaa gun within 10 miles has been alerted to your presence that's just great what now we stay put until the council sends the reinforcements we requested we are the reinforcements what you're all they sent i told the council to send a fleet we couldn't understand your transmission they sent me to investigate that is a repetition of our task i lost half my men investigating this place so what have you found saren's base of operations he set up a research facility here but it's crawling with geth and very well fortified is he here have you seen him no but his geth are everywhere and we've intercepted some calms referring to saren this is his facility there's no doubt about that what's sarin researching he's using the facility to breed an army of krogan how is that possible apparently sarin has discovered a cure for the genophage what's so important about curing this genophage it was the solution to the krogan problem we introduced the genophage to the krogan population after the uprising to quell their numbers without it the krogan will quickly overrun the galaxy and these krogan follow sarin the geth are bad enough but a krogan army he'd be almost unstoppable exactly my thoughts we must ensure that this facility and its secrets are destroyed destroyed i don't think so our people are dying this cure can save them if that cure leaves this planet the krogan will become unstoppable we can't make the same mistake again we are not a mistake is he going to be a problem we already have enough angry krogan to deal with he'll be fine i'll talk to him i'd appreciate that commander my men and i need to rethink our plan of attack can you give us some time go ahead captain i'll come back soon we won't be long commander in the meantime if you need any supplies you can talk to commander rentola he's in one of the tents nearby looks like things are a bit of a mess yeah i wouldn't be so worried if it wasn't for rex looks like he's gonna blow a casket you think i should go talk to him it wouldn't hurt well it might actually just do it carefully i'll be careful but be ready just in case i'm always ready this isn't right shepard if there's a cure for the genophage we can't destroy it i understand you're upset but we both know saren's the enemy here he's the one you should be angry with really saren created a cure for my people you want to destroy it help me out here shepard the lines between friend and foe are getting a little blurry from where i stand this isn't a cure it's a weapon and if saren is allowed to use it you won't be around to reap the benefits none of us will that's a chance we should be willing to take this is the fate of my entire people we're talking about i've been loyal to you so far hell you did more for me than my family ever did but if i'm going to keep following you i need to know we're doing it for the right reasons rex these krogan are not your people they're slaves of saren tools is that what you want for them no we were tools for the council once to thank us for wiping out the rachni they neutered us all i doubt saren will be as generous all right shepard you've made your point i don't like this but i trust you enough to follow your lead just one thing when we find saren i want his head your ability to calm the krogan is impressive i'm surprised you were able to reason with a krogan normally i wouldn't think much of solarians in a firefight these soldiers seem well trained it won't be an easy fight but we're ready when you are nice work with rex the upcoming battle frightens me but i know 7 must be stopped thank you for speaking with the krogan the assault on saren's base will be difficult enough as it is i assume that means you've come up with a plan of sorts we can convert our ship's drive system into a 20 kiloton ordinance crude but effective nice drop that nuke from orbit and sarin can kiss his turry and ass goodbye unfortunately the facility is too well fortified for that we'll need to place the bomb at a precise location where do we take the nuke and how do we get there the bomb must be taken to the far side of the facility your ship can drop it off but we'll need to infiltrate the base disable the aa guns and pacify any ground forces first you want us to go in on foot we don't have enough men it does sound a bit risky is there no other way no but i think we can work around that i'm going to divide my men into three teams and hit the front of the facility while we've got their attention you can sneak your shadow team in the back it's a good idea but your people are going to get slaughtered we're tougher than we look commander but it's true i don't expect many of us will make it out alive and that makes what i'm going to ask even more difficult i need one of your men to accompany me to help coordinate the teams we'll need someone who knows alliance communication protocols i volunteer commander not so fast lt commander shepard will need you to arm the nuke i'll go with the solarians with all due respect gunnery chief it's not your place to decide why is it that whenever someone says with all due respect they really mean kiss my ass williams you'll accompany the captain no heroics understood aye aye commander i will have the ordinance loaded onto the normandy and greet your crew on its detonation sequencing do you have any questions before we go commander i'm ready when you are captain excellent then if you'll excuse me i need to prepare my men well this is it don't do anything stupid while i'm gone lt you too commander we'll be fine you'll see yeah i just good luck is there something you want to say chief i don't know it's just weird going under someone else's command i've got used to working with you all of you don't worry we'll see you on the other side i know i it's been an honor serving with you commander it doesn't matter if we're not in the same unit we're still a team watch each other's backs keep your eyes open and fight like i know you can we'll all come out of this in one piece you bet commander you all know the mission and what is at stake i have come to trust each of you with my life but i have also heard murmurs of discontent i share your concerns we are trained for espionage we would be legends but the records are sealed glorying in battle is not our way think of our heroes a silent step who defeated a nation single shot or the ever alert who kept armies and made hidden facts these giants do not seem to give a solace here but they are not all that we are before the network there was the fleet before diplomacy there were soldiers our influence stopped the rachni but before that we held the line our influence stopped the krogan but before that we held the line our influence will stop staring in the battle today we will hold the line good luck commander i hope we will meet again [Music] do you read me commander loud and clear good we'll start our push we'll try to make it to the a.a guns but it might be up to you to finish the job and commander if you see any way to undermine their defenses we could definitely use the help shadow is on the ground shadow is on the ground chief williams with igor team manova teams move time to get some attention so is under coordinated crossfire check for long-range turrets helping the guest target foreign foreign [Music] [Music] hmm something scrambled they're targeting we've got a shot chief williams take the heat off manavi oh oh [Music] they're calling sat strikes dieto watch for khan stations williams can you see [Music] four anything four [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we're getting pounded bunker up before the aircraft returned [Music] [Music] hold that line [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] holding ground jf around me shadow team must be getting close [Music] we've got access to base security you should be able to cut the alarms might even be able to trigger alarms on the far side of the base it'll clear out the guards for us but they might be too much for the solarian teams to handle just disable the alarms we can handle any guards inside go um [Music] [Music] is someone out there [Music] okay can we hold him here damn fill those holes come on shepard [Music] saren's experiments have to be stopped [Music] uh what is going on here where are the guards where is sarah no stay back this is important work this is the glorious salvation of my species you will not destroy the work we have started [Music] take out those hostiles [Music] don't shoot please i just want to get out of here before it's too late i'm not going to hurt you who are you [Music] granothanoptis neurospecialist but this job isn't worth dying over or worse you think the indoctrination only affects prisoners sooner or later saren will want to dissect my brain too i thought this was a breeding facility not this level we're studying sovereign's effect on organic mines at least that's what i assumed saren kept us in the dark as much as possible you helped him and you didn't even know why i didn't have the option of negotiating this position is a little more permanent than i'd expected but i can help you this elevator behind me goes to saren's private lab i can get you in [Music] see full access all of saren's private files are we good can i go what were you studying here it's that ship sovereign and amidst some kind of signal undetectable but it's there i've seen the effects saren uses it to influence his followers to control them it's called indoctrination direct exposure to the signal turns you into a mindless slave like the solarian test subjects but there's collateral damage too i'm gonna blow this place to hell and gone if you want to make it out alive you better start running what you can't but i'll never ah you enjoyed that [Music] [Music] [Music] commander look over here it's another beacon like the one on eden prime [Applause] [Music] foreign sarah needs to pay for what he's done to my people i get the feeling something bad is about to happen you are not sarin what is that some kind of vi interface rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh you touch my mind fumbling in ignorance incapable of understanding i don't think this is a vi there is a realm of existence so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it i am beyond your comprehension i am sovereign sovereign isn't just some reaper ship saren found it's an actual reaper reaper a label created by the protheans to give voice to their destruction in the end what they chose to call us is irrelevant we simply are the protheans vanished 50 000 years ago you couldn't have been there it's impossible organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation an accident your lives are measured in years and decades you wither and die we are eternal the pinnacle of evolution and existence before us you are nothing your extinction is inevitable we are the end of everything there is an entire galaxy of races united and ready to face you confidence born of ignorance the cycle cannot be broken [Music] cycle what cycle the pattern has repeated itself more times than you can fathom organic civilizations rise evolve advance and at the apex of their glory they are extinguished the protheans were not the first they did not create the citadel they did not forge the mass relays they merely found them the legacy of my kind why would you construct the mass relays then leave them for someone else to find your civilization is based on the technology of the mass relays our technology by using it your society develops along the paths we desire we impose order on the chaos of organic evolution you exist because we allow it and you will end because we demand it they're harvesting us they're here to wipe us out what do you want from us slaves resources my kind transcends your very understanding we are each a nation independent free of all weakness you cannot even grasp the nature of our existence where did you come from who built you we have no beginning we have no end we are infinite millions of years after your civilization has been eradicated and forgotten we will endure where are the rest of the reapers are you the last of your kind we are legion the time of our return is coming our numbers will darken the sky of every world you cannot escape your you're not even alive not really you're just a machine and machines can be broken your words are as empty as your future i am the vanguard of your destruction this exchange is over commander we got trouble hit me joker that ship's sovereign it's moving i don't know what you did down there but that thing just pulled a turn that would shear any of our ships in half it's coming your way and it's coming hard you need to wrap things up in there fast this console's been disabled orders commander let's head to the breeding facility joker can pick us up after we set the [Music] nuke [Music] the guests are turning shepard must be getting close janto circle around keep them here [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so shhh [Music] so foreign look out okay we've got the other one in our sights i'm going to tear this whole place down [Music] saren's experiments have to be stopped the solarians will do their part let's just make sure we do ours there's the gun clear though and get the charges set oh are set everyone get low now all right nice work that's one less thing to worry about commander i'm bringing us in i'll get as close to the site as i can bomb is in position we're all set here commander can you read me the nuke is almost ready get to the rendezvous point williams negative commander the guests have us pinned down on the aa tower we've taken heavy casualties captain kirahi is dead we'll never make the rendezvous point in time get them out of there joker now negative it's too hot can't risk it we'll hold them up as long as we can it's okay commander i need a couple of minutes to finish arming the bomb go get them and meet me back here up to the aa tower move oh foreign i'm a little busy here so it's already here there's geth pouring out all over the bomb side can you hold them off there's too many i don't think we can survive until you get here i'm activating the bomb alenko what are you doing i'm just making sure this bomb goes off no matter what it's done commander go get williams and get the hell out of here screw that we can handle ourselves go back and get alenko alenko radio joker and tell him to meet us at the bomb site yes commander i you know it's the right choice lt i'm sorry ash i had to make a choice i understand commander i don't regret a [Music] thing not now shepard [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] commander set that nuke and get out we can't hold them damn it suppressing fire cover your flank cover your [Applause] [Music] i applaud you shepherd my guests were utterly convinced the solarians were the real threat an impressive diversion of course it was all for nothing i can't let you disrupt what i've accomplished here you can't possibly understand what's really at stake why are you doing this you've seen the vision from the beacon shepherd you of all people should understand what the reapers are capable of they cannot be stopped do not admire yourself in pointless revolt do not sacrifice everything for the sake of petty freedoms the protheans tried to fight and they were utterly destroyed trillions dead but what if they had bowed before the invaders but the protheans still exist a submission not preferable to extinction do you really believe the reapers will let us live now you see why i never came forward with this to the council we organics are driven by emotion instead of logic we will fight even when we know we cannot win but if we work with the reapers if we make ourselves useful think how many lives can be spared once i understood this i joined sovereign though i was aware of the dangers i had hoped this facility could protect me you're like every other poor bastard in this place a tool sovereign could use then cast aside i've studied the effects of indoctrination the more control sovereign exerts the less capable the subject becomes that is my saving grace the sovereign needs me to find the conduit my mind is still my own for now but the transformation from ally to they believe sovereign to be some kind of god the pinnacle of their own evolution but the reaction of their deity is most telling it is insulted sovereign does not desire the pitiful devotions the gather hermitage they are just tools and no amount of belief on their part will change that but as tools they are useful they will survive the coming invasion if organic life is to survive we must also prove we are useful we must work with the reapers tell me why sovereign needs the conduit tell me what it is maybe we can find a way to stop them the conduit is the key to your destruction and my salvation sovereign needs my help to find it that is the only reason i have not been indoctrinated sovereign's manipulating you and you don't even know it you're already under its power no sovereign needs me if i find the conduit i've been promised a reprieve from the inevitable this is my only hope together we can stop sovereign we don't have to submit to the reapers we can beat them i no longer believe that shepard the visions cannot be denied the reapers are too powerful the only hope of survival is to join with them sovereign is a machine it thinks like a machine if i can prove my value i become a resource worth maintaining there is no other logical conclusion you were a spectre you were sworn to defend the galaxy then you broke that vow to save yourself i'm not doing this for myself don't you see sovereign will succeed it is inevitable my way is the only way any of us will survive i'm forging an alliance between us and the reapers between organics and machines and in doing so i will save more lives than have ever existed but you would undo my work you would doom our entire civilization to complete annihilation and for that you must die [Music] oh [Music] all right everybody hang on i can't believe that ash didn't make it how could we just leave her down there williams do the risks going in she gave her life to save the rest of us but why me why not her it wasn't your color linko i had to choose i chose you but if i'd done my job you wouldn't have had to make that call it wasn't your fault it wasn't my fault the only one to blame here is sarah yes sir i'm we'll get it done commander excuse me for interrupting but i have an idea i think the beacon you found in seren's base was similar to the one you found on eden prime it may have filled in the missing pieces of your vision i might be able to help you put all those pieces together you want to join our minds again don't you okay go ahead relax commander embrace eternity oh [Music] incredible i i never thought the images would be so intense i need a moment to collect myself did the vision make any sense to you it's a distress call a message sent out across the prothean empire a warning against the reapers but the warning came too late what about the conduit there were other images locations places i recognize from my research ilos the conduit is on ilos that is why sarah needed to find the new relay it is the only way to get to ilos how come you never told us about ilos before the mu relay links to dozens of systems in hundreds of worlds how was i to know ilos was the one we wanted without the cipher the images in your visions were never clear only now do i recognize them as landmarks from ilos we need to get to ilos forget it the mu relays inside the terminus systems alliance ships are not welcome there neither are specters the conduits on ilos that's where saren is heading i'll be waiting for him when he gets there saren will have his entire fleet orbiting islos you will never make it down to the surface without reinforcements you must alert the council we need a fleet too i am sorry the joining is exhausting i should go to the medical bay and lie down for a moment dr chakwa should take a look at you that will not be necessary i just need we're done here dismissed commander there's a con buoy nearby i can link us in if you want to report back to the citadel council you know to warn him about sovereign set the link up joker they need to know patching it through commander shepard i'm pleased to see your mission on vermire was a success sarin is formidable enough without an army of krogan serving under him the krogan would have served sovereign a reaper yes we saw a mention of this on your report sovereign ascension machine a true artificial intelligence this news is quite alarming if it turns out to be accurate sovereign's a reaper saren admitted it he's playing you shepherd sarah still has contacts on the citadel you probably saw your earlier reports the ones talking about your vision and the reapers it's highly possible sarin is using false information to throw you off balance our own intelligence has never turned up any corroborating information sooner or later you're going to have to take something i say on faith counselor try to see this from our perspective commander sarin is a threat we can recognize however as far as we know the reapers only exist in your visions our decisions affect trillions of lives we cannot act on the accusations of a single person even a specter not without solid evidence the council cannot take any official action here that is why we created the specters you have the authority to act as you see fit if you truly believe sovereign is the real threat you must take whatever steps are necessary to stop it and serene good luck commander from all of us i forwarded the mission update to the citadel commander we got confirmation on those reinforcements ambassador udino wants us to report back to the citadel the council is massing a joint species fleet to deal with sarin in his gaff i knew they'd come around back to the citadel joker i want the normandy at the head of that fleet yes sir [Music] good job shepard thanks to you the council's finally taking real action against seven the ambassador is correct if saren is foolish enough to attack the citadel as you believe we will be ready for him patrols are stationed at every mass relay linking citadel space to the terminus systems you think a blockade is going to stop him he's on ilos looking for the conduit right now what are you doing about that ilos is only accessible to the mu relay deep inside the terminus systems commander if we send a fleet in there the only possible outcome is full-scale war now is the time for discretion commander sarin's greatest weapon was secrecy exposed he is no longer a threat this is over one ship going into the terminus systems won't start a war i can be discreet you detonated a nuclear device on vermeyer i wouldn't call that discrete your style served you well in the traverse commander we recognize that but i lost requires a deft touch we have the situation under control secrecy isn't his greatest weapon the conduit is saren is a master manipulator the conduit is just a distraction from his real plan to attack the citadel sovereign's the real threat saren's just a servant of the reapers only you have seen the reapers and then only in visions we won't invade the terminus systems because of a dream if saren finds the conduit we're all screwed we have to go to ilos ambassador udina i get the sense commander shepherd isn't willing to let this go there are serious political implications here shepard humanities made great gains thanks to you but now you're becoming more trouble than you're worth you bastard you're selling us out it's just politics commander you've done your job now let me do mine we've locked out all the normandy's primary systems until further notice you're grounded are you insane after everything i've done you still don't believe me i think it's time for you and your team to leave commander this no longer concerns you the council can handle this with my help of course commander shepard i cannot believe they did this to you i am so sorry it's not your fault it's not right you did everything they asked and more nobody else could have done what you did the council owes you everything everything instead they strip you of your command and ground the normandy i don't care if they ground me but they refuse to go after saren if they don't stop him from finding the conduit we're all dead perhaps we could appeal and get them to reverse their decision i pushed them as hard as i could they wouldn't budge so you're going to walk away you will just give up and doom the entire galaxy to extinction we're out of the game for now but i'll find a way back in i believe in you shepard i am with you every step of the way sorry to interrupt commander got a message from captain anderson are you spying on us joker no sir just knew you were on the ship and figured i'd pass the message on the captain said to meet him at flux that club down in the wards you should probably go meet with him equalizing interior pressure with exterior atmosphere logged the commanding officer is ashore exo pressly has in breaking news chairman burns of the parliament subcommittee on transhuman studies has been kidnapped by biotic extremists the biotics commandeered a freighter and were last seen in the hades gamma cluster no demands have yet been made [Music] so so yeah what is it why were you tossed out of there doran didn't have a clue what i was doing he assumed i was cheating i know dora if he says you're cheating you're cheating i was just tipping the scales in my favor only as an experiment it still sounds like cheating to me to you maybe but this device is merely intended to simulate situations and record results recording losses is easy of course nobody notices those why do you need to record these outcomes ah now you're getting to the heart of it i've spent the last five years developing a system that can accurately predict wins and losses on the quasar i just need a few more recorded wins and i can complete the algorithms can you do that isn't that illegal it's illegal to use my system but i won't use it i'll sell it to others i just need a few more wins recorded i think i'll take my chances the old-fashioned way suit yourself well i have some calculations to do goodbye i still can't believe that could happen out in the open like that neither could he the seasick agent said there has been an increase in violent crimes in this area lately did he say why i don't like them they all act like they've been living here forever the citadel is out they pulled me off the mission just like when they forced you to give up the normandy i know i'm sorry i wanted to warn you but there was no way to get a message to you before you docked i know you're pissed off right now but you can't give up they all think this is over but we both know it's not you have to go to ilos you have to stop saren from using the conduit there's only one ship that can get me into the terminus systems undetected and she's grounded citadel controls locked out all the normandy's systems but if we override the ambassador's orders we can get them to bring the normandy back online you can be indeterminate systems before anyone even knows you're gone if we steal the normandy you're the one left holding the bag and if saren finds the conduit life as we know it is over the reapers will destroy us humans are sorry everybody you're the only one who can stop him shelter so i'll do whatever it takes to get you on the normandy and off this station stealing the normandy is mutiny what if the crew won't help me the normandy's your ship now commander her crew will follow you to the ends of the galaxy we both know that i won't forget this captain i promise i can unlock the normandy from one of the consoles in the citadel control center you'll have a few minutes before anyone realizes what happened that's a restricted area patrolled by armed guards how are you going to get in leave that to me just make sure you're in the normandy when the systems come back online there's got to be a better way ambassador udina issued the lockdown order if i can hack into the computer in his office maybe i can override it he won't just stand by while you use his computer hopefully he won't be there if he is i'll just have to think of something the ambassador won't forgive this captain you'll be charged with treason a capital offense we don't have a lot of options i break into the ambassador's computer or i take my chances with the patrols in citadel control it's your call captain i'll break into the ambassador's office he made this personal you ready to get the hell off this station commander let's do it i'll take care of the lockdown you get down to the normandy and tell joker to stand by in remembrance of eden prime we present another profile in courage with servicemen nirali bhatia a devoted wife and talented chef serviceman bhatia joined the alliance military under the deferred education plan after finishing her service bhatia planned to open a restaurant instead she gave her life protecting the colonists of eden prime for more profiles in courage or to explore opportunities in the military please visit the alliance military on the extranet keyword courage standby shore party decontamination in progress anderson what are you doing here i didn't [Music] get us out of here joker now so [Music] [Music] message coming in patching it through commander i'm glad you were in the area we've got an emergency situation and you're the only one i can trust to get the job done how can i help admiral bionic fanatics have hit a medical research station with a psychotropic drug the drugs have temporarily driven researchers crazy and the biotics are effectively using them as human shields i'll do everything within my power to bring those researchers back safely admiral i know you will commander i'm sending you the station coordinates now fifth out shepard may i speak with you i was just thinking about you i have been thinking about you too and what we are about to face i do not know what is going to happen on ilos i hope we will stop sarin of course but part of me fears we are already too late there is something i must tell you in case we fail we're not going to fail i promise please i am not looking for comfort seren might already have the conduit it is time to be completely honest with each other these could be our last moments together our last chance to show each other how we feel i want this to be special we don't have to do this not unless you're sure i have never been more sure of anything in my life will you join with me shepard let our bodies and minds unite just tell me what to do [Music] by the goddess that was incredible shepard you were incredible five minutes eta to the mu relay i had better go duty calls you would not want to keep joker waiting shepard whatever happens on ilos i just wanted to say thank you for everything [Music] [Music] uh commander we've got company have their sensors picked us up yet well stealth systems are engaged unless we get close enough for a visual they won't have any idea we're here picking up some strange readings from the planet's surface take us down joker lock in on the coordinates negative on that commander the nearest landing zone's two clicks away we'll never make it in time on foot get us something closer there is nowhere closer i've looked drop us in the mako you need at least 100 meters of open terrain to pull off a drop like that the most i can find near sarin is 20. 20 meters we'll never get in close enough for a drop we have to try find another landing zone there is no other landing zone the descent angle's too steep it's our only option it's not an option it's a suicide run we don't i can do it joker i can do it gear up and head down to the makeup joker drop us right on top of that bastard you two keep moving inside now we have to get inside this bunker before saren finds the conduit there's no way we're getting past that door with brute force sarin found some way to open it there must be some kind of security override somewhere in this complex we'll have to find some way to get it up and running again now it gets fun [Music] [Music] hmm shh do hey [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] shhh so so [Music] there's something in here foreign [Music] a lot of people died here long ago now it's time for a lot of geth to join me this place still has power it must be running off its own generator i bet this is the command center for the entire complex we'll have to figure out how to disengage the security lockdown if we ever want to get inside so so [Music] [Music] there's something in here come on saren's already got a head start we have to go find him before he reaches the conduit unless he's already found it then we're just walking into a trap that's a chance we'll have to take hold on something's happening truly invading fleets sounds like some kind of message but i don't recognize the language it's probably in prothean this recording must be fifty thousand years old no wonder we can't understand it the message is all broken up but i recognize some of the words it's a warning against the reaper invasion incredible the cipher must have transferred an understanding of the prothean language into your mind not safe seek refuge inside the archives what's it saying can you make out anything useful odd reapers the citadel overwhelmed only hopes it said something about the conduit but it's too degraded to help we should go cannot be stopped cannot be stopped now it's time [Music] who votes we take the vehicle into the creek i thought sarah would have said some kind of trash what are all those things on the wall some kind of containers they look like cryogenic so what's happening it's a trap sarah must have said an ambush i don't think saren's behind this [Music] what do you think we're gonna find down here it has to be useful if it specifically targeted us don't get your hopes up the only thing we can depend on right now is ourselves you are not prothean but you are not machine either this eventuality was one of many that was anticipated this is why we sent our warning through the beacons looks like some kind of vi program pretty badly damaged i do not sense the taint of indoctrination upon any of you unlike the other that passed recently perhaps there is still hope wait a minute how come i can understand you why aren't you speaking the prothean language i have been monitoring your communication since you arrived at this facility i have translated my output into a format you will comprehend my name is vigil you are safe here for the moment but that is likely to change soon nowhere will be safe are you some kind of artificial intelligence program i am an advanced non-organic analysis system with personality imprints from quesadilla chief overseer of the ilos research facility why did you bring me here you must break a cycle that has continued for millions of years but to stop it you must understand or you will make the same mistakes we did the citadel is the heart of your civilization and the seat of government as it was with us and as it has been with every civilization that came before us but the citadel is a trap the station is actually an enormous mass relay one that links to dark space the empty void beyond the galaxy's horizon when the citadel relay is activated the reapers will pour through and all you know will be destroyed how come nobody ever noticed the citadel was an inactive mass relay the reapers are careful to keep the greatest secrets of the citadel hidden that is why they created a species of seemingly benign organic caretakers the keepers maintain the station's most basic functions they enable any species that discovers the citadel to use it without fully understanding the technology reliance on the keepers ensures no other species will ever discover the citadel's true nature not until the relay is activated and the reapers invade how do the reapers survive out in dark space we have only theories the researchers here came to believe the reapers enter prolonged states of inactivity to conserve energy this allows them to survive the thousands and thousands of years it takes for organic civilization to rebuild itself but in this state they are vulnerable by retreating beyond the edges of the galaxy they ensure no one will accidentally discover them they keep their existence hidden until the citadel relay is activated the reapers can wipe out the council and the entire citadel fleet in a single surprise attack that was our fate our leaders were dead before we even realized we were under attack the reapers seized control of the citadel and through it the mass relays communication and transportation across our empire were crippled each star system was isolated cut off from the others easy prey for the reaper fleets over the next decades the reapers systematically obliterated our people world by world system by system they methodically wiped us out [Music] some of you must have managed to survive through the citadel the reapers had access to all our records maps census data information is power and they knew everything about us their fleets advanced across every subtle region of the galaxy some worlds were utterly destroyed others were conquered their populations enslaved these indoctrinated servants became sleeper agents under reaper control taken in as refugees by other protheans they betrayed them to the machines within a few centuries the reapers had killed or enslaved every prothean in the galaxy they were relentless brutal and absolutely thorough i don't understand where did the reapers go after they conquered your people our worlds were stripped bare harvested by the indoctrinated slaves everything of value all resources all technology was taken certain that all advanced organic life had been extinguished the reapers retreated back through the citadel relay into dark space sealing it behind them all evidence of the reaper invasion had been wiped away only their indoctrinated slaves were left behind abandoned mindless husks no longer capable of independent thought the indoctrinated soon starved or died of exposure the genocide of the protheans was complete what did the reapers get out of this why do they keep repeating this pattern of genocide over and over the reapers are alien unknowable perhaps they need slaves or resources more likely they are driven by motives and goals organic beings cannot hope to comprehend in the end what does it matter your survival depends on stopping them not in understanding them you said you brought me here for a reason tell me what i need to do the conduit is the key before the reapers attack we protheans were on the cusp of unlocking the mysteries behind mass relay technology ilos was a top-secret facility here researchers worked to create a small-scale version of a mass relay one that linked directly to the citadel the hub of the relay network conduits not a weapon it's a back door onto the citadel how did you manage to stay hidden all official records of our project were destroyed in the initial attack on the citadel while the prothean empire came crashing down ilos was spared we severed all communication with the outside and our facility went dark the personnel retreated underground into these archives to conserve resources everyone was put into cryogenic stasis i was programmed to monitor the facility and wake the staff when the danger had passed but the genocide of an entire species is a long slow process years past decades centuries the reapers persisted and my energy reserves were dwindling you should have fought we were a few hundred against a galactic invasion fleet our only hope was to remain undetected i began to disable the life support of non-essential personnel first support staff then security one by one their parts were shut down to conserve energy eventually only the stasis parts of the top scientists remained active even these were in danger of failing when the reapers finally retreated back through the citadel relay there were hundreds of stasis pods out there you just shut them down you killed them you were programmed to protect them not kill them this outcome was not completely unforeseen my actions were a result of contingency programming entered on my creation i bet they didn't tell the non-essential staff about this contingency i saved key personnel when the reapers retreated the top researchers were still alive my actions are the only reason any hope remains when the researchers woke they realized the prothean species was doomed there were only a dozen individuals left far too few to sustain a viable population yet they vowed to find some way to stop the reapers from returning a way to break the cycle forever and they knew the keepers were the key aren't they under the influence of the reapers the keepers are controlled by the citadel before each invasion a signal is sent through the station compelling the keepers to activate the citadel relay after decades of feverish study the scientists discovered a way to alter this signal using the conduit they gained access to the citadel and made the modifications this time when sovereign sent the signal to the citadel the keepers ignored it the reapers are trapped in dark space saren must have some plan to undo everything you did the one you call saren will use the conduit to bypass the citadel's defenses once inside he will transfer control of the station to sovereign sovereign will override the citadel systems and manually open the relay and the cycle of extinction will begin again is there any way we can stop them there's a data file in my console take a copy when you go when you reach the citadel's master control unit upload it to the station it will corrupt the citadel security protocols and give you temporary control of the station it might give you a chance against sovereign wait where's the citadel's master control unit i've never heard of anything like that through the conduit follow sarin he will lead you to your destination if the reapers are trapped in dark space how did sovereign get here it is logical to assume the reapers would leave one of their own behind after each extinction a sentinel to pave the way for their inevitable return like those in dark space sovereign probably spent most of the last 50 000 years in a state of hibernation periodically it would wake to analyze the situation keeping its existence hidden it would evaluate the state of galactic civilization and when the time was right it would signal the citadel and usher in the next reaper invasion but this time the signal failed the keepers did not respond sovereign's allies were trapped in the void alone it was forced to try and discover what had gone wrong sovereign's the largest ship in the galaxy why all this secrecy why not just attack the citadel sovereign is not invincible revealing its true nature would have united the forces of every organic species against it even a reaper couldn't survive such odds but the reapers are patient they will not rush into the unknown sovereign could have been planning this for centuries moving deliberately gathering allies slowly it has assembled the pieces of the puzzle working through agents to keep itself hidden saren is the most visible pawn of the reapers but i doubt he was the first now sovereign has grown bold whether from confidence or desperation i cannot say but it is determined to reopen the portal to dark space what about the beacon on eden prime and the one on vermeyer what were they for at our apex the beacons span the breadth of our empire we use them as a single galaxy-wide network to transmit data and communications rapidly from world to world virtually all the beacons were destroyed during the invasion but once the reapers were gone the survivors here on islos decided to risk sending out a message we knew it was unlikely there were other survivors but if there were we wanted them to know about islos we wanted to give them hope so a message was sent across the network you could have exposed yourself to the reapers in truth we didn't expect any of the beacons would still function but we had to try if there were survivors we had to reach them the message was meant for our own people it was coded so only organic beings could interpret it we still didn't understand the power of reaper indoctrination we never realized it could lead an agent of the machines like saren to this world but it has also led you here so perhaps we did not fail after all so when the reapers created the citadel they created the keepers as well a more likely scenario is that the keepers were one of the early harvested civilizations perhaps the very first perhaps they responded well to indoctrination all the reapers simply bred them to be obedient in any case they were left behind to operate and maintain the citadel but the keepers are no longer directly controlled by sovereign they evolved so that they only respond to the signals emitted by the citadel itself when the protheans altered the citadel signals they broke sovereign's hold over the keepers now they are completely harmless sovereign must have realized that organic races were difficult to control a likely hypothesis the keepers evolved in an unanticipated direction non-organic servants like the geth would be more predictable what happened to the survivors from the conduit project they used the conduit to gain access to the citadel but the conduit is only a prototype the portal only links in one direction so they were trapped on the station i do not know what became of them then it is unlikely they found any food or water on the station i fear they suffered a slow grim death i only know they succeeded in their mission to seal the relay your presence here proves their sacrifice was not in vain sarin's got enough of a head start grab that data file and let's go the one you call saren has not reached the conduit not yet there is still hope if you hurry there's something in the air so many races looked up to the protheans as paragons of civilization they were fooled by the reapers just as we were they failed keep it moving i've got no intention of like them ah so so there the conduit it's incredible we don't have time to admire the view we have to get through that relay and these guests aren't going to make it easy on us [Music] activate the defenses seal the station the arms aren't moving system's not responding [Music] abandon the citadel evacuate the council citadel control city control do you copy [Music] hang on critical failures detected across all monitored systems please begin emergency evacuations [Music] please begin emergency evacuations somebody needs to put saren in his place [Music] don't let the enemy ships inside the arms [Music] saren's locked the elevator suit up we're going outside [Music] [Music] so so so [Music] oh so stop there [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] to me [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so me okay foreign [Music] [Music] hostile contact [Music] [Music] so powering up foreign [Music] oh i was afraid you wouldn't make it in time shepard in time for what the final confrontation i think we both expected it would end like this you've lost you know that don't you in a few minutes sovereign will have full control of all the citadel systems the relay will open the reapers will return i've still got a few tricks up my sleeve you survived our encounter on vermeyer but i've changed since then improved sovereign has upgraded me fancy hardware is not gonna save you i suppose i should thank you shepard after vermeire i couldn't stop thinking about what you said about sovereign manipulating me about indoctrination the doubts began to eat away at me sovereign sensed my hesitation i was implanted to strengthen my resolve now my doubts are gone i believe in sovereign completely i understand that the reapers need organics join us and sovereign will find a place for you too sovereign's controlling you through your implants don't you see that the relationship is symbiotic organic and machine intertwined a union of flesh and steel the strengths of both the weaknesses of neither i am a vision of the future shepherd the evolution of all organic life this is our destiny join sovereign and experience a true rebirth sovereign hasn't won yet i can stop it from taking control of the station step aside and the invasion will never happen we can't stop it not forever you saw the visions you saw what happened to the protheans the reapers are too powerful some part of you must still realize this is wrong you can fight this maybe you're right maybe there is still a chance for the implants sovereign is too strong i'm sorry it is too late for me it's not over yet you could still redeem yourself goodbye shepherd thank you [Music] foreign [Music] vigil's data file worked i've got control of all systems quick open the station's arms maybe the fleet can take sovereign down see if you can open a communications channel [Music] the destiny is section main drives offline kinetic barrier's down 40 the council is on board i repeat the council is on board normandy to the citadel normandy to the citadel please tell me that's you commander i'm here joker we caught that distress call commander i'm sitting here in the endura sector with the entire arcturus fleet we can save the ascension just unlock the relays around the citadel we'll send the cavalry in you'd sacrifice human lives to save the council what have they ever done for your kind this is bigger than humanity sovereigns a threat to every organic species in the galaxy that's why you can't throw away reinforcements trying to save the council hold them back until the citadel arms open up and the human fleet can go after sovereign what's the order commander come in now to save the ascension or hold back opening the relays now joker we need to save the ascension no matter what the cost i hope the council appreciates this alliance ships move in save the destiny ascension commander we're picking up reinforcements it's the alliance thank the goddess destiny ascension you are all clear repeat you are all clear the senator's opening all ships move in concentrate on sovereignty [Music] make sure he's dead so he's dead so uh [Music] yes i am sovereign and this station is mine don't awesome oh that's done [Applause] sovereign's too strong we have to pull back negative this is our only chance take that monster down no matter what the cost my shield [Music] good to go [Music] this is [Music] did [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the shields are down now's our chance [Music] hard on my blank we're going in [Music] go [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] captain anderson we found him they're in here [Music] take it easy it's over you're safe now where's the commander [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ambassador captain commander shepard we have gathered here to recognize the enormous contributions of the alliance forces in the war against sovereign and the geth many humans lost their lives in the battle to save the citadel brave and courageous soldiers who willingly gave their lives so that we the council might live there is no greater sacrifice and we share your grief over the tragic loss of so many noble men and women the council also owes you a great personal debt commander one we can never repay you saved not just our lives but the lives of billions from sovereign and the reapers commander shepard your heroic and selfless actions serve as a symbol of everything humanity and the alliance stand for and though we cannot bring back those valiant soldiers who gave their lives to save ours we can honor their memories through our actions humanity has shown it is ready to stand as a defender and protector of the galaxy you have proved you are worthy to join our ranks and serve beside us on the citadel council councilor on behalf of humanity and the alliance we thank you for this prestigious honor and humbly accept we will need a list of potential candidates to fill humanity's seat on the council given all that has happened i am sure your recommendation will carry a great deal of weight commander do you support any particular candidate we need someone with the courage to stand up for what he believes in someone like captain anderson [Music] him you must be joking anderson prefers to let his fists do the talking only with you ambassador only with you are you sure about this commander the captain's a soldier another politician we've already got too many politicians on the citadel the captain would be perfect for this job i think it's an inspired choice the council would welcome him with open arms should he accept i'm honored counselor as humanity's representative i'll do everything in my power to help the council rebuild sovereign's defeat marks the beginning of a new era for both humanity and the council sovereign was only a vanguard the reaper fleet is still coming hundreds of ships maybe thousands and i'm gonna find some way to stop them shepard's right humanity is ready to do its part united with the rest of the council we have the strength to overcome any challenge when the reapers come we must stand side by side we must fight against them as one and together we will drive them back into dark space [Music] [Music] [Music] you
