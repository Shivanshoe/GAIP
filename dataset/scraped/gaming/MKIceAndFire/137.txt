yes you guys need help we'll be fine thanks what happened we heard a rumor about this garage we thought it'd be an easy score but we were wrong dumb asses hey hey at least we got far enough down to start up the old military generator and juice up some uv lights so what happened then further down the underground parking is [ __ ] swarming with infected barely made it out of there alive and then part of a wall collapsed on jonas on our way to the surface well you won't mind if i give it a try do you knock yourself out but it's probably not worth it unless you want to end up like me or worse yeah i gotta make good on a promise here if you manage not to die maybe you'll find use for these we sure ain't going back not that way at least well thanks can you hear those noises downstairs that wailing yeah like peacock singing the hallelujah chorus must be howlers they don't attack on their own but bring other infected running you think it's all clear then one shriek and a wave of infected appears quit [ __ ] scaring me man maybe we'll come back for this generator another time seems to be in decent shape and just how are we going to get it out of there it'll be lighter if we drain the fuel yeah that'll do it so what's our plan for now we wait until dawn we won't get far outside with you busted up like that so we stay put until morning and then uh we'll take a shortcut next to the massage parlor okay [ __ ] this hurts [Music] uh uh [Music] uh quick oh [Music] i think this is the military storage area hubert told me about let's look around [Music] hmm ugh [Music] [Music] so so filters never gonna have enough of these i'm sure dodger can use them [Music] [Music] [Music] yes ugh [Music] looks like i struck gold a bottle of risen glory cognac and some cigars cubans the box says looks like i got everything of value time to head out of here hmm wow you made it did you find the stash sure did thanks for the lock picks but what are you still doing here is this him sure is he was kind enough to get the goods for us saved us a lot of trouble very good so where did you find out about this a little bird was it to you was it a little bird mitt a broken leg how would you know because i broke it why'd you attack him hubert was planning to take the goods for himself tell dodger he didn't find anything needed our help to pull it off but we didn't know why we needed half-assed ruby and now we don't need you so give them to us three against one i like those odds count again i counted five corpses kill him and take the gods [Music] you ain't he's here got you now [Music] i got something for you [ __ ] um [Applause] how's the leg uh i know better but it'll heal eventually oh fantastic something wrong i had a chance to meet the bandits you mentioned before they said that you'd plan on cheating dodger after all okay the cat's out of the bag but look it was only going to be just this once dodger would never find out why would you steal from a man who's giving you work oh god i'm living by the skin my teeth here i thought just this once i'd pretend he gave me a bum lead and take the whole stash maybe get a little ahead for once and the bandits i figured an ambush would sell the story better didn't expect them to turn on me but then i'm an idiot aren't i seems like it trusting a group of thugs like them that's what you get for being greedy i wasn't being greedy just just desperate now got a busted leg and don't know when i can work again what happened to them anyway now they tried to kill me but didn't uh and the goods did you reach them i got everything i'm begging you don't tell dodger if you do you'll ruin me please take what you have to him tell him i'll be back in business as soon as my leg heals why'd you even get mixed up with low lives like that seemed reasonable enough at first you're interested in helping for a small cut then they show up with a psycho damn it i'm such an idiot i i brought this all on myself don't tell dodger please i'll think it over come on man without work i'll starve i won't even think about doing it again i swear don't make me laugh think i'd take your word for anything after this believe me i i learned my lesson i'll never do anything like that again we'll see [Music] thinking i've never seen someone watch a job so badly in my life i thought i could trust them haydon what you got for me i found these filters for one okay not setting my world on fire but i can move those for a nice profit how about these a bottle of cognac and a box of cigars now that's what i'm talking about you see i knew there'd be something valuable at that military base you see that turban can i sniff out the good [ __ ] or what kick ass speaking of asses what was huby's deal is he trying to duck out on me [Music] uh hubert broke his leg so i went and got the goods for him he could use a doctor or at least someone to look in on him while he's on the mend oh yes he'll definitely need a doctor what are you talking about you know what they say trust in god but break your camel's legs just in case couldn't hug what hey this psycho works for you well two solutions are better than one she wanted to kill me no who said anything about killing i just told klaus to get the loot he can be a little over eager at times you jackass oh come on don't pout look at klaus he's not mad about you killing his friends it's natural selection you proved yourself stronger than them you came in handy after all i didn't know how to get to who be but then you showed up i waited until you were gone and paid him a visit what did you do to him he was in terrible pain because of that broken leg so i broke the other one for balance that's what happens when you try to screw dodger you're [ __ ] out of your mind no need to get all broken up about it doralex said lex the times we live in are ruthless and the law must be so too he's already learned his lesson he said he wouldn't do it again how can you be so sure any idea how many people half-assed has conned people who are also just trying to get by who have families to feed he's been asking for trouble for a long time he got what he deserved and he won't scam anyone ever again remember rules are rules with the whole world collapsing we need them more than ever without them we'd be no better than a pack of rats did you call this following the rules for your rules you won't get away with this carla hear the whole story carlo he won't dare touch me i know too much about him i know too much about everyone even lucas respected me who do you think is behind his death barney sophie barney and sophie are just a pair of kids playing in a sandbox that's too big for them on the other hand they are really [ __ ] up you never know what might pop up in their heads i know one thing though curiosity killed the cat and thanks for your concern but i don't need it i saw the potential in you from the start but i had to figure out who i'm really dealing with and how did i do oh you're something else but you'll still have a lot to learn kid you lied to me about hubie aidan aidan hayden this is no world for a saint a martyr maybe if you get yourself killed at least i'll have a clear conscience clear conscience [Music] no one has a clear conscience here and since you are still alive neither do you right what have you been getting up to pilgrim what are you running from next time find yourself another patsy feisty i like it we'll meet again eden [Music] find something you like [Music] [Music] dude so [Music] [Music] oh this place is a pigsty that ain't no proof [Music] here's something [Music] hey what the hell oh [ __ ] that's that's human skin icon i found the tattoo they cut out of lucas damn freaks what yeah oh i'm gonna throw up get the hell out of there we still ain't doing why are you going through my sister's stuff i didn't know they were hiring pilgrims as housekeepers in this hole are you shedding skin barney what the [ __ ] is we didn't a little piece of lucas to remember him by just sicko [ __ ] you nice try but that ain't mine i'll kill you you you can't take us off i'm gonna kill you traitor stop it what's going on here for [ __ ] sake are you nuts he's he's setting us up this [ __ ] pilgrim is framing us what is he talking about aidan i found the proof hidden among your things proof of what you cut the tattoo from commander lucas's arm after his death or when he was still alive you're out of your mind i didn't do it maybe you didn't but you're crazy brother barney's not a psycho we have nothing to do with lucas's death i'm going to ader i've got the proof he's looking for aidan it's not us nobody at the bazaar will believe you [Music] then where did this piece of skin come from sophie could have been planted to set us up ever think of that who would do that and why to distract everyone from the real killer who gained the most from killing lucas who had the most to gain if it was that easy for you to get in here then someone else could have come in here before you and planted that doesn't matter this is between you and aydah now wait please adore doesn't care about the truth he doesn't care about finding the real killer he's only looking for a reason to raid the bazaar it's not my war sophie no but you'll have blood in your hands blood of innocence someone is setting us up someone clever we're not sadists who would skim lucas aiden and you know it but i know that you want to get rid of the pk's yes and we will get rid of them but not like psychos and assassins aiden believe me this is a setup i'll help you get to the center i promise how by getting rid of the biggest problem of this land the pks that seems dangerous we've been preparing for this for a long time i'll tell you everything when i'm ready stay close to your radio aiden time to make some changes around here [Music] [Music] oh ready to get me to the center i'll tell you everything when you get here hurry up on the floor these days what is our roof now what are cats hey well you look happy oh what is happiness if not a disease of fools uh you lost me on that one wait you seem like a man of power do you wish to possess the world's most powerful weapon the world's most powerful weapon okay what is it you will see with your own eyes i will give you its location and in return you will give me all your money yeah i don't think so what is money compared to such a priceless thing it buys me food and drink keeps me from starving i can go on fine 200 and a money-back guarantee and if you do not value the weapon as i have i shall return your money will you accept my challenge okay i'm in look for chests hidden on the old overpass overlooking east horseshoe and the roof of the office building close by the last one you open will contain the world's most powerful weapons search and you shall find it [ __ ] this won't be easy [Music] [Music] it's like the virus [Music] apparently not here [Music] finally found it and where is this weapon that nut job has some explaining to do before you say what's a con job but a shiny stone to his simpleton i'll knock it out of your quince comes such anger wait once i climbed like an idiot to the top of the viaduct for nothing don't you see you've gained the most powerful weapon after all it's perseverance what the most powerful weapon in the world is perseverance which you displayed when you climb to the very top and i paid you for that give me my money back perseverance will overcome the greatest difficulties and lack of it will destroy you as it has destroyed our world win the war faster research the virus faster and sloppier so what will it be would you sacrifice your perseverance just to get your money back there was nothing there give me back my money what is my fist in your face but the broken nose of its sheet right i see here here's your money you have much to learn [Music] sometimes i can't sleep because of the awful sounds the infected outside make you know this used to be a bell tower in the middle ages i wonder what happened to the belt this is madness sophie the peacekeepers have more weapons men they will crush us like worms etore may have more men but we have the home field advantage home field advantage you're crazy i forbid it while i leave the bazaar no one will attack the peacekeepers you no longer lead the bazaar what you're no leader carl never were we lost people because of you crystals you almost got yourself killed my mother wanted a free bazaar not slaves serving the peacekeepers i want to restore peace here you can help me with this or leave roger humphrey arrest them what are you doing they want to betray the bizarre roger you have no power anymore carl you want to be like your mother you'll have blood on your hands sophie a lot of blood [Music] crawl is right we don't stand a chance in open battle sophie what the therefore we're going to weaken them first what do you mean we'll cut off their main source of electricity without uv lamps adore can't defend his base they will be driven from the metro tunnels and cut off from the armory how does all this get me to the central loop once aider is weakened he will retreat for reinforcements then you can make it to the central loop ayden but first we have to blow up the windmill and fast before aider gets wind of what we're planning barney gather our people be ready roger and humphrey go to the armory provide weapons to anyone capable of fighting you aiden go to alberto and vincenzo they'll walk you through the plan okay community and freedom aiden together we will win [Music] i demanded why won't you help me you are worthless heartless selfish everything all right no everything is not all right please it's my boys they've gone missing i haven't seen them for hours moe's 13 scotty's 16 please boys their age do tend to wander off not my boys they always tell me where they're going and when they'll be back this time was no different but oh my birthday's coming up it'd be just like them to get into trouble planning a surprise i'd die you understand if something happened to them i'd hey i can take a look but i'm new here i don't have much of we neither do we but well i'd have nothing without them if you find them i can share a little something i've kept for a rainy day all right i can try to find them as a pilgrim i did plenty of tracking what a pilgrim you're lucky this is about my children i know what sort of people become pilgrims otherwise i'd want nothing to do with you i just want to help where should i start to look right here sometimes they play with this filthy little boy by the church walls all right i'll check it out you stay here and wait apparently you made a commitment to something [Music] what can i do for you you're practically one of us now hey alberto this new armor of yours is splitting more fit for a beetle than people yeah way too thin first time peter she has a great protection this is top craftsmanship made from the finest quality materials built from uh-oh i can almost see the steam pouring from his ears look out he's gonna blow titanium we reinforce the armor with titanium we pull from the scrapyard that's why they're lighter and better protection you guys shouldn't be such dicks well why didn't he just say so we'll see [Music] thanks vincenzo you didn't have to it was nothing dad ah as for you those two orbs took the last titanium vests i'm not here for armor sophie sent me you're supposed to bring me in on some plan the plan my plan creed color greed you hear that vincenzo not carl sophie you gonna share or do i have to guess windmill we take down the windmill bingo the big windmill that provides power to the pk headquarters but first we need the charges that jack and joe left at the water tower [Music] would you bring them to us pilgrim after we blow it up all the uv lamps in the pk headquarters will go out that will allow the infected to attack them old villa door will be free again and you you have a clear rule to uh uh you know the past chemical fallout and to uh what's it called a central loop the central loop right how do you know the pk will withdraw and not retaliate because dad designed this windmill he knows it like the back of his hand and it's the pk base's only power source without it the bks won't last another night in old villador but we must act fast before the peacekeepers catch wind of our plans so you win [Music] okay so the windmill powers all the pk's uv lamps yes it does indeed a lot of people will die only if the pk don't turn tail and head back to where they belong they stole that windmill from us it was ours lucas and his men they when they came they ah uh damn it exactly they took it without electricity ator can't keep anyone here we have generators smaller power sources they need a large power source they'll have to withdraw and before they return with backup from the central loop we'll block the tunnel ourselves their commander jack matt is not going to risk fighting in the dark with the infected and renegades at his back old villadore will be ours again and you will go to the center [Music] all right fine i'll do it okay go to the water tower we're going to use the charges that jack and joe tried to blow it up with let me know once you get there the others take this [ __ ] what happened here what's going on here pks they've been searching us for weapons found on molotovs and went ape [ __ ] slaughtering everyone in sight looks like someone set us up who and where are the bombs for alberto we managed to send some out the couriers last reported near star square then silence alberto the charges are gone i'm going to the star square that was their last check-in oh my exactly yeah be careful someone sold us out the churches without them the plan cannot proceed doing what i can i'll be in touch i had no choice dear you have to believe me don't you dare me you could have chosen to pay your son's debt instead you dragged me through the mud with what money it would have ruined us either way so you decided to take me down with you i hope it was all worth it no please you have to give me another chance we've been best friends forever forever is over theresa you're dead to me just leave now thank you for trying to clear my name aiden but as i thought the damage was already done despite your efforts many will never look at me the same again and i've lost my best friend [Music] friend no no true friend would have done that to you you're right i don't want to think about it anymore water under the bridge aiden i have to look forward thank you please take this sometimes certain events must occur to cause the scales to fall from our eyes [Music] any other city uh [Music] here help me please [Music] come on faster [ __ ] that was some fight the pk's ambushed your transport he searched everyone and everything eventually they found the bomb someone tipped them off they took everything you know suddenly something scared them off what where are the charges hey um they were in the yard come on maybe i didn't steal all of them lucky few the infected showed up everyone's scattered probably leaving the bombs behind don't know why they didn't steal them they were right under their noses morons wow [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] alberto i have the charges wonderful excellent so what are you waiting for come back here i come [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] where's your father there you are only two pk's took the rest damn damn triple them because of that traitor our plan is in danger we must act quickly no nitrates we need fertilizer then we can make more explosives the old night runners they've got everything and certainly all we'll need to make more pops i know a guy lives on a rooftop friend not foe it depends kilian you know him hackon's friend killian yes kelly i'll explain how to how to add another way thanks still here are you crazy it's aiden you there killian there's hakkon back then everyone must have thought bffs forever bingo alberto i have your fertilizer dad went ahead to the windmill meet him there i'll meet you when i can just make sure that fertilizer can do my dad okay i'll do my best just come quick [Music] me and your dad you think that's a good idea we have no choice aidan hurry please this plant means everything to my dad i don't know if you noticed but that's kind of awkward and unappreciated this is a chance to show carl sophie everyone at the bazaar that they were wrong what that's made of what he can do he'll be the hero of the bazaar after this one he always wanted to do something big that's exactly what i'm afraid of i'll stay with you on the radio hello vincenzo hello [Music] vincenzo i can't hear you [Music] what what do i have to do i brought the fertilizer you sure you got this of course i'm sure and if i don't know something i can ask vincenzo the windmill is causing too much interference the radio doesn't work ah then i'll figure it out myself it's as easy as mine and you're certain he explained everything to me relax we'll do me and you will do no reason we won't do just fine like i said easy as pie the bombs are ready you're up take the charges and secure them to the spots vincenzo marked for us planting bombs what could go wrong easy as

[Music] um [Music] ugh [Music] another uh nearby [Music] so explosions are in place time for the fireworks would you like the honors sure this should be fun [Music] the detonator isn't triggering must be interference from the windmill that doesn't look like that did much the windmill's still standing i mean the rotor's still spinning vincenzo's calculations they must be off i'll have it fixed in a flash gotta see this truth it's my fault not vincenzo's what are you doing an armed bomb before the pks get here giving we can't rely on radio detonation not with all the interference what now this one is guaranteed to blow up the whole windmill all right how much time do i have let me count it will go any second run but where am i supposed to put it where you have to go back and and plant it on place it on put it on [Music] leave it by the base of the windmill no that will accomplish nothing right in the middle of the windmill i can finish my own sentences thank you very much on the rotor you have to climb up to the rotor to the very top be serious the bomb is picking you really think we have time for jokes [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] come on come on come on faster go on [Music]
