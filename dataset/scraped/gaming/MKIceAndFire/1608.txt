I can win with this kind of power nothing can stand in my way now I just obtained the ultimate power New York what's wrong Vegeta are you not going to save him him but he what how is that pathetic worms still alive my attack should have been fatal you won't be able to cheat death again once I turn you into a million little pieces my eyes know Vegeta attack him with all you got he had that kind of ability what are you doing Vegeta why the hell didn't you tell me that namekian runt had the ability to heal people because we didn't know either if we had known we would have had him heal Goku you really surprised me there Dendi thanks good luck his power has increased rather significantly I suppose it's because he has the blood of a Saiyan it might not be much but it should be enough to tip the scales in our favor impossible that little was on the verge of cake I'm sure of it something's coming mr. piccolo sorry to keep you waiting of all the people to show up had to be the freak we killed back on earth the Dragon Balls were used to bring back this dead weight what a waste sorry to disappoint you but let's make one thing clear I'm coming after you next once I take care of Frieza that is so another namekian worm has come to die back off I fight alone what what it's your funeral you have no idea what you're up against but fine go ahead he's still far from a worthy opponent time to check out the trash [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no way actually fighting on par with Frieza no he's doing better than that Wow I know mr. piccolo can do it I must apologize for my attitude before I've underestimated you but I'm afraid you're still out of your league allow me to demonstrate my true power well then guess I'll do the same it appears you don't fully grasp the danger you're in did you think what I've showed you was the full extent of my power what you simpleton you're clearly unaware that I've undergone a transformation prepare yourself you're about to experience dread like you've never felt before transformation now that I have your attention it's only fitting that I instill you with hopelessness as well with each and every transformation my power increases quite considerably and still I have two more forms beyond this one you know it that means don't you you can't be serious No he's got two more forms prepare yourself you have the esteemed privilege of being the first to see my next forum rejoice [Music] mr. piccolo I'm gonna fight you kidding me [Music] no you're wasting your time I need you to beat me within an inch of my life right now I apologize for the weak how do we begin round two you monster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

our limits what are you waiting for I can't get a power boost if I harm myself I need you to do it with that little namekians healing ability I can recover from whatever you do almost immediately I'd love to beat the snot out of you believe me can't I mean coke who's gonna be back any minute now Kakarot isn't going to get stronger he's a loser now while I could snuff the life out of you in my current form with the most minimal of efforts I wonder yes I think I'll demonstrate to you just how truly terrifying my power is before I end your pitiful lives now's the chance hurry up and do it huh good this should work yep dawn you have to get out of here right Oh No what did you say what the hell do you mean you can't heal me you killed so many of my people I can't heal someone like you I need to help the others [Music] thanks a lot kid Krillin why did you attack Vegeta don't you remember Saiyans get stronger every time they survive a fight to the death that's why Vegeta asked me to attack him oh yeah that's right Dendi look I get it I know why you don't want to heal Vegeta but we're screwed if he can't fight just heal him I'm not strong enough to take Frieza on my own what's going on is that freeze up his transformations complete den de please we need you to heal Vegeta [Music] took you long enough [Music] Rize should be no match for me now finally feast your eyes on a Super Saiyan is coming into view [Music] that's friezes true form it's so small and compact but it's intense guess it's true what they say you can't judge a book by it's cover still the gun like this other forms better sorry I couldn't help you guys out I know you all went through a lot of trouble trying to wish me [Music] you know I couldn't help but notice that little namekian had the ability to heal I'm afraid I can't have any more of that [Laughter] well then let's begin shall we [Music] [Music] I made you a promise didn't I I said you would experience a dread like no other you felt before his speed is incredible so that's phrases true form that I won't lose not as I am now [Music] it seems your moves were too fast for the runs to catch but I can see them clear as day I admire your confidence Vegeta but I'm afraid your mind is so overcome with fear that you become delusional you will be laughing for very long Frieza after all you're up against your greatest fear a Super Saiyan freezes Final Four [Music] [Laughter] you haven't lost your ridiculous sense of humor there won't be a need for Kakarot when I'm done I can see you [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] god [Music] god [Music] impossible the stampy happening [Music] [Applause] I don't believe it this can't be [Music] search this can't be the extent of my power are you finished and I think I'll make the next move I'll beat you for the very first time in his life Vegeta had finally begun to experience true dread overcome with hopelessness and frustration he was reduced to tears the mighty prince of the warrior race had lost his will to fight [Music] if you wish to save him feel free to try it anytime [Music] whoa I'm overflowing with power it's actually kind of freaking me out well I better get going hang on guys I'm on my way [Music] hmm sorry I'm late I'll take things from here dad Goku it looks like I still have some trash to dispose of Herat hmm Kakarot though I see so you're a Saiyan as well I intend to rid the universe of every last one of you there's something different about Kakarot yes he finally done it you actually countered one of my attacks I'm impressed Risa are you serious if I were you you're finally face to face with your worst nightmare Oh Super Saiyan legendary same warrior the strongest fighter in the universe you're finished Frieza you're finally going did I not make myself clear before I've grown tired of your pathetic jokes stop don't you see he can't fight back anymore he's done just let him go Kakarot yeah just a thought is always perhaps you're not a super saiyan after all hit stop letting your emotions hold you back stop being so soft and you can finally do it you to become a Super Saiyan check her out listen their home planet planet Vegeta wasn't destroyed by a media it was Frieza we we Sainz we Saiyans where is in forces followed every order your parents my father's body they they were all murdered by that monster but I bet you Jacqueline please please defeat Frieza please I beg of you he must die by sane hands I was wondering when he'd finally die Vegeta he must have been really difficult for a proud guy like you des begged me for help I hated you at first but I began to understand over time you were a proud sand warrior just know this I'll do what I can to carry on that pride of yours hey I'm a Saiyan raised on earth and to avenge those you've brutally murdered the sands and the namekians I'm going to defeat you utter nonsense we're just in the way we need to get out of here go on come on hurry please don't die dad make freeze-up pay for what he did [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this has been fun it's been quite some time since I've exerted myself this much my hand I'm in trouble if he's serious about the half power thing then even the kaio-ken times 10 isn't gonna be enough I should be able to hold my own if I push it 2 times 20 though like body might not be able to handle it [Music] [Music] what what's going on it barely it barely did a thing my dad's energy it's a lot weaker than it was before I can't believe someone's actually that strong just kink I was right can't believe I'm saying this but we shouldn't have picked this fight in the freezer cuz you sayin well now that accurate where is all your energy gone what have you exhausted yourself already I can't watch anymore I'm gonna help him which seems like Goku's got something in the works [Music] Goku the legendary super-safe the spirit bomb all things living on Namek and all planets that can hear me lend me as much energy as you can give me the strength I need what are you doing don't tell is this another one of your pathetic attacks what can you possibly accomplish by just standing gap well he's made a spirit Bob that huge phrase that doesn't appear to know what's going on right now I don't understand what Goku doesn't just attack him he's probably thinking that he needs more energy so that he can take Frieza down for good this time man I wish this thing didn't take so long to get ready I have to make sure he doesn't figure out what I'm doing come on this is getting ridiculous how much longer do you intend to keep that up okay not sure as long as I have to I guess say you're not in a hurry are you you dare mock me I do not understand you sales your kind has been a thorn in my side for as long as I can remember once I destroyed that Saiyan child and this entire planet the Saiyans will finally be no more The Legend of the Super Saiyan will remain just that legend that's not the Sun what doctor no insight stay here no matter what happens do not leave this spot what is that is that some sort of ball of energy you it's no use if I wants the spirit bomb at him right now he's just gonna dodge it site it doesn't even have enough power to take freeze it down [Music] while planning a sneak attack this whole time how pathetic but all of your idiotic planning and effort has gone to waste piccolo hurry up and finish that spirit bomb already thanks piccolo you file insignificant pests how dare you interfere in this so there are more of you are there you certainly know how to test my limited patience now I will reduce you alright it's done [Music] No we're [Music] [Music] Krillin hey you made it but where are my dad in piccolo they were right by the impact weren't they you you don't think the date hey it's Goku and piccolo we're talking about they wouldn't go down that easy Krillin the Energy's feet but I feel it let's go okay dad Goku just did it let's go home you guys go what is it curling we totally forgot Obama don't scare me like that no it can't be [Music] [Applause] you won't I'm going to eradicate every last one of you [Music] and now for the little brat now there you dear to pay for that Oh dad Gohan take piccolo with you and head back to earth now hurry Gohan before I lose what little sense of reason I have left okay what's going on what's happened to him no it can't be I think I know what's going on my dad finally did it he's become a Super Saiyan I've had him no no I'm mad you will know your family's sad many innocent people like my friend trilling you act as if seeds don't have just as much blood on their heads to be exterminated [Music] [Music] give it up all your finished [Music] [Music] hi [Music] why don't you Oh [Music] you can destroy entire planets but you can't take down one single person Oh what are you you mean you haven't figured it out yet I'm the saying who's come all the way from Earth to defeat you I am the warrior you've heard of in legends I am pure of heart and awakened by fury that's what I am I am the Super Saiyan I stand corrected I suppose the legends were true after all [Applause] it's over free silence [Music] we sit now I won't let you take miss me I would rather take my own life than be killed by scum like you fine by me but the one that's going to die isn't me either be you I can survive in the vacuum of space find out the same can be said for sailors [Music] must have restrain myself too much but the core has been completely destroyed in five minutes time this planet will explode and become nothing more than debris floating through space five-minute time well that's all the time I need I'll avenge Crillon by defeating you and find my friends and get out of here me impossible no choice it's time to shake Freeza you know the only reason I'm letting you reach full power is because I want to beat you at your best as the Warriors I wouldn't have it any other way [Music] you want to test out your full power - don't my apologies for the weight as requested this is my full power Gogu struggling at this weight he might not be able to make it off Planet Namek before it explodes no way there must be something we can do wait that's it yes that's you work guardian of us Tommy can you hear me yes King Kai I can hear you oh yes I've already had mr. Popo gather all of the Dragon Balls we were planning to use them to revive those currently in your care why because Earth Dragon Balls can revive many people at once but can they revive those who died naturally I'm afraid those who died of natural causes cannot be brought back [Music] mmm I suppose such people could be revived if only for the brief time that was taken from them all right yeah here's the wish ask young man to bring back all those that were killed my freezer and his neck what I'll explain you don't have much time so I'll make this quick first we'll use the earth Dragon Balls to revive all those killed by Frieza that you mean on the meccans including grand elder guru should be revived [Music] we've only had two of the three wishes granted with the namekian dragonballs very strange with grand elder guru back we should still be able to make one last wish right with that last wish we'll transport everyone on Namek other than freezer to earth oh I get it you've really thought this through King Kai anyway that's the gist of it now hurry planning hammock won't be around much longer oh oh I see I'll summon Shenron right away state your wish I shall grant you any wish that you desire [Music] I'm alive but Alice now was this possible [Music] for what is this place have I returned to the world of the living this is King Kai of the North quadrant of the galaxy please listen closely why would you just die this is it I'm going to blow you to a million pieces just like that earthling what are you talking about [Music] are you talking about trilling [Music] don't you dare talk about drilling then our planet namek is about to explode there should be one wish left with the Dragon Balls there I need you to summon Shenron for the last wish ask him to send everyone there accept reject world I understand King Kai I appreciate your concern but wishes must be made directly I'm afraid I will contact whomever is closest to the Dragon Balls and tell them your wish wait don't make that wish listen to me ask him to leave both Frieza only behind come on ask him you heard as Doku okay yeah I understand what you're trying to do but listen King Kai if you don't let me finish things with Frieza I'm never going to forgive you fine fine I understand if that's really where you want [Music] [Music] [Music] there my child this is cool [Music] please save your questions I would like you to ask for whom God to grant one final wish generally will you ask him to transport all those anomic except for freesia and the same local to the earth [Music] here is our final wish what that's the dragonballs Kohanga Frieza people gaku [Applause] [Music] this will be sent to earth [Music] my this is a planet called Earth my time is once again at hand I'm afraid but before I leave this world once more I wish to explain what has just happened the battle against that fiend Frieza still continues back on our home planet would you look at that you need to speak the local language in order to make a wish it's just us now Frieza me and you finally I've been waiting for this a very curious it would seem you're willing to pay the ultimate price to settle our conflict very well [Music] [Music] the destruction is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he's game [Music] I'm done you're done this fight is over there's no point anymore I can tell you're afraid I don't need to defeat you anymore you dare mock me I will [Music] you brought this upon yourself Frieza though I have to admit I didn't see it ending quite like this yes you say it I'm going to make my way back to earth you can stay here and suffer the same fate as this planet how can you beg for mercy how many people begged you for mercy before you slaughter them how many [Music] I've given you just a little bit of my energy that's all you get you're on your own Critias being in the universe and that is why you passed and two of the three wishes had been used to bring back the beloved chiaotzu and Tien then with the third and final wish the namekians were transported to a new planet along with their legendary Dragon Balls hey it's me Goku what's that now you're telling me freezes alive and right now he's making his way to earth with his father they're probably gonna do something awful while I'm not there aren't they you're not gonna get away with this Frieza huh who are you stay tuned for the next episode of Dragon Ball Z the fight for the future against the Android terror you don't want to miss it [Music] you you [Music] go on how are your studies going [Music] but okay I guess you lost a lot of ground during your little excursion dynamic we've got to get you caught up yeah but I've been studying so much I don't think I could cram anything else in whoo all
