that opening right there looks like a good exit point right get comfy this spiderbot might be broken and missing some of its legs but it can still jump and fit through vents that's a good way to get through the station undetected that's a part of the remote detonator system from parliament if the met or albion rather actually analyzed it they would see it wasn't dead sex handiwork at all um ah that's dalton's mask it must have been recovered from parliament it might be the only thing left of him now um uh all this junk you'll have to jump your way across to get to the next bent opening ah ah who decided they couldn't be trusted to do their jobs suddenly some corporation could clean up our streets better than the same police force we've had but who knows how long when crime fighting is treated like a business crime will never go away that would be bad for business right so don't tell me albion has our best interests at heart if the police could handle their job albion wouldn't be necessary but they can't tone bombing is a perfect example a bunch of lazy overpaid cops are asleep at the wheel well they're not at the wheel anymore are they i've been around ah you're almost there make your way through this last bent part ah got it scanning spybot and accessing its internal drives while i'm analyzing this data you should make yourself scarce unless you'd like to explain to your new heavily armed privatized police force why you've broken into the station fine no no please the spiderbot fragment you found has a satellite-based gps module that regularly pushed his location to a specific ground station a secret location oh this [ __ ] keeps getting weirder let's go find out what we can pushing you the ground station's coordinates look around no stone unturned [Music] [Music] uh i'm detecting a surveillance network guarding a space under this bridge if you can patch into it perhaps you can take a look inside the gps history of the spider what we recovered regularly pinged these coordinates our mystery witness to the real bombers must have come to this lovely damp location several times out of the way and gross good place to plan a terrorist attack or to discreetly dump a body into the thames hostiles near your location over have visual anyone suspect is swimming away huh search has yielded no results report back to hq give up while [Music] ipad holy [ __ ] [ __ ] there's like a whole secret bunker down there looks like an off the books cop shop well if album was stopping all over your workplace you'd find a different place to store your lunch too and it seems our mystery officer was dedicated what the [ __ ] were they working on that led them to the tone bombing the computer's dusty enough to kill an asthmatic but there may still be something useful on it this is inspector caitlin lao well former inspector now since albion's coup the met is no more the police brass had already buried the evidence anyway everything implicating albion and clan kelly in the bombings but i know mary kelly's band of [ __ ] were involved and they're involved in other crimes we can look into me and a few good mates are willing to go off book going after mary kelly again i'll never [ __ ] learn will i inspector caitlin lau video log clan kelly and albion are teamed up on some deal i don't have all the details but it looks to be human trafficking the european processing center is the albion angle since the bombings they can grab anyone off the street call them illegal immigrants potential dead sec insurgents whatever though we know who the real danger is so clean kelly gets hold of these people these immigrants deportees victims really and they're taking them somewhere but where and why it all comes back to the boss lady herself i knew she was into something but she wriggled off the hook there's only one way i can do this 24 7 surveillance on mary kelly if i'm caught well this will be my last entry but i have to see what she's hiding so our mystery officer was inspector caitlin now it sounds like mary kelly was her white whale and her investigation led her to the bombings [ __ ] we knew albion were [ __ ] but they're working with clan [ __ ] kelly it seems like zero days wet covers all of the unsavory bits of london tug on a thread and it leads back to them clan kelly and albion included people have been disappearing off the streets a lot of people we have to do something about this inspector lao mentioned albion is running their part of the operation out of the epc detectives like us call that a lead me [ __ ] i thought they had me this albion clan kelly business leaves a bad taste in my mouth and if caitlyn allows right then this little nugget jumps to the under the queue we have reason to believe a former dead sec operative may still be alive but missing inside the epc angel lopez not london-born but i won't hold that against him unlike some others looks like angel got caught up in the immigration roundup which ironically may be the only reason he escaped zero day's deadseg purge anti-immigrant sentiment has grown in london since the bombings albion fuels it it allows them to send anyone they want to their brutal refugee camp we need to find angel before they discover he's dead sec this is kind of personal team but finding his trail might just shed some light on the albion clan kelly connection [ __ ] they shuffled him off to the epc where he's waiting to be deported with all the others if he's lucky i've sent the details to your device and advised our contact at the epc they can get you inside hello hello someone else slapped off work and now it's your turn all right all right i swear oh [Music] i've delved more into kailyn lau's investigation and an enormous number of missing person cases center around the epc the inspector was definitely onto something we should find our contact i'm afraid of what albion might do to angel to discover he's dead we are still on the suspect over i've lost the target i've already taken care of your entry get you in quick and quiet you haven't put me in the system right we're trying to keep this off the books no worries i'll spook but come meet me on the rooftop the only place here that doesn't smell like peace got some info for you glad to be done with that disengage this search is pointless the european processing center it processes deportees by stacking them up in squad conditions and forgetting about them but hey is to protect london right look i know i smell nice oh [Music] lazy oh [Music] who did it i did it top and nan said computers were useless what's going on here this place is worse than a prison camp every day i see people come through here pawn from their homes and their families but i rather stay and keep our eye on things maybe help out once in a while like now my god this place is a travesty and the government is okay with this anyone here could disappear unnoticed yeah well people have been disappearing records say they have been processed but it doesn't add up no one ever properly leaves and with the kelly's prowling around like [ __ ] hyenas i am not too optimistic about the people slipping through the cracks of course because mary kelly has to stick her nose in everything the vulture truth now about your missing guy the best place to start would be the epc database they keep a record of everyone that comes in and be careful pushing the location of the epc database on your optic you might mind standing away a little [Music] bit you
