[Music] hey there new york friendly neighborhood spider-man here wanted to give a bit of a life update since i'm sure you're wondering where i've been the past couple of weeks [Music] come on guys i'm talking to my fans right now sorry about that but yeah i've been a little busy and i've sort of not really kind of been working with the avengers it's like a side hustle it's hard taking down a multinational corporation especially when your team has been deemed outlaws in the public eye but we still find time to enjoy ourselves outside of work i've actually been able to do a lot more recreational stuff since i joined them here's a secret from yours truly the avengers surprisingly normal outside of bad guy butt kicking they're like this big family of heroes all working together and helping out but still finding the time to have fun not that i've been goofing off it's still serious work fighting alongside the avengers but you know how it is saving the city all the time all by yourself it gets kind of lonely i've met so many cool people now i've been to so many wonderful places and you know i'd never leave new york you guys are always my number one but the avengers are like no other friends i've ever had it's been kind of great sorry i'm totally getting ahead of myself let me back up a little bit start from the beginning this is safe right yeah totally safe what could possibly go wrong okay i did not think this one through hill should be in contact soon to fill us in hey guys we have a visitor hey you know you guys should really consider getting a doorbell or a front door can i come in now [Music] okay spider-man let's talk you two know each other spider-man's been fighting baddies in new york for like ever sorry i spent the last five years frozen and in space i was living in a trailer with internet well i'd say i'm insulted but 50 recognition ain't bad aim had a pretty extensive file on him no id though you cover your tracks well wow coming from you you can't see it behind the mask but i'm totally blushing right now still doesn't explain why you were hanging off our helicarry or mid-flight yeah i need tiny dancer she helped my friend slip some aim intel to the resistance a while ago i was hoping i'm listening right so i think ames working on something big like chemical weapons big i'm having trouble getting specifics because every file i've pulled off their servers is super redacted the number of black bars on these things put some modern art to shame and and i'm trying to track down their supplier but i i need tiny dancer to break ames encryption so i can get into one of their facilities i can handle the rest myself let us take a look first if you're right about what ames got planned we'll help you get into that facility hang out until we're ready to go tony that it's really not a big deal it's just to get in you're still walking okay don't worry i'm an expert in hanging out get it hanging well i thought it was funny you know you guys don't have to come with me right we know and still gotta help though it's what we do and uh you don't have to wear that mask around us if you don't want to it's not really about me there are people back home that i need to protect and the mask helps me do that hey i get it no one back home knows i'm miss marvel either except my abu of course but um mask or no mask we all need people who have our backs and really get us even the weird parts especially the weird parts in any case you should check out the place thor and the hulk are competing in the home room but i'm sure you could kick them out the harm room is that name literal or ironic you'll see welcome to the chimera spiderman thanks let's hope this was the right call pete hi i'm liz liz allen peter's friend sort of it's complicated your dad's company is alan chemicals right yeah i um i track down the person who's been funneling their resources to aim it's it's mark raxton should i know who that is he's my step-brother been working as a junior executive since he graduated college and now well now i guess he's selling out our family to aim can't wait for that conversation over thanksgiving dinner we have to stop him any idea what he might have planned not a clue i'll look into what he's been doing at alchem but let me know if you find anything on your end we're going to fix this don't worry [Music] mission report miss allen very funny so i looked into my brother's network and i think i got a hit a former mentor spencer smythe four years ago he started working with aim as one of their lead tech engineers so he could have recruited your brother that's what i'm thinking here's the good news i know mark's work if they're collaborating i should be able to reverse engineer something to give you an edge against whatever smite's cooking up sounds good i'll take all the edges we can get thanks you are definitely not supposed to be here does it help if i say i come in peace marginally look i know i'm probably not your favorite person right now but i am here to help smythe i mean he's gone off the deep end why the sudden change of heart last i saw you didn't have a problem making robots specifically designed to kill me i know i know but you have to understand it was the only way i could make sure liz was safe from aim they would have ruined her career or worse and now they know that liz and her friend at the bugle are helping you guys destroy those chemical caches they're making moves so let me help give you an edge against them it doesn't make up for everything but maybe it's a start okay cards on the table liz trusts you but i'm going against my gut by letting you be here you're on shaky ground raxton i'm keeping my eye on you good that means you're not an idiot you got a sec a present for me you shouldn't have mark and i reverse engineered some of the circuits really whoa this is amazing while i've got you i talked to peter but did you now he offered to hack into the bugle's website and broadcast incriminating footage from ames internal database worldwide we just need to get him access to aim server from the inside sounds like a job for me and mark you can use his login to get administrator access into aim server send the data to pete and we're in business come here this will only take a sec mark raxton a junior executive at allen chemicals turned himself in to authorities today claiming that he was solely responsible for the company's involvement with aim scientist dr spencer smythe smythe and advanced idea mechanics are both under investigation after raw footage of advanced synthoid testing was leaked to the daily bugle's website raising questions as to whether ames practices are not just unethical but illegal the bugle's internal investigation into who uploaded the live stream is still underway hey liz are you okay sort of still processing i think mark always had a bit of a protective streak i guess i never expected him to do all this just to save my career i mean working with aim even knowing what they were really doing just and you wouldn't have lost that internship in the first place if it wasn't for peter parker peter peter had the right idea this whole time aim is dangerous we should have exposed them a lot sooner so you don't hate him i mean i did it first nobody likes losing their job but this is bigger than both of us and now i have something to offer the resistance what's that maybe alan chemicals can't officially work with the resistance but they can at least spare one of their top biochemists me parker said you were as tough as you are smart he was right so what about you huh what's next for spider-man well first i'm gonna go back to new york and get a decent slice of pizza after that i guess it's back to the old grind speaking of i have work to do so it's cool if you want to go like have some superhero bonding time or whatever oh that's okay i'm still not used to having people around i've always flown solo or swung i guess so working with the avengers has been kind of terrifying but also nice i don't know it's strange having people want to be around me and wanting to be around them too that's called having friends spidey you should try it sometime i think you'll like it you did good out there yeah and you know if you wanted to stick around on a more permanent basis i don't think anyone would mind uh bruce only requested that you limit your lab time to once a day and during work hours i i'm really flattered but i've still got my own message to clean up back home new york isn't gonna save itself still if you need anything from me give me a call and i'll be there oh yeah you're not gonna go all i work alone on us i guess it's not the worst thing in the world to have a couple of super hero friends on speed dial uh actually if people mind i get a lift back to new york kind of far for a ride share so hey aunt may sorry i'm late i was hanging out with some new friends hey don't sound so surprised you know what i did have a nice time but you know you're always my preferred company sure i'll grab some tamales on the way home yeah i'm glad i had a good day too love you [Music] you
