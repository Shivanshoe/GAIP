and you boy are not yourself you are too quick to temper you are rash insubordinate and out of control this will not stand you will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen it is not too late this discussion is far from over we are here because of you boy never forget that wow it's cold this is hell not just hell worst place in hell you could have put us i see a ship get us there it only takes us halfway to tears temple but at least it gets us far from here for a thousand mortal lifetimes the bridge keeper kept the living out of this place but now that you've ripped his heart out here we are funny how it all comes around boy that wasn't me ugh woof it was me but we're gods we can do whatever we want turn away boy do not dwell on those thoughts not here we must keep moving yeah what good what was that not just the old and sick come to helheim so do the criminals they all must not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture how do we stop it escape hell as soon as possible i'm not gonna let it bother me like you said ramir it was just an illusion i wasn't me no but it is who you have become of late whoever i am i will get us out you will follow orders but maybe that's not who i am it had better be now let me focus i don't mean to hurry you but faster let me think uh oh huh wait i think i see baldr up ahead i can't taste i can't smell i can't even feel the temperatures this room feasting drinking women it's all god he will never god feel pain again death has no power over you now you would rather die i would rather die yes take it away i can't please please take it away come on no yes i can't fix come on ciao never what you did to me what you did to me freya is his mother why did you keep this from us head would you believe it slipped my mind i would not ah i'm at a loss ah sure you have no reason to keep such a thing a secret there's the boat we will speak more of this soon uh cool huh oh uh i will have much to do after i kill you who is that we must hurry whoa oh uh not entirely sure this is seaworthy give me space to work you have done enough just bear in mind this boat can only take us part of the way the earth temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which sadly we are downstream that means even if we get there intact we'd still need to sail up a waterfall somehow the vineyard built the greatest ship that ever was and it can fly excuse me yeah because it was designed to fly this was not nevertheless this is the boat we have on perhaps the biggest iceberg i've ever seen at least the fire's making me what now so now the sales are loose just watch pulling the sails down but how they're gonna catch the wind we're floating the heat from the fires we're actually floating we're stuck not for long stay with the moment wait for me then we need to talk brother you do realize it's over don't you even if we make it back to midgard you and balder destroyed the only gate to yottenheim we are out of options and that boy up there he's in nine kinds of pain his head's turned so far around andreas is not your concern well he might become everyone's concern if you don't do something you don't have to be the smartest man in the world to see that go petraeus i can help together now we did it we're free we are going to get out of here it is time to end this here's my son it is time no it's that voice again do you know who that is i do not know hold on oh wow watch your lap harpoon i will free up find your water um head how long before we reach the temple yeah it's freezing as long as we maintain this speed and those fires don't go out we should be there in no time lad i'm not ready is wow god oh oh wow uh cool come here how's the fire staying lit would you believe magic or those blades huh uh ready one time oh foreign but we need to lose that harpoon it is time my son look around at what you have done uh come on we gotta go you saw there's no time look i have a plan done that was your plan you're both tracked we are leaving this realm now as long as we didn't write our way back what is this place this is odin's and recognizes atrocious taste anywhere look at that it's the missing panel about here odin must have stolen it but why he always has his reasons might i have a look well this is most unexpected why what does it mean we're having the foggiest isn't that unexpected look clearly that tear traveling somehow perhaps magically but what's that to do with the giants that they should avoid a shrine to it i'm afraid that is none too clear what are those rooms in the corners not runes symbols from different lands they mean war i how do you this one i know too well oh his eyes they are jewels like yours no doubt signifying the gift of sight the giants granted us give me a closer look interesting interesting what is that secret plans concealed by tears so none could access by him and those few others the giants trusted and right under odin's i did promise i'd get you to your name what do you mean ed you said we were out of options don't you see brother odin never gave up hope and neither should we he knew there was a clue in here but we are the ones who found it these plans are for a key to some chamber tears kept hidden i don't know where it's leading or what we'll find but it's a path how do we make this key i suggest we ask a dwarf that symbol on the temple door it's a bunch of rooms together peace unity hope other things too tia's own design he made this door himself i think this is where odin brought all his best clues about yodenhan uh boy before when you saw i didn't see anything you did not see me with someone an old man what old man can we go yes very well all right let's get back to midgard and see about making that key where's that dwarf now head why did you not tell us balder is the son of freya he is it's shocking every time i hear it and yet obviously i know it when i think about bolder and freer from there balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical wait what is happening he is bewitched not to speak of what he knows i am i am oh that's it precisely i wonder how long that's been sold since she had my head at her mercy but back when i figured out baldur's weakness i'm here yes lad you just said you figured out baldur's weakness did i but baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical enough this means there is a way if he troubles us again we will find it can you make it is it a weapon armor or likewise an instrument of war of which i'm a master at shaping no then forget it even if i wanted to make such an insignificant google i'm liable to change my tools working on something so delicate and ladylike then shingle it how to weld the item with scaps like keep the layers thin alternate the overlay okay smart guy and where do you propose to find a lump of quality scalp slag last time i saw one i could still get ridgid down south shut your mouth is that where did you i had to get my hands dirty well don't just stand there let's do this what you you're fine with working on something that's not a weapon oh hell why not what i can grow too oh what watch the spine keep your wrists loose don't you keep your wrist loose yeah i need more heat here coming up you're gonna temper that steel longer i don't need to i triple quenched it with drago see how inventive and sanitary you clever little beaver never too late to learn a new trick is it no it's not yeah here it is nope don't forget this no quit your grinning it's downright it's just nice to see you together but now the rune on your brand looks different yeah price of reforging something what broke i knew it you two love each other i'll cut it out princess you're gonna get me all weak i like the new and better don't you we have work to do no let's get you all bum-fuzzled over there get going something else we can do for you nah just glad you guys worked it out ah well i could say the same to you yeah i guess i was getting a bit full of myself i told him what he needed to hear how's it sounds to me just the same i'm sorry for how i spoke to you sendry you forgive me already have like you said it all worked out now let us get back to work before i get sentimental one lady make you something anything else for you looks good so foreign now we just need to figure out what door this key opens it has to be somewhere around the temple tears roon this is it we're inside but what is this place your guess is as good as my little brother the tree we're underneath the realm travel room but why is the floor on the ceiling those round doors seem to mirror the ones above up there up there deer use the same magic to protect the black roon the clue we seek may be inside huh right next to the united door interesting but can we reach it not from here well one in our sanctum within another those tapestries looks like more giant art whatever it's here did for them must have been big whoa who are they boy this is the room for your night that's right and look we're on the other side of the door the upside down door what are you thinking stand back okay it's moving what's moving extraordinary the whole room is built on some kind of axle there's chains on both sides without those we can flip the temple okay what now oh things are happening okay i don't think they're attacking me boy on the statues i see that it says hmm ominous go on read before the first after the last nothing between no shadow cast oh are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach them whatever it is you said there would be a path the temple can be flipped therefore we put the temple the logic is not sure what happens when we recklessly append a room that's rooted to eight other realms i'm curious of course but it's a leap to imagine it gets us to your night i don't mind to leave well who knows perhaps you and dear are the same kind of mad here boy another one it says his name is burgomere i think mother said he was the king of the jews i that he was and quite a bit more looks like he had a lot of kids he's dead but nobody killed him do giants die from old age they may though it's rare again with the dashboard huh exercising hmm foreign okay we made it time to do what you do brother now we can decipher those new flying rings and the travel rune is here too you want to go until gods grow good could be quite awake no they're just waiting for all right go oh oh um enemies ahead um the other chain waits eyes the other kind variety is so important huh huh truly do you hate this pot i know oh i can't believe we're so close i for one never doubted right leave them in peace obviously not referring to us ah uh oh we are done here uh oh ah come on i'm ready boy yes sir time to put the temple yes sir what just agreed to stop saying flip the temple it's starting to sound normal brothers i know what i promised but in case this doesn't work just remember tyr had good cause to create these obstacles he's kept rottenheim out of odin's reach but the world is hardly at peace no but it's got hope we're all working together now we have unity that's what the rune on the door to this place was telling us we're on tears path lift with your legs brother he knows just trying to be helpful ah standing on the day that brute force is the answer i'll be quite happy to be on your side brother and we're not dead that's a plus there oh noah see that mimir nobody can do all this alone all these obstacles they're just chances to prove are the ones who can beat them we may argue me and father you and freya brock and syndry but when we all work together we do make a good team and that's tears test that's why we're going to make it deodorant do you hear that brother lads found his equilibrium what's that mean he means you speak wisely atreus and that is good to hear ha i guess the temple was made to be flipped look the trees upside down or are we i'm not sure anymore room boy your knife well what have we got some sort of travel stone let me see great out dumblezatus that's the unity stone you know it i wasn't sure it existed if tyr possessed this that explains how he could visit all the realms and other lands to boot he held this in the panel at owens library yes yes that's it i understand now it shows tyr walking the realm between realms you know how you must never stray from the path well tear always followed his own path if you catch my meaning the realm between realms so you're saying kirsten showed him stepping off the branch of the world tree and you're thinking to reach the secret path to your non that's what we need to do i am oh dear that is what you're thinking good i am more than okay with not throwing ourselves over the edge of the world jesus yet in due time boy ah really you two going in or what so what you find out don't be too careful you're hitting the road or chewing the fat something else we can do for you no just glad you guys worked it out ah well i could say the same to you yeah i guess i was getting a bit full of myself god if you're thinking about hurling us all into the void i hope you're quite sure wasn't it your idea find your own path right bollocks this is where tears stepped beyond and the unity stone protected him ready ready well if this is it lads it's been an honor a faith head this is oh how can i be so nauseous without a stomach come on that was great look the tower i knew there was something down here amazing how do you hide something that exists in all realms cast it out of any realm to the space between clever old tear is your time on the other side can't be that it's not like you go through vanaheim to reach the midgard peak but how do we use it i'd suggest we look inside but stay alert tears little challenges are never as simple as they appear i have noticed well this is sparse the pedestal oh no it took the stone tower it's absorbing the stone's energy something's happening is it moving it's moving it knows what to do the stone served its purpose we're fulfilling to your spell what happens now no idea brother after that fall i'm sure we'll pass the worst of it smells like meat no this is considerably oh looks like alfonso oh thank hmm oh that was tough where do you think it's taking us next i do not know oh no we're back in hell oh dear here we go not yet surely that's enough of that this won't be dead sure that's fair um wow uh you stop i think it's over hi but where are we look we're back in mid garden there's the bridge we did it the tower's back where it belongs now tears travel room can take us to youtube how did you do this odin suspected the giant secretly possessed some remnant of primordial youth in our creative essence the stuff all realms were made of the unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence to trust an outsider with an even tear tells you just how desperate they were and look now we can finally light all the razors and see what happens another name it's the name of one of the valkyries that's quite curious you fellows sure love to make a racket don't you what will it be what the [ __ ] ever i don't know what we'll find when we get to jottenheim but we must cover our tracks ravens will tell him of the towers restoration and we mustn't let our efforts be to his benefit very well hold on wait a minute this isn't going to work what there's no travel crystal gear must have used his own eyes to reflect the energy it was his final fail see i've got an eye one who didn't what don't mother i precisely to keep me from traveling sorry lads thought that would work what did odin do with your other eye you'd have kept it in any of a hundred places i'm afraid we've come so far there has to be a a bit of a long shot but for years i've seen syndra sometimes brock looking around in that mountain when odin came for his visits maybe they know something brockton syndrome hey guys question for you anyone know where we can find mimir's other eye oh yeah that's yeah i'm sorry as a matter of fact odin asked me to hold he wanted me to build a home he showed it to me you see and i oh decline sorry will you excuse me oh well that was useless you know it was about that same time that odin came around looking for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment now that not being a weapon in the acer being a bunch of park speckled talkers i too saw fit to decline but i know we got it built just the same oh what was the statue i said one of thor out there flashing his sack to the lake the statue that the serpent ate sorry about that feeling much better how are we supposed to look inside the snake inside oh we'd better go see what the world serpent has to say about that well lads i don't know what lies ahead but now would be a good time to make sure your gear is ready for the worst anything you need to do i'd do it now what's more to the horse wow steady oh ah he thinks it might still be in his stomach um and he's open to letting you go into his mouth to look inside ew really by the by he's no wild about it either you do not have to come well i'm not gonna miss this go you sure this is a good idea no well brothers i've been to many strange places but this will be a new one yeah i've never been in a giant's belly either how about you father never wonder was not trying to eat me maybe we should expect that sort of response at this point here we go funny i used to dream about getting eaten dreams are nothing i'm not afraid it just reminded me of a way i used to feel when i was a child let's find that statue ah smells not as bad as i thought it'd be a bit like heather ale fermenting rather pleasant actually you're so weird water kind of burns in here that is water isn't it there the hammer you father so any idea where odin hid your eye no it's not like i can still see through it uh yep that's an eye maybe you should stick that in my head for safekeeping gently now gently thank you brother you don't miss depth until it's gone how's that feeling here well i wouldn't say i'm feeling whole again but it's a right improvement the buy frost is intact hell sir then we have all we need finally we're going to unite there's no stopping us now laddie have you ever had the town tempting feet so how do we get back out what's going on well that was mildly terrifying maybe our presence is upsetting norman gander's belly no something is wrong what's happening nothing good glad that's over is he getting hit what is that we must hurry couldn't agree more brother home titan watch the board shifting i'm good boy boy i'm good i'm getting kind of used to this what happened to him something we did no something else a dead giant why would the serpent leave us here look freya we can still trust her right until we know for certain keep a distance the world serpent what's happened here we hoped you would know you are far from home i'm looking for my son the two of you you helped me see things more clearly you do not know where he is then no but the woods and fields speak his name i know he walks here in midgard when you see him last long ago before you were even born why are you standing so far from me what's wrong something's happened there i had a feeling hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open do you have any idea any idea at all what you have cost me my boy mother i'm here don't run away oh i'm not going anywhere mother i know that you're still angry i know that how you feel hasn't changed but i i want you how i feel how i feel i've spent the last 100 years dreaming of this moment i rehearsed everything i ever wanted to say to you every word to make you understand exactly what you stole from me but now i realize i don't need you to understand anything i don't need you at all back off kratos this has nothing to do this path you walk vengeance you will find no peace i know you i'll deal with you later but family first this again oh you might want to turn away boy this won't be pretty i won't let you hurt him no boy fine stop no betray you're bleeding breathe boy breathe not my blood what is that i can feel this i can feel everything he's vulnerable now you will not do this what's going on is freya trying to kill us no do you hear the wind we are moving that arrow punch the mistletoe in the quiver strap yes mistletoe harmed him freya said it was wicked he's more than hard the spell is broken he can be killed i'm certain of it it's all coming back now now he remembers she controlling that thing stay out of it i can reason with him no woman you cannot he needs to kill you you can't stop me no one can where is he i don't care if he kills me i will protect him i will not let him die i'm touching this will all be over soon now more i feel i feel crazy you oh uh oh boy crystal dress address i'm doing wonderful i've never felt so alive oh oh show me more now i'll kill you stay away from my son you don't have to do this there has been enough pain ah shut up all right before you die i want to thank you both of them you've done what even the all father himself could not i've never felt more alive isn't it love well done boy stop please he's being father not a threat you will not come for us again you will not touch her i don't need your protection help yourself can you mother no matter what what i do or say you won't it won't stop inter fury in my life i was just trying to protect you i've made mistakes i know but you're free now you have what you want try to find forgiveness we can build something new we can because i will never forgive you still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me i have paid i have paid but if that alone will make you whole you've seen me dead we'll make things right i won't stop you handmail i love you here must be better than this no no no no no my boy my dear sweet boy freya he chose this i will rain down every academy every violation imaginable upon you i will parade your cold body from every corner of every realm and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell that is my promise he saved your life he robbed me of everything everything you were just an animal passing on your cruelty and rage you will never change and you do not know me i know enough does he boy listen close i'm from a land called sparta i made a deal with the god that cost me my soul i killed many who were deserving and many who were not i killed my father that was your father in health is this what it is to be a god is this that it always sun's killing their mothers their fathers no we will be the gods we choose to be not those who have been who i was is not who you be we must be better well guess we are the bad guys now in her eyes yes but she could never make that choice we should finish this journey while i still have strength i don't understand i know saving her was the right thing but she seemed all evil at the end not evil you killed her son lad her son the death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily but he was gonna kill her she would have died to see him live only a parent can understand so you'd let me kill you if it meant you would live yes look there was no easy choice for anybody brother but i think we can all agree you did the right thing the world's a better place with freya in it just if our time lasts she'll come around back to tears temple then one last time hi yachting awaits why did bulger say we crossed it odin must have convinced him that following you to your name would bring his cure lies i'm sure why did mistletoe break the spell daniel magic is powerful but its rules are slippery and elusive i'm sure it makes sense if you're a witch it's also bloody tragic balder was the greatest gift odin granted freya the one thing she treasured from their marriage only hope to spare him pain and spare herself loss but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions why did you say tyr felt responsible for what odin did to the giants there was an incident shortly after the forging of mjolnir when tyr arranged a diplomatic meeting between odin and the giant kings but this was when the long war was young when victory was still a thing dreamed of and the yacht nar might have tipped the balance between acr and vanier odin had persuaded tyr that the hammer was merely a deterrent a means to broke her piece from a position of strength tyr was hopeful to convince all parties they would prosper best through peace he knew the giants were deeply concerned about the hammer a super weapon in hands they did not trust but they trusted tyr always believed the best in people and taking odin at his word and his desire for peace he brought the raven king to yottenheim from there things unravelled quickly the giants anticipated odin's trickery and exposed his true agenda to spy and steal their secret wisdom with magics they expelled odin from their realm and cussed him never to return frustrated odin visited his fury upon the giants of midgard thor unleashed mjolnir's might upon any giant he could find none could stand against the tide of slaughter that followed and at last it seems with tears aid they retreated the tower disappeared no giants could be found in midgard and no man nor god has set foot in yottenheim since what's got you all bum fuzzled over there get going here we go if things work according to the plan go ahead and lock in yachting diamond we'll be on our way probably boy ahead get ready oh right got him let's hope this doesn't cause you to explode or anything oh i haven't considered that maybe we should talk about this a bit more nah i'm sure you'll be fine ready that's unpleasant now boy we must be close well what are we waiting for think it's far we will see i want please before we continue listen the last thing you two need up there's a decomposing heat ruin in the moment but i'll wait for you here this is between you and the boy true but if someone wants to fight my lady sifts off perfect slushers you done did it sorry we had to see this oh no no no no no no fine damn it fine watch the head till we return i can do this no no i can't okay ready come yourself look we're on the giants fingers i can see the highest peak ahead right over there we did it we did uh what are you doing i have nothing more to hide can we go now we're so close boy carrier hmm boy it's nothing i just thought i'd hear voices by now hello anybody here what is this place they must have all come through here when they left midgard what was left of them why carve all these faces what if this is all the giants that got out of midgard alive not really many at all odin and thor ruining everything for everybody where are they now the gents came back home so they could survive but i'm not sure they did huh who's the guardian i should feel them but i don't this place is dead what happened to them why mom send us here one question is answered and two more tickets wait father something's happening it's your axe it's mueller look she's arguing with a bunch of giants she knew giants that's us the first time we met the world serpent but how and our fight was balder but that just happened wait they knew everything that was going to happen the dragon in the mountain the stone mason all these drawings this is our story no this is your story but what does it all mean that i was not the only parent with secrets you didn't know she was a giant i'm a child why didn't you tell us she sent us here knowing we would find this why not just tell us the truth mother would have had good reasons walder was never sent to fight me he was tracking her all along not knowing she was only ashes if she had a plan for us i trusted whatever it is besides she hasn't been wrong yet come on we're so close to the end now yes yes we are look it's mothers she was here she saw every step we took before we took it like she was always with us watching over us leading us home let's finish it fine no we do it together suddenly a minute the giants they really are all gone there's nothing for us here come so i get that mother was a giant which makes me part giant emperor god and for immortal right i guess there's just one thing i don't understand my name on the wall the giants called me loki okay what's the name your mother wanted for you when you were born she must have called you that to her people but why a question for another day let us go home foreign so hey check this out guess it all makes sense now why should you want to end up here deal with your kind but did she know it's going to be like this here is this what she wanted us to see did she want us to tell the people or keep it a secret i do not know so what should we do i trust you to decide that oh so why do you want to name me atreyus no it can't be for god no he was a soldier a spartan a great warrior all spartans are great warriors we trained from birth our lives were disciplined duty battle and death life was grim and we greeted it grimly but atreus of sparta was unlike the rest of us he wore a smile even in the worst of times he was happy he inspired us to hope that though we were machines of war yet there was humanity in us goodness when the day came for him to lay down his life in battle his sacrifice saved countless others and turned the tide in our favor i carried him home on his shield and buried him with all the honors of spartan custom his memory was a comfort in dark times wow you actually told a good story and we missed it i understand if you want to go hungry but i bet there's still some corrupt developers out there that could be set free some other help people maybe helping people was part of my mom sent us out here too i mean what would atreus have spotted and what would loki do huh that's a weird name i'm glad we went with yours last am i glad to see you i believe i've reached my limit for dwarven charm what happened they took an uncomfortable number of measurements and then proceeded to bicker about the weather what do you want us to take you how about the warm confines of anywhere bloody else before we return to midgard i should warn you what time has passed than you went to realize the snowfall that began when you screwed up to become something else not just lots more snow and then the end of the bloody world in that approximate order another prophecy no brother prophecy doesn't expect this for 100 more winters at least you've changed something prophecy didn't count on you yep i'm telling you it's thimble winter i can feel it in my scrotum this is the big one stop saying that oh you're making me very nervous it was bound to snow sooner or later that ain't just snow when you know it it's the end times how dare you make me the voice of reason live just discussing the weather bit of a old snap lately what he means is thimble winter's upon us boys the winner to end all winners i can feel it in my screw yeah we we heard so if you're heading home try to keep moving and also to not die or if you're not heading home same advice yes that's a terrible pity okay tell me again how old knew we were going to yoda9 before we did odin is extremely clever you see nearly as clever as he thinks he is and he's a collector of prophecies if it's about the future he adds it to his collection helps him style himself as all-seeing and all-knowing but of course the idea is control control of the future control of his feet he control every realm of every land in every world if he could every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate even if you've never posed a threat before he may think one day you might so you see it's not important how he knew before you did
