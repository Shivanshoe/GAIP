a pushover except those two [Music] yeah what's with those guys they look at a weird like they're more powerful than they should be [Music] so the world tournament was finally underway most of the Z warriors were spread out across the matches however Goku and Vegeta were faithfully paired against each other for the sixth match of the first round Krillin set the tone for the tournament by making short work of his opponent in the first match in the second match piccolo found himself standing before the enigmatic shin however what is this what is going pond why am I having such a hard time with this guy this isn't right who the hell is he you'll find that out soon enough let's just enjoy the game for now count me out i forfeit huh you forfeit you're not going to fight anymore that's right I see so he's the former guardian of this planet perhaps he's realized Who I am then well let's keep things rolling time for our third match [Music] next it's Fidel versus Popovich [Applause] correct me if I'm wrong but you're not not what exactly you're not the the grand Kai are you no I am NOT he's the supreme kai the Sabri time please keep that to yourself for now I don't want others to know just yet so you're even higher than the Grand Kai who's above the for Kai's I mean I'd heard about gods above the Kai's before but I didn't know they actually existed hey piccolo something wrong don't tell me that guy's already talking trash nope nope you know keep your mouth shut do not say anything you hear me huh [Music] meanwhile Fidel was trading blows with the muscle-bound spewpa in the third match though Vidal was a much more capable fighter she was quickly overpowered by spoke of itches abnormal strength I can't quite put my finger on it but there's something seriously off about that guy like he's not using his own power that launch starts you gave it your best tap out just throw in the towel Vidal I'm not giving up [Music] [Applause] I've had enough that jerks going down [Applause] that's enough spoke ovitch you've had your fun we came here for something far more important than this hurry up and win the match yeah okay [Music] [Applause] spewpa Finch wins the match Fidel spoke vich you're not gonna get away with this you hear me should I call for a stretcher no I'll carry her myself eat meat that guy's headed for me you got it if I win my next match I'll be up against him in the fight after that go on I've got some Senzu beans thank goodness Fidel you're gonna have to trust me on this but could you eat this bean anything from you probably has some mysterious power behind it right yeah you should be fine now but it'd be best for you to take it easy for a while here Thank You Gohan gotta go everyone's waiting you good luck out there Gohan Gohan found himself facing the mysterious kebede Oh in the fourth match transform into that Super Saiyan form of yours I want to see if you truly have what it takes to help our cause huh how do you know about Super Saiyans and what do you mean help our cause you will find out soon enough first I want to see the power of a Super Saiyan but are you kidding I can't just transform into a Super Saiyan in front of everyone I can't hear what they're talking about he told Gohan to transform into a Super Saiyan [Music] Gohan piccolo nah what's up piccolo you know what's going on look I'm not sure what our apologies but Gohan will be assisting us with something for the time being all of you must promise that you will not get involved no matter what happens I trust I can count it what what what do you mean you honestly think we're just going to do whatever you say tell us who you are he's the supreme kai he rules over all the Kai's he's a god oh yeah that's right King Kai told me about you so you're the supreme kai huh all right I'll transform into a Super Saiyan I'm not sure why you'd want me to though why don't I take it one step further and transformed into something beyond a Super Saiyan take you to the next level what beyond the Super Saiyan [Music] [Music] this energy is incredible that's our guy he he transformed go on transformed you gotta be kidding me we're taking that energy make sure he doesn't try to escape spoke ovitch right who are you [Music] that's it we've got enough energy now let's do it yeah wait don't move not yet you'll be fine chibita will restore his strength shortly [Music] I intend to follow those two and learn where they're taking Gohan's energy if you wish to join me you are more than welcome to do so I could use your help so what are you gonna do Goku I'm gonna go with him you heard him didn't you Crillon he could really use our help in this besides I have to know what this is all about then I guess I'll go too I don't think so Kakarot did you forget about your match with me come on this isn't the time for that okay Vegeta don't blow me off the actions of that supreme whatever aren't my concern in the slightest all I care about is settling the score with you once and for all that's the whole reason I joined the stupid tournament in the first place I hear ya I hear ya it doesn't have to be here but we'll fight later I promise all right idiot you're only back from Otherworld for one day remember hey you should come to Otherworld with me we can fight there let's go tell me can i really trust you with Gohan it'll be fine after I finish healing him I will be joining you I'm sure he'll follow soon thereafter dammit [Music] wait up so you've decided to come there thank you I don't think we have much of a chance without your help much of a chance you mean against those two guys no not those two they're merely pawns at the beck and call of an evil wizard a wizard yes right around the time mankind began to walk upright here on earth an evil wizard named bibbity lived in a distant corner of the universe one day bibbidi happened to create a terrifyingly powerful monster that monster was boo and untenable and fearsome watchin in a few short years hundreds of once-vibrant planets were reduced to nothing but ashes launching boost power was so great that even his creator struggled to control him bibbidi had no other recourse but to temporarily seal majin buu away i was able to use that chance to defeat bibbity however I failed to realize that bibbity had a child his son poverty who was filled with just as much evil as his father there you're healed Gohan Wow I feel great come with me I will tell you everything can I come too there's so much I want to know please can you just promise me you'll run if things get dangerous sure all right then let's go majin buu huh Wow okay so then what were those spoke of itchy and llamo guys doing it the tournament [Music] in order to break the long-held ceylon margin boo a large pure energy source is needed [Music] those two were sent to the tournament to gather that energy we won't be able to reach the others at this rate we need to increase our speed I can't buy any faster than this okay you'd better head back then things are far worse than I feared guess I'm gonna have to huh that's too bad but I think I finally learned something it wasn't my dad that beats so back then it was you guys right well I knew it I thought something was off when I heard my dad beat him that clears things up good luck Gohan pulverize that wizard bhavati and save the world right [Music] don't die on me Gohan I want to go on a date with you when you get back [Music] are you done we need to hurry after the Supreme Kai right sorry about that [Music] I wonder what this bobbity guys like okay let's go meet up with my dad and the others hey it's my dad and the others [Music] someone's down there do you think it might be that bobbidi guy [Music] no that's not mama D someone's coming out [Music] dabura curse that bobbidi he's made the king of the demon realm nothing but his servant huh Tabora which one's that the big guy yes wait so that means that the little one over there is the wizard bobbity correct what he lacks in physical strength he more than makes up for with his terrifying magic bar body's greatest technique is his ability to latch on to the evil in one's heart and use it to bend the victim to his will for this reason only those such as ourselves free from evil in our hearts we'll be able to fight him oh my this is completely full of energy well done you two this brings us closer to reviving majin buu and it also means I have no more use for you briefly yes sir [Music] well my dear Devorah it seems that your mu and his friends have brought us some visitors just as I calculated and with him that infernal Supreme Kai who murdered my father and dog again assuming we can't make use of the energy for the Supreme Kai in capito three of the others appear to have more than enough energy for our needs once you eradicate the others Devorah I want you to then lure those three into the ship that will afford us a much greater chance of absorbing their energy indeed one more thing do not kill the Supreme Kai I will personally see to it he receives a slow and painful death later as you wish Lord poverty do not let me down sir now then it's time capito know what though Oh No Krillin piccolo but don't touch them they've both been turned to stone they can't be restored unless de bourree skilled oh is that all we have to do well that's in simple enough leave this place you will never be able to stop Lord poverty let's go where are you going [Music] you come on - let's make short work of this guy and save piccolo and krillen [Music] whoa what is this place well this is an awfully playing room be on your guard we don't know what kind of traps they have in store for us now that I think about it it's rather strange that you three weren't attacked at all my apologies but we're not the sit around and do nothing types your poverty is a little lower most low of this ship [Music] unfortunately if you want to go down any further you're going to have to go through me so in other words this is where you all die yeah I wouldn't be so sure that so who goes first I think rock-paper-scissors would be fair fine all right guys here goes good looks like I'm up first [Music] are you really going to fight him alone of course I'm more than enough for this worm you're dumber than you look you know that like I said before you guys are getting past this blow any damage you take here will be converted into energy and absorbed by this room and then sent directly to the ball that majin buu sealed inside that's good to you does that mean if I blow you to pieces right now no energy will be absorbed that's right enough talking let's hurry up and get this over with come at me I can't have you damaging my ship [Music] [Music] Hey what the whoa what just happened where are we bobbity used his magic to change the room most likely to a place that benefits his henchmen so what I'm going to end this [Music] prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the gravity here is ten times stronger [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] got a gun you're like God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank God prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] damn that poverty doesn't he have goons stronger than this hey check it out a hole opened up in the floor it looks like some sort of elevator how how did you do that [Music] hey what gives this room looks just like the last one whoa sky looks pretty slow [Music] that's that's Jack on demon beast yak on in the interest of time I'll transport you to your beloved her world of dark star environment make sure to retrieve plenty of energy for me now it's one of you should I eat first Europe against me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] think I'm gonna go down that easy [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if this is what they're throwing at us then this majin buu creature must be a real weakling what in the world are these people I know what to do now I shall handle these intruders myself and in doing so I should be able to retrieve more than enough energy for majin buu but de Bora if I lose you then I'll have no further defense against them who you actually stand a chance stand a chance [Music] I had the Borah king of the demon realm no one in this universe has the power [Music] you
