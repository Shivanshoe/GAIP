truck with you you see more you shoot him knew this wasn't over get the truck out of here okay we're getting out of here i can't believe i lived through that following close i know morello he'll have guys on the streets lots of guys uh grab a set of wheels and watch my back sure how the hell did morello hear about my deal all kinds of beefers in this city for now let's get the bulls back to the warehouse and try not to [Music] i die it we got more guys on us okay let's slow him down so hit him where it [Music] hurts [Music] [Music] morello sent more guys after us [Music] another motor coming

see what we got we got the booze i mean i know it didn't go to plan but we got the booth yeah so tonight me and you are gonna drink a bunch of it i guess we earned that much [Music] looks like at 38. morello's boys caught up with you yeah boss we took care of it what about the kid from kentucky well he took a slug to the shoulder but uh he's a tough blocker and his crew dusted out as soon as we bumped off morello's hatchimal getting shot will give gates and his pop another reason ice morello out of the whiskey business well let's see if this hooch was worth all the trouble excellent i'll work out the details with papa gates but once we're running this kentucky brown we'll be back in brass buttons good work son i'm proud of you i'm proud of all of you [Music] sounds like salieri was getting ready to make his move woken up to him maybe but then prohibition ended and the bull legging business got knocked on its ass know that fighting over booze man next to nothing that took us a few years to recover but when we did bounce back boy it was something we took what though we had from the moonshine and canadian whiskey and invested into no records some of them even legal construction restaurants trucking gambling we branched out into everything except pedal and dope by 35 things were looking up we had good money rolling in on the regular i had a wife and daughter sam was running a club for the don even paulie had a few records of his own wasn't exactly happy but what do you call it them content yeah that was it and cilieri he finally starts talking about getting out of morelo's shadow maybe buying our own cops our own politicians hmm that's interesting you think celia was sourcing high binders in 34. maybe way well a few years back the voice squad got to judge on solicitation of a minor once in the box he started confessing all sorts of misbehaving trying to get a deal but he copped to taking kickbacks from rollo and your mancelieri playing him off one another trying to goose the take but once morello found out he threatened to bury the judge's kids on the beach still breathing of course christ that was the missing piece how's that marilla was always winding us up but he never did anything that might start an all-out war learning silieri was building his own bench must have finally tipped his scales because in 35 he hit us with both barrels over his face and pasted it on his face oh hey boss what's going on i'm glad you're here there you go boss going to pepe's for lunch but carla called in sick you up for a drive sure bus bravo i'm

business time you know how it is it's good sure i know the business i see the books every day but since what happened happened i know that a capo needs to talk to his soldiers without some other guy getting in the way [Music] i guess we're mixing with a better sort of person though and i like dealing with all these big shots we got on the pad anything's better than those grifters trying to shift their hooch before the 21st went through ah this is only the start of it tom i got plans plenty of good people lining up for a slice glad to hear it [Music] must be nice for you some time away from
