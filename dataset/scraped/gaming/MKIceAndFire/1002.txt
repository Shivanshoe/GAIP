what's the matter don't like surprises time take better notes guess you saw that coming huh you think you've won what the hell are you talking about look around romanov the world will remember this day the day their heroes failed them what's happening here the city's collapsing damn it they played us steve can you hear me get the hell out of there screw this [Music] five years ago the avengers paraded dangerous untested technology causing damage on an unprecedented scale our beloved captain america was killed during the attempted theft of this technology thousands of other innocent people died and many more still bear the scars of what has come to be known as a day hundreds fell sick encased in strange cocoons only to emerge with dangerous otherworldly powers with no known cure the disease has spread across the country and while both shield and the avengers promised to rectify the situation it was dr banner's testimony that brought about the end of an era you so-called heroes transformed san francisco into an infectious gas-filled quarantined zone you unleash diseased powerful beings that wreak havoc throughout our nation many still lay dormant unidentified so i ask you again dr banner do the avengers pose a danger to society yes their activities outlawed the once mighty heroes disbanded but out of tragedy is born hope after the government liquidation of stark industries dr george tarleton himself a victim of a day and founder of advanced idea mechanics thinks science is the solution to our nation's problems i wish i knew what happened to captain rogers that day but i was nowhere near the reactor room i don't have those answers but i can promise you this i will use this second chance to make you safe aim will find a cure for the inhuman disease comforting words to those families torn apart by the disease but is he too confident many criticize ames tactics this so-called resistance army grows stronger every day this is phil sheldon reporting live at the a day anniversary can't see the revolution right under their noses come on where'd you guys go there's got to be a clue here somewhere hello there if you get it right copy everything we'll find you now we're talking oh retro stark do you have a moment to talk better yeah uh sure the girls are leaving for the mosque retreat in a couple of hours it's still not too late to meet them at the bus it was tonight kamala we talked about this going to the retreat will be a good time to get away from all of this breathe some fresh air laugh nakia will be very disappointed if you don't go you're right i'll think about it good very good there'll be ice cream oh and best of all no boys so lots of fun i love you beta i love you more but you don't get it okay where were we password hint first love hmm oh [Music] what come on you got this oh right dang come on guys no way can't be it oh my god i'm in i mean i can't believe it right uh copy everything [Music] bless your inflated ego tony stark [Music] i know i got something better check this out at headquarters guess i really kicked the hornet's nest gotta get to headquarters and check out what's on this flash drive hmm flying toasters are everywhere good tip me gotta brace the ramp thanks for the lift put whatever you want on top still the avengers tower who needs high-tech security when only i can make this jump ah back to the old hq it's a mess but it's my mess laptops upstairs don't want to bump my head jumping up like last time looking pretty worn out wonder if they make any for super-sized punches oh a mirror would break at the side of this well then again my brother freaks out over basically everything just let somebody try to get me at range stretchy arms for the win [Music] i need my laptop all right see we've got the chimera this must be the reactor room security footage dr tarleton but you're supposed to be on the command deck oh cap what's going on no way charlton sealed him in there's no malfunction he killed cap oh my god he killed cap what tiny dancer oh no [Music] heroes park i don't know this could be a trap but what if it isn't someone needs to see this just be smart kamala hand over the proof and you're done hello mechanics is down i go i guess sounds like a knock on the door i'll get it [Music] in accordance with inhuman protocol section 3 subsection 8 2 please remain still while we complete thank you for your compliance if you would like see no inhumans [Music] first time heading to the park this way uh forward i guess tarleton's lying about the command deck who knows what else he'd be lying about hello what was i thinking not graceful but made it okay get to the cat statue fellow heroes park been a while my parents used to bring me here all the time when i was a kid ames tearing this place down to build their new clinic such a waste everybody's a critic slash vandal all inhumans all missing this is what abu's really worried about the first person they called inhuman wow it's really been four years should be a good place to stake out cap's statue up ahead need a hand big guy cap it's been too long tiny dancer hey hey where are you going we're not home really we just got here hey want a drink yeah no thanks what are you paying your respects i'm just taking a shortcut that's awful shortcut come on get out of there right cool later so we want them back huh so they can kill more of us what no no no no what is it then hmm and you must get you going come on fellas stop are you okay candle kid's got a girlfriend zach check out her bag what what the hell is wrong with you people i just want to go home okay what are you doing my kid brother was there on a day he wrote some dumb stuff about captain america it wasn't cap's fault it's all their fault

newer [Music] [Music] pushing dumpsters is not how i imagine to stay ending aim's got humans looking for me too who can teleport looks clear this can't be our moment oh good you're awake i'm so sorry those syntholids were only following their security protocols stealing private information is a serious offense monica give her a moment hey what's going on where are you people taking me somewhere safe ah forgive me i know i don't quite compare to my holographic counterpart but it's a nice trick for the [Laughter] shareholders dr tarleton [Music] in the flesh why did you hack our servers i didn't steal anything then what were you looking for the cure perhaps kamala aim only wants to free us from being at the mercy of the powerful you know subjectivity unlimited power that's dangerous it's lethal a day was a prime example you are lucky to be alive but with technology we can right their wrongs we can give you back your normal life look i i just guessed a password okay i didn't think i'd actually get in she is clearly violent her infection must be getting worse what i didn't mean to hurt anyone of course not but what happens when you lose control again what happens when you hurt someone that you love even the avengers had to suffer for their hubris hey were you there i mean when cap died were you there yes luckily monica found me on the command deck her regenerative formula saved my life come on kamala let's do this yes let aim help you i'll take my chances damn it george get the girl now hold on kamala you just outed yourself as an inhuman stupid what were you thinking huh join the resistance become some kind of hero i can't go home i'll make a boo they'll punish them for hiding me i really messed up utah the old shield base resistance has to know what to do i have to get out of town what stop running come on stop oh sticking around to find out yes i guess i gotta fight my way out of town okay let's do this come on you want to see powers there we go are those grenades come on reinforcements engaged why don't we give our new friends great my favorite [Music] stop trying to kill me for this uh uh cover for me say i went on the retreat with you bye jersey subject 1102 can clone herself almost perfectly with the exception of a slight color variation in the eyes the cells are splitting down the center creating two separate individuals uh it's it's like the planarian flatworm only human exactly and can retain all the memories of the original subject 0925 can create powerful bursts of energy and there's at least a half a dozen with fire based abilities we're building an arsenal programmable power under our control no more heroes no more mistakes it's time for another dose i feel fine you're in a coma for six months earlier you could barely contain your cough few more doses of my regenerative formula and your treatment will be complete they still light candles at the base of that statue if not for that hammer i'd have torn the thing down leave it why have the public thinking you're still worried about the avengers let my people handle it we have a daptoid to launch you're right this version may be a bit more potent is it stabilized almost this is incredible [Applause] uh you have reached yusuf khan please leave a message and i will return your call hey abu so i took your advice i'm with nakia and the others on the retreat can you believe there's no cell service out here i i'd hike all the way up to this pay phone to make this phone call anyway um you're right we're having a blast oh i'll be home late sunday promise i'll be good love you more ah [Music] all the conspiracy theories online point to this canyon as a resistance home base they're the only chance i've got at least i know someone's been out here anyway just like me to travel across the country chasing rumors all i got ames out here too i have to hurry finally something not made of rock huh is this a good sign or a bad one resistance this is where they are it's gotta be first hello this was their base but where are they now they got away before no some must have escaped they have to be around here somewhere better keep looking huh just need to get up high and see where i'm at don't get mad abu i'm just stretching my arms [Laughter] i can't believe i just did that my parents would freak if they saw me out here i mean i'm freaking out no way chimera i found them i can't believe i found them [Music] here we go careful score dang it did you see that oh man [Applause] the resistance has to be here lights somebody's home uh oops almost the reactor room up's probably the way to go holy crap i must be close [Music] holy crap the command deck where is everyone this is it this is the resistance headquarters how long ago did those aim drones outside scare everyone away kind of dusty no they're here somewhere so oh uh hello maybe they hid in the crew quarters and got locked out thanks to the flaky power figures gotta get the power back on maybe there's a breaker or something i could flip there i think i can reach it okay just focus ah wow nice one kamala [Music] hello something else scared everyone away that sounds like this old thing's falling apart that wow is that what i think it is how is this still here it's so light you were right cap terrigen was powerful stuff who's there oh no wait don't hurt me ugh listeners [Music] can we talk about this i need your help all right what are you doing don't kill me i gotta get out of here no wonder the resistance bailed on this place hulk should have transformed back to dr banner by now how could pushing a red button possibly going if hulk comes back i'm close this was the hangar bay almost there be cool kamala just need to get to the top deck without getting my head ripped off hmm i wonder if those buttons still work push buttons move platforms right i could get used to this just keep going up gotta find a way to get that junction box working something's missing i wonder if there's anything around that could help yes found the handle for that junction box and voila now that button has power i can get out of here so there's my way out no sign of the resistance anywhere hulk must have scared him away better find a way off this thing what am i supposed to do with this footage now did you follow me here that is so creepy [Music] oh great needle hands i'm not afraid of you you're not taking me anywhere try to stop me me this is new i'm giants oh okay oh hey what are you doing oh take it easy it's okay just making sure that you don't die on me okay you can't just go around drawing people's blind i know i know under normal circumstances no but these aren't normal circumstances holy crap dr banner oh no um i weigh 900 20 miles away then you probably could just do s sorry talking about i've spent a lot of time um as the as the big guy so how long have you been here uh a few years yeah that's remarkable yeah so i've been told so this is why aimbots chase a kid into the desert not exactly i kind of stole something off of aim's server huh what why why i know i know i know okay i just i think you should see for yourself it's tarleton yeah why are you shutting down the security protocols did he just right right that's what i thought he totally locked cap in the reactor and then he tried to jack the chimera that's a bit of a stretch we know the reactor was malfunctioning so it's possible cap asked him to shut down the security protocols and then lock the door we've heard the ada testimony tons of times tarleton and monica were on the command deck when the explosion happened and that's why they barely survived but this proves that tarleton was nowhere near the commanding when the explosion happened this proves he was lying so where's the rest of it got bumped off the rest of the footage got corrupted look what if the avengers were set up okay tarleton aim this so-called cure it's just not lining up but there's something wrong and i can feel it don't you here i thought you were just some nosy little thief trying to make up a cap shield so i was thinking couldn't mr stark help us with this i mean the whole mainframe was built on his technology if anyone could get us in it could be him right there is a bus stop off highway nine you're gonna keep heading west and then when you do it'll take you some old friends who can help maria's good people tell her i sent you and uh just show her all of this but you saw the video you know something's not right i'm sorry i can't help you i wish i could but i can't but you're dr bruce banner you're one of the greatest minds of our time greatest minds look you look at what we did you have no idea how dangerous it is tarleton calls people like me inhuman he claims we're sick violent demented he says our disease will kill us in the end well i don't believe it guess i'll find mr stark myself wait just you'll need a ride really [Music] ah uh tony stashed most of his stuff here when stark industries went under and if anyone knows where tony is it's jarvis this trail should take us to the archive secret entrance cool well it's a nice day for hike yeah that's the spirit are you wearing that communications butt i gave you yeah practically invisible so why did you go back to the chimera well i didn't he did so did he scare away the resistance you know honestly kamala i don't remember anyone being there now the big guy had to run in with a few shield agents but after that nothing oh right i think i found something bit of tight squeeze yeah watch your head here let me help thanks there's a clearing just ahead the entrance should be there cool so what does jarvis actually look like like an outdated hard drive from 1998. okay new question what does a 1998 hard drive look like oh god wow you don't see places like this in jersey city it's nice peaceful yeah it's been a while tony used to let me come here give me space to calm down or break things this means we're close oh wait that's what it should send dr banner what do i do what hmm uh this is bad this is bad crawling all over the crap um what's going on uh i hope you brought a change of clothes oh i can tell by your silence that you are not amused it's okay i don't think bruce likes my jokes either no bruce okay okay i won't mention the guy with the glasses um this doesn't look temporary i think i can hear you hey uh we good okay we're cool i guess oh man didn't just arrive they've set up shop we've gotta find jarvis and get us oh guess aim took over the place still think mr stark's here i could head through the vents and take a look yeah that works [Music] games everywhere you distract them i'll find a way in [Music] they've got guards all over the place this might be a bad idea [Music] crap we're closing it all down i'm in these vents are huge looks like am built around the original archives [Music] um me that was close they almost saw me now big group of guys reserve conductors uh [Music] [Music] um hmm oh here [Music] i know you can hear me please you can fight him i don't want to hurt you hmm room this isn't you this monster isn't you doctors destroyed he needs it um hmm i can help you yeah right um let me help you bruce is oh i'm in something called a genesis lab what is this hmm you made it they were keeping the inhumans in here what happened this is where they hurt them hulk i need you to destroy this lab smash restrain the hulk you saw the truth banner you were the only one we're fixing the damage the avengers did what we did there is a chance for all those humans to have a better life we can still save the inhumans from your fate they want to cure but you're weak [Music] targets if you can't stop the hulk then i will i have to [Music] oh get out of there run hulk no way the archive this has to be the way in hulk i think i found mr stark's archive i'm gonna try to get it open okay right the switches get on it kamala [Music] i guess they know i'm uh-oh now you've got generators online keep flipping switches to get the power on please activate secondary systems uh right uh that door should open now please be here jarvis maybe he's hiding somewhere in this super cool pile of avengers stuff i think this belonged to thor maybe it's a secret lever oh no it's just a cup why display pyrite when you can afford the real thing i should keep looking the mark won did he plan to come back for all this someday from pepper to tony i know i shouldn't be freaking out right now but i'm freaking out tony stark's guitar caps for shield this was on display at a day you don't open a secret passageway do you worth a try what's over here [Music] looking sharp guys no way jarvis [Music] now to find hulk and get out of here what you got there cricket why don't you let me have that i don't think so all units find the girl and stay out of my way there's something wrong with you something different is oh there he is now stuck somewhere in between um maybe you're not an ape after all your kind of word for a test thing like i found the archive schematic i think i can find my way to you can't wait this is where i evolved oh go shot shot is it dead where are we anyway right talking to myself okay show me your secrets p705 according to our lead scientists we have successfully reverse engineered terrigen gas what wait please calm down in a moment this will all be over administer the cure what does that mean you're hurting him please please please stop where am i a promising result case 705 has made a remarkable recovery and will be monitored for the next 24 hours congratulations you've been cured impossible we should get out of here it isn't safe yeah sure uh well you can feel free to make it a little more homey thanks you good i'm not used to you being this quiet uh oh yeah it's nothing okay okay good so [Music] yeah what if it's real oh sorry what was that the cure what if it's real i mean i mean it looks real but what if i could be normal again it uh didn't work like that i mean you saw them it looks like it really hurts but but maybe that's worth it kamala i never really fit in before i mean superheroes were my world and i figured if i could just i could just win that fan fiction competition you know then everything would just be it doesn't matter now look at me i'm a freak you're not what you did back there hey what
