clan your family [Music] [Music] foreign no that is not me ouch [Music] it was not by chance that this struggle came to be the blame falls squarely upon my shoulders for giving evil the chance it needed and therefore fulfilling an ancient prophecy raiden's earth realm champions had failed to stop the deadly alliance from fully resurrecting the mummified army of the dragon king in the end only raiden himself stood between earth realm and total destruction defying the elder god's wishes he alone challenged quan qi and shang tsung in mortal combat earth brown's last hope for freedom [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] raiden fought well against the two sorcerers and it seemed as though victory was at hand but the combined might of quan qi and champson proved to be overwhelming even from a thunder god raiden was defeated the deadly alliance had won [Music] their victory was short-lived as suspicion and lust for power overcame both quan chi and shang tsung the former allies turned on each other the deadly alliance was no more [Music] quan chi defeated shang tsung and rebelled in his conquest but it is said that there is only one true ruler of outworld and that ruler had returned [Music] the prophecy had been fulfilled the dragon king had indeed returned to outworld to reclaim his army and impose his dominance death awaited all who stood in his way [Applause] [Music] [Music] and so it was that a new alliance was formed out of desperation sworn enemies joined forces to combat a greater threat [Music] raiden began to realize that even their combined might was not enough to defeat the dragon king [Music] there was only one chance left raiden's sacrifice was in vain for the blast had little effect on the dragon king now onaga has what he needs to shape the realms as he sees fit i was the fool who brought him this power only i can destroy this threat born of deception there have been many powerful warriors throughout the millennia but ages of mortal combat have begun to tear the fabric of the realms the critical point has finally been reached it was foreseen that combatants would one day grow too powerful and too numerous if left unchecked their intensifying combat would weaken and shatter the realms and bring about the apocalypse [Music] [Applause] my god the elder gods demanded a safeguard be put in place to avoid total destruction one that would make use of the combatant's insatiable bloodlust like moths to flame they would be drawn to battle uh [Music] at the apex of destruction alliances will be broken [Music] and old hatreds will be revived [Music] um at last it has come to this final battle armageddon has begun a battle raged at the end of the first tournament the forces of earthrealm were facing their greatest challenge [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh okay [Music] look at y'all [Applause] cool uh [Applause] come here [Music] oh oh academy [Music] you
