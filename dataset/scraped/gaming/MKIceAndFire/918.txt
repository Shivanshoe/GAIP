do choose and i'll tell it this is a story of sacred relics stolen for profane purposes when the mongols targeted divine artifacts and how the ghosts rose to stand in their way [Music] as the ghosts neared they were met by a single monk over here a mongol scout was pulling this cut he ran to warn his friends when he spotted me as the ghosts knew a scout meant more mongols were near they're coming please don't let them devour the temple grounds another group of mongols appeared intent on killing the monk suddenly charged at the ghost the demon's eyes were as red and fiery as its massive shield the ghost ran to hell there's another cut though there were many stolen relics the statue was nowhere to be found please like the statue it's sacred to our people the ghost continued searching the temple [Music] easy the ghosts discovered the rest of the caravan's guards [Music] [Music] along with this statue the ghosts found a map with the path the mongols were taking i know that area on the map i'll show you the way many believe temple statues hold great power sometimes even containing the spirit of hikami other times that of a demon the ghosts arrived at the first marked location on the map and planned their attack if the map is right the mongols will pass this way soon um [Music] huh they're coming uh the ghosts defeated mongol and demon alike but more enemies were on the horizon the ghosts heard the rest of the caravan approaching oh your souls are you ready they had no cuts with them perhaps the things they stole have already been taken ahead found many ways to travel between the heavenly realms some even convinced humans to release them from their prisons their ghosts reached their final location on their map in the umugi swampland i dare not go any further it's up to you now kill them if you wish they did them all [Music] for centuries countless statues and relics littered the grounds stolen from the temples huh [Music] hmm met the ghosts in battle eager to protect the stolen statues and relics eager to protect eu's army your soul is mine [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] uh [Music] with the oni leader defeated eo's plan had failed the statues and relics were returned to the temples and kept under watchful eye or even today some claim they feel the power of oni pushing against their prisons eager to enter our world once more thanks [Music] relax for a moment listen to these tales what legend would you like to hear this is a tale of how the ghosts fought man and spirit alike a mongol named sukhmatar had found a way to enslave the dead before they could be reborn he hoped to create an invincible army that would allow him to easily conquer tsushima with every enemy he killed tsukamata gained an obedient soldier the ghost felt the heat from the rising flames the dead littered the ground bloodied and terrified a mongol called out for hell betrayed us he believes we are too weak he'll kill us all and control our spirits through the fog came the spirits of the recently slain they stepped over their own corpses to attack the ghosts feel my blade uh let the spirits rest the mongols hand clasped and scroll outlining the path of sukhovatar's army the ghosts set out in pursuit somehow zug battle had found a way to create unreal vengeful spirits they followed his every order mongol bandit and samurai alike fell under sukhumvatar's control [Music] the ghost followed the path until they came across a small quiet village but the flashes of lightning revealed they were not alone [Music] ah your soul is mine [Applause] [Music] the ghosts found an unfinished offer an emirate meant to keep the spirits away huddles of blood darkened the pure white snow leading out of the village oh bloodstains led toward the window as if someone had crawled there to escape [Music] huh [Music] [Music] huh take this uh i'll kill you [Music] feel my blade tightly in the man's hand was a blood-stained scroll covered in strange symbols the ghosts struggled to make sense of the cryptic writing certain they were linked in some way to the spirits in the distance the ghosts heard the sounds of a mongol patrol approaching uh the ghosts watched as spirits of slain samurai emerged from the fog to fight their mongols the bodies of the dead mongols bore the insignia of sugar the ghosts were on the right track sacrificed allies and friends alike to increase the number of spirits under his control for he desired an army compelled to obey his every whim one that knew no fear and could never retreat the ghosts finally caught up to sukpotter's forces they moved into the burning town eager to free the spirits from his grasp the ghosts sensed overwhelming suffering from a nearby building cloaked [Music] uh yes [Music] the ghosts found the remains of a family burned beyond recognition [Applause] ugh countless innocents brutally impaled pain frozen on faces the fog around the large building slowly dissipated from the homes on the hill screams pierced the air find the ghosts were angered by the slaughter of the village the spirits vanquished the fog faded away [Applause] [Music] [Music] wafted from the nearby docks obscured deep in the fog huh the remaining villages mangled and broken were left to rat in a net like fish the fog around the docks floated slowly down the river [Music] [Music] huh time [Music] uh suddenly zuke barter's voice boomed throughout the village come ghosts once you are dead i will display your bodies as a warning to others that even the ghosts are helpless before water every footfalls approached the ghosts ready themselves [Music] dreadful warriors had covered his escape the ghosts moved on from the decimated village knowing more would suffer the same fate if sukubata wasn't found and defeated [Music] i have many legends for you to enjoy you
