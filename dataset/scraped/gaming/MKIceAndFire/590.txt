unusual for rose but i am a hundred percent sure because i could see her tears falling onto the dolls tears were falling onto the dolls oh wait a minute i know what happened it's a spell ridiculous cody we've got to apply logic nay okay we are having a conversation with a pair of binoculars there is no logic in that goodness sake i don't even believe in spells okay well did you believe that you could be turned into a wooden doll huh exactly it had to be the tears was a spell i am telling you so if it is a spell how do we break it okay i got this yeah me and rose we read all about this spell stuff i'm a virtual wizard right now okay just give me some space i need to think okay so if the spell was cast through her tears then in order to break it oh in order to break it we have to reverse it through her tears boom right okay we basically have to find her and make her cry on us again really okay fine okay do you know where to find her miss binoculars she's in her room go on okay thanks
