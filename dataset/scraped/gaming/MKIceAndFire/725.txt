had the opportunity to kill one another yes i trust him fine where's the meat and when japan after sunset i am sending you the precise location i'll see you there [Music] goddammit [Music] so he says see there's more up your alley than clouds hey at least here you know what you're getting here kitty kitty what's the rush yeah gear looks a little basic but it works hey not one step closer here to see who got a message for fingers comes from the tiger claws and that message would be two things urgent and confidential meaning meaning you've got a choice oh yeah you either get your [ __ ] kicked in for being slow or for being a nosy prick fine let him through sludge sounds like paradise 24 hours you feel no pain and barely remember a thing afterwards who can blame them then hey you all right no way i'm gonna swim i hate water can't you see nobody cares fingers no where i can find them if i could i'd swap you know why does everything have to be so damn convoluted in the end only i got left the shredded cables and empty bottles hey hands off pick up scared of your skinny ass you will be when every box in town depends on the [ __ ] you got a financial claim take it to court you [ __ ] and leave me be fine i get it everyone's got that breaking point just pay me what you owe me and you can [ __ ] off the greener passengers i don't owe you [ __ ] oh but you do and that [ __ ] has a name

face plate for free you want out you gotta pay me back hey hello there's a line uh-uh you ain't cutting heard situations things yeah like his hand sometimes slips glad to see a familiar face i'm worried sick about her v had no idea anything had happened we'll find her i know we will after the heist evelyn holed up with the mocks for a while right that's right so why the hell she go back to clouds thought she'd be safer there god knows why tried to get her to see straight but she wouldn't listen mocks don't happen to have fingers in their crosshairs no why her joy toys come out of his clinic in worse shape than they come in yeah well can't solve all the world's problems at once we're gonna be here forever i just know it maybe you could talk to those girls see if we can cut in front why me i don't think they like me just give it a shot that or come up with something better i think evelyn's been kept here somewhere on the one hand hope she is cause i want her back fast but on the other hope to god no because who knows what that sick [ __ ] could have done to her she means a lot to you doesn't she and you've arrived at that conclusion how exactly moment you knew where she was you sprang into action once you get close to evelyn you never want to let her go you worked at clouds not as a doll tunes are virtues that's where i met ev tom and the rest of the crew show fingers where will i find him he's operating on somebody right now been in there for ages shouldn't be much longer don't hold your breath i spent hours waiting for him to come out especially when he collects payment right after the procedure my friend here she's in real sorry shape you couldn't let us cut in front just this once of course honey pick my guest well now hold on hold on a sec didn't seem so bad just a minute ago she's a toughy keeps it inside mostly now try come on let's go just lips of yours hmm how about now better wait something's wrong can't see nothing but a blur faceplate's previous owner had a longer face than you edges are stretching yes hello what can i do for you looking for a girl named evelyn parker i know she was here in your clinic ah so that's what this is about where is she a loaded question if i've ever heard one you tiger claws as far as i know i'm all paid up we're with them marks why didn't you say so so what brings you here these girls know you're chipping faulty implants you might say so i'd say they're the very best i can find see what's in it for you whatever they have to offer and they always have something to offer heard you help the working girls around here well very few children will play with broken toys so when skin goes flabby sockets go out of whack implants malfunction i'm sure you get the gist you pay for goods you expect top quality consumerism 101. please grab yards offer better quality than this already told you i'm looking for a woman named evelyn parker need to know where she is step into my office please many girls come through here so many but let me put it to you this way i believe in giving each of them your personal touch ask anyone i'm more than a chop doc see i know what people truly want to be flattered praised patted to feel like like they deserve it of course i can't remember each and every one please set your exquisite derrieres down went jittery soon as i mentioned her name don't try getting out of this i know you remember her i i have a neurological condition it's not easy living with ticks really i'd love to help but if only i knew who you were talking about mocks have got low tolerance for scum like you and right now i'm the one thing standing between you and a particularly feisty and furious member of the gang so tell me where evelyn is or i'll let her talk to you poor girl tried to help her i did but as you can see this isn't exactly a state-of-the-art facility you mentioned you couldn't help her help her with what exactly if i only knew i wager she'd be standing here happy and smiling instruction register on her chip was burnt to a crisp tried replacing it nothing damage is caused by a netrunner using homebrewed malware sounds about right get to the point the point ah yes well i haven't the faintest idea where she is enough of this [ __ ] what'd you do to her you freak now either you put a muzzle on this creature or put her down it's impossible to have a conversation with her around don't talk to her like that she insulted me look the quicker you spill the shorter you'll have to put up with us now evelyn parker where is she could very well be on her way to becoming the next underground brain dance darling that's all i know what do you mean by underground i i don't know i mean i i don't watch that sort of stuff snuff xbds i told you i don't know you sure about this four days i had her here she was out cold in la la land for practically every minute [Music] it wasn't a slumber party we didn't have pillow fights and promised to send each other postcards where we find her how many times do i have to repeat myself i don't know i i did what anyone in my place would do when i realized i wouldn't be able to help her patch her up i called my fixer two guys came and picked her up the same day who'd you call who's your fixer [Music] wicko told her i had a busted doll with a bd implant to hand off where did they take her i told you already i don't know they weren't the talkative kind and i'm no gunk i know better than to ask questions of people like that you're no gunk what do you think why did all these girls come in here let you grope around them take us for your charm your caring attitude they do it cause they got no choice and in the end they despise you they can smell your pathetic these guys what do they look like like you me anyone else in this city really now they look like you they look like the kind of guys you don't make eye contact with one of them was a bearded fellow the two that came for her didn't say anything about where they were gonna take her what they were gonna do to her mention something about virtues with a moth of all things said she'd be perfect for them whatever that means but that's really all i know you ponder off like she was some [ __ ] inanimate mannequin because that's exactly what she was need air i'll be outside so i let her go back to clouds could have stopped her but i didn't don't worry we'll find her i know it we'll [ __ ] find what's left of her butchered corpse hey keep it together you want to give up now no only we got an xbd where's that get us we also know we're looking for something related to the debt's head it's better nothing i don't get your optimism still sounds like a big fat nothing to me that said symbol bring anything to mind anything it doesn't matter how small hey me hear me industry loud and clear markets looking for every kind of fetish yeah that it makes sense makes them harder to now harder to sing i didn't think big parties are your thing yeah

shooter v my dignity please what's up with you sure i'm in when well uh right now we'll wait on you see ya need to figure out where they're scrolling this stuff gotta be a rat hole of some sort without they do much shooting on location yeah gotta be somewhere quiet out of the way it could be we'll see something to point us in their direction in one of their virtues have to be real gonks to leave a clue everyone everything leaves something behind just need to know where to look lucky for me i'm running around with the best bd specialist in town has an extra pair of expert eyes well your
