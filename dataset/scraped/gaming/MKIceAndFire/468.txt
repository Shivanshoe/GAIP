cast about this laugh my friend my past won't get me into that ring forward we'll need to find another way uh [Music] so nature club [Music] uh come brothers let's end this [Music] yes so hey now thank you just like the idiot press hard [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh i hope this is the right game must be blocked from the other side hey so far [Music] hey you're ava right you serve king barak we were meant to check on the king and report back but soldiers grabbed us and threw us in here i'll let you out return to kim flan if you can nothing's upon your friend thank you [Music] who wants to know viking i served as my kiva thank you they offer you freedom [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] your life you're dead let's end this me to hide with you [Music] dog join us cousin we've been having a grand old time the kings and i it's the abbot who's turned this place into a prison he's taken hostages from all the families to control all of ireland shut your gap donald only kelly if you talk too much and flan will kill us if we don't it's like donald said it was owen he told us to delay whoever came until until what until the abbott can move his forces in how many men how many we don't know no one does he has some companies that are ma more men than he lets on that's all i know left to my cousin you'd both be puddles of blood and guts but king flon might spare your heads you'll be treated as hostages not prisoners until your king decides what to do with you now think on your sins it'll be easier in the end to let them keep their crowns but they don't need to know that yet flan must learn of this trap i've already sent messengers telling him to pull his army back i wasn't going to sit on my arse waiting for you i'm impressed don't be it took days of drinking that swill before neil finally grew bored and careless you have outdone yourself i'll be sure to let the king know who the real hero was today thanks to you cousin make sure that message reached flan and i'll join you all later may soul and maori guide you so avor you did well at alec we march in the morning i think of no small thing for you to lead my honor guard did you not get by its message lord you must pull back not move forward this ruse is part of a larger trap not yet sprung varus believes to know the minds of these kings but the church has taken root and flourished since my uncle's day the church is behind the plot against you did the message say nothing of epidermon king neil and king donald were doubtless seeking to cast blame elsewhere the church is a convenient scapegoat what if there's some truth to bharata's suspicions owen is the ability god's appointed in ireland i cannot doubt him on the word of a friend you mean a pagan why are you all still here did my message not get through it did but king flan is not convinced you must pull out the clocker now my king before we are surrounded by owen's army you do not command me bart mcever if there was an army my scouts your scouts are dead baldur's blood flowing how many must die before you learn to trust you forget yourself barith do not invoke your false gods in my presence listen what's that owens wolves have arrived i didn't come this far to die in a tent my king we're under attack come on this place is heavily guarded you we have this they're all around us the answers have fired the ravens back here come with me i will be your shield they're on the road [Music] words thank you stay sharp right eyes open they retreat you've saved us we held them off at a great cost even where is badass bunny can you hear me that is makiva have you seen king but hi he was headed towards the farm on the edge of the village a cold hand grips my heart a glorious ant don't you think worthy of a saga maybe and you thought i'd gone soft no one knew your true measure except you cousin you you never doubted me your bravery will be remembered by this i'll see to it hold your weapon well cousin i will see you in valhalla sephiroth have him swear by his god there's nothing the christians fear more than their almighty's wrath it will be done a hero's funeral earth has become a greater man in death than he was in life or maybe we were too small to see his full size a harsh truth but fear he saw more clearly than i and i ignored his counsel owen will pay for his death what then when the abbot is gone and you've tamed the north what of six franc will you give him your royal support when he has proven himself it would not be good politics at this time trolls take your politics bharath gave his life in your service if this is how you repay loyalty you'll be in short supply twice you stone me with truth i'll return the favor sigfrith isn't ready but he could be with proper teaching good he'll benefit from your wisdom and my support but neither throne would be secure while owen lives we'll throttle the snake and afterwards the fate of this land will be in your hands sensations the horses are being made ready my king sure you don't want to rest your bones and leave by dawn's light my thoughts right too rough for sleep i have an army in reputation or claim the second may prove harder than the first my mother used to tell me how the morrigan would feed on the death of heroes then fill men's heads with thoughts of war i imagined using the tara stone to drown out their song the way bishop patrick drove the snakes from ireland there's no power strong enough to do what you say not even the gods can change fate the world is destined to end in war which was not but the fantasy of a young girl so tell flan i'll come to him after i have arranged things with secret tell him yourself i'm not leaving yet [Music] [Music] oh good day many kingdoms desire to trade for our goods so enough for today i look forward to your return [Music] ava i'm sorry i did not notice you care to indulge in profitable commerce perhaps that's enough always a pleasure a4 we will march upon our mark immediately this place smells like a brewer's heart i will blood eagle the abbott with my own hands i will blanket the north with the skulls of petty kings enough if you charge into a mark like a berserker they will crucify you like their christ i'm sorry to tell you my king the siege weapons you requested are being held by arma he'll have that habit those weapons were to be a show of the strength of dublin's new king forget about shows of strength cast your fortunes with flan the high king will be a powerful ally if you back him now where are these weapons coming from who is supplying a maw a shadowy web of pirates run by a druid cult they roost along the northern coast looting and trading in equal measure these druids do they call themselves the children of danu in fact they do led by one they call the seed now that you have their scent i wish you a good hunt if there is nothing more my king i will return to my shop i will gather what forces i can wherever i can and join them to flance together we will avenge my father you have a strength that comes from him when you find that men will follow soon guide me we raised we have this hey enough hey come here a moment oh i split you foreign okay ah all right give me a hand at this hey come here let's get back oh oh he's [Music] oh [Music] patients will reward us oh coward [Music] uh your mind may you please so [Music] so uh [Music] [Music]

time's up uh uh uh [Music] oh [Music] not getting away from me uh just need to get out of here bishop but god who greet him at his death oh oh this place is heavily guarded [Music] i don't like going against the churches all uh-huh we'll bring down god's wrath god is with king flan you had any sense you'd know that i was a clown god wasn't with us there that's luck not god did you not seeking plant fight or barthmative or die aye it's true that battle was bravely caught don't avor come in siegfried tells me you've been hunting pirates in the north allies of amar providing weapons and other supplies i've cut them off god is truly with us own is weakened and will soon taste god's justice do you have the men to take amar we do thanks to sigfrith he has rallied vikings from every corner of ireland how did you convince the norse to fight for you i told him of a monastery full of silver to be looted your father would not have made such a promise and he would not have raised as many men cannot win the good will of the people by destroying their homes or their church but my lord these men came expecting a raid if we deny that i may i think in this case some burning might be useful tell me how when we were attacked at clocker owen didn't stop there he burned cash along as well to send a message it is our turn to light up the land with fire and smoke to let the people know that our mar has fallen born what you must but keep your warriors leashed kill only those who oppose us and spare the church as you command my king there's something else abaddon leads the children of danu so the poisoning the ambush they're all part of owen's nefarious schemes we'll cleanse our map that's unholy filth siegfried and i will prepare our men join me when you're ready choose a good view dear poor it'll be a battle for the ages thank you for not seeing anything about from my past the past has passed and not our future i swear evo you really are like a hero out of folk tales do i have permission to sing your song you do once i've had a chance to finish it it's good to see you take command it suits you it feels heavy and stiff like this new armor i envy you avor when battle is done you can move on to what you like i go where my destiny takes me sixth none of us are free from that there are worse fates than being a king our forces are replenished thank god's good grace some part of those thanks should go to six with lord i i'll not forget his role today he's a good man but he lacks his father's seasoning then you must show him what it is to lead lord in the court and on the field come let us flush out this false abbot without delay yes owen must answer for his actions there are fewer defenders than i expected they cower behind their walls let's strike while we have the advantage move forward or remain alert god will guide the right we have no other choice reach that gate the bridge is down give me strength take care okay [Music] yes thank you wow oh [Music] costume we must raise that parkour to go any further ah [Music] so light up the sky for all to see [Music] food uh [Music] yes with me thank you fight smart there's only one way through that gate they fall back gather your breath but for me not already i knew it looked too easy [Music] avor i need help with this door leave this house of god flanshiner i'll be cursed with his wrath eternal you desecrate this holy place with foul corruption you are sickness to be forged god will be my judge not you you act the christian king but let pagans and wolves do your dirty work do not preach about playing both sides i know you lead the children of danu do you then you should know you cannot win my children are everywhere even in your court who do you mean kira had the makings of a high priestess but she was careless dabbled with forces she could not control don't listen flan he tries to cloud your judgment small wonder she charmed her way into your court she's always been attracted to men of power you lie devil love conceals blemish and evil it's easy to lose sight when you're following a woman's backside there's no shame in keeping your hands clean of this filth let me do your dirty work this god's work protect your rabbit you shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed do not quote scripture to me devil may your tongue burn for eternity while your throat is pierced with jagged glass no you would rather have a song from your pagan poetess if she didn't tell you about the children of daniel what other secrets does she keep he tries to poison your mind with these dying words lord don't let them in could he speak truth the best liars makes truth with lies if she was part of that cult she isn't anymore you are right of course ah this feted air befells my thoughts let us step out into god's cleansing light it is a beautiful land we are a blessed people word of our victory spreads like fire in a dry field i couldn't stop all the looting my king but i made certain the people were spared they will sing of the high king who cleansed the church at our ma and the king of dublin who fought with honor at his side and the hero who came from the land of heroes who helped them win the day all will be remembered the living and the dead [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh thanks to you art mel joined our trade their sweet honey will lure our most demanding merchants is honey so valuable it is liquid gold but luscious and sticky care to indulge it [Applause] perhaps that's enough another time ah my business many kingdoms farewell what has happened they have summoned flan i hope he shows soon if only to end this bickering speak lord there has been much deliberation these last few days news of owen has spread like a mountain fire the people are frightened we are unsettled to say the least a trusted abbott unveiled as a pagan conspirator the druids have permeated the church at the highest level there's no telling how far down it goes something must be done we must rid them of this land begin an inquisition how dare you speak like this owen acted alone he belonged to a sect there are others like him do you deny it i do not deny it but then you will speak only of the children of danu a weed that grew from druid roots if we allow it to thrive how can we ever be certain this will not happen again flam i do not like what these men are implying do not entertain this you would presume to tell your king what to do you who share those druid roots you even know this sect by name perhaps like owen there is more to you than meets the eye bastard enough speak to her like that again and rats will sup on you alive apologies my king porters i do not mean to cast suspicion only to draw a very real comparison we do not know from where the next threat will come and we cannot simply hope that it will not come we must put aside our differences and come together as christians if we wish to preserve an ireland under god flan if you do this i know well where you stand kieran are there any others who wish to speak i will this gathering shows us something very clear that there is solidarity in this cause if we do nothing the weeds will continue to sprout leading to unrest across the kingdoms but if we act begin an inquisition it will lead to unity this land has sorely lacked these are my people sick freeze and there are those within who threaten the very fabric of this land can you really stand there and defend them anyone else what is being proposed is the bold strategy the consequences of which cannot be properly weighed just now you must allow time to reflect lord every moment we waste weakens our position lord we kings are all in agreement there is but one move to make we will launch an inquisition every druid will face a choice reform or exile the future of ireland is a holy christian one where did kira go set off for her house just down that road looked mighty upset kira is not of sound mind i need to settle her down here get out leave me be what is this what are you doing flan spanish fool what was he thinking he saw an opportunity to unite the kingdoms he ceased it it is what any king would do do not defend him i am not but consider what would happen if he ignored these allied kings you're right to be upset but you know flan best this was not a decision he made lightly let us go back and talk with him if anyone can convince him to reconsider it is you oh i will whether he wants to or not what i am sorry evod i cannot let them erase us avar can you hear me ava are you all right did did you see kitten i expected her here oh what is that i think it's kira it must be i do not know what she's trying to do but she's angry this is my fault i must speak with her it may be too late for that she said she would not let you erase the druids what means would she use lilia fall i think she will try to use it to stub you a stone it is an ancient part of her lineage there may be more to it than myths and legends i knew my decision would upset her but i was certain she could find a way to understand me there's no simple decision by choosing one you betray the other choices that weigh heavily require ample time to reflect you are to find the best outcome i acted rashly i listen to fright many more men whose loyalty i hunger for clear your head lord we're nearly there uh of you where is she dear your sword flon stay close to me what do we do fight these are my men it's them or you now fight back get back they will not listen kira has taken yourself i cannot let you walk this car you would stand in my way i do this is too far [Music] keep your gut up kyra where are you kira [Music] come on ah ugh it will consume it's enough kira surrender now is my blood ah yes and you will throw away all reason to defend what you are sworn to i am no different my people will live to see tomorrow if it means i have to kill you today you are unrelenting battle heartened over many victories do not make me add another do as you must so hey have you not had enough food i bathe in that lust i'll stop here before it's too late i told you i would never see the truads into darkness i pretend to be my ally i pretended nothing i thought i hoped you could be better better than owen don't compare me to that demon no look around you you said in motion what the children of danu hoped you could you became the vessel for the plot i always have been after mother died i became the last the last who could awaken the leah fall never did i think i would use this gift so foolishly what now it ends owen the children of tanu they only exist in pursuit of the stone's power and i am the key to unleashing it you must kill me kill me evod if i die tara's power dies with me and there will be nothing left to lead my people astray the old ways will return let me do this let me save them please you may be the key to this power the stone is the source destroy it you know i cannot your ancestors the souls in another realm they will not despair of the stone's loss sometimes we must sacrifice what we treasure most to protect the ones we love bury the past build the future [Music] until kyra i bow my head in contrition i fail you i failed you and the true druids of ireland for that i truly apologize i will speak to the kings and undo my rash decision the land you have wished for is secure i hope it is so flam farewell farewell avar where will you go [Music] how are you feeling bruised battered but i'll live i thought it'll take some time to reclaim my pride took a
