but the view was amazing when this thing was in the air maybe mr stark can fix it this place is kind of a mess i think they were using it for storage or something wonder who was staying here before i should go talk to bruce or i could look around some more now that some of the doors are working you know give him some time to forget he saw me crying what is all this stuff we should get some nice herbs growing in here basil thyme maybe some oregano hope this blood machine thing can tell me more about my powers [Music] bruce's room looks like hulk left this one alone still looks pretty nice in here or bruce is just a super fast cleaner so hey bruce uh sorry about um no don't worry about it any luck with you know who uh good timing i was just about to take a look can i get a hand on the other side there just push that button ah so awesome this thing belongs in a museum [Music] so okay here goes nothing good afternoon dr banner we did it tony stark's super awesome computer pal though i'm just a rather very intelligent system a pleasure to meet you miss kahn but you can call me kamala pleasure miss come on what's going on the war table isn't getting enough power the system is on emergency lockdown hmm looks like i tripped the security sensors when i was in the lab i'll have to disable them i got this okay bruce what am i looking for all right you're gonna use the console on the lab table to disable the sensors [Music] um i think i made it worse it's okay just means you'll need to disable the security sensors manually uh look for the little red lights how the heck am i supposed to reach them really oh right duh sketchy arms got one okay this is easy you know in one of my stories iron man has to shoot out a bunch of street lights to cover for black widow sneaking into a hype uh-huh that's nice didn't think it could actually be a real thing an avenger did you know i mean uh avenger or anything oh all right that did it all right come on back [Music] so nice work kamala okay jarvis let's find tony uh jarvis searching now hold on something something is wrong dr banner that's not good oh dear it appears my neural uplink was damaged when the chimera crashed it's highly specific shield technology without it i can't access the global database shield uh let's get marie on the phone maria hill is she leading shield now uh sort of no one knows what happened to director fury so hill is the only one i know i can trust bruce it's it's good to see you after my run in with the hulk i wasn't sure we'd be hearing from you again yeah sorry about all that uh hulk's been having some the issues you don't have to apologize all our lives fell apart after that day i'm just glad to see the avengers back in action well not quite hi kamala khan it's just the two of us for now we're trying to find mr stark yeah uh marie we're gonna need a neural uplink you've gotta have one stored somewhere all of our resources were seized by aim and most agents are still in hiding but i may know where to look i'm sending the coordinates to your ward table i can brief you on the way shall i prep the quinjet's engine sir uh what quinjet use the wall table to set the quinjet's destination of your next mission the coordinates commander hill provided lead to an installation in a remote tundra region i have marked the location on your war table missions that are critical to your investigation of aim will be marked with the avengers a i thought that would be appropriate some missions will contain enemies with special abilities and modifiers it would be wise to examine emissions modifiers and plan your loadout accordingly aim forces in this region are reported to use cryotech weaponry equip any cold protection gear you may have to better your chances of success did you know this was here the entire time absolutely not i swear uh-huh i think you just wanted to go on a road trip in your rv no no [Music] no [Music] okay hulk we've got to find that neural uplink maybe mr stark can find us some more footage of what happened to cap at least i sure hope so i'm giving you access to shield secure frequency it should lead you to the bunker hang on i'm getting some interference something down there is blocking the track see if you can find out what on it commander hill hello radio's down guess it's just us from here not to worry i will guide you to their signal jammers up there it's an aim drop ship oh there is an elite aim unit near you defeat them and you may gain something sure is useful out here [Music] if you're done observing the scenery right sorry i told the prize up we can do it [Music] i need to be closer to breach the system not a problem you'll have to deal with whatever's disrupting the signal before you're able to track down that function sorry carry on look for a chest containing special resources nearby uh huh you're going down [Music] huh uh i wonder what's inside that aim building if you're curious there should be an external locking mechanism you can use to open the doors right like a switch or something you want to look around hulk aim up ahead can you sneak past them or not sweet let's see what's inside so bad guys let's get this party started [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh look for a chest with gear nearby huh [Music] ugh huh huh look out got some bad guys you're an avenger miss khan the shield signal is being blocked by a local aim security node i'll need you to get me close to the node so i can disable the disruption okay let's get close to that thing hulk jarvis needs to do his things [Music] i'm working on clearing up the signal to stay within proximity of the security node [Music] do it how you doing jarvis making progress keep those aim forces away from the security node please huh i've almost taken control of the security node just a bit longer these enemies must be defeated hmm [Music] in your faces the signal should be coming through now loud and clear the tracker will lead you to the shield bunker follow the beeps got it still can't reach commander hill huh i'm gonna try not to let that freak me out let's get out of the cold hulk wait do you get cold data remains inconclusive uh oh finding the shield bunker's harder than i thought hmm we're close do you see anything i think we found it nice work let's hope that neural uplink is inside i'll get you back to yourself in no time jarvis i appreciate the sentiment it is rather unpleasant existing without instantaneous access to all the information in the known universe [Music] what does it feel like not having an uplink i mean is it like losing your memory i'm not sure what the human equivalent would be i suppose it's like being locked out of the library oh like when ami shuts off the wi-fi quite wow check out all this stuff guess we better start looking there is a chest with gear close by huh the neural uplink is nearby cool oh whoa what's happening i believe we may have triggered a classified shield security system avenger detected hello avengers it's been a while nick fury if you're hearing this then the worst has happened i'm gone and that means i need you now more than ever i always knew shield might fall so i made sure it could also rise again these are the shield protocols shield was built to protect the world in times like this one it all seems hopeless that's when we've got to stand strong so i need a favor deliver these protocols to any remaining sub director they'll give shield what they need to rebuild good luck avengers fury out director fury like shields director fury those protocols he was talking about must be inside let's get this party started uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] they must have followed you inside protect the uplink i think i can upload the protocols to a secure server we've got to get this data back to the chimera think he can hold him off huh ugh ugh yeah [Music] let's get out of here [Music] [Music] wow director fury got more than we bargained for didn't we jarvis we'd better get this back to the chimera charting a course now [Music] now that the neural uplink has been successfully installed i can access my full database director hill is reviewing the shield protocols that you also recovered feeling better jarvis everything seems to be in working order you have no idea how much this means to me to shield thank you bruce you too kamala with this i can start rebuilding shield in earnest if you ever need anything give me a call i'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of each other looking forward to a director i feel like i should salute her something no no need for that good luck both of you jarvis you think you can get us tony this will take some time but i should be able to find mr stark in the meantime i've uncovered something that might be of interest to ms khan in the home room the what now the holographic augmented reality machine something the avengers use for training whoa that sounds awesome i should warn you the system may be a little irregular is this safe only point zero zero zero one percent chance of injury uh okay i trust you i guess proceed through the crew quarters the harm room is on the lower floor of the hangar bay thanks jarvis you
