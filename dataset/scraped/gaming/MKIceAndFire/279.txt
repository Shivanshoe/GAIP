[Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh ugh [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] [Music] cara come quickly [Music] stay with me cara the ship it just argo city's gone millions of people that's only the beginning brainiacs destabilized the planet's core krypton won't hold together much longer but all your research isn't there something you can do that's why we're here a spaceship that's what you've been working on your uncle jorel discovered a planet that can sustain kryptonians far away from brainiac he's built a ship just like this for your cousin cal the cal he's just a baby which is why you'll need to protect him teach him our ways me teach him what about you no no no i won't leave you please please don't make me i can't come with you but you'll never be alone you belong to the house of el cara a house of hope never forget that never give up hope get in [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] in my years fighting crime i've learned one truth that every villain is the hero of his own story superman was no exception the joker drugged him tricked him into killing his pregnant wife lois and made him trigger the bomb that nuked metropolis so when superman killed the joker i understood why we all did but once that line was crossed there was no going back he gave himself and the justice league a new mandate stop all crime before it happened by any means necessary but he couldn't see his good intentions were leading him down a path of tyranny and evil that's how our greatest hero became our greatest threat so what if superman's pulling criminals out of arkham they're the worst of the worst he's going to kill them damien sounds like justice to me killing people is injustice superman can't see that he's grieving he needs time to heal yeah and what if it had been gotham if joker had killed me your own son thought he'd say that it's not responding we're being taken to the batcave prepare to eject [Music] [Music] [Music] a warning shot cyborg i won't hurt you unless i have to you're gonna have to my friends were in metropolis batman starfire beast boy gone we do this that never happens again you're right to be angry but it's not a blank check and the justice league isn't a death squad ah um rethink your strategy you don't see it yet but superman's wrong your glider skills need work yeah i'm fine thanks for asking let's go [Music] [Music] wow [Music] so you won't kill but you're fine with traumatic brain injuries secure the loading docks [Music] here to help bruce yes to keep you and clark from making a terrible mistake none of us wanted this but the joker forced our hand metropolis changed the world now we have to change with it not like this of all people i thought you would understand um don't waste my time demeter [Music] uh i need you to tell me the truth where is he cell block c you can't turn your back on him he needs you that's why i came [Applause] [Music] doc what are they gonna do with us where we going are you going nowhere till you tell me what's happening get back in line now [Music] two minutes [Music] you're better than this clark these inmates are irredeemable they're thieves rapists murderers like the joker that's the problem with fighting for truth and justice the battle never ends and executing them will end it first joker now this when does it stop when there's no more crime when people can live without fear we want the same thing bruce i wanted to kill my parents murderer i could have but that's not the life they wanted for me and it's not the life lois would want for you don't you put that on me a red solar grenade to dull your powers you need to stop take time to grieve before it's too late you wouldn't [Music] you're supposed to be my friend which is why i have to stop you there's no peace [Music] please don't get up uh i'm sorry clark get away from me look who i found victor says psychopath how many women have you killed 121 121 huh sounds incorrigible to me robin let him go you'd rather fight your friends than the real problem i'm warning you son son you didn't raise me the league of assassins did problem solve who's next damn it damian this is a line we do not crawl then stay on your side batman i'll be on superman's [Music] you're dead to me uh [Applause] [Music] damian i i never meant to you coward we are at war with these animals you think you're better than him you let the joker keep on killing you couldn't save lois or jason or anyone [Music] that's enough let's go but the inmates not today [Music] it's been years since the regime fell superman's behind bars damien my own son is there with him but we can't ever forget why we put them there we must stay vigilant i thought your goal was to reassure people mr wayne you're not alone in rebuilding gotham and metropolis but if we don't change the mind soon thought that's why you hired that overpaid pr firm lucius convincing folks to move back to these cities is a lot harder when they're afraid someone's going to knock them down again superman's never getting out i made that clear but wonder woman black adam aquaman they're still out there somewhere and seemingly immune to prosecution i know you built brother i to keep tabs on all those loose ends but the public doesn't know brother eye's secrecy is critical our enemies can't fight something they don't know exists well then at least follow one bit of advice we paid those pr people so much money for what's that be a little less batman a little more billionaire playboy get out around town in the daylight and smile focus groups show people feel safer when they see you smile hmm that would be your other job bruce consider widening your circle of trust nobody wins all by themselves not even you as a reception area this place needs a lot of work dinah oliver thanks for coming on short notice you're lucky we found a sitter so [Music] my great-grandfather built the original gotham underground but these days it's the batcave and this is brother i more like the eye of sauron surveillance hub more than that a communications hub licking every satellite and server on the planet it warns us when trouble's coming and guides us when trouble's here must take a real genius to operate i don't know about genius but i do got a phd [Music] dinah dinos hobby you sure came a long way a world away but the change of scenery is nice i was surprised you called bruce things seemed to be going well so what's up dismantling the regime created gaps in global security we're covering them where we can but we're stretched thin vulnerable harleen show them what you found right oh bets gorilla grodd everyone's favorite talking ape he's got himself a band of bozos calls them this society my mole in gorilla city says grodd's planning

you're here to take down these punks [Music] quite a catch ivy red you're with them your man bruce was supposed to better care for the green all he's done is remodeled the concrete jungles of gotham and metropolis where i sit there's not much difference between him and superman you're a few cones short of a pine if you think your new friends care about the green grodd will keep his promises or he'll be my next victim oh red why are you making me do [Music] let this get you out of here girl we can team up again drive all the boys crazy you know like the old days the old days were fun but

make you more comfortable let me out diana you've taught me what my powers can do this world needs help earth's people are so divided they're always fighting that's the world without kal-el batman has

can't even help cal-el we will cara just like you and i free diana from themyscira the time will come we'll save kal-el and batman will answer to us our best chance to stop broad is a preemptive strike sounds more military than vigilante you try calling the army there is no army not yet to break up the regime we have to start from the ground up so what us three extradigrad from under his entire gorilla army garage their alpha take him down and the others will submit but be wary of running into other members of his society they're more coordinated than we knew next stop gorilla city guess i better call the sitter mommy and daddy are coming home late if this is more than you and ollie are comfortable with dinah i'll let blue beetle and firestorm take over no we can do this you've been out of the fight a long time you have a family your family too bruce i couldn't be there to finish the fight against superman i'm damn sure finishing this one [Music] wow [Music] gorilla city our time has come in a few short hours we break the yoke of oppression forever no more regime no more justice league today the world welcomes its new masters the society today we show the world that we are superior today we bring anyone who would dare stand against us low self-esteem not that guy's problem that's a lot more than a few society members it's all of them they're headed indoors out of sight from the soldiers harley keep the jet warm when we signal bail us out later on a you hire superman speech writer soldiers must be properly motivated to sacrifice their lives hate is the perennial motivator better not turn that hate on us or this society is over as long as we have a common agenda captain cold you have nothing to fear you mean as long as we follow your orders we already lost the shipment at slaughter swamp hope your silent partner can still deliver maybe it's time you spilled the identity of our silent partner since we're relying so much on him or her he will soon make his presence known but for now first a few words from the brave and the bold i'm the brave one right i'm not bold enough to disagree handle this i call first dibs a traitor again selena i don't know why blue's ever trusted you i've got nine lives dinah i'm only a traitor in most of them [Music] hear me roar i'm stealing this one from you you can't with broken claws [Music] that's gotta hurt so much for nine lives oh that was graceful ollie one of us needs to distract him while the other snips his tubes ouch his venom tubes ollie how kind of batman sending his underlings i will enjoy returning you to him in body bags go i'll keep bain busy little birdie you will sing a song of pain oh i'll sing song but you'll feel the pain [Music] [Music] got any fight left in you ah is more work to be done ollie now no now where's that damn dirty ape i come to you as darkness falls dr fate diner lance oliver queen it passed i have shielded you from danger but a grave crisis looms and i do not know if i can stop it you mean grodd and company we've got that covered grodd is the part of a much greater master a new order is coming i have foreseen it leave with me now while i can still save you if that's the case we're staying here batman will need our help everyone and everything you know will die i will shepherd you to safety lest you suffer the same fate by force if necessary the good doctor's been wearing that helm for too long then let's help him out of it oliver queen you must flee this earth before the threat of your faith would unravels to do that but i only take orders from here mind if i take a selfie [Music] order shall prevail you really need to get laid light of angled raw this day just keeps getting weirder kent you okay your headgear really had you going i lost control of naboo the spirit of the helm thanks to you i'm back in charge for now i have to go consult my masters the lords of order pray they'll intervene before it's too late too late for what kent what's going down the lord's magic bars me from saying more i have changed fate too many times this planet's destiny is no longer clear what comes next mere mortals cannot stop for better or worse your fate rests in the god's hands that was spooky yeah come on let's find god and get the hell out of here you've overstayed you're welcome we're happy to check out but you're coming with us fighting a talking ape wasn't enough had to throw in telekinesis give us a song to suit these savage beasts ah i forgot to bring my banana arrow wait you eat bananas right or is that an offensive stereotype yes i left my earth for this [Applause] i was just trying to be pc um surprised that worked let's call it a day and get harley out of here it's never good when you slap the cuffs on and then they start chuckling humans you've won this battle but you've already lost [Music] holy [ __ ] [Music] ollie i uh i got nothing your victory over gorilla grodd warrants further study [Music] [Music] green skin smart money's on alien uh martian like john johns my point of origin was a thousand light years removed from mars on the planet kohler i am stop please cause and effect resistance begets violence then we won't resist please just stop you're the grave crisis we were warned about what do you want i seek the one you call superman for years i believed i had destroyed krypton and all its remnants superman's survival is an oversight i must correct superman's no friend of ours i am aware but your planet has also piqued my interest its many contradictions are fascinating we'll never serve you sir i am no petty despot i collect worlds preserving their essential knowledge to enhance my intellect and then i discard the remnants why your species values precious metals arbitrary symbols of status i value knowledge and like your metal trinkets knowledge is more valuable when it is rare [Music] [Music] brother i give me an update on the team at gorilla city i cannot do that bruce wayne of earth why not i am brainiac you cannot regain control over the past days brother i has been absorbed into my neural network it is now an extension of my mind you a fragile human captured and imprisoned a fully developed male kryptonian maybe i'm not so fragile to prevail you harnessed advanced sciences nanotechnology satellite communications interdimensional transits i am taking these tools from you why the kryptonian belongs to me and soon so will your planet foreign great hera where else besides metropolis gotham beijing moscow so many cities all at once it's him who carl who is it we need to get cal now [Music] [Music] you're wearing a suit am i in trouble again brainiac what can you tell me how do you know that name you're afraid of him he's invading he says you belong to him brainiac killed my parents he blew up krypton you never mentioned that before how do i beat him you can't not without me i'll find a way this is my fight bruce you need me bruce bruce bruce so need a hand dr randall i don't know barry sat link's out internet and phone are down maybe this old ham can help us you fitting in okay people treating you well let's just say people here aren't thrilled to live in close quarters with the flash convicted regime criminal pardoned regime criminal give a time they'll come around lw base are you there cops are down everywhere these spaceships shut up in the morning on this city you're killing everyone lw base how fast can you get to metropolis my pardon agreement was pretty clear on no powers you think that matters when aliens are invading you helped tear down the regime barry that's why mr wayne asked me to take you on and if batman thinks you earned a second chance who are you to argue [Music] uh [Music] uh as predicted barry allen has returned to action the task force is ready go enjoy this thank you [Music] nice aim deadshot just get the job done that knee ain't healing super fast at absolute zero for god's sake cold look around yeah crazy day kind of like when superman went nuts and you went right along with him punish me later we have to help these innocent people the same innocent people who cheered superman when he executed my friends my sister i'm sorry cold but you never hurt civilians you're better than that once upon a time i was uh [Music] can we hurry this up [Music] i might have underestimated you like that watch this [Music] guess we both let each other down huh [Music] thanks kitty i was hoping you was bruce's mole for all the good it did grodd never trusted me enough to share the whole alien invasion plan we gotta help dinah and ollie we will first we need to get back to gotham if there's anything left of it running a little slow flash retirement will do that to you what's with you lawton you should be fighting this invasion got no choice explosive in my head so whether i like it or not i gotta do bronze dirty work [Music] [Music] next time try stretching first [Music] you're not bulletproof i know it's just business crowd said you couldn't resist a good crisis you don't belong here and missed the return of barry allen [Music] huh so [Music] uh [Music] i ran a long way from the future to hurt you barry but this timeline it's all wrong so go back to your own time reverse flash think i haven't tried your regime buddies killed one of my ancestors now i'm trapped in a paradox i can never go home at least i can hurt you too fast for you all bad guys this slow you're out of time [Music] [Music] don't know how many more reunions i can take i guess i could come back later how no not today nice to see you too barry whose dead hand you pry that ring from you know it doesn't work that way the ring chose me even after you bailed on the guardians to join the sinestro corps the guardians locked me up but they also trained me to overcome my fears i earned the second chance they gave me the guardians made a mistake told you i was fast just admit you're impressed eat my dust uh you were holding back weren't you i told you i'm trying to make things right i betrayed my core my planet and my friends that's the worst part all day i've been reminded how i failed to be a hero how hard it's going to be to regain people's trust guess we're both on that path we have a long way to go barry it'd be a lot easier if we're together [Music] we need help don't we not his you gave me a second chance because you got your head straight and helped take down clark if he was still in charge he'd still be wearing yellow i'm not that guy anymore look i get why you don't trust me but you should trust the guardians this ring means something they put me through hell to get it back fine i've got my orders just thought it'd help if we cooperate lantern maybe it's time i widened my circle of trust what can i do you're going to atlantis our circle of trust needs aquaman and his marines you think he'll help he's been off radar since the regime fell um he didn't like getting roped into the regime by superman he sure won't be happy to see me get used to that batman wants my marines to fight his battle like the time superman ordered me to invade metropolis we were all on the wrong side of that war the next time my people's blood is spilled it will be for atlantis not the surface world you're one of us too arthur your father my father was human but my duty is to atlantis i don't trust you jordan you are any surface dweller now leave and remind batman stay out of my seas and when that's on your doorstep atlantis will defend itself sooner than you think we need to help each other go i don't need your distraction i'm not leaving need i remind you whose kingdom this is uh [Music] even saint walker can't help you [Music] field poseidon's wrath [Music] listen to reason arthur i'm sorry i i didn't come here to fight you this is exactly what happened up there first they take out communications then they invade they're your oceans but it's also my sector let me help you cover me [Music] oh [Music] hmm i thought the only regime down here to torture would be aquaman cheetah let's not beat around the bush wonder woman's in hiding maybe down here tell me where's your amazon friend didn't you hear i unfriended her so did atlantis i don't need a golden lasso to make you tell the truth ugh ring doesn't like your chances the rings failing you saving the best for last [Music] bad kitty [Music] my people are getting flanked hold this line be our rear guard on it and you i'm the vanguard how jordan you have returned good to be back where i belong kind of like you in a prison cell even as yellow lantern you never showed me the proper respect but i will show you how easily your will is broken [Music] ring doesn't like your chances wow [Music] you are hard to kill green lantern can't lose pay for your life [Music] break this [Music] we're locking down the gates but the fight's not over oh sorry i was somewhere else where's this leave us you put yourself at risk for atlantis maybe you can be trusted so you're in i can't i belong here defending my people oh jordan red lanterns atrocitus and dexter agents of vengeance powered by rage don't worry i'll handle these two ring to ring good luck you've been messing with my head haven't you atrocitus sinestro's yellow lantern slaughtered millions and their victims demand vengeance you may have cast off their ring but you are not absolved you're not the first person to tell me that dexter would tear your heart out and lock your blood but i sense you have a higher calling a spark glowing within you a spark of rage what are you doing what is this this anger you may have overcome your fears but you still betrayed the green lanterns hurt your allies how could you ever forgive yourself i i can't [Music] [Music] in blackest night become vengeance join the red lanterns no more evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evil smite beware my power green lanterns lights you're right i do hate myself for what i've done but my will is stronger than my hate you gotta want it more [Music] [Music] there's no hope for you your world is burning and when it is ashes you will beg for vengeance the guardians don't need to know about that one the beta phase is complete earth's defense is irreversibly compromised begin the countdown [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] i circled the globe larger ships are being positioned over these major cities even with aquaman's marines we're still badly outnumbered what's the plan and you have one right we have to evacuate the occupied cities before taking on brainiac but we need firepower any heavy hitters on the luthor wayne payroll only blue beetle and firestorm but they're busy too busy for this they're the last line of defense if brainiac moves on superman well if brainiac doesn't try busting him out of prison black adam and wonder woman will the worse things get the more people will think we should let them out to help i'm just saying hope the new kids can hold down the most wanted man in the galaxy beetle and firestorm are green but together you're the most powerful team we have [Music] for real jaime batman does not think we're important aliens are invading and we're on guard duty guarding superman and his cronies who already have guards we're guarding guards we're redundant jason you need to step back take in the bigger picture i'd rather be in here than out there this suits an alien war machine and your guys's firestorm matrix we could take on brainiac and boom accidentally blow up the world jaime's right we haven't mastered these powers yet oh listen to yourselves you two we're badasses and badasses belong on the front lines this is the front line brainiac running amuck is a crisis brainiac and superman both that's an apocalypse so we're the only thing between a crisis and an apocalypse hmm i can get behind that brainiac or the superman fan club either way i suggest we fuse [Music] [Music] game on [Applause] [Music] red sun still secure must be the power center the power center if it goes down those generators shut off and he flies right out of here [Music] am i dreaming [Music] [Music] here's the plan one of us takes adam the other restarts to generators before superman gets loose [Music] it's more likely you will die here fix that generator what magic is this science basic impedance field do not condescend chimera you may have two minds but i have the wisdom of a god um rolling with the big schooled you mr wisdom let's circle back lock down superman's cell my old man standards sure have dropped you noobs are so desperate to impress batman why he's weak if your papa's weak what's that make you i take after my mother professor stein wants to teach edibus here to respect his elders bet you were one of those students thought he was smarter than the teacher thought i was smarter no i know i am takes to the firestorm class dismissed wonder woman's outside keeping what's left of the guards busy if it wasn't her who let you out i did cara [Music] another kryptonian you recognize me cal my parents stored your image on my ship you're my protector sorry i'm a few decades late you and i left krypton at the same time but the explosion threw my ship off course way of course you haven't aged a day hyper sleep while you were growing up i was on ice i never thought i'd see family again someone with my eyes my own blood you knew my parents they loved you so much cal [Music] diana needs a hand cyborg how long give me five more minutes then it's lights out i don't want to leave you i'll be here she is not out of our league what happened to your confidence kryptonians happen come on batman's counting on us [Music] gotta hand it to palmer these people's cryptography is legit doesn't mean i won't break it victor behind you [Music] what's your melting point cyborg the red sun generators we need to reactivate that console before superman powers up amateur hour was over rookies i think i got this sweet arm cannon i got one too quit playing kid you even know how to use that [Music] [Music] [Music] go in on the scrap heap cyborg i'm not gonna miss you maybe i should have stayed in el paso advantage scared if you ever want tips let me know [Music] [Music] brainiac's too much for batman i'm your only chance here's the thing superman batman asked us for help he didn't draft us make us sign a loyalty oath or threaten us with jail he won't go far enough that's why he'll fail stay away from him kryptonian huh the professor knows how to deal with you stops kryptonians don't surrender we're freeing kal-el we like it or not let's switch partners we need cal's help kid you have no idea what brainiac can do no but i know what superman can do um should call me black kryptonians call that a beat down guess you belong here too what did i tell you we got game professor and i trapped wonder woman under 10 feet of steel you fought valiantly but this battle's over you want me to do what a professor but that's crazy maybe we can control it but you're right no other option get out of here jaime jason you're gonna nuke us it's the only way now go leave all of you you'll get a hell of a lot worse than a sunburn you blow up metropolis rather than let superman go i'd save the earth firestorm stand down [Music] who are you superman's overprotective cousin you keep so many secrets but you can't stand it when one's kept from you can you you can't beat brainiac bruce you're right diana i can't [Music] what the [Music] you're ready to stop brainiac by any means necessary by the means at hand what's your game you're always three moves ahead saving the world is enough for now i'm never going back in that cell we'll cross that bridge later right now the world needs us [Music] you summoned me brainiac there have been surprising developments carl is free but more remarkably he is not the last kryptonian there is another refugee two kryptonians continuous plan is not yet at full strength but remember the kryptonians belong to me thanks to flash's recon we have locations for every ship in brainiac's fleet they're targeting major cities on give us some privacy listen batman about the prison we that was reckless don't pull a stunt like that again make up for it by finishing another mission discreetly we have to evacuate these cities before attacking the fleet but we need communications restored first so before we get started cyborg's going to fix brother eye i am not bat tech support that's not the issue victor [Music] [Music] cara saw firsthand how brainiac destroyed krypton she says we have less than 48 hours before he does the same to earth without tight coordination we'll lose valuable time and that means we fix brother i catwoman and harley will join you you'll need their help getting into the bat cave just give me the coordinates i'll open the portal and boom tube in you can't i reverse engineered your armor's motherbox technology try teleporting into the batcave instead of boom you'll go splat so how do we get in the old underground there's a tunnel entrance under arkham i'm taking you two to arkham asylum promise it won't be awkward or nothing i need a few hours in the solarium at the fortress of solitude assuming you haven't torn it down not yet damian adam you're with me and the rest of us we can't

make sure no one follows us after you please [Music] it's too quiet bogeys and they're not bats i told grog you were loyal to the bat he called me paranoid at least he listened when i said batman would not relinquish his cave so easily soon not just this place but all of gotham will be mine cyborg my old comrade i was never down with superman recruiting criminals to the regime that was his call we are both considered criminals now so ask yourself what is the difference between us [Applause] you can't fight physics dead the difference between us i'm still standing ready to meet brother i

brainiac hasn't attacked it yet the rock of eternity's magic hides conduct from crying eyes even brainiacs but i don't expect them to be fooled forever cal we need to talk give me a minute both of you damian told me what happened is diana all right she's fine but she was gonna kill harley i've never seen her so cold-blooded yes it's unfortunate i know what was she thinking it's unfortunate diana chose now to deal with harley more unfortunate that you got in the way what the joker sickened harley's mind beyond healing when she relapses innocent people will die innocent people are dying now she was helping us don't be naive cara harley's a criminal my only mistake was not dealing with her sooner diana said the joker was executed were you the one who i took one life to save millions but it wasn't just one cow was it how many how many everywhere i go people are afraid of this now i know why it's not how i wanted things but humans they've been slaughtering each other for millennia i

to me with our powers we can't hold back or the ones we love pay the price i'm sorry i wasn't here i couldn't help you but metropolis wasn't your fault i promised myself never again this isn't who we

worst i can help you think about all you've lost cara what if you could have saved krypton i think about it every day then stand with me it's brainiac he's extracting the cities early then we fight back i must go to protect conduct go we're heading to metropolis what about her all that matters now is stopping brainiac but when this is over you need to choose you're either with me or against me [Music] so [Music] [Music] do help me no please why can't i stop this why won't you let me fight back how could there be order if bradiac wins humanity breeds chaos brainiac is order [Music] [Applause] superman and supergirl are almost here the others are tackling the fleet shouldn't we be in gotham brainiac controls the entire fleet from that skull ship take him down take them all down contacts dead ahead [Music] [Music] they gave us an opening locking on the skull ship [Music] shields five seconds to impact prepare to eject three seconds [Music] you're welcome what just happened brainiac's force shield is creating a concussive feedback loop so the harder we hit it the harder it hits back [Music] the kryptonians are incapacitated complete the extraction [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] no [Music] superman the force shield concentrates its energy at your point of attack move faster than it can and you might break through got it creative but insufficient decrease shield refresh interval to 10 picoseconds [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] ah cow [Music] [Music] i couldn't find his body can't hear his heartbeat i was supposed to protect him from this from you and now he's gone i'm sure that's the best news you've heard all day i'll miss him too you mean that he was a good friend once i trusted him with my life but the joker got to him and i wasn't there to stop it i lost my friend clark and i've missed him ever since atlantis gone i didn't listen now we all die together no one's giving up yet anyone here from beetle or firestorm this is your fault bruce cal and i would have beaten brainiac you should have followed our lead stop it diana millions of people are trapped on that ship we have to save them not with him such discord no wonder humans have yet to expand their civilization beyond the confines of this tiny planet did you call in just a gloat nightmares are taking position while across your planet in one hour they will explode in unison burning the earth's atmosphere rendering this world a barren unless you surrender clara sorel she is krypton soul survivor and my last opportunity to study the effect of a yellow sun on kryptonian cells surrender her and i will spare this world even if i thought you'd honor that deal we wouldn't take it you have one hour to reconsider thanks for giving the new girl a chance but maybe i should go no we'll find a way to take down brainiac's shields we have to we could try shorting them out but we'd need to generate an insane amount of power perhaps science is not the answer so he might be vulnerable to a magic based attack i can drive the immense magical power from the rock of eternity through the gateway in kondok but i need an artifact a medium to channel it something that can withstand the power how about the trident of atlantis yes that could work we get the shields down then what cyborg said brainiac controls the ship with his thoughts but i did cut him off from brother i it's possible i could make a signal disrupter that blocks his neural network if you get brainiac's shields down we can disarm those beta bombs then that's our plan aquaman adam get your condom [Music] the rock of eternity is hidden in a pocket dimension i've refrained from opening the gateway to it since brainiac's invasion because it would draw his eye precisely once the door is opened it's only a matter of time before brainiac attacks a fight i look forward to ancient ones unveil the golden path to me in your names men black adam has revealed conduct's power and its location the society will obtain a sample of the rock of eternity for me i wish to study earth's so-called the society is disbanded they thought earth would be theirs to conquer not yours to destroy and you got earth can go to hell i serve brainiac as you should i will give you new soldiers bring me that sample before the earth is destroyed and your loyalty will be rewarded [Music] let's work quickly don't bother there's no time left [Music] using pawns grodd homes can achieve great victories if you're willing to sacrifice them [Music] [Music] [Music] stick a fork in you you're done i'll [ __ ] you for life we've yet to plumb the deaths ah [Music] this king isn't easily captured [Music] here comes the cavalry fitting that you two died together the last of mankind's monarchs what kind of ruler sacrifices his own people for brainiac my loyalty isn't to brainiac or guerrilla city it's to myself i'll wait until that alien exposes his weakness and kill him with his ship i will be unstoppable you're deluded grodd how did it feel to lose your people aquaman i didn't lose them they were stolen from me that's embarrassing now who needs a kraken [Music] i will avenge atlantis we thought you were dead the scarab's hard to kill batman told me you guys needed a hand consider me your sidekick come along [Music] [Music] how does this work exactly we imbue your trident with a spark of the rock's power when its full might is released it will seek out your weapon your thoughts will guide the wizard's power to its final target i am ready [Music] [Applause] a sleeper agent to lead you here despite the power of his scarab the boy was easily manipulated now heidi kill them so many ways to kill you the skelem's gimmicks are no match for the rock of eternity come on straight bubbles [Music] why you still [Music] your power child's play a true leader serves his people you only serve yourself be that as it may be [Music] you have been a valuable contributor to my society [Applause] your [Music] your punishment [Music] stupid humans the people of atlantis demand justice against brainiac i've seen his mind without his power he can't be stopped but you can [Music] oh how's your head empty so not much has changed barry arrow out of the way ah [Music] [Music] cyborg where's that signal disrupter coming at you all you have to do is hit the trigger but it only jams a local area you need to get within arm's reach of brainiac good wow [Music] they did it shields are down supergirl on me victor help the others fight those betas [Applause] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] the signal gets stronger this way what is it voices millions of them [Applause] so many languages the kryptonians candor arco city home we have to help them i'm not sure we can there has to be a way [Music] until recently i had thought my collection of krypton to be complete your capture will make it so you have failed in every effort to oppose me you are not exceptional merely an ordinary specimen of a primitive species dispose of him [Music] look uh [Music] and i thought i could make an entrance where's cara captured somewhere on board we'll find her but we only have 20 minutes before brainiac's betas scorch the earth why aren't the others here they're attacking the betas just in case we don't pull through we will [Music] firestorm what happened to you brainiac unified our dueling minds no longer divided we think he's your walking bomb how do we get past him swamp thing two he has mastered the firestorm matrix all knowledge will be subsumed under his collection i've heard enough about brainiac in his collection you talked a big game back at my cell let's see how you stack up your immense power is finite matrix uh no more mr boy scouts ready to quit yet we just found your limit uh [Music] you have a plan it's a work in progress i might be able to restore them that's new brainiac's adapting i can help him keep those betas busy this one thing hear me your power's being used against you against the greenhouse protector it will live forever uh [Applause] rethink your strategy don't be so sure [Music] now let's get you free it should disrupt their link with brainiac firestorm's brain patterns are changing i can't read what's happening to swamp then jason professor stein yeah yeah we're both here what happened brainiac added a third mind to your head like we needed that what is this place brainiac ship firestorm will get you back on terra firma report to hal he'll need help fighting brainiac suicide babies sounds like a job for firestorm good luck no brainiac where is he i don't know the ship's walls are lined with lead bruce wayne of earth of krypton your battles echo across the universe your war has had consequences neither of you could foresee the chaos you spread is a cancer upon the cosmos only brainiac can establish order i'll deal with him you hate magic i'll manage and i'll hunt down brainiac i've always respected you fate but brainiac can't destroy my home not again your misdeeds precipitated his arrival on this planet brainiac's curiosity was piqued by your decimation of the green lantern corps now he comes to spare humanity from the chaos you unleashed [Applause] ready to quit yet the strong protect the weak [Music] horus superman must not rain i'll carve out my own destiny the lords of order their voices are gone it's over kent i'm sorry for attacking the helm commanded me they can't command you anymore both of you have defied fate carted chaos but now to see you working together again you must keep order or the lords will impose it if not through brainiac [Music] even a magical being like dr fate recognizes my superiority in time the entire universe will adhere to my design unless we stop you i offer nothing less than deliverance your environment is poisoned your civilization has exhausted its resources the earth's decline cannot be reversed we'll find a way we always do oh earth's time is up where's karen being vivisected she has already taught me much about the nature of your powers allow me to give you a proper demonstration i'm at your strength you cannot match my intellect you are only a kryptonian of which i have killed billions [Music] crime doesn't pay for my parents that was for krypton the attacks on the fleet are weakening him i could feel him losing steam as we fought good should make it easier to cut him off from the betas ugh ah uh this is batman brainiac is down the disrupter worked all the betas are shutting down we did it now we find cara what's happening brainiac's mind is the ship's cpu apparently he doesn't have a backup system [Music] if we crash all the cities preserved on board destroyed clark wait you said yourself the ship is controlled by pure thought this could kill you sounds like a job for me [Music] oh [Music] create a bypass loop put the ship on autopilot uh try it my ship you will not destroy my collection [Music] relinquish my ship you will regret that [Music] you are persistent but primitive theatrics cannot save you i know your thoughts don't waste my time your story ends here i've got a few chapters left uh [Music] like you said i'm persistent we need to get you out of there not yet the cities [Music] [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] you're okay i thought it was too late but i can feel the heartbeat of atlantis brainiac's work is undone not all of it i couldn't save everyone some cities are still trapped in the collection others were lost wiped from the ship's memory metropolis coast city but we can still save them right carol my family i'm sorry hal first krypton now earth no other world should suffer this clark no even if i agreed that he should die you can't we need him alive to save the rest of our cities no we don't with more time and cyborg's help the ship will obey me or we could lose more cities bruce is right we can't be sure what we can be sure of is that brainiac puts everyone else at risk this is no different than joker if you'd killed him we might it was never that simple diana yes it is bruce metropolis and coast city are gone how many more innocent people die before you accept that some lives need to be taken my powers how did you gold kryptonite courtesy of firestorm get up cal stay down enough exposure and you'll be de-powered permanently this madness has to end bruce uh [Applause] you don't want to do this stop clark this is over [Music] oh god [Music] [Music] oh [Music] arthur don't do this you don't want to follow clark i'm not following anyone you've never understood atlantis bruce we are

they double-crossed him we have to move [Applause] there's no escape you wish to fall so be it [Music] go back to conduct adam stay here and you'll be prosecuted you'd have to capture me batman and

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] she let us write to him it's no accident you brought us here of course it isn't i warned him about diana but i didn't believe you'd turn on me this is the last time bruce no more secrets no more schemes schemes i'm not the one who stoked clark's worst fears [Music] to pacify man's world cal needed steel not compassion but you didn't bring peace you started a war hail hermes don't waste my time uh your war is over fighting on the same side it felt like old times but i guess we both knew it would end this way do you remember that night when you told me lois was pregnant you knew even before i said anything that was a good memory from another lifetime i miss the people we were then me too quit bruce you can't win you of all people know clark i never quit run it out of chances bruce don't waste my time ah ready to quit yet [Music] foreign is he he'll be out for a while i'm sorry cara for what i couldn't save him [Music] cara

you all right no this symbol should give people hope [Music] he made them fear it that symbol's meaning is up to the person who wears it when clark and i founded the justice league we didn't govern people we protected them plain and simple maybe the world could use a team like that again welcome to the circle of trust [Music] [Music] so you
