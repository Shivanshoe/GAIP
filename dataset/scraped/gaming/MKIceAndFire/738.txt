mountain just use the boat wait and take this you can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world it will always steer you towards your goals i see a bow nightmares mom used to tell me about them didn't think they were actually real nightmares yeah they give people nightmares or they are nightmares i don't remember which behind me yes do not touch the water why do you know what is under the surface no then do not touch the water huh over there now we'll get to the mountain quick i just can't believe i'm here and always there was a time i thought i'd never leave our woods or even my own beds you are not to blame for your sickness oh i know i guess i'm just saying this is great there's the mountain look how close we are we flow into sea water how do you know do you not smell it that smells the seat this is stinks look at that it's the door god of thunder that's right i never thought you'd listen when the mother spoke of the gospel i seldom did did she speak of one who could feel no pain oh that sounds like baldr that's right why do you ask i think i see something just sitting there in the middle of the light i see rooms there miss chelsea can't make it out it reads sacrifice your arms to the center of the water awaken again the cradle of the world what throw our weapons into the water guess that won't be a problem for you are you gonna do it the axe did not return okay what is this it's the world serpent stay calm boy oh yeah yeah mom said he's friendly what does it say i don't know that was amazing wait there's the shipwreck way over there see that and there's a statue of thor except i can see a lot more of him now the water dropped then the serpent rose oh that must be why the beach wasn't there before see and there's the mountain look it that building leads from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple it was all just under the surface except for the statue good thing huh there's even a dock there next to the flag we're going to the dock first right we'll be the first people to walk on and who knows how long you know of that serpent he's one of the giants he's so big he's wrapped around the whole world and bites his own tail an exaggeration i don't know look pretty big to me hey prepare yourself help me father it's some kind of drawing maybe a map oh maybe a treasure map hey that could be valuable how do you think this has been here a very long time is this the way to the mountain it would seem if it isn't the bearded fever it is sexy have i got something for you two broth but how did you none of your business now get in here i got something for you and don't go making pig eyes at my spot i saw him first oh okay what do you think he wants to test our patience when word gets out about my new shop folks will finally come out of hiding they'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wheels you watch you rush around like that everywhere yes catch the pile of rocks here with that key of intrastill you can open a magic door to the branches of the world tree a shortcut between the realms if you ever see them out in the world use it to get back to be quick but it's only one way straight back here and nowhere else and whatever you do never never ever never ever throw yourself over the edge of the path unless you want death yeah i don't see us wanting that what's it gonna be this time something for the boy hope you got what you wanted what can i get you you little fart so uh you sticking around for grains of wisdom huh foreign what is this a horn here's the end can we blow into it without knowing the outcome well we usually push every button pull every lever we see outcomes we can predict no this is something else we must develop your instincts i knew it we are blowing the horn no we are testing your resolve i have resolved a bunch of it i won't blow into it if you don't with luck that tower leads to the mountain i'm ready hmm i don't know these rings if we find a cipher i bet i could figure it out when the water dropped new beaches were exposed we should search them for resources i wish we could have gone on a trip like this with mother she could fight couldn't she yes she fought beautifully here boy yes sir quebec the axe isn't working what is that a spirit it's talking to us and it hears you as well you'll be shy now you're dead you're very perceptive and reckless take caution when lighting these braziers sailor and hell walkers will swarm to the flames like moths i assume we have you to thank for freeing us from a watery grave us other spirits the lake of nine is full of most are able to move on from this realm but we lucky few are stuck here in midgard until our affairs are in order perhaps you can help them as well we have no desire to help you spirit ah but you already have i only wished to see the sky again farewell uh oh he disappeared let us not be distracted hey it's a fragment of a language center we should look for more like this so i guess we should keep an eye out for other spirits what did i say about distractions but it sounds like they needed help they are spirits boy dead things they have no needs only wants it feels wrong to ignore them we will get over these feelings mom would have wanted to help them what was that boy nothing i thought as much so know any good stories to pass the time what kind of story i don't know mother always had stories once you told me when you were a boy there was a man i knew of long ago his stories were brief and purposeful sounds fun do you remember any there was one that concerned a hair and a tortoise like the witch's house unlikely so what happens they wager on a race between them the hare is too confident of victory and foolish while the tortoise is steady and disciplined the tortoise wins you haven't told a lot of stories have you uh boy hmm this is good tonight oh good now when you're done gawking i got a favor to ass what is it dwarf there's this alchemist on var been working out in the velander mines you haven't heard from them in maybe i don't know a hundred winters or so probably dead but uh maybe you can find him he's dwarfing like me where's the fancy green ring owes me a favor you look if it is on our path oh i see how it is not a something for nothing type are you fine if you find don vary i'll make him whip you up something special this entry stone here oughta get you inside those mines the valinder mines is right through these doors might as well ever look see inside don't you think i need that alchemist for something i'm stewing up for you if in your smarts you'll find him can you read it uh these runes read death inside let's get you squared away then where is i know being small like us that's natural blessed to hear hey whatever helps right say the word kid anything else for you so rock said his friend was dwarven like him wearing a green ring look if you wish i will be gathering resources for our journey you don't want to help him no why not because i do not run errands for dwarven but one of his crew scorch marks there along the floor and wall weird i guess we keep looking we i mean i'll keep looking oh that it does not attack oh mom made them sound more dangerous than that then do not drop your card come be ready yes hey i thought you didn't care i noticed the lack of ring while looting the body ready yourself that's it no ring we're not gonna find brock's friend alive boy sir yep follow me adrease oh the ring on that severed hand attached to the soul eater well we know what happened to invari now you can just go tell brock i'll need to fight it right no we'll fight it why because you are frightened of it huh what's up almost ready uh this is crazy how are we supposed to kill something made of rock be strong atreus stay focused and look for a weak point yes sir stay quiet make no sense movement fired we can use it against them uh already we did it i can't believe it believe it you are stronger than you know green green dwarvish inscription the alchemist but where's the rest of him most likely solely to got him i guess we should bring this back to brock hmm roof read it yes sir these runes were written fast it spells out he dreams stainey hmm i don't know that one we will ask the blue one so now you're interested we found his alchemist a reward was promised food oh go be ready so hmm what'd you find your alchemist i'm sorry bro the hand is all we could find still wearing the ring there was a solider inside and well it must have burned away the rest of him suppose you'll still be wanting some compensation huh naturally naturally he says beyoni for oxy i'll take a closer look at this here ring maybe angari left a bit of magic inside before he croaked dwarves can do that sure dwarves and magic jewels is like flies and pig lips supple ones oh i'm not as interested as i thought say uh you didn't happen to run yourself a foul of a scruffy fell about yay high doesn't feel pain sounds drunk but probably just slow hey how'd you think i feel about it if i'd wanted acer business i'd have set up shop outside of brothel or a fighting pit nor fighting brothel uh did he say acer by gods no brock what do you know about the serpent and the lake i know he's too damn big uh all right to work it is another time oh come boy ugh look at this place this must be a branch of the world tree boy stay on the path right right i know well worth a shot i can't read these either but they're different from the others what was that i told you we should come back with a cipher what is that smells awful poison ugh oh i'm ready another cipher piece i'll see what i can fit together oh what were those things they smell awful your mother called him scorn poles poison magic she was the one who showed me how to disable them what it's just funny to think of her teaching you something yes whoa sure is foggy here another door you should no he is of no consequence uh excuse me but um how did you come by that uh axe that is my concern alone and uh while i won't dispute that i i know that blade it was one of ours but uh we didn't make it for you step aside i can't see the woman we made it for i was uh well i am quite fond of her and i would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her it was my mother's she left its father before she died face dead very very sorry to hear that she was a fierce warrior and a good woman okay i will make improvements to the axe but nobody asked you to well it's true but but knowing your mother she would have insisted i repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my brother i knew it you are brock's brother the other half of the brand's here the blue one is your brother yes though my talents are vastly superior no boast i swear to freya do not undo his work improve upon it only yeah but can you can you put it down over there that handle is no filthy okay then i'll just i will just oh oh oh oh is that dried blood oh so what were you working on oh that i call it the sky mover just up that mountain awaits a treasure trove of rare resources once i mine it i'll need a way to bring it all down and you know how to fix it not even a little oh i could use a distraction was there more let me think oh oh i love you it is over uh oh did you really make that ask for my mother oh i'd recognize it anywhere ask me one of our best infused with the echoing screens of 20 frost trolls give or take but why her how did you know her she sought us out in the beginning she was a special woman she wanted to protect people i suppose we thought it was a chance to give power to someone who'd use it for good she even spoke our native tongue she'd say mothering some gengor that's right that's impressive i see a lot of her in your eyes you know thanks and don't touch me what i didn't i won't i'll come back later be careful where you're going there's nobody nice out here anymore since all the people left i mean i hate to generalize but um mostly they just try to kill you good tip um i know it's not my business but if i were you i wash off that symbol painted on your neck we were told it would help protect us was that a lie oh no it's a protection stave all right but you can't render that pigment into paintable texture without blending it with boar urine and is that really better than death maybe a little well well it's your neck please be careful i'm still fixing that stupid head chief tell me what's wrong with you ah i can't tell are we getting closer to the mountain we are oh stop you so yes god oh i'm not ready ah we'll need something to get through this one do you think for this last leg up the mountain that maybe i can carry her i told you no why she meant more to me than you anyway what i just meant i spent more time with her you are off hunting law it would serve you to stop talking ah let him go father ready yourself god uh uh an ogre here who built this place oh go hmm uh uh whoa i can see why mom wanted us to bring her here indeed wonder if cindy knows his sky movers and with the boots i doubt it so how is he going to get it to work i do not care is that smoke you're not tired stay back boy what is that you must find another way up the witch wish she was here bet she could get us past this my magic is useless against the black breath and there's no way around it odin saw to that long ago what are you doing here making sure you can finish your journey why would you warn us i was busy saving my friend if you remember the black breath is a corruption of magic even i can't dispel only the pure light of alpheim is strong enough to break but that road is long what does this goal mean to you it's everything follow me why help us maybe i see more of myself in you than i'm willing to admit maybe maybe by helping you i'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes or maybe i just like you even though we shot your friend even though you shot my friend yes where must we go to a realm beyond your own we're going to another realm are you coming with us only for a little while only for a little while the dwarf at the foot of these hills he was fixing it when we got here no one was there when i passed by perhaps he finished dwarves are awfully resourceful and irritating based on the two we have met that too just give that a turn there tears temple is at the center of the lake it is from there we travel to alfheim thankfully it's no longer underwater why is that creature in the bay no one knows he just appeared one day soon after thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms ultimately it ended in a stalemate and thor returned to odin empty-handed the serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of midgard see told you they've hated each other ever since destined to kill each other come ragnarok you believe in ragnarok i dearly wish i didn't child you know we actually talked to the world serpent you did an exaggeration i'm good with languages even ones i've never heard before but when he talks i can't understand any of it sadly no one can he speaks a dead tongue oh must be lonely watch your step just along here are you sure we came through here before and there's no way back see is that so let me show you something are you watching what it's solid elven architecture my bowstring was soaked in the light of alfheim it can now reawaken the magic of the elves wait it won't just disappear will it not as long as the light shines free this way i want one those roots what kind of magic is that it's van air from anaheim you know of it just stories mother didn't say much about the vanier gods just that they're always at war with the acer as compared to odin thor they're the good guy there are no good gods boy thought i taught you that look here another look it's the world serpent he's so much bigger than i imagined oh look he bit thor or will bite him looks like huh tears temple bills with help from the giants great tear used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them doesn't seem very peaceful everywhere we go we're attacked especially by dead things the risen dead grow ever more numerous once the roads and trails would have been full of people now all have hid or fled save for the reavers savage enough to survive in such a world make a ride at the bottom of these stairs hey another one of those light crystals wait there while i reawaken the light that did it what are we doing exactly mending the disc repair start by lifting that axle good now push it back into place now realign the wheel onto the track perfect now push the bridge along the trap what the whole entire bridge is turning how was the whole entire bridge turning boy you're really strong just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position tired yet no he's always been really strong so about the dead you heard someone call them hell watchers but what are they they are poor restless souls denied their judgment and their peace why what could then your magic raise the dead it could once but this is no spell this plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance something or someone has meddled with powerful forces that is all i know for sure that's perfect come back up we're ready now that was impressive you didn't hurt your back did you i did not hurt my back through these doors wait so did the giants or the elves ellisville tear stuff all the races helped with its construction it was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before peace disappeared for good wow your bowstring stopped going its power is now depleted only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them your bow please once you claim the light of all time infuse the bowstring with its power don't forget you talk like you're not coming with us i'll try but measures were taken to keep me trapped in midgard why the gods don't care for me much is this it it's so dark this temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters it needs only the light of the bifrost to reawaken those roots don't look like your magic they aren't these roots are part of the great world tree and make travel between the realms possible approach the table how does it work you will need this a bi-frost to create travel between realms it can capture hold and transfer the light of alpha place the bifrost there what now give it a moment the temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber it is from this room and this room alone that you will be able to cross between realms what you see before you represents the temple in which we stand as well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside all the realms exist in the same physical space reflections of each other these doors the towers outside and the nine realms are all intertwined and co-existing on the branches of the world tree separated only by the bifrost light of alpheim this place can focus and control that light and is this the world tree only an artistic representation of it no the yggdrasil is much much more than this the tree of life is bound to the fate of the world just as we are bound to it the tree nourishes our soils the dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers the tree's very existence supports all of creation along its vows it's life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life birth growth death and reaping every strand transcending time transcending space everything comes back to the tree so that's how it works but i'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer yes very well the bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of anaheim instead turn the wheel to our actual destination alpheim wait is this moving the big bridge outside yes the wheel turns the bridge and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside wait there's no tower on this one and that's why realm travel to yotenheim is impossible without a tower for the bridge to lock into the sequence can't begin every realm has a travel room that unlocks the bridge to that realm i'm giving you the one for offline now you can lock in your destination we're ready remember to take the bifrost you don't want to lose that now the realm travel bridge will align and the realm between realms will open see that giant crystal each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the bifrost opening the bridge to that realm that's why realm travel is only possible from this room what about that one round town to sit from the lake the hotenheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago when the giants vanished from midgard where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery it didn't work we're still here follow me but my frost is dark this trip was its last use there's no going back until it's replenished with the light of all time so we are trapped someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to midgard and we'll be able to make that black breath go away with the captured light of alfheim yes welcome to alpheim gentlemen think you can spot the light i can barely see it something's wrong see that column of light on the horizon it's housed in the heart of a ring temple we'll find what we need there no no no no no damn it not yet what's happening to restore the bifrost magic you must step into the light but be very careful she's not dead not likely um look at this place stay by me touch nothing okay what is that i think you killed it whoa what's that about not our concern boy focus what does it say hmm something about an eternal war for the life i don't get it if both sides need it why not just share it greed you will find it a common cause they keep murdering the lighthouse it is war being the one the rope once lost oh uh what are they attacking us we didn't do anything did you say something no oh okay soon we'll be able to translate those moose pohans at least we're getting closer to the light wait is that centric i can do whatever you need was there more to discuss oh how are you here before us dwarf we were told our path was the only one between realms well it may be the only way for you to travel but we dwarves are full of surprises that is not an answer ah hang on to that sense of wonder there's so little mystery once you've amassed the wealth of arcane knowledge that i have where to comb the realms for exotic resources how to craft them into creations that defy imagination to the novice i'm sure it all seems like magic the uh oh all right it's magic are you happy now what'd you say i said nothing really okay did your mother speak of this realm not much just that since the elves are always fighting over the white he kept them isolated huh again i said nothing where this one you said something ah what is it boy voices you don't hear that i hear nothing it's going away now it was screaming lots of voices angry you really didn't hear that no it felt evil uh so look should we try talking to them no but maybe they need help they do not stop us so they do not concern us they do not concern us look at that that must be the ring temple look they have sand bowls and i'll find two should i read it what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life most pure but i don't see any runes around here we must find it back to the boat it's sad the elves can't work things out i don't find such a beautiful place but war makes it ugly you see with the eyes of a child in war a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy the rest of him is lost sometimes never to return you know about war don't you wars are fought for two things survival or advantage battles may be won by the better soldier wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory enemies keep betray us to me huh i'm ready oh huh you got it uh what's up uh sundry said mother was a warrior was she in a war too of a sort her family was decimated by hostile rivals and she alone survived she walked the warriors path but her war was to live on to brave an unforgiving world alone and that's why she has cindy and brock to make her the axe she had the strength to wield such a weapon and the wisdom to use it for good she found purpose in protecting the weak so she'd help out the elves no the blue door that's gotta be the entrance let's go careful boy what are they doing the bridge is gone they covered the crystal with that stuff why to prevent reinforcements go go oh maybe we can fix the bridge from down there okay so that did something i think huh we do not belong here wait combined together like that they kind of look like a room it doesn't make sense come back to the sand bowl what's that father you ever know anyone else who heard voices i knew desperate men at sea who when our supplies ran dry would quench their thirst by drinking seawater they swore the sirens evil creatures singing to them from nearby islands were in fact their wives and daughters calling them home they endangered the crew steering us toward the reefs um how did you fix them we threw them overboard oh well good thing i didn't drink any seawater right yes it is father the pillars in ring farm in elvish room what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life most pure yep it's water all right boy it was the voices again but different voices less angry they're asking for help we are here for the light i do not care who they are nor what they want you never care about anything you have something to say no more what's happening whoa look what we found father yes the voices i heard it was hard to make out but way in the back i'm pretty sure i heard mother that is not possible i know what i heard petraeus that can't be good oh uh so be ready okay here we go hope that was worth it foreign ugh okay tricky huh that side hallway will get us to the temple we will find out huh you were wrong back there oh i know mother's voice better than anyone he was hurt she is gone boy speak no more of this fine go um yes ah hold on from boys oh huh no way across here too bad the witch's bow string doesn't work anymore uh so hey you sure the witch is okay i'd hate to think she died helping us she knew what she was doing okay if we cut enough away the bridge above us should reappear right expect resistance right oh oh you find its weak point hmm god well there it is watch our backs boy hmm freezing at first we must find a way up you
