tools to build myself some help uh hmm [Music] [Music] huh [Music] that should be enough to get a portion or two out of one car plug let's head to nema outpost [Music] yep oh these five pieces are worth one half portion last week there were a half portion each what about the droid the droid's not for sale i'll pay for him 60 portions come on baby water water oh let's get out of here we'll see about that [Music] helping you i didn't ask your help this droid says you stole it it belonged to poe dameron he was captured by the first order i helped him escape but our ship crashed so you're with the resistance obviously bb-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base apparently has a map that leads to luke skywalker and everyone's after it luke skywalker come on ah we can't outrun them watch out oh so much for outrunning them yeah another foot jumper but how are we gonna reach it it's locked away i think i have an idea stop them you're up bb-8 [Music] fine [Music]

i'm going low [Music] stay low it confuses their tracking stay low got it hey keep setting me up and i'll keep laughing this ship really moves just wait till i get the compressor off the ignition line whoa getting pretty good probably there's a map to luke skywalker inside bb-8 yeah the resistance i mean we really need that map then we best get away from the first order not bad for garbage get ready okay for what we're gonna go inside that downstar destroyer aren't we it's fine i scavenge them all the time we aren't gonna blow a hole in that engine with these cannons we need something more heavy duty like a proton torpedo or something wait a minute these ties might be carrying the proton torpedoes we need the first order tie pilots are some of the best i've seen we got to watch out bb8 it's getting a little cozy in here whoa i'm not with the resistance okay i'm just trying to get away from the first order but you tell us where the base is i'll get you there first deal so where's your base go on bb8 teller the eileenium system yeah that's the one get us there as fast as you can [Applause] [Music] we're going to make the jump to the eye union system everyone's trapping it's the first order what do we do there must be something where'd you get this ship don't tell me your wrath star's gotten loose oh great it's the guavian security soldiers get below and stay there until i say so han solo we want our money back now you think hunting wrath cars is cheap kanji club wants that investment back too that bb unit the first order is looking for one just like it and two fugitives if we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both guns [Applause] i got a bad feeling about this this was a mistake huge did we just release another raptor three raptors four rathers what's the difference free solo android is coming with us great timing let's go [Music] don't meet us there we need to find a way back to the falcons that preferably doesn't involve getting the doors are in auto lock down till we get rid of this rather i'm pretty sure i left an anti-rathtar something or other than one of those crates now we're getting somewhere uh [Music] [Music] here goes nothing we're headed to the falcon find a way to meet us there but we don't know where we are that's the scary uh there they are uh [Music] ah [Music] foreign maybe releasing those raptors was a good thing that when we get back on the falcon looks like he's got more than raptors on this ship [Music] hmm [Music] uh yes they won't be getting their money back hey kids you you still alive yeah way down here great we need to clear those force fields chewy the containment units well when does being unsure ever stopped us uh uh uh oh we're close the falcon is just through there the falcon come

bb-8 solo it is i see repeat you must not have recognized me on the way in due to my stylish red arm there's actually an interesting story who are you calling self-indulgent general i regret to inform you but this map recovered from bb-8 is only partially complete can't believe i was so foolish to think i could find luke and bring him home the scan data from snaps reconnaissance flight confirms finn's report this was the death star and this is starkiller base the weapon that destroyed the hosnian system oh uh hang on this this thing's 4k the first order they're charging the weapon again now our system is the next target okay how do we blow it up that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator they have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate i can disable their shields but i have to be there on the planet we'll get you there i am not sure master solo recognized me oh do you suppose he was confused by my red arm what would you know you don't read anything won't you how'd you find what you needed the flooding tunnel is over that ridge we'll get in that way let's find ray where am i you're my guest i know you've seen the map and now you'll give it to me i'm not giving you anything give me the map never ah wait here [Applause] the scavenger resisted you she is strong with the force then the resistance must be destroyed before they get to skywalker prepare the weapon supreme leader i can get the map from the girl bring her to me you will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open i will remove these restraints and leave the cell with a door open oh [Applause] the longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have the shields i have an idea about that ah hey all right big deal now one there will be [Music] [Applause] matters into my own hands what was your job when you were based here sanitation sanitation you won't be able to take out fasteners easy trust me fire fire fire do you think you can destroy this battle station hey i recognize that guy um this so grab pathetic i will deal with you myself we're going to need that power core if there's any chance of us capturing phasma she takes one step on this and she'll be in for the shock of her life i think you're enjoying this a little too much kid but you like being in charge phasma get down here let me show you how to deal with intruders the only way this plan is going to work is if we use that power core foreign so oh [Music] one minute she's just walking under this inconspicuous bridge then blam will you keep it down let's get her to the system control we can shut down the shield from in there don't celebrate quite yet your pitiful band of peasants will never destroy this base you want me to blast that bucket off your head lower the shields you're making a big mistake what do we do with her is there a garbage chute trash compactor yeah there is huh finn what are you doing here escape now hug later the shields are down almost in range hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get [Music] ah direct hit but no damage my friends got a bag full of explosives let's use if you're going to get inside i need to find the junction box huh girl knows her stuff keep your hat on i'm coming let's make a move we need to be ready at the door once ray gets it open atta girl are you trying to blow us up [Music] hey when i dropped them we weren't sneaking into a first order base and the falcon was fine in the end come on we got a job to do is someone there spark trip is needed ah explosive detected get back huh walkways out we could just dump the charge here ever the perfection fine then find us a way across is that all of them let's get out of here an explosive everyone down ben han solo my son will you help me yes hmm thank you hit the target hard give it everything you got [Music] we aren't getting inside that oscillator just yet let's bend down the defense we got a chance [Applause] before they have a lot of firepower is anyone seeing these torpedoes lying around yeah grab them and fire them at those towers the last of their cannons are down so i'm taking there's a brand new hole in that oscillator we did it the oscillator doors are open i'm going in thank you the falcons this way ah traitor [Music] that lightsaber it belongs to me come and get it fight me let me put you out of your misery second time holding a lightsaber and i'm fighting kylo ren keep learning no one will stand in my way not han not you you don't deserve to wield that saber give it to me he wants us to follow he's probably a trap but we can't let him get away i see his footprints he went this way over there a scavenger and a traitor you two are pathetic this whole planet is falling apart we can't let him get away with what he's done you're a monster it's just us now han solo can't save [Music] you won't win you can't watch me it's the ones who destroyed the base [Music] you sure you're okay finn i'm fine we have to stop him let's

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] well i wonder what's gotten into him bb-8 says he has something to show us bb-8 it is very doubtful r2 will have the rest of the lab in his backup data
