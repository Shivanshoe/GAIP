i'd love to see what the normandy can do in a fight only an idiot hopes for combat while flying in a stealth ship but the stealth drive adds a new tactical level to space combat as we know it surprise attacks undetected flanking maneuvers this isn't a strategy simulation if those new tactics don't work we're salvaged message coming in from the brass at arcturus hatching it through normandy admiral hackett here we're getting reports of a marked increase in death activity in the skillion verge surveillance drones have identified death outposts on four different planets in the armstrong cluster we need someone to take them out we have any idea what they're after hard to say they may be just gathering intel on us or maybe they're setting up staging grounds for hit-and-run attacks on human colonies i'm on it admiral finding sarin is still your top priority but you've got experience fighting to get you're the logical choice to take out these outposts we're transmitting all the locations of known geth outposts in the armstrong cluster to the normandy now admiral hack it out [Music] message for you commander just came in over a secure channel this is admiral i found out who set that trap for my men the ones killed by the thresher war damn i hope you get this message it was a group called cerberus an alliance black ops organization top secret highest level security clearance they vanished a few months ago dropped right off the grid nobody knew where they went to what they were up to they've gone completely rogue shepard they're conducting illegal genetic experiments trying to create some kind of super soldier i don't have any proof but i found the coordinates for one of their research worlds i'm uploading them with this message they're completely out of control somebody needs to stop them i've done my part now it's up to you this this is probably the last you'll hear from me cerberus is after me now i need to disappear before they find me [Music] so did three more of these outposts left to clear out this should be fun [Music] [Music] so okay so so so dog [Music] no number two tv [Music] [Music] right so so just one outpost left i'm going to miss slaughtering death like this [Music] [Music] [Music] so foreign so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Laughter] no [Music] [Music] uh [Laughter] so [Music] so okay [Music] [Music] so hold up this receiver is picking up some kind of transmission based on the signal strength i'd say it's coming from inside this star cluster it must be a message from the primary death base we can use the signal to lock onto its location and take them out [Music] [Music] foreign so [Music] um [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] so let's get moving [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] my [Music] so okay looks like cerberus has other bases on this world shepard so uh so [Music] so foreign [Laughter] this is my kind of mission [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] it's i guess [Music] [Music] [Music] so uh so [Music] [Music] uh so [Music] [Music] she shepard i need to talk to you it's important is something wrong you know the data you took from those guest control nodes the information you uploaded to alliance control i want a copy of it you want to bring this data back to the migrant fleet those files have information that could be vital to our efforts to understand the geth it could be the key to helping us reclaim our home world you think you can use this information to destroy your enemy not right away we will need to study it it could take years but it will give us new insight into how the get have changed and evolved over the past centuries go ahead make a copy my people i owe you a great debt one i can never repay the only thing i can offer in return is what you already have my solemn promise to stay with you until saturn and his death armies are defeated i never wanted anything more thank you shepard so we've got saren on the run it won't be long now saren's good but i'm better good he's rotten to the core i could tell as soon as i met him why didn't you tell me this sooner i would have if i thought i was important i think i'd like to hear about it just the same this was a while ago a bunch of mercs were bragging about a job out near the edges of the terminus systems they said it paid well and the boss was never around to ride them they said he was looking for more men too so i checked it out i didn't know saren was openly recruiting mercs it wasn't that open and he only showed his face once we'd been raiding ships in the area for months when we took out this massive cargo freighter our biggest haul yet i was on board checking bodies for valuables looking for some extra credits that's when i saw him what did saren want with the ship i don't know what he wanted he was just moving through the ship watching a couple of the mercs called him by name but he never spoke to them never spoke to anyone i had a really bad feeling about him so i got the hell out didn't even wait to get paid that's the only time you saw him yeah didn't even know who he was still wouldn't if i hadn't joined up with you but my instincts were right every other merc on that mission turned up dead within a week every damn one so long rex shepard oh before i go you said you're serving with commander shepard now we saw him on the news here he's cute later sis tell me you didn't hear that afraid i did oh shoot me now one of my sisters that's sarah the youngest surprised to see you here sir thought you'd be chatting up what's her name to sony liara why would you think that scuttlebutt says you got a bit of a thing for i could understand why the crew's off limits with the regs against fraternization and at least she looks like a woman you think i'm interested in liara because she's the only one i'm allowed to date so you are interested in her of course it could be politics alien diplomats daughter us under orders to make nice with the bug-eyed monsters what's up you didn't come by to eavesdrop on family mail your family seems to be important to you yeah we've always been close me and my sisters especially with dad on duty so much i had to help mom raise them after helping raise them your sisters still talk to you amazing things were tense between sarah and me for a while then we bonded like a story feel like sharing sarah got herself a boyfriend who wanted to go faster than she did mike i didn't think he was a bad kid just pushy lynn would send me these worried vid mails and i'd tell her to relax where were you when this was going on i was on active duty sarah's graduating high school this year this was only a couple years back they were on amaterasu at the time i was assigned to chernobook same cluster but a dozen hell why away close enough to talk regularly too far to make it back in an emergency i couldn't afford a fast packet flight sounds like that situation didn't last mike thought they'd go for a romantic walk in the woods because he figured it was past time they did the deed she levered mike face first into a tree and left didn't have a scratch on her good thing mom and dad had us all learn some kind of self-defense i took emergency leave and walked sarah to school for a few days did anything happen while you were home my last day out mike was waiting for us sarah had told her friends so everyone at school knew what he did he wasn't happy i wanted to snap him in half but sarah gave me this look this let me handle it i need to do this alone look she kept her cool god bless her as he screamed in her face she just let him vent then he tried to punch her i swear she just flowed around him next thing i knew he's face down on the sidewalk and there's blood everywhere he missed when he swung she just she wasn't there anymore and he fell she helped him stop the bleeding and had me call an ambulance she told the paramedics he fell before they took him to the hospital mike touched sarah's arm i thought he was gonna end up on the ground again but he hung his head whispered i'm sorry and started crying and she hugged him the williams women are decisive bunch commander we do things when we're ready not before not after your sister's something else but you didn't mention your father at all was he on deployment dad always wanted to serve in space but he wanted us to have real ground under our feet he'd say space is beautiful but you can't raise a family there i cannot rest from travel i will drink life to the leaves all times i've enjoyed greatly have suffered greatly both with those that loved me and alone for always roaming with a hungry heart much have i seen and known cities of men and manners climates councils governments poetry you gonna bore the enemy to death marine doubt it'll work on death but i'll give it a shot just like to remember why we fight ulysses was my dad's favorite poem every time he shipped out he recorded me reading it he had a dozen versions when he retired does he still like it i sure hope so i read it to his grave every time i go home dad passed on a few years back he's probably still watching though so behave i thought you said he was dead you know from heaven wherever that is that's not a problem with you is it that i believe in god your beliefs are your business i'm your commanding officer not your moral compass just my commanding officer huh we'll have to see about that we're on duty here williams too bad i should get back to my duties didn't mean to take up so much of your time what's your opinion on the last mission you mean the wreck i think just saying skipper we'll talk later williams looking forward to it skipper commander how are you why did you want to be a c-sec officer in the first place that's a good question there were several reasons i guess like what probably the same as most officers i wanted to fight injustice wanted to help people i guess my father had something to do with it too he was cesek one of the best i grew up hearing about his accomplishments or seeing his picture on the vids after a big arrest he's taking my resignation pretty hard that's tough but you'd think he'd be impressed you're going after saren my father's a c-sec man to the bone do things right or don't do them at all he says he thinks i'm being too rash too impatient he's worried i'll become just like saren he actually talked me out of becoming a specter when i was younger for the same reasons you were asked to be a specter well i was targeted as a possible specter candidate me and about a thousand other turian military recruits i could have received special training but my father didn't like it he despises the specters he hates the idea of someone having unlimited power with no accountability he wouldn't like you commander no offense i suppose i can understand his concern you can but saren's not going to play by our rules c-sec's rules if you want to nail saren you need to send someone who isn't restricted by policies and procedures just because you can break the rules doesn't mean you should i don't need to stoop to saren's level to stop and neither do you garrus i see what you mean but i'll think about it thanks commander i get the feeling you want to ask me something commander maybe we could pick up where we left off you were telling me about your interest in the protheans actually i think i was talking about my interest in you and making a fool of myself in the process as i said i am not used to dealing with people especially humans i did not really know much about your species when we first met shepard i found it hard to take humanity seriously your kind always seemed so rushed and high strung we don't have the luxury of time and asari can live for a thousand years we're lucky if we hit 150. that is true at first i thought that was a weakness of your species after spending time with you and your crew however i think it may actually be an advantage you humans are creatures of action you pursue your goals with an almost indomitable determination it is an admirable trait but also an intimidating one you're scared of us unfortunately the rest of the galaxy sees humanity as something of a bully you run over anyone in your path to get what you want it is up to people like you to change their minds shepard i'm doing the best i can liara there is a reason the council chose you to become a specter they saw something special in you the best of what humanity has to offer i looked into your history i know what you did during the blitz it was a remarkable display of courage and heroism you didn't need to go behind my back i would have told you whatever you wanted to know i apologize commander after our last conversation i was afraid i would say something stupid again i wanted to know more about you to understand what made you into the man you are there is something compelling about you shepard you're interested in me because of my visions you just want to know more about the protheans i admit your connection to the protheans had something to do with my initial interest but it has grown beyond that you intrigue me shepherd but i was not sure if it was appropriate to act on my feelings i thought there might already be a relationship between you and chief williams williams and i are just friends nothing more my mistake then i am not as adept at understanding human relationships as i thought but what about us shepard is there a mutual attraction or was i wrong about that too no you were right there is something between us i knew it and i knew you felt it too but does this not seem rather strange why do i feel so close to you we have only known each other a short time we are from two different species we have almost nothing in common this makes no sense these things never make sense they just happen and we get swept up in the storm you make it sound so chaotic so dangerous i'll keep you safe i am not looking for a protector this is all a bit overwhelming i am not used to this you i need some time take all the time you need liara i'll be here thank you shepard let's let's just talk about something else for now i should go goodbye shepard anything you need commander just trying to get a sense of where the crew's at thoughts well they know about the stonewalling you've had from the council they deserve to know what we're up against they're on your side they're pissed about the resistance we're getting especially from our side i'll have a better handle on all of it when my head stops hurting another l2 flare up anything i can do no commander it'll settle down it's rough sometimes but they spike higher than a lot of l3s except for you of course besides i fared a lot better than some after kinetics was through i haven't heard anything about kinetics in a while yeah they quietly disappeared broke up into a bunch of little corpse after they botched the training on jump zero after first contact kinetics was set up to track element zero exposures and develop implants for humans once we had an embassy on the citadel kinetics could bring in experts instead of taking it slow i'm sure kinetics did what they thought was best it wasn't best for us they brought in an ex-military turian named commander vernus a real hardass he basically had a free pass to break us if it would turn out a decent biotic kind of spiraled from there commander did he ever face charges for that he got his yeah but like everything else at jump zero was under the table the less said the better anyway this is ancient stuff i walked it off a long time ago i should get back to my duties commander we're here to make history not rehash it what's your opinion on the last mission killing sir i'm sure dr disoni's hurting though we'll talk another time transmission coming in commander i think you're going to want to hear this one greetings commander shepard i represent a party interested in obtaining information on cerberus activities who are you and who do you represent who i am is inconsequential suffice to say i am an agent for the shadow broker you see admiral kahoku contacted my employer looking for information on the location of any cerberus facilities we provided that information on the promise that he would turn over copies of all files gathered from the cerberus systems to us these are classified alliance files i'm not handing them over to you a reasonable commander cerberus was operating outside alliance jurisdiction you don't know them any loyalty the alliance is just going to file this information away in some archive but no secret stays hidden forever eventually someone somewhere will deliver it into our hands might as well be you transmit the files to us and you will be well compensated what are you going to do with this information information is a commodity it can be bought sold or traded why my employer desires this information is not my concern my loyalty is to the alliance not the shadow broker that is unfortunate commander my employer will remember this the next time you need something from us message from admiral hackett commander patching it through we just received your report looks like this geth incursion was bigger than we thought they were probably preparing for a major offensive in the system we're increasing patrols in the armstrong cluster to make sure they can't establish another foothold in the region nice job shepard you saved a lot of human lives on this mission hack it out alliance officials report that a geth incursion into the armstrong cluster has been repulsed with the geth suffering heavy casualties in the event of future death activity the alliance plans to maintain a strong security presence in the area hey commander shepard it's me conrad verner remember me there are rumors on the extranet that you've been made the first human specter that's incredible being a spectre is a big responsibility i just want to make humanity proud the vids are all talking about commander shepard fighting for all of us back home and they also say that you don't take crap from anybody you're showing them what humans can do hey can i get your picture i don't have a problem with it but why you're a hero shepherd decades from now humanity's going to remember you and i'll have your picture just hold up your gun perfect thanks again commander i'm gonna hang this in my living room my wife will love it there are a few unlicensed vendors who operate out of the markets here sometimes they have good stuff for a respected alliance military has passed away the veteran soldier who won the love of his troops during conflict with the batarians died of natural causes kahoku is survived by his wife and three children who are planning a small private memorial service standby shore party decontamination in program logged the commanding officer is aboard exo presley stands relieved do [Music] so i know who runs this place have you been here before no but i was planning to come here before you and i met this place belongs to a turian scum named tawn actus it's a long story but he's got something that belongs to me well what is it family armor it's been with us for over five generations turian military took it from my father's father after the war somehow this ass wound up with it i want it back we'll get it back now let's move right behind you [Music] oh do [Music] so uh hmm foreign my this is it i can't believe my ancestors ever wore this piece of crap but at least i've got it back i'm glad we could help you get it back i might just be starting to like you [Music] shepherd [Music] so [Music] [Music] equalizing interior pressure with exterior atmosphere logged the commanding officer is ashore exo presley has the deck we saw your ship fight dan wants to speak with you immediately who's fighting he's our leader he needs your help to prepare for the geth they are making another push please up the stairs past the freighter uh [Music] dc so [Music] [Music] head to the tunnels make sure they're secure what if i find gap there are you glad to see some soldiers our numbers are getting thin i fear the death will kill us all but this work must be completed my headaches are getting better i just have to stop thinking about the past ah commander i'm glad they finally sent somebody to help us you're a bit late aren't you arcelia sorry commander everyone's on edges watch out we've got gath in the tower protect the heart of the colony [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] the get the bunker he's the closest thing left to proper channels i'm grateful for what you've done but your heroics don't impress me commander goodbye commander the tower's secure thanks to you commander i'm just glad your colony is safe i appreciate your concern and your efforts against the gift they may have been slowed but they'll be back they always come back help me find what the guests are after and you'll all get out of here alive we don't know what they're after they came they attacked us that's all we know their main base is at the exogeny headquarters if you want answers what's exogeny it's the company most of us work for before the attacks they fund this colony the skyway leads directly to exogeny headquarters you can't miss it of course there's an army of gas between here and there i didn't expect this would be easy then maybe i can get this colin the operational again what can you tell me about the defenses that geth set up i don't have any details but i'll wager it's a lot more fortified in the command post they landed at least one guest ship at exogeny and i've seen large walking tanks on the skyway expect a hard fight what do you need done to get this place back on its feet we need those geth destroyed arcelia's right there are still death in the tunnels we also have more mundane problems like food water and power i'm not sure where we stand on those matters you should talk to the people overseeing them is there anything i can do to solve your water shortage marca doyle has been assigned to that particular issue if you have any insight to offer please speak with her what's wrong with the colony's power supply may o'connor was working on our power problems she'd know more about it than i do you mentioned something about a food shortage davin reynolds is tasked with securing food for the immediate future if you can assist please speak with him do you have information about death in the lower tunnels nothing new they're in the tunnel somewhere likely guarding a transmitter to coordinate attacks it's not a critical threat right now but getting rid of that transmitter will help us defend against further attacks let's talk about zoo's hope and pharos in general of course commander what do you need done to get this place back on its feet we need those death destroyed arcelia's right there are still death in the tunnels all i'm not sure where we stand on those matters you should talk to the people overseeing them let's talk about this commander i'll talk to you when i learn more good luck commander you
