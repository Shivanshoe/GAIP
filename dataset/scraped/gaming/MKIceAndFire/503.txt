it was not by chance that this struggle came to be the blame falls squarely upon my shoulders for giving evil the chance it needed and therefore fulfilling an ancient prophecy raiden's earth realm champions had failed to stop the deadly alliance from fully resurrecting the mummified army of the dragon king in the end only reagan himself stood between earth realm and total destruction defying the elder god's wishes he alone challenged quan qi and shang tsung immortal combat earth brown's last hope for freedom [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] raiden fought well against the two sorcerers and it seemed as though victory was at hand but the combined might of quan chi and shin soul proved to be overwhelming even from a thunder god raiden was defeated the deadly alliance had won their victory was short-lived as suspicion and lust for power overcame both quan chi and shang tsung the former allies turned on each other the deadly alliance was no more [Music] and reveled in his conquest but it is said that there is only one true ruler of outworld and that ruler had returned [Music] the prophecy had been fulfilled the dragon king had indeed returned to outworld to reclaim his army and impose his dumbness death awaited all who stood in his way [Applause] [Music] [Music] us and so it was that a new alliance was formed out of desperation sworn enemies joined forces to combat a greater threat [Music] raiden began to realize that even their combined might was not enough to defeat the dragon king there was only one chance left raiden's sacrifice was in vain for the blast had little effect on the dragon king now onaga has what he needs to shape the realms as he sees fit i was the fool who brought him this power only i can destroy this threat born of deception my patience for mortals has worn thin if i'm to protect earthrealm i must punish those who would threaten it the fool shujinko had let himself be deceived into believing that he worked for a greater good he was in fact an unknowing tool of a greater evil one that had almost caused the destruction of earth realm [Music] that shujinko and did his mistake and destroyed the dragon king is of no importance those who place earthrealm in harm's way will pay with their lives [Music] and that is why we must put our differences aside and join forces why should we believe you quan chi why should we trust you i will not join an alliance of traitors [Music] shang tsung shal khan onaga my comrades we are all treacherous by nature and betrayal is to be expected but if we do not stand together at least initially it could mean the end of darkness i stand with no one i will claim the prize and with it destroy you all oh naga emperor not anymore you haven't been listening to what quan chi has told us the forces of light also seek to acquire this power you cannot defeat them alone only if we join forces does one of us have a chance of winning the prize but which one of us if onaga is the victor he could use that power to overthrow you i'll take that chance what of the brothers what can be done about them i have trapped one of them in earth realm the other is in eugenia we must go there now our allies are waiting to warm [Music] do not go through that portal raiden you look different but i'm glad you're here i need your help shao khan and his allies are planning something it is none of my concern i don't understand you've always fought against shao khan's forces now he's planning another battle and you won't lift a finger we must not stand idly by we must stop this no tathan i have struck a deal with the emperor xiao khan will honor earthrealm's independence when his forces have won when he's won what are you saying why would that lunatic spare earthrealm because in return i will prevent you from completing your quest [Music] cannot believe that raiden would side with the enemy since this quest began nothing has made sense my entire life has been turned upside down i want to abandon the quest but if i do dagon will win and he has become far too corrupt to replace father as protector at this moment the forces of darkness are invading edenia there must be something i can do to stop them [Music] i'm a little old for punkin no get shinnok but i love you dad so you are the issue of you want him you're gonna go through me yes that's better watch miss cage as i ran your father's flesh this is what awaits those who define excruciatingly you son of a holy it does run in the family your father's power will not save you you cannot hope to survive you got caged that you

beautiful saves the world my work here is done this way in here isolate shinnok and devorah and get the medic we'll fix you up help is on the way you should have seen cass wipe the floor with shinnok i believe it and you you did a great job with your team johnny [Music] you hear that cass she called me johnny i thought she might [Music] too long have i allowed earthrealm to endure the horrors of war time and again we've defeated our enemies but we've exacted no retribution demanded no remuneration what have we gained for our mercy more intrigue more senseless violence as the new rulers of the nether realm heed me no longer will i simply defend earth realm i will seek out and destroy all who threaten it no mercy will be shown no quarter given was an elder god impossible to kill there are fates worse than death [Music] your shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grand master hasashi no if we do not hear soon i will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get raiden the fire gardens they built the shiraira you are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is grand master hasashi he is dead now you have come to finish us i understand your distrust but i am here to assist you i find that impossible to believe who

a slave and cronica is your master fight [Applause] [Music] raiden you must listen spout your falsehoods elsewhere scorpion chronicle will not entrap us it is no trap karan awaits you in the nether realm lord raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out [Music] now scorpion the truth raiden stop this step aside lukang put down the amulet its darkness is

realms hang in the balance to defend them i must command order i thought it impossible but the revenants were right you cannot be trusted i do not need trust i demand obedience enough of your madness if you must die so be it this this has happened before [Music] [Music] enough of your madness if you must die so be it [Music] [Music] [Music] i have been a fool liu kang cronicas puppet we only battle because she wills it i must help him i was wrong to doubt you i too have been a slave to anger i do not understand lord reagan your rage was caused by chronicle yes i succumbed to her influence but then our confrontation it unlocked memories memories not only from this timeline but from timelines that have come before wait a sec timelines plural cronica has restarted time on countless previous occasions using each timeline to learn and to perfect her plan the details of each timeline are different but in each one events conspire to bring lou kang and i into conflict in each one he dies only cronica has such power to control time and fate i don't get it why do that i do not know but be assured cronica will control us no longer at long last you see the pattern the pattern but not the purpose why set me against liu kang is it not obvious your combined power threatens my vision for the timeline lou kang and i will not be divided further by your machinations oh raiden do you think this is the first time you made that vow we have repeated this exact conversation so often in so many timelines i have lost count this timeline will end differently we have played out all possible scenarios raiden you cannot win you are welcome to try of course but without lukang by your side [Music] enjoy these final hours raiden they are all you have luke where is he cronica has taken him to her aisle we must leave immediately to save the realms we must save liu kang your shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grand master hasashi no if we do not hear soon i will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get raiden the fire gardens rebuilt the shirairu are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is grand master hasashi he is dead and now you have come to finish us i understand you mistrust but i am here to assist you i find that impossible to believe what is he doing here we are not together if you are here to help prove it join me against the sorcerer i shall [Music] fujin raiden thought you lost when the timeline was broken but you stand with shang tsung we have urgent news for raiden please let us pass this may be the sorcerer's trick the fire gardens will not be defiled by his presence why you have joined shang tsung is beyond me fujin what has he done to corrupt your mind [Music] perhaps listen before you judge [Music] thank you fujin we must speak with you brother we fujin since when are you friends with this filth i'm here to save you raiden we hail from your tragic future in it liu kang but their battle destroyed her crown without this a broken timeline couldn't be repaired our only hope was to return here steal the crown and make use of its power now we can change the outcome of the fight against kronecker we can defeat her and fix time i never thought you gullible brother shang tsum schemes serve only to benefit him how could you fall for such lies be rational raiden spread your falsehoods elsewhere sorcerer you will not deceive us lord raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out now shane the truth braden stop this step aside lou kang put down the amulet its darkness is taking hold of you you also betray me this is not the way shang tsung is not the enemy this time the realms hang in the balance and you form this unholy alliance enough of this madness if you both must die so be it my brother is my problem i will signal if i need help chinock's amulet inflames your anger and clouds your judgments have faith in me [Music] now listen brother we're running out of time i am a fool i have allowed myself to become a slave to anger i will not allow my temper to fracture our resolve further you just fujin not at all liu kang raiden's power makes you a fire god of course it does unfortunately i cannot transfer my power to liu kang yet first i must free his revenant from quan chi's curse we will face their evidence soon enough what else can you tell us about the final battle we must use every advantage [Music] i trust you are enjoying your travels you have already been defeated once cronica of course fujin how else could you have escaped the void if you know this accept the inevitable surrender but clearly my loss was not your victory raiden if your future savior had gained full control of my hourglass we would not be here this timeline would no longer exist i see no harm in confirming your suspicion even if you defeat me what then who claims the hourglass surely you realize that shame soon will break your alliance we are prepared kronecker are you have you wondered why shang knows so much about my crown because he did your bidding gathering souls to fuel it shang is far too modest the crown is his design no one save me knows more about its power i told you we would still be marooned at the beginning of time bickering among ourselves you must decide raiden who do you wish to keep time for all of creation me or shang soon neither cronica you will be beaten and if shang soon betrays us we will finish him you are a fool raiden do not condemn the realms to oblivion [Music] [Applause] so the crown it is a mistake challenging a titan now i end your existence [Applause] um you are vulnerable ugh [Music] brother are you all right uh yes but the crown truly my finest work i will instruct you in its ways what just happened cronica came here to retrieve the crown we forced her to retreat we must strike while she is weakened let us join the armies massing at the sea of blood together we will storm kronecker's isle and take command of the hourglass you
