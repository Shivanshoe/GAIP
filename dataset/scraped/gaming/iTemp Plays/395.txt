hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to playing some live flight who's probably the legend who has changed the most since this game came out originally she was really good as a solo queue legend because of her fast tales they were incredibly useful and then she was turned into more of a more of a team player with the afk lifeline revive and she still has that focus now but with a big power distribution change between her afk revive and the other pieces of her kids she actually has by far the highest arena's win rate because of how useful her drone and revives are and it doesn't hurt that a gold bag costs 250 points which is barely more than a single shield battery you can buy one no problem from the second round onwards and it's so incredibly useful today i'm mixing up a little bit i have a game on olympus for you and then i have an arena's game as well let me know if you want to see more arenas from me because i do enjoy the mode but i haven't really posted it much lately at all so thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't think i've ever had 520 bumps i think i've had like three four you've definitely had more than that uh you don't understand because i play so little but when i used to play i used to get to like eight or nine kills i used to think all right if i just get three more kills this is a game play i can hop up yeah so i wouldn't even try to go for that exactly exactly i would never risk it i'd play a bit slower enough i feel that so i was dropping 12 bombs like every game but they were consistent consistent consistent 12 it's a shame that's not a 12 bomb counter because i'd have the leading amount in the entire world you if they had yeah if they had a stat tracker for that you'd be up there just solid 12. oh don't mind if i like everyone's just a god at this game oh that that mental mate that unreal and i just suck yeah me too wait they're scrapping right here yes they are one's outside how did wait what the shot just go i believe we are looking good my aim is just horrendous i don't deserve to play this game i need to loot my kill but oh well oh i have eight heavy bullets oh god what am i doing russian over here mate i don't know what are you doing rich you're just throwing it i need my 12th bomb anglers one big thermite that's my thermometer where did the bangalore go i think she has gold do you see bangalore um did you first of bangalore i've only got two kills no i didn't i didn't there's anybody pretty sure the bangalore has gold because there was two people down here i don't know where she could have gone how did that happen oh i see her she's tuned into the corner up there how did i miss that stinky you are a toxic gamer i need the third time i should give me a hundred dollars it does wait did i get the kill oh no i didn't you better not knock down level four uh do you need any of these 84 syringes i've got three here no i dropped all of those well i drop like half of them i don't know why i'm carrying this many when i've got a lifeline drone but yeah yeah it doesn't exactly make sense but no nothing i do make sense that's why you watch the vids find out what's going on just try to create your own your own scenario my own story lines all right 15 people left if this is world's edge there'll be like 25 minimum um yeah yeah i'm not really down for olympus oh it just kind of sucks it i mean yeah it sucks only nine more kills and then i get my 12 bomb uh it's doable i'm not sharing my kills though because i also want a tour bomb yes that's a problem but it's not dying from the edge towards edge play ranked are you down with a couple arenas oh reena that's the one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i haven't have you played thermal i haven't played thermal i haven't played arenas since the 90s mate so i know ah since it was this since the last time we played or have you played after no i haven't played after that i think are you do you know okay so do you not like it at all or you just is it just kind of too much i just no it's just like it's because you have to like three stag right or yeah there's not there's not any like balanced games like i don't like getting two kills and 300 damage in a two-and-a-half minute game i agree or you're getting put up against like proteins yeah went a different way i think i'm showing your decoys how is this ended outside because they're all on me ridge hiller invite for a free kill towards my 12 bomb oh that would have been the most disrespectful thing i've ever done should have should have happened oh please i went for a big flank and i went all the way around that's the problem rich you're playing too tactical just running running there get in there do what i do look at this mate look at this have you ever seen have you ever seen anyone look like this before kind of impressive are you just hanging on the edge yeah look at me hold on let's chase [Laughter] 70. she's cracked okay these guys over here sell frozen i'm gonna go first okay this is awful i'm using a certain anima oh that's that's the combo hey that's the combo right there i'm reloading i can i can help in a sec 140 140 huge oh that wasn't you i should have hit that oh my 12 bombings on the cards man i shoot one sentinel shot and everyone's shot 14 of their magazines somebody's rising [Music] oh yeah it's like in the storm okay guys come on there's no accuracy on that yes no the 12th bomb oh you even got the other kill this is an absolute tragedy for the boys i mean i i'm using a set on ebay i deserve everything that's coming to me i mean true you're a man of culture i'm a man of i mean i'm using a hemlock no that's something not impressed i'll wait for you to use my drone mate don't worry um no i have 12 get rolled step it up oh that's my heat shield all right that's right the sentinel just sounds so menacing when it has the when it's charged i would not want oh you're dead oh they're i think they're gamers can't hit anything because i'm using iron sights you hear that there's a care package coming down so hard to hit with iron sights from back here one's a fuse hold on don't die no i'm using my bats i told you i'm using all my butts i'm just playing by the way i'm not going to use all my thoughts i've still got 12. i have 11 though oh my god we're getting help jesus cracked so 7575 no i'm stuck in here i'm stuck in here wait wait wait let me get you there's damage okay and they're gone i'm missing bad rich yes we had 11 bats sorry mate just run into the fuse fire you are the eighth sure i should have done that this is what happens when i use a sentinel like it's just not fair this gun does no damage it's so bad like do creators just have like a whole room a whole house full of just nonsense i just destroyed the back of your head if that was a person i took those bullets and put me into the enemies teammates getting he's good though are they on this right side oh yeah i'm getting cry all the way around but then it's like 50 health max popping yourself i guess i can never be bothered to pop sales i'm gonna do it holding this one i don't know how i got that down [Applause] i'm going around going around then it's just gonna be [Applause] oh i can't believe he actually just sat there in the zone i didn't think he was just gonna sit there uh don't try to play i mean that's high grain right i think i've ever played it before though it's just safer for longer than either side on my way uh yeah i'm done should we give the arm shield as well he tanks like nearly 300 damage with his arm shield this way how much damage i just did i'll start my nerves as well oh 100 i broke one back there have you seen the 35 reloading i think there's one pin down there yeah on them enemies here they almost broke our bloodhound again i'm knighting this left side so they have to move back if he's cracked give his like 60 health he ran all the way back though okay i'm trying to i'm moving up middle going far right i think they're inside again there's no way they went inside again these guys are so loud i need to buy a bat so i'm gonna have to stick with a just a wingman i've got bags so let's get running starbuck how quick i am just me get more mats yeah they're all middle recharging shield need to recharge my shields he's in the middle he's getting he's getting the uh the shields hey go down to the way recharging oh mate i just opened the door by shooting
