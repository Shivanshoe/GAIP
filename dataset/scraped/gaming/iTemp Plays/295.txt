like the angle that i was at you guys are right behind that team so your names were coming like over their heads i was just so confused i didn't know who i was shooting who i wasn't shooting it was a mess that's the worst one going the wrong way halloween low uh lower oh no i was about to calm horse source lore is that how you say hey what are you saying it's lore it's laura a loki ross i'm the worst player on the game everyone's got one health i need to farm damage on these damn guys oh my god we gotta get it together i'm trying you guys are too cracked me oh that guy's one oh the wingman shot everybody wants to steal that hill oh no oh he's fighting somebody right here oh that's the last team yes mate i'm cracked the boy how'd you get 500 damage how are you gonna ping that side of the lad on this side hello i was telling you which way i wanted to learn that's it god i should have landed on my side stand back go wait i don't even need any of this but i'm literally taking all of it and i'm going to throw it off i'm throwing everything off the edge you need an extended energy because it's gone oh i did it in front of the octane i'm getting damaged i'm just thirsty i've got no damage i haven't actually shot anyone i wonder if octane's using energy so yeah are you the champion i say yeah to be fair i checked your guys weapons before i dropped it oh they could drop it so there was a little oh wait oh my god a little havoc in a turbo in the same bin that's huge i'm gonna landing on that other odds what guns you rocking today uh have it gonna lean man that's good like that combo i don't know if he went up top yeah he's up top you can see him grab the door he did yeah he's up top i don't want my ultimate that look at that ability all right i'm not chasing i have full faith in the octane actually i'm coming he's i need to lie oh my god some awesome fences coming up supplies inbound my friend i like the bow i mean i haven't used any ages this game but still at the moment i'm just not the biggest fan oh oh oh oh down low are you off sending it the full variety of this game i like it kind of sort of got a big rope or something i do have a rope but we're probably more likely to shut off this oh yeah boy nice hey punch me i would not have liked that i tried to do the super jump and i failed oh yeah it would be nice up here ah sometimes you just gotta try it but i can do now what's no one's here yep oh i don't want to do that i want to loot nope please just let me look i've got to get ahead of you cause i'm playing immobile character and you're playing path uh i'm already extended level three i'm playing with the path team already caught up that's what i mean i just gotta get a little bit ahead so we're at the same point you know one way man's been busting lately yeah i've been popping off with a winky the wingers i'm just like actually finally using it now i don't think i never liked it before it's it's just so satisfying yeah just satisfying when you hit all your shots nothing on heartbeat contact oh that would have been a sticky mate what's going on over the battery i was just fine at the little things that came up from my ultimate i don't know why i thought i had a shotgun for a second and i just kind of full sent in trying to like peak that and it was a win-man it's a shotgun oh literally i gave my haircut where panga i don't know i don't know you've got no pings mate them they have all the gold guns a gold rampage gold piece keeper gold flat line do you see this over there that's impressive that is impressive please yes i can't zoom it in so wait he wasn't moving and you missed all of them mate i don't know the booty drop on the board like hit one no i'm gonna get there now oh no what a tragedy i hate him i don't know hurry because i'm gonna grapple in and try and creep around i know you are and you're gonna kill this one solo guy i'm not gonna be there it's gonna be so anticlimactic and you don't care i already scuffed this how much damage do you have how many kills you have nine kills fourteen hundred okay we're on the same damage this is not anticlimactic for you this is another bust of a game no i'm using this hundred percent so am i oh that's it why you never use the crate not because you're bad but because you end up missing every shot at the end and then you're like i don't even want to show anyone that happens every time nope showing it showing it oh look at it look at this right back look at this right back wait wait oh perfect perfect i know how to like angle it and everything now it's great what does that mean you know what it means you don't need to ask mine's a hashtag but what's yours dude wait how do you put a hashtag in there i just when you press enter sometimes i just fat finger it you know nice damage noob easy kills thank you i'm glad i first thought that right at the end for an extra hundred
