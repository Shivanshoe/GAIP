variants in separate games and it was a great time i think since the mastiff nerf the mozambique ironically is seriously good as a close range option hammer point harry strikes once more let me know what you guys think about the hammer point mozambique in the comments especially compared to the e-rater on the mastiff i'll leave you to enjoy the rest of the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends which film you going to mate this one this one then let's go this way yep you get there's armors in here thank you uh he's got a massive i hit him for a bunch though [Music] the only gun that could just kill me the other one and even like first you're right there too did you see how great i was wondering amazing good are you listening it's a good place to die oh yeah nice and safe in here someone's pushing am i gonna get to my box no they're in here nice dude so yeah phoenix in here if you fancy it she had a gold mozam too she was ready to hit you with the hammers oh no bro you totally would have been you didn't even give her the chance dude nope i hear people at market also uh west it's people fighting everywhere around us there's people fighting at gauntlet and beside us i think we just go gauntlet yeah i think so too though because i don't have anything recharging shields this place has been looted angelic harris is in the feed but i don't you know who ainsley harris is who is it like a famous chef it's not actually him obviously actually it could be i don't know what if it is it might be ainsley oh they're here on me coming you challenge that maniac [Music] shot i was trying to like time like where he was going to strafe to the left like back we just kept walking in a straight line like what are you doing straight my man it's a little bit [ __ ] straightforward holy moly right well they're dead yes and now we're gonna mark it yeah uh yes i'll see you there to the meat market oh yeah the meat market 10 seconds i mean i don't know when they put that sign in let's go let's go i remember the first time we saw we were flying and you're like you know this is the meat market i'm like what are you talking about wait who's firing us right here i messed up you went into the fight my friend is he inside okay that guy might report me rest in peace i just landed and i i double headshot body shot him oh god with the wing skull piercer and all poor guy i've been there on the receiving end give him the chance oh my god do you need a battery uh no i'm good thanks i have one take one you have three i'm uh i'm a huge harry potter nerd you should come over and go to harry potter world is that uh is that a thing where you live i think so yeah it's like a warner brothers i've been to platform nine three quarters is it king's cross see i don't know anything about that stuff yeah wait it's a cause like that you know platform nine three quarters yeah but they based it off like a like a real train station it's not that interesting we can just go there i'm on platform nine and three quarters really bad hey oh not this again no why would you your phone at janks leave me alone correction his teammate is firing at me his teammates really hurt what is this guy doing certainly not right oh 48 this guy had oh 48 this guy had act on the via zigg sorry i was excited oh i see some big ultimates going down oh you can't stand on this oh you can't stand on this is he forcing all your land on someone's head by the way and i almost more we killed the last member gotcha oh you ain't messing around did you see what i tried to do to them it was going to be awesome i did and then it just forced you off into i don't know how you survived they were opposite teams like the guy up top would give me in the past but weren't on the same team and i think yeah and they both shot at me my feet hit the ground and i almost died they had a treaty i'm gonna bait janks in here wait i should have picked some i've got a hundred spare that was eventful i heard explosions i heard something i think they opened they must have opened this ah that's probably what they did they opened that guaranteed be staying inside is that you oh yeah turn it away from us isn't any cracks [Music] find a whale of a time oh anthony harris no god no ainsley no not ainsley do you reckon they're this way i guess we don't really know i mean they have to be probably a repulsor if i was guessing yeah if you can't hear it incoming nearly have my ultimate nice little i got another pad here this one i fed earlier no i messed up on it there they are you got a rope yeah and nearly 93 95 56 which one which one is it this one uh somewhere on the left yeah we are all ready i think they're at the building but maybe this is the ultimate look and then yeah then we can pad somewhere on them a very burning ring flare opening close by us they're on the far side we can get up closer and we can just jump out on the meow okay we're gonna find out like the other team's close to us really yeah yeah i think so oh i didn't get the craver you murdered that bad dad nice punch man i got it but i didn't got a pk yeah yeah thanks we just absolutely just rolled this entire lobby nice job and he's still chasing me well he's nearly cracked that was trapped i saw i don't know what a psycho i'm taking that dude i'm so confused why were they still here and where where did the local where the logo went we didn't hear gunshots so they didn't run into each other this is why we need a replay mode i'd love to know where she went oh totally that would be like a massive priority if i was in charge i'd be like all right replay mode get it involved that would be awesome bro imagine how good our videos would be too you know how we did that dual perspective video yeah you could do every time you could do it every time and it would be like no extra effort on anybody just like you just do it yeah i used to do so much in four nights and i'd have like a picture in picture and i'd show it from both perspectives or i'd have the camera on the outside so you can keep track of where each of us were that makes sense yeah that would be so good oh my god i hate you i'm helping my shields i'm safe i died come on trade race that was my fault by the way i stuck it because i hit him a lot the player was not expecting him to do and he just finished me i think he's surviving no he's not [Music] nice good job dude oh my god that was the first one i hate horizon it's going massively in massively in handy i was gonna say that make any sense what does that mean i saw i saw somebody at cage let's go push that though but just expect to be pushed in the back yes cracked back flies nice he bubbled way too early this might be their portal are they beneath me wow oh you do no no no no 10 seconds the ring is fairly close right this guy is like the world's best player [Music] good job mate thank you actually i'm taking my rep back high five bats oh man not easy who was that guy with the r3 i think it's the bangle right i don't know he lasered me though in the back we're getting pinched by the actual ring and the ring the fake ring oh that was kind of sick yo the movement holy moly the momentum we're still going it's not over yet holy moly we're still quiet and rich celebrate good times oh i hit a barrel scam do put that there what kind of game design is this who put that barrel there i know did they not know that you were gonna pull off such an incredible movement maneuver we got a double package here rich oh one h which one you want uh the back one here are you sure we can still trade we can still trade if it's a crab which yours anyway no no no i don't use the craving oh big value we've got a med kit here i got a peacekeeper the other team already died i think they were fine was it west uh it was definitely a capacitor i have to come out of there i didn't actually i didn't actually hear it but it's got to be in that direction somewhere oh i'm between them oh here we go how did you pull that one out that's actually a sick rat spot hey look can we go dude that's actually a really good rad spot the best rat spot i ever found is when i put so far in a pipe oh i remember that when you're you're playing with were you playing with ali or [ __ ] he was on the tour on the back first 10 seconds i drove him into a bike never tried it that was that was funny that would be a way to pull this off bro i don't know how i sandwich myself in here i don't know oh they're this way making contact with the enemy look at the obtaining nice is that what you were screaming is that what this screaming was happening i was gonna hit the rope but you can't hit the rope i guess oh yeah you can't you can't i've tried that so many times right off the map gg my friend nice little clutch at the start for you as well
