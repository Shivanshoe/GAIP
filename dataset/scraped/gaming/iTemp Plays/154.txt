hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and it is that time of the season where we start getting teasers trailers blog posts announcements the whole lot for the upcoming season season 12 is called defiance and the new legend is called mad maggie now you may remember mad maggie from her time as an announcer where she insulted many people by comparing them to her eight-year-old mum or something it was a while ago i can't remember now the in-game teasers that you've heard on storm point was her ship getting shot down in the stories from the outlands trailer that you're watching in the background here she's captured placed in front of a judge and a jury and sentenced to death right when they are about to shoot mad maggie one of the higher ups decides that her punishment should be to fight in the apex game so there you go that is her introduction that is her entrance into apex legends she does seem like a bit of a lunatic if i'm honest but then again she's called mad maggie so it makes sense i suppose now on ea's blog post for apex legends there is also an announcement for a new limited time mode called control which is a 99 experience which sounds so hectic there are infinite respawns and you are fighting over control points pretty much like domination and this sounds so fun it's what the community has been asking for for such a long time now this will help new players a lot as they can warm up with any of the new guns they are unfamiliar with and it will be a breath of fresh air to the veteran players looking for something new on apex now i'm really excited for this mode and i think it'll be the best limited time mode that apex have ever released and this is scheduled for the first three weeks of season 12. now on this website they are also teasing some new map updates to a link purse which is a map we haven't seen in quite a while so i'm also excited about that now there are more trailers coming soon with more details one of them is coming on the 27th and i'll be covering them on the channel here so make sure you are subscribed to not miss out thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all with some i'll gameplay it not bad rampage as well now i'm not gonna use the rampage i'll use the hemlock hemlock car i'm not using the car hemlock vault that sucks it does sorry it does hey don't get mad it's not my fault the gun is not fun i see a blue and a lot of energy might be on the top of my head though it won't land here it's unlooted well i'll be on my own it's because they're all scrapping over this way instead you know i'm about to take this big man because i don't have anything i have any attachments squad hardly a challenge i do feel bad for that the champion fell not a lot to be honest i got two kills and 40 damage a lot of people died on this way would you believe i can't believe your opinions was unlooted stream was unlooted we didn't even really look through there to be honest okay get rid of some heavy one my dude but there was a big scrap it's over moving here i mean we could halt up top i have no attachments i have nothing though god i felt i didn't mean to fall another squad is on us we have 30 seconds prepare recharging shields come on are depleted are they still fighting over there they are i try and get their banners though security got 30 seconds recharging shields oh man i didn't rest my team was so far behind are we loaded no hello i have the banner we must correct their failure i secured the banner charging shields what am i supposed to do here man this is ludicrous half of the squads are gone recharging shields enemy here meet me here an entire squad gone how pitiful i need them to fight before i respond to be honest with you and we all have to go this is a bit of a problem this is a bit of a problem it's just too much i've got nothing healing man replicator incoming this is a full team i can't do anything there i'm sorry i can't get you i've only got two syringes i'll just die in the zone i don't know what he's saying but i hope he's not flaming i couldn't even get to the the respawn beacon i got chased into stream the building i wish this uh tower was still here i could alter to the tower five seconds to close the distance i wish i had a need as well and they'd right now be clutch that's another team down i'm probably gonna die but who cares i crushed the entire squad he was the last one i need to go i might if i need to i just need some stuff oh this guy had a shield ah well at least i've griefed those teams i have five bats 20 cells probably don't need this many cells oh there are people here is there are people going that way full team landing on each other that's the door in this place found it well fortunately i got some decent stuff i guess oh that was a i thought it was a vault i thought the same lock was a vault uh it's not too bad don't let them slip away we're already in the next target acquired here abandoned nice careful enemy recharging shields this fight isn't over get out i didn't realize like for some reason during that good fight i've tried to armor switch from full blue i thought i popped a syringe before and not a third shield cell so i thought i had two shields and more health i'm an idiot he's what i'm trying to tell you recharging i want to vault so bad so gosh darn bad flat white oh three times though the whole time i feel like she switched to that like this was online flatline an excellent selection i need help just one serene joke would work energy ammo here okay my ultimate is pervolt here hmm like we just surprised each other let's get his help to him but this is some incredible cover i'm getting shot team it's a different team cleared and the true test begins okay oh god please that hurts a lot right grenade how much you got 17. dropped a little bit energy ammo i'll just use the hemlock mainly i'll eventually find a decent hold on wow heavy ammo here good grief i have 300 bullets for this slightly unnecessary i'm going to take that anyway all right seven kills not too bad a lot of people dying here i'm gonna try and keep a lot of heavy because i can just spray this of range in single fly mode try and farm some damage i have seven like these guys got 10 kills now hold on a second who is this man i could use that i'm not happy about it they are all dying over here guys i hate this place i hate it give me oh my god she got double hundred naded i think someone's closer oh god apparently gonna oh on this team i guess oh my gosh this is so awkward i don't know which way to go cutting the base here let's go and join help all right he's one we needed to try and push someone i think you were i think you're right i should have ash altered all three of us up there that's my thought really gg though dude guys you
