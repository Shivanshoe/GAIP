hey wassup guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some of ATX legends of course and we are here in season 4 and I finally got to use the devotion now some of you may remember the days of me always picking up the devotion it was season zero we were season 1 and I was just melting full teams with these good I've always thought it was one of the best weapons in the game in season 2 however respawn introduced extended energy bags and it was a little bit of a nerf to the early game devotion because it came with a reduced magazine size until you found those extended mags so now you are left with a gun that didn't have a turbo charger early game because often you know you'll just find either the turbo charger or the devotion never never both at the same time and also it has a reduced magazine and toy find extended now a short while ago respawn removed the extended energy mags and now in season 4 they also removed the turbo charger from the game and it would appear as though the devotion is no longer that good think again my friends the devotion is back it's now a care package only weapon it has the magazine size of 54 which is 10 more than it had when they removed the extended energy mags a few weeks ago and it has the turbo charger functionality built in it is the best gun in the game I'm gonna go ahead and say ok put my neck on the line here if you pick up this gun and you don't win the game of your playing you can invoice me 10 pounds PayPal because you will win the game it's that good please don't do that I take that back unfortunately because it's a care package weapon I found it fairly late and again that you're about to watch but I still got a fair few killed early I had a load of Actuaries weapon and I hope you enjoyed the video if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the art Empire and I'll see you one in five and a half seconds my friends screwie delta T it is my friends this my new favorite place Island i scratch lassitude is the train station horse I've always thought this place has some pretty decent looks and it's fairly easy to navigate the Sun is in here we think that's not good any charge rifle Gibraltar with Blue Shield's versus half robot half man with a charged rifle I need a baby good this looks unlooted 3:7 nice teammates down one so get rid of this altogether I don't I don't like the charge rifle near friend Simeon he was not weak at all good grief I was you collecting to go in that corner and I thought this guy was gonna be fairly weak but he still pretty much had all his shields left I swear I switched the armors either I hit my head that L star is actually mental showing up my for my tea mr. K yeah he's attaining teammates there's another one that's the same guy don't go away have that l star man half man half L star alright I'll take that I thought I was going to start spawning with just a charged rifle when you can hear so many people around you is pre intimidating say the least but we survived we did it I'm not sure if sounds the actual first thing that we saw though Oh God concussion I see my so close on any need to add them to the cover here I think I hello friend he's looking at me I'm gonna finish this kelp and just take his on that and I can come back this should be one more something she doesn't that's next on iCarly now is one stone good job team this is this is the most mad people I've seen at scraps OCC in season four this place has been pretty dead recently I'm totally friends couple shields shields octoscope Apple I think I could have paid that better the plan was just to let my team I had really good health like she had purple shields and stuff for that one v1 so the plan is to just try and keep the crypto away then the crypto he was dodging all my bullets he got friends a medkit free to get he was dodging all my bullets I was gonna the plan was to melt him but I miss most my shots so do you really work out that way but listening I'm likening the heavy in the extended mags department so I've only got a level 1 extended line mag and that's it I think Rhys footstep we have a definite increase footstep audio resigned the patch notes hey I'm Gary hooker fees London eight shots tonight okay you don't want at least let's go get messy I've never seen so many people here trying to stick with my team I guess what am i doing I got my teammate I mean I guess that if I could have looted it quicker would it make sense I'm making a lot of weird decisions here and it's all working it's definitely working out I have a kills we have our teammates banner there's a respawn we cannot in this way this way I got my Ultima so you can get back to the looters bomb this has been so messy here scruffles it's in my word it's making like it this place actually I've landed here so so much today and it's been dead Nick oh not one person I mean what team have loots the entirety of scraps we'll see see and now all of a sudden every team's here wait and also at the Tower Suite as well to : I sometimes I can't aim you don't know why famous this definitely feels different that's another team good grace two of them I mess my grappler look I'll specify over the top please don't shoot me thank you hey sorry friends think he's just trying to get some loot and he got ambushed by this full team another full team that 11 kills now not to you that's the most I've had in season four and there's still 14 people left this isn't looking too bad there are so many death threats over there it's okay my team I can get a bunch of look back there should be happy days here I mean hopefully this means that we've taken our mostly aggressive players bats that mave that may have been grapple the century that was tremendous I'm a bit shots from that it wasn't a distance it wasn't the speed it was that it was the finesse I collided up top that was beautiful that might be that might be a 12 out of 10 I'll say got your teammate we need to get back over to the loot I've messed up ah teammate dropped down as well I let him down there we could have got back to the loop real fast I mean I saw okay Tommy now find it me skate transpose let me go extended Bank blue-purple the upgrades are unreal probably even though that to do this you every time every time I do this I tell you if I get crave it good no Craver okay it's Trainyard that's good for me because I'm a pathfinder I'm sure there should be some purple arm around here for you friend if I got Cray but then never again never what I've touched there ever again any of them got some purple for you I mean I'm blowing shield see I have one shield battery and I've got four shield cells I shouldn't be asking really kiss guys literally just came back and he's purple arm is here as well no no no you use that friend I'm sorry I shouldn't be asking this tree keep is only two of the spots left this way so we need to get ourselves to train yard work and that's what the scraps gonna be now we've completely cleared out scraps or city that was like a white that was like a tower defense game right there that just kept coming in waves all right now pull this up for a second time I mean that wasn't quite as good as the first one but it was still quite it was still quite a beautiful grapple I'd rate that 11 out of 10 okay package load in the distance it's actually not that far away I've been looking for a devotion all day because they buffed it they increase the magazine size and I've checked seven 8k packages perhaps I haven't found one yet I'm not sure if it spawns later in the game or earlier in the game because I know that the crab in the Mastiff it depends on how you shoot someone anyway that should be fine then I keep all the other ones I'm using this as bait they're not be hiding your battery exceed sniper buddies a devotion it's beautiful it comes with the two-time site okay that's not that bad feast before bullets in a magazine my friends me amigos means I can pick up some throw balls too I need to get a bit closer I've got chills too so it's pretty healed up already I'm not gonna be a lunatic I'm not gonna drop down he's in the opposite one yeah come up oh my god this is the melt machine someone else wants to go where my crap will go I've got a grapple to the other side look at the faithful not - that's not even a rape I've done him with the righties beneath this bridge my teammates coming in he hasn't come out you decide you see some way it's a fact don't know if I've just blocked that with pre-emptive timing or he's just mixed and it's get out teammate I need to get him bit he's fine up him to sulphurous he's downed one of them natima Timmy Timmy Timmy go help you help him I'm good but I'm using now I'm never using I don't if I've ever heard that voice line before I guess I found with you that same way it's been absolutely shredded these guns too good it should be pretty weak I should have just hit fight in the air I don't like your fight you good huh the other gone back then sounds like it oh my team are we saying contact I thought there was another one coin range I think they just wanted to revive the devotions too good the devotions way too good no wonder it's a care package weapon good great champions good game scratch that's fun how many kills the end of week 22 squad kills 15 not bad not bad at all 2700 damaged Wraith probably deserved a few more than four let's be real but three revives to respawns 15 kills and I think till I get don't get three kills the devotion I think three kills and a kill zone are those shadows as well that good I'm gonna go and say is the best girl in the game if you see they're in a care package picking it up oh you're throwing pretty cool thanks scratch wait did he say what did you say I was disconnected anyway thank you for watching team I do appreciate it and I'll
