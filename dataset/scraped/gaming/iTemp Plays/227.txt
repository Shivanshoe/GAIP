hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i'm showing you what is my favorite game of apex that i've played in a long long time any game where you come back from massive adversity is just so satisfying make sure you guys are also taking advantage of my g fuel code being 30 off right now it is a huge saving for you guys i personally highly recommend the hydration line which is sugar free and caffeine free bristle has all the good vitamins and electrolytes in there just use code item at checkout link in the description so thank you for watching i do appreciate it see you all in five and a half seconds my friends is there another team coming to broken no they're going to the lava i always get baited by the mirages every time i don't like the eave right i don't like it at all wait that's fine he got purple darn it should have fallen down all right if i can find a prowler with a blue purple mag at the side of the game i'll be laughing carson carson g works too goodbye erase all right let's apply some people let's mess them up nice oh god he's there my mistake he was still there heavy and light heavy light perfect could have done with that shield back but that's okay probably needed to and it wasn't my kill i mean i could switch this to light i've got so many but i'm going to use up the heavy first that's something i'm bad with with the car i did the other day you guys are furious and rightfully so i thought this was my r1 i've got no barrel stabilizers on it backpack here level two hey over here team we get involved i pretty dead for that listen to my heart my friend why do i feel like such a big noob at the moment i don't know it's over here you know i'll do cars on light now don't have to worry about the heavy stuff i got the mag on there just a reminder i literally can't ping the right choices i need light ammo care package incoming i can figure out what the ping pong was on on mouse and keyboard but they found it recharging how many first was that like 12 bursts grenade that's preset for that there's another squad attacking that's not good for anyone not on the roof are we on yes retouching you're there what am i supposed to do what am i supposed to do position revealed by ash oh my god i've just got a run or something there's a mob one in the crafter maybe bait them closer and appear behind the shield perhaps 30 seconds to get in the ring not chasing it's 50. well there's no chase and i think that's okay i can just go all the way around pretty much wait i have no health i can't go that way if i had a med kit this would be far easier but i do not i there's one of the team i need to draw them in a little bit god please stop doing that that is really annoying you know yeah thank you this kind of sucks uh there's a respawn down here that i need to try and use but it's very very telegraphed another crafting mobile run i'm recharging my shoes now what to create i'm out of life i can't cancel i can't cancel i'm dead 45 seconds but i'm close see that did you see that grenade did you see that grenade when i heard though coming over absolutely just crazy crazy maneuvers can i pop this respawn probably 20 seconds can he get safe i don't know if he can i've got to try i've got to try i can't believe i killed that squad but i had no ammo this has been a complete mess what a mess of a game i don't know if he can get safe i feel like this zone's going to move quick they're probably going to be waiting for us but what story he's been so far can we get the job done come save the day he's dropped he's safe he's probably okay i'm gonna drop him some stuff i don't know what uh some of these i can't even ping it what's the ping button on this oh what's the ping button on there you go found it energy i've got zero energy what else you're using just energy i can't even think that they're here that goes for health he's literally four health i'm choking i'm nervous easy easy game easy life easy game easy life nice jj my teammate i think he had like 20 bullets with an l star but he was just the perfect distraction he did a little bit of damage he got them to focus him a little bit and then and then i ran in and i finished the job what a game that was so fun that was so fun i can't ping and i have to literally reach up to my keyboard to press my ultimate which nearly got me killed but we got the job done nice thanks thanks for being patient oh he's left and plus i said patient gg huge
