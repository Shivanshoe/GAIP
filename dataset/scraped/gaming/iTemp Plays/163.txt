hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are back in ranked mode which i have been neglecting as of late haven't played ranked in a few weeks but i realized after many comments that i got in the last few videos saying that what happened to the rank videos i still remembered about it again and i remember that i'd actually played a decent amount and made some good progress but there is still a long way to go and that is what we are doing today we are getting the job done so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right we are i was gonna say looted but not really we've got two blues and a white i've got a fully white attachment after one but look at this bad boy hey got the mastiff in the back pocket with the purple a shotgun bolts and someone did just get respawned over here i'm only carrying two arc stars as a fuse but i finally got a level one bag and it's just i had loads before but i had no ammo i guess i could have dropped the mastiff shotgun shells that would have been smarter i think oh well i have a 90. that's not too bad not a lifeline package is that just in the open anyways that's what it was i i don't know what i thought it was i'm scared of getting flanked too much i don't get third parted after all that looting could just be too sad all right we think there are people this way we could just go safe especially because there are 30 people left last team probably two times slow sometimes killed that joke he's looking for his throw balls uh we don't want to let this team flank us like there were there were two people running away right this is my first game of the day just yet look it's happened as expected why did no one else see this coming there's a right down here too one minute in the ring spitting down the team reload beforehand there was i'm gonna try and get teammate we got two of them on your feet mate there we go kill credit i'm hoping one of them just had gold that might have been a different team though but she can't rings leave hustle up [Music] i'm just gonna zoom i'm just gonna get out of here i don't have a mobile do i know i have heat shield it's not in the craft is it no it's not that would have been pretty nice you do need to go it's a pretty long way and it'll be the third ring here in a second uh where's the best respawn honestly maybe even fragment we got two left here in fragments oh she's respawning over there okay that's probably smart that's well played from the from the gang it helps a little bit i don't want to go in again because then i'll have to ah i'd have to use a second syringe i probably won't though i'm going to keep on uh hold of it it's my set it's my own lisa range guys i've got one syringe one and med guitar that was really smart by the uh by the bangalore though i suppose there was so much loot there i get scared in the zone especially in ranked when there's 30 people left people just heard the world's biggest scrap just inside the zone i just thought you know if we get gate kept but at least now ray's got a good amount of loot because there's so many death boxes there it's a big scrap appear too an enemy nearby angle or ultimate there was a care package here which is kind of scary looking for syringes could have used lower broads can't be bothered i got my ultimate here this might be [Applause] actually do so much damage if you don't if it's been on the ground which i didn't realize hello friends i just want the kill to be honest oh my god let me up where did the off thing go there we go nice and there's people scrapping up this way too i want to have a little cheeky bake that's what i love fuse you know they're all in there ultimate did so much damage on the way i was going to help teammates instead get a little bit too anxiety rob these guys i guess they just went over this way to fight instead which makes no sense hello is she zooming down the hill i think i think it's the down bangalore but sometimes they just zoom okay never mind these are the last two teams i never mind never mind it wasn't anyone's game that way i think we just get safe let's go here we don't need to take this angle it's just horrendous fighting at the bottom of that i don't know what you call it chasm oh that's the solo i think it's a celebrate that triple take just listening to world war three going on could use a third race one beacon i think that's all missing in this game well good news is right that has to push me don't mind she died let's have another one leader out there what a go-getter i have to push us any more no what about you oh that's sad i gotta kill let me put down anyone oh he bounced back and then he killed me oh my god oh my word imagine if i was the last guy he bounced off his knockdown shield and stuck to me and killed me imagine imagine the scenes leader all right twist squad a rank twin is a ranked win oh my god this has been an absolute disaster are you good i'm fine i'm not training already okay so you ever think i'm nervous you know ah i said i saw you over there and i got nervous i know what you're like why are you nervous you know i won't be only one you've been getting things all day you've been getting beamed all day okay how much damage did you have last game four only four damage impossible not possible you hit it you you're using a longboard you had to give you an island it's not enough it's not your teammates going down either one attention huh what's going on oh what's up all right let's go uh let's go kill him kill leader better you better do something good uh good this match otherwise it's gonna look really bad on you i'm gonna pop off i've got shot caps no i've got i need both those things that she just thinks but it is on my weaponry are you good mate no worries i don't need one see so i can do this ready hold on bam i missed the bat mist again no no he's running flat i think it's a horizon i think some ultimate's ready on my mark um see anybody over here they were mate i don't know where they're at now oh they whether this by some way i think they're in their left side they were here somewhere do they trade surely not shield battery here they just disappeared yeah where did they go i think they traded faking him out with a decoy i'm miles away baby they just scanned me so they think it's just me uh bloodhound has gold and are here for 90. he's outside he's outside i think he's outside now they kept running back they could bring him back she smoked him off so i can't see right with a decoy nice i don't know who would have thrown the alkstar i don't see anybody but probably right i don't think he was just throwing the ark star so i'm actually curious what it would be like if no one like no videos are posted and we just went in clueless like not knowing anything other than patrick's it'd be great it'd be so good that's how it was early days early days yeah even if someone posts videos it's like the leaks are just so bad on twitter and stuff everyone knows everything before it comes out yep heads up got one here i say i hate the way it works i missed simon just hopping on later you only have like the trade i don't even like the trailers just let me hop on and see who's new great that'd be so cool i guess like the story and stuff we're inside the ring what's she doing got him it's pretty good right that's pretty good he tried really hard yeah you got to put some effort into your impressions you know i'm not an impression guy you're the impression guy i'm calling myself an impression guy i do a few memes well kind of an impression guy you take it really seriously and it's kind of cringe whoa i'm not cringe i'm just doing an impression of someone's cringe that doesn't make me cringe no why would i shoot the guy standing still i had i had like eight seconds i decided to shoot and i was like shoot the giveaway uh team rotating over here they're gonna be coming towards us they actually have to target over there you guys got the range so some stuff i wish i could do an impression of someone that could land a shot giving my shield to recharge i landed three shots i just wanted to say that i just did 90 damage with my vault i did more damage come on are they still behind that yeah they're running back there i don't know where they're gonna go i think they have about behind his back i shot one of them are you grappling teams are here they're close broke that first oh god he's still still to do it so i'll show him i can't do anything opening fire on the enemy right here i need 10 damage for red yeah this is like it's such a difficult spot because everyone just see you as well yeah and everybody kind of agrees with you yeah take a little take a little cheeky peek like a cheeky peak sending out my decoy don't be crypto are they all right i'm testing my luck i'm coming back giving my shields of recharge give me four cells i can't really see these guys without getting shot with the team these teams are gonna have like an unspoken agreement to only shoot us i'll be fuming okay that was interesting oh my god that even trying to do the team with you that's like it tries to use it he's my last bat oh my god i'm to die to it jeez oh god i'm doing so much damage watch out this is doing something this is this is a mess right here [Music] [Applause] i'll pick a yes bit speaking out there and bamboozle take a look at peak no trick it's then crack on that guy i have one kp i have two i have a thousand damage and two kills yeah fourteen hundred and one kills come on i need a kill okay oh come on i better get this kill please over 42 as well oh dude he's zooming yes nice okay that's my last recharge 142 on crypto um i have four sides i can i can't i can't take this 30 seconds was confusing you flew past our head did we just drop down below like beneath us we're gonna have to drop no self is we don't want to go that way then right i mean both ways up all teams team on the left is like struggling now [Music] he's cracked he's really weak it was a fun game you are the apex champions she was a bit of a rambo too that's why we won fit in perfectly not always i got four kb i'm five i got five players one more i'm ditching you i'm gonna go play with uh paragon no okay
