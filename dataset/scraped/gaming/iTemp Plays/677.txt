hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today is of course the season six launch day here on apex and we get to see a new legend a new weapon a new crafting system a new battle pass there are new areas on the map and there are some more things as well but today we are playing caustic because we had a ramp that's already chosen on the team but we did find the vault early on which is the new energy sub machine gun it's hopefully going to replace the r99 as the flawless smg that you want to keep an eye out for it took a while to get enough bullets to use it as much as i wanted to but crafting definitely helped solve that problem as well uh just a disclaimer here i played a pretty bad this game i always get so on edge when a new season drops i get tunnel visions all that sort of stuff but uh we started playing better towards the end of the game and we went with a good amount of kills and it's seven o'clock in the morning where i am and i've had three hours of sleep so that is my excuse anyway if you're new around here please consider subscribing to the channel we are well on the way to one million subscribers which would be incredible but yes thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh that's not good deployed someone's got a vault i'm familiar with it my myself yet unfortunately i can try oh you can't climb up that way they did jump down i defeated they were going to you are fortunate they'll do me an unbelievable outplay we've caught it there that's why you're playing it's just those unbelievable moments that's the wrong way game let me up i don't know which i don't even know where this guy went i don't even know which course of gas he died to because he wasn't this one and i can't even remember this guy's taking the loot because i literally did nothing coming up as quick as i can i don't know who you're firing at people fine further north i need a site i want that vault so bad get him team i can't climb this please i'm so unathletic recently i'm literally getting so heated i need energy ammo this has been such a weird game it was a tough that's not good i got gonna revive he did get a revive no he didn't got my kill as if you're gonna be able to see me from there with a devotion we might hear once or twice but once the recoil kicks in you'd be i'll be struggling i mean i have medkits here but i can't i think i can even get to them this is good i got my controller i am playing so unbelievably bad so unbelievably bad i'm then going my controller i appreciate it hopefully this guy's in health there's a guy right down low might as well just shield bass i mean if i can get inside i'm laughing he just killed this person too in my defense i've literally had three hours sleep and it's like seven o'clock in the morning like don't don't judge please don't judge do my teammates need anything i'm not entirely sure they do i think they're actually okay especially the kills you just got how do i have four kills i do not deserve this many this guy's weak whatever you say target spotted last guy i don't know if i can make it to him this one has no recall i just left shields there but i don't think you can actually get to them annoyingly we're kind of split here i'm just going to try and stand my ground i think probably the best thing for me to do i think they know kind of i mean you don't get many bullets in this vault though it's got no recall but you definitely have to land your shots it's time to feel a little bit better should have had some warm-ups before this new season oh i think that's one of the original people at the respawn beacon that must be one of those guys because the octane had to run off because he had nothing i do not deserve to be killed either i am honestly i'm playing so bad i feel like i've been a really bad teammate too my teammates have needed stuff and i've just been stuck trying to i don't know get kills and i've been preoccupied destroyed i think two of them are cracked nice guys running right now that's not what i wanted to do did you see that teleport turbo charger which means he had energy which unfortunately has been eaten up yeah i need i need to just use this vault close range because i do not have the necessary bullet capacity here to use it at the the ranges i would like to try and use it because it's got no recoil it's actually kind of crazy this gun should i try and craft something how many crafting things do i have i'm gonna try and craft something maybe i can get some ammo or something i know how it works let's give it a go oh i just connected it i suspect we will find something here okay what does this do then oh there's a crashing over near them okay i'm just collecting it okay i see i see collect another 25 i have 50 what i'm poor he's crafting something let me check if you can craft ammo that's what i'm in desperate need off here i've way too many shields let me on uh weapon fit energy ammo craft you have 40. okay what can they steal this they're going to be able to steal it come on energy nice only 20. but it's worth it replicate i'm going to go like this hold on i'm going to keep doing it why did it cancel my other one no he didn't there we go boys were crafting look at this i got loads of bullets now all right the good thing about having sheila on your team like i can't placer shields in it wait are we getting shot don't fault me my teammates are like bunkered up a little bit so i'm going to try and play a little bit safe that's a big all coming down i believe basics can't even see what's going on now someone's weak i'll be honest i thought it was a draw ultimate i have no idea what he was if he wasn't a drab not a clue these guys are on their ropes though yeah they're getting out of there it does have a little bit recall here as well i'm gonna try and stick with my team no no need to try and throw this game you know my bad well she's real weak okay take this stuff i guess i should have told him that she's cracked but i i don't know what my push at all point is and she's definitely healed by now they come back through i'm gonna leave that for them i keep forgetting i'm actually caustic i have a lot of stuff going on in my head i don't want to enter this when we know there are people around try and get back to his teammates gratitude is acknowledged get their banners i would assume my teammates are doing really well here three squads left we've gave the vote a good go considering we have struggled to find ammunition for it i've been trying to reserve it for like the close range stuff only one minute ring's pretty close i'm not sure how people will i'm not sure they'll prefer it to the i-99 but at least the r99 is still in the game i'm happy the r99 is in the care package by the way i'm glad that we're gonna have a little bit of a change in meta okay two squats left and we've just decimated one of them that race is still alive somewhere i think two devos okay they got a respawn on i can barely see it's extremely foggy that team's respawning as a team right on us nice any energy yes yeah 200. should be okay push me i'm going to chill like this this is perfect this is good my teammates are covering [Music] i know there's a purple extended in where are they they ran off i'm here with your friend i hear you oh my god did you just see him he's got a gold knockdown record he did oh my word good game boys nice i played like a noob i play like a noob i forgot i was caustic for half that game but fortunately we found a vault we managed to balance the ammo a little bit we even crafted some new ammo for ourselves oh i couldn't have been doing too bad you know 1700 damage it's not too bad especially because i saw some pretty high leveled oh he's inviting me friend i'm gonna edit this nicka q gaming i appreciate it it was a good game i think we worked really well as a team apart from me because i wasn't that good of a teammate i kept forgetting that i should drop stuff anyway i'm ranting thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one [Music] bye
