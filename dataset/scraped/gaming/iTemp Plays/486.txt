hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the final unlock in season eight of apex legends the white reactive longbow skin called a blinding light i've been trying to get a decent gameplay with the longbow but the problem is at the moment public games are wild every gunfight takes place 10 feet in front of you and the games are done by nine minutes so i went into ranked and the fights there were far far better for this weapon there's a bit of distance to them people have far more discipline when it comes to rushing and i finally got to put this gun through its paces and i've got a ton of kills with it hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends vibes don't come oh there's a blue over here on me oh my gosh there oh no it's coming to the other side i don't want to be here okay i'm coming on come here give me one sec you're gonna have to move in my speech thank you i've got a wingman and a score piece there so does that mean i have to use it first um i think so that's the problem i just can't you just can't no i mean you can though may not do it well but it's okay no kill leader that's it i must confess is he okay uh yeah probably this flat one is so tempting all right here's the sniper tower okay give me a second that's the most stacked long way you've ever seen i just saw this trailer oh yeah oh they smoked tomorrow am i near them okay she keeps smoking everyone out but like i hit this guy from 96 and she smokes it but i guess she didn't know that okay we're good nice work everyone um i'm gonna look for more reliable secondary what are you using massive longbow so i feel like my second gun should be like an r9 here we go green now what do you think i have what did it even do um right here he had some stuff for your lambo he didn't like no he didn't you're just stacked out of your mouth fully stacked wasted my time okay oh well all right nice good start fantastic i've got two kills of my longboat it's already on fire landed a head shot from 96. i mean that's the dream right uh absolutely if there was people here that even better had to buy the um i saw a care package flying over here but i have no clue where it went it's not on the map anymore it might have been a lifeline oh yeah i had way there's oh wait there's a give the old hold on everyone i didn't know that was coming in oh all right sorry maybe you led it to me you led it to me with you soon the stones come in as well just be careful not with you guys at all it revolted mate team's here eyes are in the same hand 27 headshot okay not again come on that might be their teammate just trying to get battery i think so it's positive i'm gonna go back to the same team over here evo shield here level three wow i should take that what am i doing what do i need syringes i'll try and get up top so they don't hold this out oh can't i can't see the accident i'm dead you're fine no no no i have no syringes i think i'm okay i think you're okay you're okay okay that was a mess are you bad at kingroot i don't know so i left you alone because i was providing the teammate because there were boxes right there so i thought you know i guess it worked out he's up there i see him on the on the door that door is he down already i can help if you fall back if you need i'm fine that's right but they have to jump off in a second but i'm a corsicson fan scenic and if you ever had on the outside you can just climb up nice and one okay nice there's another team that i shine this way too okay yeah we gotta we gotta move it went like right through the hole i am scrapping what's this a contraption i can see in the distance there's something here oh my god that looks awful never mind riding over here oh do the team's pushing too careful not with you engaging there we go yeah i walked up uh hughes was resin while lifeline was standing in the corner oh nice yeah yeah team called nation where is this crater i'm going to add crab with my longer 65 cracked one shot dead that's not a head shot i'm missing i'm missing i'm missing i'm missing an actual mystery i see anyone on diving board which is very surprising kind of interesting right oh uh where i just killed that one yeah nice um wait are you telling me that i don't wait so i can't recharge you okay so i'll just waste my ultimate nice that's two out of two then okay big value racing stop doing i'm trying to snipe them i got two of them oh she definitely does she's popping off with it it's never good for your team if they don't have it oh i got one now so i'm showing i need a four to ten times that's what i need comment really um yeah i was kind of confused but i understand what you're trying to do now did you know that you can't like use it and recharging did you know that um yeah i think i knew that about caustic i think it takes for it has to like go away right yeah i mean it makes sense i'm glad otherwise you'd sit on charge towers and double imagine that virgin terrified one ultimate thrown through a fence and another ultimate i've thrown at a care package but no one was taking fire evaluation absolutely hold on mate careful with that one maybe it was like a you when you read it you're saying it about them kind of thing you know yeah i guess so um these guys are just big chill and hide yeah they have double smds so i'm not very useful as soon as you get shot at you just retreat there uneven hit a shot and he's just out there what's going on here it's like a game of whack-a-mole what's going on here oh my god there was no okay once positioned me i'm not wasted how does that mean don't know it's an actual mystery how does none of that hit yes i deserve that one us there's one squad left and they needed us so i don't know did they go that's the question they're in this way make the longbow that's the longbow game i'll be trying to get that's the game you're here you're kind of firemen that was fun who are they didn't have a single good ultimate it's not about caustic gg did i deserve 14 kills when you look at the damage counters no maybe not okay all right all right rich come on what is what is happening here what is really happening here i can't farm damage when i'm double head shine people they're just dead it's not my fault yes when you're here for 105 105 they're just dead there's no farming i can't first from that range either it's tough
