hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing revenant with janks on apps which is a deadly combination but we ran across someone who i'm 99 sure was cheating they weren't aim botting or wall hacking but they almost certainly using a macro or third-party piece of equipment to turn their single fire into fully automatic now i'm at the end of these same accusations all the time i have a pretty fast trigger finger but this guy was emptying his mag almost instantly it was mental thank you for watching guys i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends three versus 57 that'd be it'd be so cool i'll go mark if you're going broken okay stephanie team here didn't get a gun i'm gonna come help you in one second reloading welcome to you need a weapon any guns here uh yeah some not a lot if i'm being honest with you nice not the easy start i landed in the middle you know the two little like little alcoves here no weapons unlucky dude you know what drives me nuts is this stupid camo isn't your camo oh it's so annoying well i have no heavy i have to have oh no love is one

only have a car and a pk i have a 30 30 online i got to get kind of close here dude this single fire thing is ridiculous half with a coal stake hey i was actually cheating for teammate i've never tried so hard in my entire life like which i like i tried less at uni in my final exams zero cabbage dude did you just say zero cabbage no cabbages involved me jesus if you thought there was a cabbage involved you were sorely mistaken i have no big kales i have 24 cells wait i'm gonna need some cells you go you go thank you i need to pop some of the shoes we need to go like now we had three left yeah we need to leave mate because he takes going to the second round here i've no have one med kit yeah me too one make it extreme their boxes let's go let's go seoul bro it's crazy you actually gotta like try try what are your stats looking like i've eight kills and not kill leaders so i have eight kills in two thousand damage i have eight kills in 1996 i need it let's go mate i wish i had long range dude this whole time i'm running a car do you know how hard this is to cause some costs why are you using that hard to use did you lose a bet or something or no beggars can't be choosers man this is what i landed on you can switch out you know i don't know i've never really had an opportunity to do it it's just kind of like fighting in my defense i didn't even land on a gun in this game there was a couple times where i was going to swap to an r9 but then there was no light ammo in the box so i just checked the car i've got um 130 now i've got it two times on it if you've done it two times oh my oh my car yeah are you drinking no but it should be after playing this christmas yeah no no no not because you're playing apex because it's christmas cause it's christmas level three oh my god i just found a battery oh nice wait that's a crafty but it's gonna be in the zone oh my god pretty type that battery here oh did you get into this all get it let's go now i got it just about i think i think he had his eye on it too i saw one in it sorry i can't blame you i can't blame it yeah yeah okay where's the blue armor team that crafts like 12 batteries we need them we need them right here i hear them i think they're on board yes i cracked one really bad really bad you ready okay okay yeah yeah come on quick i did that's wife the star this was such a good all man here we go it's the it's i've just said where's the blue armor team with all the bats that they crafted and these guys delivered oh did they ever i i passed yes that was probably the best worry i'm gonna put him in a bind oh that's a crater this guy's getting dead now come with you just shut it 45 seconds where is mr crabber guy reloading give me your gun there's so many if you walk the left walk to the right side okay i got the guy on the right nice i hate this guy i'm gonna i'm gonna hold them there then i don't know if there's someone else behind us we get that oh you crave them right them yeah this race must have phased out providing yeah i'm gonna stand only last team last names for the last guy i think it's just the last guy yeah he's on me he's out back uh he's gonna be on soul he went inside i think okay he went back again he's definitely punchable 100 punchable wow what a game though that was crazy well played nice that was fun one actually really fun one that blue armor team with all the bats in the world i told you they were i knew around the corner you literally called it because everyone's at caps so everyone else is like what else can we do we just gotta craft right mate look at this let's go 15 on the dot too that's super satisfying to look at
