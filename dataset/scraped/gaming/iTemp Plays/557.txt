hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be running some octane now i found to be one of the only legends that i can use anymore with the lobby's dying game before the first ring is even over if you want to find yourself any kills you have to play a legend who can run into the gunfire in the distance as soon as possible ragtag so far and i had a game on olympus earlier that was eight minutes long and it wasn't because we slayed out i think we had like 10 kills combined it was kind of slow but this is the state of the game at the moment plus octane is pretty fun to play so that's always nice so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends ah what's his name oh really oh really give me the vault thank you blue i think this might be a caustic i don't know he's looking at me weird yeah i'm not sure if there's any i didn't see any

reason you weren't going to say anything you you out damaged me once a week and you lose your mind every time you do it it's great right we're going to have some counseling right now i wanted to one at a time lay out your feelings about to say good game no you were only because you did less damage than me only because
