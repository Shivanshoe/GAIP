hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that i have for you today was comical it was comedy in so many different ways and it was actually the game this season where i got my highest kill count as well probably undeserved i mean there was one point where i literally did six damage in the craziest third part you've ever seen however it was still my highest kills it still counts okay i'm sure you guys are going to enjoy this one thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all five and a half seconds my friends well i didn't mean you lent oh i thought you meant you were landing the other one okay i mean i found a devotion was last time i used a devotion ready for good reason it was a long time ago i mean is this blood mosaic that was the only gun in this whole place oh my god okay i've got devotion and an alternator i remember the last time i used the devotion i i really could not tell you been so strange i mean i do like it but you never find energy it's difficult to find a turbo throwing star frag out i did used to love it though i mean that is the dirtiest party you've ever seen oh that's horrendous i'm so sorry sorry guy whole squad taken out i like what i see impressive i'm gonna do i'm gonna go like that actually that seems smart i'll throw one massive yeah inventory's looking good i need like a three times or something two times or three times i love the three times r301 not sure how good i am with the mastiff with uh with a digi on where did why did you go where did my did you go i've been scammed i needed that cause i'm blood out oh my goodness at 2 15 you said you were blue toned instead of bangalore i guess i can't smoke smoke out of fights i'm running there now got a live one out there what did that come from contact already on my mark firing for effect let's reposition here airstrike danger where'd they go did they just have to push up when i threw that the ring's closing and we ain't in it i suggest we move pals is two more teams here so many times that they start the third fight started shooting each other which is great i got this back now too and i got your shell like i'm actually i'm actually pretty much looting rooted here look where all these people there's a bottom behind me she gonna focus reloading nice give me a sec recharging shield wait for the smoke exactly but this guy's knocked down he's just blocking everything extended heavy magazines does anyone know leave a comment i've done nothing i don't know damage for these kills maybe done a little bit those last two guys but overall not really oh my god it's absolutely kicking off oh that kind of sucks another third party another crazy third party here for the gang what's that fight if i i can do because it's gonna be in the zone and people panic why too much in this first zone they're gonna just walk into this i think that guy's flesh i think that was gonna must have died surely round two oh you guys have got you guys have got to get out of there you can't stand there just go through the zone and go into the building okay i've got us i've got to heal up with it that's all you i'm i'm i think that might be solo maybe heck's going on here i have 12 kills i don't have 12 kills i'm just stealing everyone's kill everyone's killed i'm third partying for eight damage i pretty much just stole that last one but you can't just not treat people you know i don't know if that guy's got a teammate that's a an apex bread and we need to get his team out of there to stand a chance i don't know just get him out of there just trying to win ultimates off cooldown who wants to see it rain gear package i kind of know some examples this whole game oh there we go it's that one buddy to get their attention do we go across the rope they might be going to the respawn beacon because it's definitely solo in this lobby [Applause] okay there was a solo i don't think it was those guys who were they fought there's an octane this way i heard a pad away what are they doing give me a sec i need bats what they put away like that they could just fire this ow there's no way this guy's aiming at me like that that shield's recharging crazy there's someone over there and this one behind him he's got blue but he's got the best aim of all time apparently that must be the guy that was weak might be too early for me to get involved that might be in range of this oh i could use it for a sec oh they're gutted they're so confused let me make some keyboard sensitivity is weird i haven't played mess killed in ages i'm gone no come on let me i took a mess to keep what hold on hold on where they at this guy just got to revive i don't know how to ping i'm an idiot i suck yes where's my where's my good attachments for it here there okay oh they bumped into the very last team unless it's the seer team they thirsty for me what a great guy give me a sec good work we're inside the next room yes there's a solo on the right so you want to kill this team if anyone should have do you want to kill this see a revenant team but if anyone he's probably trying to pop up that's gonna love that at him he's got less time i can't see i can't really see that was poor for me i should have taken more of an advantage who the heck am i playing against who are these people if you have q just lob your q and me in the smoke if you can let's relocate here just let him fight what's our that's huge me thank you the guy who sat in the corner and his team had a charged rampage what is this lobby one second absolutely pushed up there i'm glad one of us isn't playing like an absolute idiot because i i am let me tell you one minute he's up top now this guy's crazy massively i like what i see one other squad after every shot i was like shooting and it's going like this like twitching away oh god no that's my crater hey put that down that's my crater the ring's closing and we ain't in it i'd suggest we move oh doesn't that you climb up why does it let you climb after that oh i'm committed okay anyone know where he is if i die up here i'm absolutely screwed please don't crave me that was terrifying i've got me absolutely terrifying why has everyone got a devotion in this lobby don't crave me i'm getting scared give my shields a recharge come on we pop into the smoke right here it's got like a turbo devo and a crater is there a more broken setup in the world it's too good it's an absolute machine what a terrifying weapon and his secondary is a craber oh god why this game's crazy given my shields a recharge i keep missing my massive shots i think it's the digi i'm telling you like i'm never this bad with the massive i'm actually really good with this gun where did he go this guy's too good please no yes fair play though that hurts fair play like that guy put up a massive fight considering he was solo i mean he was lost if my teammate wasn't playing smarter than me with his q and then goldberg revived me like it was actually a lost game i may have stolen a lot of kills and got kill credit but that was a team effort oh man that was funny though that was funny i want a gg
