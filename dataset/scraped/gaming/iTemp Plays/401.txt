hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're playing some solo in trios which is so difficult now most of my lobbies are just full of unbelievable players and the game gives me inexperienced teammates however sometimes they do give me masters players and when that happens the game seems to just play itself it's great i have two games for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right well it's capital city and it's also the heart drop which means that this is going to be pure carnage hemlock would be nice but there's a team on us and i'd rather have two close range guns first i saw the pathfinder heirloom i saw the boxing gloves using being used in there to the traditional sense i can't even speak i'm trying to say i got terrified a hundred volt bullets what kind of maniac manages to find 100 bullets for a vault within 12 seconds of the game starting there is a humongous scrap over this way teammates we've managed to survive it's a christmas miracle i absolutely hate using syringes it's my pet peeve on apex this isn't even a third party with a third party this is the fourth party oh apologies teammates i've missed every single shot 57 though i should probably just regroup with this guy oh my word i've missed out in all the leaks here one light round one singular light round so sad any more light rains i mean i've got so many energy bullets not a single bag in sight though giving my shields a recharge they're still live which is a good sign teammates retreating a little bit i'm not sure if he's pushing the fighter or he's just trying to get safe that's coming from whatever where he is i think he's found a team here the team split i think the other teams are just big scrapping in construction got the right ports on the train track i think we're okay no we're not there we go we've got the army switch off as well oh god one singular light round again this team's brushing his name i'm such an idiot i hate someone too that was giving my worthy a recharge wow looks like that was the last one that's in my red please thank you slight miss click this is why i check the same death boxes like eight times is because whenever i first loot them i'm looking for an armor switch thank you uh we got to this one it's pretty far away let's go this way the closest one though uh when i first look there i'm looking for an armor switch then i'm looking for like shell bats and then i'll look for ammo after i know i'm doing stages i mean this is uh this is his teammate like they're actually queued together you are super cool um i don't think they've been sarcastic right surely not surely not because i am super cool it's it's clear to see and i assume they are talking to me because as i said they are cute together so they'd probably be communicating in a different way than the apex in-game text chat i don't need that that's all for grabs all right this is the mistake everyone makes whenever they respond to teammate they just fly off into the sunset they leave them there to fend for themselves what you should be doing is getting a bit of high ground like a decorative gargoyle and there you go look at that three vultures three hyenas closing in for the kill yes yes this isn't about doing damage it's about fending them off this is about this is about buying time for the blueprint to the mind to pass that stage now shields daisy the team did everything perfectly well there like the bloodhound obviously had next to no loot but even just tanking a few shots getting a scanning you've done your job you know taking those few shots that could have been fired at me means that i was able to survive you just gotta you gotta take it as a team there's a team going tunnel to train i think we just dip inside here go to the left the only problem with fragment is that when you need to go safe or you need to go uh west it's just a bunch of choke points choke points are pretty bad if you don't like being focused it's in need of energy man this is what this is why it was so surprising that this guy had like a hundred energy bullets at the start of this game and two votes there we go what kind of magician conjures up a hundred energy energy bullets at the start of the game the choke point i was talking about might be something good this way you need shield shield got a bunch of them here contact with target they're tough is that even the same team they they were flying i don't know if these guys would have yeah i couldn't even go that way hopefully i can take some of the heat here tim it's got his phoenix popped i'm going to try and draw their attention away from my teammates because i'm like more of a mobility legend nevermind that's not good they will split i missed they're getting shot in the back though that's that's an easy race kill us i thought they were gonna die i'm dead yeah i'm dead too many teams oh i'm trying to type keeping an eagle eye here i could have played that so much bear it's okay though amigos there is a squadron in the vicinity i mean this is pretty decent move for one floor i might as well try and help easiest mistake to make there especially because i'm somewhat weak myself he sort of sprint around the corner and slide downstairs where did the revenant die i assume he managed to fall down little rope shaft giving my shields the all-star is one of the best weapons at the start of the game however i'm pretty sure it's the only gun that doesn't spawn in with uh amazing amazing i'm trying that's me trying to focus on looting and talk at the same time amazing good grace it doesn't spawn with ammo in the magazine because it hasn't got one this happens every time ton of white rounds though there was no there were no energy rounds in there right i'm fairly certain i didn't miss them if i did it's an absolute modern day tragedy absolutely zero we are struggling why am i even in here i can't i literally can't use it teammate i've got i've got one gun affirmative i'm considering dropping this it's just not even worth my time i'm letting my teammates know that i'm not that effective at the moment there you go robin how does it happen every time someone else when it's all shielded up i should have stayed up top at least i got me an assistant uh i'm just gonna quadruple bat you can't go wrong with combats it is actually so far away five seconds on the grapple corbin as well i can't believe that okay that wasn't an attempted ball jump that actually wasn't i wasn't i didn't even want to do one i can't believe pathfinder's grappler used to be 15 seconds flat like when this game came out path must have been the most overpowered legend this game has ever seen i mean wraith as well her hitbox was non-existent but 15 seconds it's a very few people and i wasn't one of them but very few people realized how good the grapple was uh this seems like a bit of a split fight here i want to try and get me some ultimate high ground i need some first game of the day i need to tell my teammates alive these teams are scrapping i'm going to revive i i am completely useless i did about 16 damage that entire time i've got two smgs what am i doing trying to get that ultimate high ground i need to get in there that's a kill to me didn't deserve that one um i'll challenge you i'll do it recharging shields reloading i need my shields back there we go as soon as i decided to get in their face with my double smg setup actually worked out fairly well who knew there's one squadron left [ __ ] i don't need all these shields they're over there over there big 13 16 30 this is though i have miscalculated here i thought i don't think there was anyone behind me that's the view pathfinder though gg me amigos i was a little bit too far away from the action with a double smg setup but first game of the day the alternator it's got the recoil of an assault rifle but not the bullet velocity that's what i was struggling and and the aim department as well you could say um but that's something um that's unfixable that's just that's just me it's most damaged though still got most i'm happy with that
