far away oh there's another team really ah hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing apexy's forgotten legend who gets no love and i've seen a decent amount of community backlash aimed at respawn because of their favorite legend and how they are not getting any attention whatsoever and the legend is of course watson the little french lady was released in season two many years ago now and apart from a few seasons of being meta in ranked hasn't really been too powerful or fun to play and with the upcoming release of a new heirloom which is rampant of all legends watson mains are understandably frustrated i think that she needs some books maybe a miniature rework maybe a time takeover and an heirloom i think she just deserves better i have two games here for you today on watson one is solo and one is with so far i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't land in the middle anymore because the only place to get real guns that aren't snipers or the g7 scapes is in the beans so i tend to land at the side ones there you go i'll start eating right love to see it i'm trying my best not to complain about landing on an l star but it comes with like one did i get the bolts thank you i need light ammo oh my god i absolutely i'm actually pretty confident in my team because the wraith had a masters trail so we should be we should be good to go that guy's damn nice oh he's got his pad already oh that is tremendous okay i'm a bit of a mess it's it's my first game of the day i don't really know what's going on don't tell that i pressed that what's going on here that's earlier on the shotgun vault the shotgun bot that was there and then what was it like a purple extended line mag and the um and the extending mag scammed unbelievably keeper here i am down to either what the banners looking like here because okay the wraith is absolutely cracked out of their minds that the octane is a bit of a demon as well even though he's only level 50. don't who got that but if you're not using it i would greatly greatly appreciate it this way oh big scrapping i'm landing at this rock [Music] that guy's dead i would assume all right i'm going for a one kill win here that's the goal that's the dream hey got mixed any mag nice that's all i wanted i've got a passive shield regeneration as well which is what like one every 18 seconds that's pretty huge if you think about it i'm actually going to leave that so i can passively heal it all right one kill five assists this is the stuff of dreams here i don't need any batteries because of my passive shield regen obviously bottom is a pretty pretty powerful legend as we all know hold on hold on hold on i know what to do here guys i still get him by nade i mean it was on either side of the rock to be fair that's coming through you guys are peeking the wrong scope user i'm telling you where'd this guy go oh it was blending in all right we're going to kev because there is another car in the way i'm liking my team now i'll be honest with you i'm liking my team is that what the car was or is it just because you heard a car and that's a road that's the logical place to look wait okay beside the wall okay here don't leave wraith i should have picked up that dj i should have picked the digi up okay i was a little bit late to that fight because i ran through the side of a wall so apologies to my teammates there definitely could have been a little bit more health helpful for sure i'm taking it three times we are getting tap fired i think it's that way i could have stopped a full stack but there's 60 in stacks of 20. it's made it more difficult for you hold on teammate una momento i've got a digital threat this time too but i forgot to take shotgun ammo one absolute modern day tragedy okay this is the saddest day of my life i want to get out the way i can't see not pushing over all day i think they're just having a nice time just like sniping the sense now from downtown you know there's no time in the back i'm going to keep strafing don't slam in the back don't come in the back i'm gonna get a different angle race cracked i think we're getting pushed in the back here maybe we just switch focus [Music] do they finally turn up we're already in the ring need to recharge my shields they can't get back this way with this tunnel so we need to be careful of this portal i've been a complete mess this game haven't i oh i've done some damage i'm pushing it i'm risking it i'm risking it oh it's a different team oh god i also need to make sure i help these guys teammates come over to me over zero light rains as well i mean i'm double light she's light shotgun i need helium i mean i have i'll drop 50. one minute i'm gonna sneak this on my teammate he's popping all the ultimate accelerants and i i haven't found any mind you i don't use my ultimate i never really think to use it especially with a team like this i'm i'm just trying to use all my brain power at the moment to keep up with these guys they're a bunch of lunatics i'm enjoying it i suppose anyone has seen one of these have they what am i doing with ease my mentoring what's going on here blue gamers we've got some blue gamers well we need to go this way because the wait didn't take the light frames the wrong g7 user you're challenging remember the team this way i don't know who is the revenant but they're throwing meatballs at us as janks would say come on kill credit killed an enemy this guy must have just ran off into the sun it's the sunset then oh that was the revenant i thought he was a horizon what's wrong with me in my defense though we were we were pinging to the side because there was another team involved so i just assumed it was relevant so it foreign 57. i know what that means is team 57 or what i struggling got him blind i'm blind but i'm still dominating i took an enemy it's kind of crazy they're getting shot on the back get him do not let this guy get a revive i shall be extremely annoyed i don't really need anything maybe some light rounds should have known that have been gone we all need light rains what am i thinking i'm here squadron i should have been here sooner if i didn't lose i could have got some more damage and i would have been able to get my uh kill credit which i ended up losing such a sad day okay i got three bats i'm fine this has been a great game eight kills i mean it's been a bit hectic is that no oh they're fighting over there though what no they're not still over there enemies right here last guy who's the last guy's ready the team is over there right don't tell me it's the same general that team though snipers in the back don't tell us the same thing up here i want to get my watson 3k i shouldn't have looted my teammates uh my teammates are running real fast i gotta be quicker come on watson move those little french feet let's sell these shields for us which is real nice of them okay i play like a maniac i have to wait i'm once again blind for the third time this game i cannot see a gosh darn thing i'm not going to throw the game for that our teammates have killed you the two it's just the gibster oh i've got full faith in the team they did it i got my 3k i'm a happy man gg well played amigos oh gg well played nice i actually dominated look at this no shot i'm dead they both throw on you or that's your apartment again there's no way he gets a

all-star nerf is gonna do anything i'm not happy about it mate i don't have any sights for this guy there's a three times behind you i tried to finger it on me sorry it's all good they have rampart shows over there now i don't think those were there before no they weren't be careful i'm gonna get blown apart by sheila i see how luke that's down reloading i knew that discovered they started stealing that stuff hey can't help it there's a lot of little over there no it was a long leap can't wait for that i'll start to be nerfed he's pretty good wait there's shots on you sounds like north
