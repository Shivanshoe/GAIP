want about this guy he's annoying his alt is annoying he's tactical he's annoying he's the bad guy uh i don't like him but you cannot say a word wrong about his heirloom it fits his character perfectly and the animations on this are outrageous so i almost wish i was a revenant mate so i could run around with this death scythe all day i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends hello uh absolutely it says this way 30 seconds to get inside that ring they're not a big building indeed they are 100 sounds like 70 hp recharging i forgot you playing low back i should have played like path or something i have five best mate i'm gonna drop one i know if you need it uh i have five okay there's a team on the far side yeah 90 on the horizon at the bottom okay move okay reloading a wraith is over there solo nice okay it's quite the combo they were right behind this bag that's the way they went there i wouldn't have seen it but my aim is dragged yeah i wouldn't have seen it nice oh my god just cancel oh that hurts damn it i'm here there's another one here oh he read it he doesn't care man he just gets it back oh i care well again absolutely i played oh he definitely knows we're coming here wait one of these guys has white crack on purple i didn't i think there was one here i don't know did we dance three of them i think i got two i don't know where the classic is he's somewhere he's somewhere you're getting ready have a quick race mate that's it's timmy's child so have some respect you know uh does timmy have a child yes and there was that guy right there another no this is so sad to see right over here to my left shut up sorry if i'm making harder wait what's on the rope leaving yeah they're all just running what okay what it's funny too because like you you hear a charge rifle and you see it but then you don't expect them to just like fall definitely not somehow wait what oh wait it wasn't you it's him it was him man i thought it was your noise gate because i just heard someone go yeah i want to kill two plays but like really quiet and i thought it was like your noise gate wasn't messing up but you just heard my my inner you just heard my inner thoughts yeah yeah that's what i sound like on uh on the day today it must be tough i made i understand oh no i don't know if i'm gonna follow you to be honest i think it's a really bad idea to follow me yeah i'm not already i'm just fighting though [Music] oh no i'm dead i'm actually done they're shooting at me always makes them it's them wait for me teammates please hold dead only got one more uh 12 kills and less than 1700 damage you know the vibes the mobile's in the race in the crafter so they got respawned here and they were still here five minutes later and then i still seem to fight him okay i think so far has gone to punch a ball back oh you clutched nice yep how many balls did you just punch is it three or four a lot of them i'm just about to go punch some more now that i'm seeing your damaging kills yeah i did mention that but you weren't here to see it blaze like mean my vibes would be so much better if my controller just wasn't uh do you need a light mag let me know if you don't drop it through a blue one i'm just yeah okay i'm just holding the blue one to see if we're getting annoying from me there must be team around here right i hope so found an extended energy back here all right i've got three bats would you like one sorry i'm blowing into my controller like that's gonna do something um i have a total of one okay you are alone i've got a corset careful i'm wearing trails remember they're reviving oh good unknown oh okay i think i've used this gun like once it's so broken i fall back do you need some i have three children okay i'm going to keep asking during this game someone's here better hear somebody ex regret something you regretted that push idiot mate can you move your big head man where did where did this guy's box go where did extra greatness no man how did you even leap over this fire without dying oh my god did you like my trash chore uh yeah you're too busy shooting me in the back while you're saying all that yeah also the kills hey debatable i don't know how to use the g7 to be honest i'm not even playing i don't know if i've used it for like the entire game you still assume a little bit you know i'm sort of thrown here i'm coming back a little bit i broke one i've got no mobility size to be careful they are broken struggling and one i'll try to survive i'm one moment i'm a crying mate i played well played you might need to grab me like soon yeah so much better sorry can i help you though nothing like nothing you can do i don't have mobility noise good news is one of them took my red but it was like pretty much broken so and now it's four three oh it's full ready to go i made two reds this game okay g7 was kind of hit right there mate g7 so so busted it is pretty good it's where she put it three time on it ah have you tried the one times oh oh thank you bellissimo you know i i don't know get to know me like how many players did you have to deal with i was i think three full teams that we just fought like one spot and they all got rolled yeah i mean i didn't do anything against the last one but before that we were rolling to the right i think i hear him i'm going to pop it i think it's the left too oh god 150 on uh i want to destroy that rev think he'll take it closer to him no way good work team trap away [Music] giving my shields a recharge this game's stress for me they're going to be right to our left yeah trying to get in front shoot him let's go down to the buildings i think because they've got caustic what was going on here they had such such good positioning over it i know like they and they know it's too i have to that's the other team but wait what are they shooting at one silence and that holds yeah and we have the other team back here oh do we have to be careful man over here i see them they're they're on their way over here now i think we just leave them leaving the zone they've got caused three stacks we get shot on the back anyway it's one of them like we get to fight them anyway so then push that you know we can uh we can get on this hill and shoot him from fire if you want damn all that just a bunker in a place where we don't even have to push yeah i don't know what what the thought process is there all right um mummy no i picked that up yesterday let my team down horrendously yeah that's good i have seven bats there med kits okay i don't know where this other team went they were like shooting nothing and i don't know what they're up to they yeah they were on their way over here too i don't know the ring isn't far dude what am i watching like what is this team oh they're up oh my god here we go oh my god oh my god send them i've always just want to watch when i get a free push you know i don't do it oh my god it's not the cost of our team how does that not we have to kill this team bridge at all costs oh 1000 once padding yeah kind of but i think they died in the zone i mean that is like that happens every game we have like intense fights and the last two teams have not fought the entire game and they've got blue armor and they're just vibing i don't know what i that team was worth it i hope camping a building for 10 minutes was worth the loss oh i hope mike sims doesn't say this i already hope he's not watching oh man if mike's oh my god foreign okay that was fun i almost died to that wraith that would have been so much she would kill mix almost every wingman shot
