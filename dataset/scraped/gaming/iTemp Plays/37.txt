some people to shoot correct look at my mini map just skulls everywhere where's his octane he died you better win the gunfight everywhere [Music] i always missed him and that was absolutely nowhere near way too early yet again what's going on with this guy he's retreating who we fighting [Music] i could shoot but i'm here sorry sorry friend there you go keep monitoring that spot send me in little tag team was actually pretty good i also forgot the mozam i forgot the most i was fully automatic don't leave don't leave i'll kill this guy okay yeah yeah i'll know [Music] you really didn't need to look back there but it's okay [Music] getting a lot of custom voice lines between the two of us a lot of tension between ash and pathfinder [Music] i'm going to take a 1v1 against the shelf [Music] hello amigo are you getting shot on the back now okay i can't get a kill get the arm switching run friends get that grapple going great we're gonna get rocked up on the enemy is moving in shields are depleted recharging time get him reloading that door's closed it's gonna have to come back recharging i wish i had some bats level three hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course first things first you can probably tell i am feeling a little bit under the weather but it's okay we're here we're plodging on whatever that means i'm here today to talk to you about world's edge i was wrong about this map for a long time it was my favorite public game map and i was looking forward to it returning and then i remembered within the first three games that if you don't land a capital city you will never get more than one kill in the entire game now in that little intro game i don't know if you saw it but when round one started when it started there were 13 other people on the map now i know that this happens on every map on olympus if you go across um energy depot it's going to happen if you go across the states it's going to happen but at least there are different places it's happening at you get a change of scenery every now and again same thing with storm points it can be a little bit annoying but at least you've got checkpoints you've got mills you've got barometer you've got stormcatcher you can land at the top of the hill and still find people and the second game that i got for you today i had to alter f4 because my game was lagging i came back like two and a half minutes into the game there were still 50 people left it was great but i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me and me goes another squad is incoming i'm here team is correct it's popping off with an eve right i've broken enemies my ultimate i'm just all the top there they came up recently i was getting absolutely cooked by one yesterday not just one there was plenty of them there was numerous i guess it's just as well it didn't work they were sat right on top of it we would have died okay this sucks i hate this spot 60 seconds how have you done that to me recharging shields hold on why do respawn make these positions where it's impossible it's like one way up up a rope you're an absolutely you're just dead if you go up the rope you have to be horizon to get up there you can't alter there apparently i'm just going to shoot these guys look at this guy get out of here i mean we are almost certainly going to get 30 by the team up top but who cares at least we can shoot these guys i was out crypto i'm an idiot i'm trying to pop a bat but i don't even have hello goodbye i've secured the banner they get a second chance that looks bad though i stole my teammate stuff but i thought this team was going to rush us and i needed that i needed as good um stuff as possible does that make sense tim has already respawned him he's not respawning you didn't use the mobile respawn beacon over there did you oh we've got so much cover from from up top from this no this guy's dead there's no helping him he's yeah he's gonna nothing i can do mate sorry should i respawn him with the other one good grief i hate these guys but to be fair if he came the way i came we both may have died at least he at least he distracted him you know the question becomes now do they jump down they can't stop there forever it's not even safe and surely they need some loot soon although they do have a low back they're not even pushing their failure sorry teammate you're not gonna get your stuff back on i think yeah i'll go this way we're fine these guys are the three worst humans on planet earth i was gonna come up yeah you yeah you three yeah they heard me chain not okay the most annoying thing about all of this is they're actually pretty good okay how are you landing multiple shots on me from three kilometers away you got two masters badges you got two masters badges and 70 scout of action is that the thing in the the firing range where you shoot the boxes i feel like i get 70 on that with like a rock band drum kit objects here i'm sick of the dog today well for the last three days i'm grouchy no one's safe please spiderman safe look at him i don't care about them iraq needs is that the term i don't know thanks teammate coming in with the smoke yeah no one's safe i'm sorry teammate that just made me feel pretty bad actually no i'm not you know i'm going to come out to you guys next yeah you're watching this what are you guys doing huh it's not gonna i have nothing to lose i'm sick anyway i don't care you throwing stuff must mean they're pretty close you could just be throwing them at the dogs we've thrown our stars and dogs around here no i'm slow this is a fair and balanced gun if that counts as my kill i don't care what people say [Music] and you get the first damage the kill i'm just i'm even complaining about first damage there was a guy around here with red so we know that they've got a guy around here somewhere out there i heard you did it's had the gravity cannon there's no way that's him at least there we go this makes more sense does he have red shield it's not going to be there that's okay listen i've turned a new leaf here i'm feeling very forgiving you can play the bubble bag i don't need the bubble bag there's a big scrap this way uh two minutes until zone pulls we can we can get these guys out of here usually i prefer the third party but if these guys are behind us we don't want to get pinched because we're still gonna have to fight them but i don't want to be fighting them with another team involved do you know what i mean i'd rather just have a fair fight now there you go ttv right main solo one thing this guy's got white shields what on earth is going on mate what what series of events have led you to only having white shields three years into this game yeah there is a squad in this area they are shooting us you got any smokes there you go give them my shields uh we can wrap around this we're fine i think this is the team from the top i called them the worst three humans on planet earth it was a slight exaggeration there are there are worse people about these guys are probably top ten still okay all right i have a shot let's get the heck over there watching that direction an took top and kill him it's a three it's a three-step plan step three kill him step two step one just all walk that way there's a guy here get those heat shields down yeah get up get him down gotta protect from the uv rays i'm getting sunburned i 100 heard someone i can hear a car there too that's auto as the crazy germans would say those germaniacs hello friend hello what's friend in german again i can't remember something i think i got these guys don't worry about it get out of here don't know are we okay controllers that that's my wire there we go we're back just rush forward big w key as if you can finish your shield there what are you thinking oh my god i don't even need this next hasn't even got to start there we go that's a complete waste of time yeah well i don't know what you want to do about that we knew the team's behind us these aren't the boys are they this isn't the team crypto come on come back i have just chill what are you doing have we just need i'm pretty sure this is the team as well what are we doing guys huh smoke and run oh my god okay give rage quick that's good because now i can arm switch my zone's moving i'm dead i'm actually i'm actually dead one of my teammates doing we could have got revenge on this team you've thrown it all away i'm going down with a fight idiot i cannot what what what ah no no awareness there team listen i don't care i'm don't i'm going to say it how it is i said already i'm sick i've got no patience the the cryptos i mean the bangalore didn't realize they would come behind i don't know how you're gonna get third-party when there are three squads left just run forget the bat okay pop an armor switch and turn around and crypto is like i'm running like a lunatic 1v3 ah what's going on ah who cares we died to the three worst human beings on planet earth i can't believe they've killed us ggs i tried i tried
