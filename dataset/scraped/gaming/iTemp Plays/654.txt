hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and first of all i am happy to say that this video is sponsored by ea so i'd like to say a thank you to them for supporting the channel and they sent me a very particular challenge it's the switch out challenge and they made it difficult not only do i have to switch out my gun for the gun of any enemy that i kill i'm only allowed one gun at a time and i also have to switch out my helmet and also my armor as well i'm not allowed to bag either for the entire game i'm not allowed to pick up any attachments from the floor i am only allowed to use the attachments that my kill had it's tough even keeping track of who i killed and what things i have to drop before looting and then because i'm on controller i'm just standing still next to a death box switching out every possible bit of my kid for theirs i had to get some help so our message so far who is the carry of course and he decided that he was also going to play along with this challenge to make it more fun so both of us were so limited in our loopholes it was an incredibly fun challenge i had a great time recording this and you can see some of the highlights of the failed games here in the intro so once again thank you to ea for sponsoring this video and i hope you guys enjoy it i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah yeah once you've picked one up you can't just be like actually i'll take this one so aussie you gotta the the first weapon you pick up you gotta stick with it apparently not attachments that aren't in the box so our first skin's actually gonna be underpowered oh no so you need you need uh you need a flat line you need a flat liner yes i think that's the best gun or a hammer all natural have a clutch either eight i'm not picking that up no attachments allowed spitfire that's not too bad okay wait oh wait so i'm i'm doing this with you so there's a g7 over there i don't know if i want it i'm picking up a helmet yeah yeah how many army are let's pick up just not the actual attachments okay oh i found a hemlock i'm picking up that one there's another blue yeah i might i'm gonna do it lucky yes it fire that probably would have been the place yeah speedfire is all right i did look at it i did look oh no i've already picked up the g7 oh no people are scrapping over there yeah i think we need a third party i've got a g7 so i'm gonna try and grapple to the middle he's in the building okay i have 10 shots with this oh no i don't know if that was him or a pc right shonda anyway uh i'm risking it all you're listening to all the fury oh he has blue there's one further back oh they're just they're just running they're just running crack back on the z second guy on the z oh the second guy's low oh i missed i'm missing way too many shots don't tell me you're going oh no they're running again nearly dead nice okay so don't throw him uh maybe not because his teammates still look unless you want his gun you kind of want his gun you don't know what it is you don't know what it is this unlocks attachments for you you're allowed to take his attachments and his teammates running i'll smoke him out so you can get closer i think the blue i have no small shadows you just run is this running away like this is actually crazy this is crazy eyes oh what has he got brief i have a g-step with no attachments on it and you're fleeing the scene we did a big circle all right i'm dropping my wait you have to take their armor and stuff right the armor and helmet oh okay i think i did that i'm not sure i don't think he didn't the guy that i had killed didn't have much oh this guy didn't have any attachments on his alternator he had a massive purple i should have taken the massive for the purple yeah he should have honestly maybe i still can is that cheeky oh alternator is all right it's not it's not the worst ah you got range so you can you can stay back a little bit all right i got a spitfire with a blue mag so nice there's another one over there purple one's got purple ones got blue i threw my alt over there if you want to we could push the guy below which way did he go oh that was the thread uh yeah ports down there yes dude oh yeah we could grab one of the guys on top i have my ulti fancy oh yeah i'm it down down the hill a little bit but whatever someone are protected i don't know where that scan just came from i don't know why even his it's just randy these players are weird these guys are absolutely terrified of my no attachment alternates then can you blame them can you oh yeah that's sick how does that how does that work maybe they were pushing us and we didn't realize yeah we just went in a circle right below that's an easy kill what do you have friend i never know cause i didn't land any of my shots are you gonna go up top go back if you need to abort abort i doubt one of them but i didn't post them oh my god there's someone else here i'm coming you good you're good he's broken really low though his teammate's here have you guys oh yeah we got to go to where that oh we got to drop our helmet stuff too oh god oh no he has okay i still have a white helmet i'm taking her oh god this team's going to be annoying that's a good vault they're grappling on you yep him a little bit far i think it's two teams i can't tell if it's two teams oh i gotta drop my spitfire oh yeah well why else did i say i don't have smokes yet he's over here we could let you just go this way oh one's on the ones on the truck low give me a second that's actually kind of good for us i need him a little bit he won't fish there healing up a little bit oh there's gonna be a hard push i'm pushing that there's two teams he's against you on the back yep i'm here with you i'm here with you oh he's right above me right above me i only have seven bullets oh my god she saw me oh that's huge i don't even know where that came from wait which one of these is my kill i have no clue i think you killed the dude up top no i don't know if i got kill credit for any of those kills no i think i killed this team i think i killed both of this team oh they're back up oh no i'm i'm hold on i'm going on my mark i threw my old thank you i broke one nice job i have a gold havoc our gold flat uh i'm gonna go this way and take the the zip okay good idea i got an assist on the kill i think and that counts yeah that counts that counts oh no this is right on me near the mastiff oh god i got a full heal you good you're good oh you're insane the other team's pushing only two enemy yeah left watch out for the new kill i think you drop back you're good you're good okay i need to switch i need to get some attachments for this what about ammo are you able to get ammo uh which one oh yeah you're allowed to do your eye demo okay i don't know if i switched out the helmet i don't know if i switch out the armor or the helmet i think i switched out the arm already i'm taking the helmet i've got to drop my bag oh god this is so good there's a lot of rules there's a lot of rules yeah it's so confusing the hardest part is just remembering the rules yeah it is oh oh i see i have 90 spare as well if you're unheavy at the moment uh i got i'm chilling right now okay okay we're good we're alive still i know i don't know how i'm picking up like 15 aids i've not been playing well but we're still breathing we're alive i think that's the main point of this challenge is just to survive yeah i have six bats i do you like wait i never remember you like the burst powder don't you you've always liked the first crowd no otter i'm all over the daughter you're still awesome even after the after the buff yeah and people are hating me for it i'm gonna pop in also dude the auto isn't i love it it's so much i mean the burst is nice but the burst is too situational yeah that's oh are they close they're closed still one more in here yeah right in this corner nearly cracked on wraith oh they're both really low oh well not not the other one oh let's go dude you're better i'm here oh my god at the worst time i think i got both those kills i don't think you have to switch if you don't want it okay no that's that's fine i'm gonna chill i did that was such bad luck i went in and i hit the pathfinder for like 99 health and then he popped a phoenix with a little oh my god i have a gold flat line i'm i'm having too many bullets a little bit uh i have 55 spare if you need any you good oh yeah i thought you were serious i have limited bullets no i'm chilling i have more if anything i'll chop i'll drop you stop here good grief i want to switch out from phoenix i have no bag and two phoenix kits like what's going on there oh i forgot about the bag are you still rocking the bag yeah i got a gold bag remember oh yeah i had a purple one for a bit but i'm not sure i used anything extra okay i think i get a pass because i'm not actually doing the challenge i'm just kind of participating you're a bonus you're a bonus party in these i'm gonna i'm gonna keep the gold back just so you can so i can keep you alive wait i see him that's why i'm here oh yeah it's the last squad jim yeah uh i should quickly make some keyboard when i have to look and then quickly pick up my controller yeah just have one hand on the keyboard real quick just standing still when you're losing this is so scary yeah i'm i'll just bubble i'll just bubble you every time we did it though
