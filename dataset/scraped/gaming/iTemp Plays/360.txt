hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using a gun setup that has never been seen before there is no way i am not having it but this setup has been used before the setup is the al star with the p 20 20. if you guys can find a win on youtube that was uploaded before the first of july 2021 i will give you some apex coins and if i can get in touch with the person who's when it is i'll give them some apex coins as well because i refuse to believe that there is a video on youtube.com uploaded with this setup and they went on to win there's no way talking of treats my g food code item is 30 off at the moment it runs out on the 5th of july as you guys have today and tomorrow to take advantage of this beautiful saving there is a link in the description or you can just use the code item at checkout so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends heavy ammo here that's you i thought i'd see him ah no no i'm flying you're zooming i've never seen you zoom like this okay okay okay live got no annoying and a purple armor all right well and i have a purple bolt on my uh some of us are living life and others others are not that's what happens when you lose gay life i'm just watching this back to edit it and i didn't realize that when i press square to pick up the armor it actually closed the door and i didn't end up picking up the blue armor and then i'd run off so yeah i'm sorry i should have i should have heavy mag there's so many heavy bullets around i know i should take that [ __ ] to the flatline i'm so mad so good i got a p20 with a hollow on it i took your advice i'm gonna test this bad boy oh yeah yeah yeah yeah crank it crank it out there a bandit we got a bandit and it's in this current environment what is this audio i know i just dropped a p20 under a death box i can't get it back i'm coming nice to see you i heard about mirage footsteps when he's down sounds like a person just full sprint and when you kill him sometimes it sounds like someone's flying is it only mirror i don't feel like that happens with everybody now or maybe it is i just don't know literally no one has ever tried to use yourself in apex uh what are you using i'm using the classic uh setup that you see sweeping the nation of the l-star p-20 okay okay okay yeah no i don't think i don't think people will typically run uh that loadout uh remember when they announced the all-star and they were like you can shoot through doors everyone's like whoa man i swear it used to destroy it but that's when he was a careback weapon so i don't know oh god you remember who shot you yeah this isn't the best loadout for this range i will admit they're all rushing you careful you got your ultimate right over here [Music] um i have to go in this building real quick and bfk for one second i hear someone flying i swear i hear someone flying i swear i did this right next to blind too are you adding that accent to everything now this sounded like i'm gonna break my monitor i swear oh there's nothing over here at all no but that race i don't like this map unless i'm landing at school town really my school town i don't want it oh furious all i'm school 10 next next game we land school time school town skull town only all right i have to immediately see what he's saying probably just playing music i'm going to see her controller this is controller this is that all it is it's just it's just a thumbstick gun like this it's just like this i can't even hear you i can't you know i've got a fantastic mic so yeah see here we are so here's what he needs by mike i'll send him the links you know some of one of your 15 go xlrs i'm in like the daisy chain so uh it's getting processed like 12 times oh what did you say a daisy chain yeah i have uh oh he said i gotta go back like i love the fact that people just hop on casually and they're there talking to teammates man i just love that they're just playing some apex they're just chilling with the bros you know that's just an extrovert rich it's nothing special no i'll just say that that's not it's converted we're just introverts so that's like uh that's some that's amazing that's so fascinating to us but it's really not nobody's just volleyball we're the minority yeah i i don't know man i'm not an introvert yes you are what do you mean you have never seen me at a party and nor is anyone else ever someone else you're a big no you're a big part here i wouldn't doubt it but i hate someone like a rival this is above just climbed up i wish i could fly i'm not gonna i'm not even gonna bother you go kill him uh he just seen me with sentinel and i got a p20 so need some help need him some help he stopped there practicing himself no i'm literally flying in i've never flown in like this before ever you've never seen anything like it bro are you a you online solo i just like i dropped and all of a sudden there's three people down there he's got to go back here just climb wait wait there's somebody below oh god oh god i'm blaming him forget it he can make his way out of the storm we'll find him he'll come to us in about three minutes i love our team you know yeah he's a grinder i feel like this is the heirloom people bought them i've seen so many yeah it's so it's a cool element it is for the worst legend uh we're about to get firing oh yeah you gotta go nice 110 on uh that's not why i hit that guy once right well like what is happening on my screen i can't see anything cause you all so let's get you a do-over yeah they were all right where's this other guy let's pick twigos oh ellen uh revenant wings out bigger than bigger than this huge hell in here he's crab walking everywhere don't just go back there for the kill what are you doing man that's the smart player oh no another hellum smartest way the other day big clients aren't expanding i'm really proud of them there's a lot of people in the beer climb now i should pop a battery as soon as he dropped where were they flying mate i don't know come on where were they somewhere over here all right i heard like one shot so i don't even know they're fighting you're welcome thank you i mean i didn't even mean to use this red flag they nerfed it so i knew that was never going to work oh my god i this is why i shouldn't even play defensive livestr i need to land on their foreheads or i'm not shooting anyone it's what people don't understand when they comment like goddamn you missed a frag grenade at eight i can't loot man look who i'm playing with this guy's a demon someone just landed up top attention is that you with me or is that my teammate who's that he's here i'm not going to bunker am i a okay nice some of us stay winning some of us stay losing i see how it is i just do just attention i can't find him he's above me he's up here slash that's fine though just you and me now okay well he could at least offer some fire whilst we try and back up come on oh i am going to die again can't believe 120 and he jumped down off that broken oh my god wait i can't i actually can't even shoot this dude at all i don't know what's happened i was wrong we did need it we are all in the danger zone i don't have my good name if you're traveling with a small child i don't know i don't think anyone's actually in bunker like i don't what the fight was more towards this way ah normal landsberger bugger sucks don't get to suck so it's always cascades or i haven't used my ability once
