hey was the closet which welcome back to under the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be playing a revenant now revelant has been one of the coolest characters in game since he was released but unfortunately his abilities and his ultimate didn't actually make him a fun Legend to play the recent update however has changed a lot of things about revenant his passives his ability and ease ultimate have all changed for the better and now he's incredibly fun to play with in the background add some gameplay to me using him and I'm gonna be talking about what I found to be strengths and how best to use his abilities at the moment so first things first he now isn't a low profile Legend meaning he no longer takes a increased 5% damage low profile also was changed in this patch was even worse for Pathfinder Ray's and lifeline because Lyn shots had to do the same amount of damage as a body shot so it's even better that this was taken on prevalence his silent ability now lasts for 20 seconds which is double the amount that it used to it disables to brought us ABS shield it lasts on the ground for 10 seconds instead of 5 seconds and you also have 2 charges instead of 1 pretty much everything about this ability was doubled I was suggest using it on Wraith Pathfinder for the revenant and Gibraltar no 2 of course is useful against every legend to use the ability after stop shooting and if you're winning the gunfight it's nice to stop these escapes of these characters and if you're going to use it against a reporter make sure to try and use at the beginning of the fight so you don't have to shoot his 80s shield off however this ability is now amazing in a different way you can use it as like a add a trap it can't be destroyed as far as on the way unlike a caustic trap and lasts for 10 seconds if there's 10 damage we've triggered 11 to low profile legends and you can cut off a doorway or a corridor which gives a great utility in a gunfight with a lot of people so now there are two charges you could actually cut off two entrances to a building and you could use that time to reload to heal up and then get back into the fight this alone was an amazing book to revenant I would have loved to have played it even if this was the only thing they'd changed however they change fees ultimate on top of all the other changes it's now incredibly worthwhile to try and use these so legend used to be teleported back to the death totem with one health now you teleport back the death with 50 or whatever health you were on beforehand if it was lower than 50 this is essentially a free 50 health healer and it means that you should be trying to use this ultimate differently to how you would have tried to use before before you'd have definitely want to use a medkit before going back into the fight so you'd want to use it somewhat far away now I would suggest actually getting as close as possible to the fight to use this ultimate if you have purple shields and the revenant ultimate you essentially have 250 health which increases to 275 if you have the ready Evo shields he's deceptively tanky and also it gives this ability to all of your teammates as well you can definitely overpower a team if you use the ultimate right I think revenant is great in places like school town there's lots of doorways you can cut off with your ability it's close quarters fighting with your ultimate gives you a chance to overpower team and there are so many places to climb up as well he's not quite as good in the open so try and have a close-quarters good and try and make use of that format in the gameplay that I'm going to show you name I don't actually come across a wraith or a pathfinder the entire game it might be the first time that's ever happened to me so my silences weren't too useful but you can definitely seen the intro clips how I've managed to use his ability and his ultimate to just destroy people essentially so thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's one team landing with us here at Bay city's my friends I can't believe this much of a hot drop in air base such a good place to Lutz only has one team team that we're not landing there together I'm not testing my luck with RNG I don't I don't trust my orangy these teammates next to me to refine I thought we was gonna land on these for it and start kicking in wasn't people nice I already know he's - I assume he's about to start rotating across to plow starved Leslie Medina Thank You friends what a horrendous way to die that is getting double L start one of the most obnoxious guns on the entire game Lima I need a sight French yg7 sport on Eustace especially here on Kings Canyon of all places sorry Kings Canyon after dark I have 300 my range that is not the one I've got Helen points I might stick with a g7 L star load eight sweet things fight I will hopefully we bump into someone soon because I can't believe how few people answered under the air base if you remember that back in the day I have to wait way too many like my bullets in Y 24 June 7 skate if I should have been popping off back in the day that's French I'm in better leave an air base with five or six kills you clear up one side you take the little zip line across me and you're laughing you're doing date number one that is not an incident apologies I would have passed upon Mozambique I'm not gonna grease this it's a nice thing to find it a start of a game but okay so good on revenant I'll just climb up I put this climbing ability where's your team my friend actually nowhere to be seen I think is the answer to our question it's Lucy I don't need to move into the moments of my sight obviously I love this mobility I'll look the spook time I seen it I sleep please teammate London and I've overheated the I'll start well by Sheila's man's got no field talk to whether all squads taking the Dern now I like her I don't play a coder that much and I'll start to use them a little bit more and then I just learn all the new the new voice you know I really heard these for a long time I don't need more than a hundred 2003 hedgehog but usually it's a little bit much for the g7 but I guess he's been in nothing else he's taking obviously I saw here alright well we haven't silence anyone yes and we haven't used our ultimate but we do have a name however who can make use of it I'm a rocket of light to a supply ship well let me know if anyone's over there friend me amigo I'm not sure I'm a big fan of Kings Canyon after dark I'm gonna I'm gonna say okay I can't see oh gosh I think and I'm not sure how well it would look on videos either because if I'm stalking to see stuff I mean gab this way if I'm struggling to see stuff then rendering it or bloating it all the compression on the files and stuff must make it more difficult to watch as well it's alright because it's not in the rotation for that long I think it's like half an hour or something I need these fun to play I'm gonna pass up on the double tap I want to see I'm not a fan not a fan at all at the double tap anymore I said we get out of here for some reason nobody's wants to land on the western side of map air base supply ship I mean this was looting they probably moved on with our lives as well absolute lorries and and the scrap medicines evidence of other people on the same map as us unbelievable he'll lead is done for yeah I agree I'm pretty sure their fight something like containment or something is actually crazy how far away you can hear gunshots maybe this is why people are dying so quick I mean it is one of the contributing reason is obviously in fact it's pretty one of the biggest ones they've just made it so you couldn't hear gunshots from so far away I would not be be line in it's straights containment from behind bunker assuming it was the same fights what's he spoke there's a Watson fence even up here though now I'm gonna contain it there's more rotations this way - it looks spooky them - on big towers looking role spooky after dark please be someone here to shoot huh Oh a being bloodhound scanned did you miss that or something shirtless mmm I assume you've got that guy I know put my faith in you my team is a predatory as well so there you go nice Heidemann happens I don't use my ultimate one person kill us again that's an elite strategy that sees the most elite strategy I've ever seen I actually thought to myself there's no point trying to silence this guy what's he gonna do throw a big way out or something but obviously he's ultimate he's actually pretty good I've never seen it used like that he popped his ultimate so there's loads of mirages around and then instantly as soon as like wasn't looking he thought I would be ultimate so I was real real confused here's a good player look it to get away with that one I should have put into silenced him no what was it the two times bruiser it's all good but three times is a little bit too much but I'll make do I've got the owl staff they're all a bit too close like a little bit lucky there sometimes you just got to appreciate the fact that you're so light you know even though I did probably fringe and fifty downstream in total he still need me bamboos or third they're happy freaked out of me never seen someone use mirages like that I can't wait for them to it to buff arrived so I can actually bamboozle a load of people remember that dummy's big day out where everybody's caught and keep the phone right guaranteed it's poor father and they were like testing to know ultimate and one of them was like the heel one of them was like obviously it's going to be mirages ultimately it sends a load of decoys putting out and they cop what you do I can't wait for them to bring that to Mirage I'm sure they will I think the reason they're not booking him at the moment hey friend you'll be too close right here let's be careful friend I think the reason that I'm bluffing barrage at the moment is because I reckon they're gonna change his kids like big-time I reckon these decoys what stays somewhat similar I think they're changing his ultimate I'm not sure when I don't have any sort of insider knowledge this is literally just me guessing I'm not putting that forget it there's a big scrap of this way I'm gonna use my ultimately scrapped a good time T's is when you are third party and then people can't hear you coming and also I'll pretty have talked about this in the in Chinatown okay nice I'm gonna get close and then use my ulti you go think of him that is I think I literally get to but it's there and got to be else unfortunately multimers been a bit of a waste but I'll tell you what though it's nice having the confidence it's just ready take that I've got red shields now it's nice having the confidence to be able to walk on heel to be able to brushing I mean I assume I've talked about in the intro but it's Altima has been massively buff now you get basically an extra 50 health and gunfights if you can just place your foot down sort of most of it by the option is that was that fight when you get safe first coming back around so safe that way so did you see him I don't to get gate caps but my team it's pretty good we should be fine without my ulti still that's the only issue with you I mean if you're if you play too good then you're autumn it's a bit of a waste you know as you can say about everything though all right way round I want a massive flank ETA can't see finish is in the shrubbery he's in the strawberry nice to shove it up sometimes once my plate too massive assists there but it's all good I've had a few kills so far in this game there have been one shot so I actually give me that one times I might have my ulti in time for these last fight it depends though I'm gonna try and use it again it's nice having the conference as I said to run in with an extra 50 health and I love the red shields aren't you oh my mom I do mean I love the red shields with revenue because he adds that tankyness this man is actually deceptively tanky if he pops his ultimate you need to do 100 damage to put him to send him back to his totem he gets 50 health back from that and then the red shields give you 125 shield so what is that 175 like 275 health revenant can have deceptively tanky if you play it exactly right my friend Oh might as well use that adds the fact that he's got some incredible mobility and his sinuses are so good against like the most popular characters oh it's good on you that's good on me as well I guess thank you we looted out a ton wine they don't sneak up on the last team sometimes I think no no no I'm careful I'm pretty sure there's no nap here but it's still some pretty good high high ground you know it up with a diving board action although we're going to be struggling to see anything off the topics I wish I still have that three times target in the distance what he talked to scrap in the distance as I take place the HTML intensity point you off that hates the longer devotion I'm tempted to do pathya soon we're a bunch of dweebs I mean this is the best place to sit but let's do French I've got my ulti too let's put it to the test there we go didn't even need the all teaming in the in the end sure I don't think I came across a single Pathfinder or a single right I know is the two characters that are one extremely popular and to the best peoples of silence I remember Ken under blue tones it's also really good to silence gibraltars to for that that act there like a deer shield this stuff and I did kill one of them but he was healing up so he's kind of pointless seven kills 10 I got five kills a very even game there looked 92 more damaged in him didn't actually make use of the ultimate too much but it was nice having the conference or sprinting like that and we got deal to a combo the red shields the golden helmet and then we combined it with the ultimate - thank you for watching I do pre chasing I'll see you all in the next one
