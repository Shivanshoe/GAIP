hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are teaming up once again with janks it has been a little while but our differences are behind us janks pinged me a gold scout at the start of season seven and since then it's been smooth sailing this is a double whammy so don't go anywhere after the first game ends and be sure to subscribe if you're new to the channel because we are close to a million subscribers but apart from that i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah but unless you get rolled for two hours when have we ever been rolled ever every day of my life never lost all i know there's literally no gun there's nobody honestly 20 20 man how do i have double p 20 in this building too me downwards no like mid i think wow he was standing next to two blues didn't even realize it poor guy uh that is a shame yeah there are two blues up here if you guys want i must confess i have one book yes please oh they're just on the balcony right next to each other and he was literally right on the other side of the of the wall oh poor guy do you hear this big scrap we're getting loaded yeah they're up here they're up here oh there's no angle oh that came in they came in oh he's flash flash like 38 feet uh i need to break one of the other ones i don't want to fight too many bullets i barely have any energy down to one i knew that that i'm just chilling on this window honestly i love that song my pink sucks can never pick up anything what is your thing oh it's actually not that bad i know i'm at like 90. i'm at 92. let's see that's crazy we should not be on the same being doesn't make any sense really does it i will admit we gotta see like the actual the actual uh like distance that you are from the new york server and then i am and then just because that's actually insane the flights new york though it's like it's like seven hours and for you it's three hours um uh i have two syringes and a med kit hold on i have two syringes right here thank you so if i was getting shot by plant pass i think that said shields recharging i'm getting shot by a flat pot yeah that's what your voice line said anyway sounds all right i have one cell all right i've got lots of cells i can drop um i could use something where am i looking at me uh there are bottom constructions i think that's a different team maybe one's in the open ones thank you how is he up here all right time to run away there's a fresh new team oh my dude thank you so much pancakes that's a completely different team yeah yeah i was having to try and hold them off yeah i was fighting somebody else you did darn good at it too hey he's the crafter skull okay i'm gonna keep running the flat line did i get my race did we did we get a race kill over here no no that's the team that ran away okay oh yeah they breathe like um bro i literally took a full 1v1 i was one shot with that race oh either patch either pad i'm gonna love it over the car that may have been way too far i just launched it sorry mate not very useful little too far i'm holding them how far was it yeah i need to kill one of them that's it back up one of them's like four story can i not loot through this fence i can't aim this gun at any sort of range at all i'm so bad with the flat line it's tough mate oh yeah i don't know why he's flying man maybe it's not even the same thing dear lord the same team uh i'm not sure i mean if you had a triple take it was the same team because he would shoot me from narnia no okay maybe you had a hemlock hemlock and uh shotgun i'm lucky probably do 3 000 damage this game such a good gun i agree it's unstoppable how long has this care package been here the whole time i don't have many energy ranks by any chance uh zero i do not either i've won 28 spare i'm being a bit dramatic anyways i had that much before i asked i thought i was on struggle hours i'll find some soon yeah deployed you got a train down to harvester is that bad is that a bad rotation is that a lifeline package or is by the way how long would it have taken you to cross it would take me another 10 seconds it would have taken me like in total like 45 seconds yeah it went it went under the ground like it went underneath and it went to the complete opposite side and hit the wall wait that's sad though i had to launch it it wouldn't have got me anywhere i literally would have been stuck in there for everyone involved it's a thought that counts right yeah i'm trying to find over here oh big horizon ultimate maybe he's nearly cracked on his finest mate i've literally just landed behind him he's he's so sad i can see in his eyes how sad he was they'll find this one down this way on my head i'm just being a meat shield today are they still on you or is that the team i think that's it man oh three all right he's dead instead nice i don't know what that guy was doing but all right we just want to leave me he's just fighting i think he's just trying to get berries we've got one minute i have a gold bag just how i like it well i've got a lot of energy now i'm not a fan of this gun but it's kind of slapping when it hits it hits which one you're talking about the flat line oh yeah like it's just so powerful i mean you're in a position when it hits it hits but at any sort of range like i just whipped me too yeah he fires really good yeah it's impossible to control the recoil with the same with the controller at range it's just impossible i just don't know it maybe i should go in the range and see what it does because it's so left and right left and right man it has like no vertical recoil it's all left and right you can't control left and right recoil with a controller it's just not it's not this is not a thing all your thoughts suffer why do you like it range what is that what are your thoughts the flatline has been dis uh i don't think it's been dissed i just i think i use it i have more hours with it than probably like 99 of people who use it so i have a better feel of it you know yeah it's just one of those guns i mean it's kind of like the old crawler i mean no one could control the recoil with the pulled brawler either that's why no one used it but i probably had like 20 000 kills with it so after 20 000 kills with a gun i feel like you just get kind of used to it reckon that's how many kills you had with it yeah i know 100 that's wild i've already used it every day i don't think about twenty thousand kills that's uh all i would use was 99 and uh taller you die please i'm trying to get involved in the fight oh flying classic here we go airborne call stick awesome beagles cracks in there on the left with the hemlock careful i don't know what just happened but my game just like super glitch well i don't know what's going on i'm gonna show you what happened i gotta show you what happened i went to throw an ark star and i went to throw like i threw my grenades at the at the thing and i threw my alt at it but then i pulled out hey well okay thank you oh then i pulled out another ark star that i didn't had and my guy was just walk i was like trying to shoot the guy and i'm just sitting there holding an arc star in my hand what what is this here we go here we go here's the ultimate test yeah oh my god i'm missing all the stuff watch out ah how's he hitting me he's still alive i'm trying to reload desperately wait that door just open oh it does it does it does don't worry like grab it grab the stuff no dude oh i can't i got a backpack and a helmet all right all right wait wait you got the helmet okay you're you're pretending like oh though you're the octane i would have you think they i think they're around here mate but we can still get hungry i got more rope okay i i'm gonna be honest i'm kind of an autopilot right now my brain has not um it's not it's not functioning right now all good all right it's a full team are you going to change that hey my hands are absolutely freezing cold not lying to you not lying make my hands are so cold i can't aim i don't know what to do the other team's gonna rock up these guys will find someone else before oh god i'll check i'm healing i have a bat that's my name oh to give you with the purple of course why wouldn't it be they both are tough they're both purple broken yeah they're broken they're both broken hey he'd be shielding cracked again he's only got his damn mate i'm literally the worst player in the game i'm not lying i'm literally the worst player uh how cold is it not not like that cold but it's pretty chilly my heat is just not working i don't know level three look at this toxic guy look at this oh mate are you kidding me are you kidding me nice nice now it's just coming look at that i i hit that oh did you that's why pathfinder hit the voice line oh i literally got 45 damage on it well pathfinder said i shot this down did you hear him say anything no yeah he did you just don't have the voice hands on yes i do they don't you're a liar and a thief i saw you take that scorpio so i wanted that for my hemlock i love that teammate's name i don't know why um what's his name 99 jimmy's what do you think that means i don't know i don't know that's what i like about is the mystery wow there's so many jimmies yeah why are there nine we you think he's talking about uh like a person named jimmy it might be that's what i mean like is it 99 actual gymbobs or is it just jimmy jimmy john jimmy what's that sub what's that sandwich company is it one of them jimmy john's yeah we don't have that here but i'm very vocal really i had it for the first time like uh not like maybe like a month ago and it wasn't really i don't really care for it too much all right it's okay but i don't like super that much so why are you really stressed i do not i'm not a fan of subway at all some over here really stressful there's a pathfinder in here yeah uh martinez laden in the blink i literally can't get in all the doors oh yeah they have a ramp in there too okay i can help i can help hold on i'm in
