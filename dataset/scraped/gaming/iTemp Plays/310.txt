hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we have the first games of diamond rank on the channel we don't have a full three stack just yet so it's just me and so far playing with a random teammate in each of these games and the thing is with diamond is that there are a ton of vultures around waiting for you to fight so they can rev octane push you for free kp you've got to play it smart so we often just play for position and have our big fights towards the end of the game now the gun combo that i'm most comfortable with in these lobbies is of course the g7 escapes with the vault as the secondary and i used escape for probably 80 of the gunfights to poke at range to get damage from my evo shield and to try and nick a few kill participation points in there as well there's a reason it's my favorite gun in the game i just feel very comfortable with it i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh is there anybody else around um someone out there they're taking the rope back down to tree if anything we take this five and get damaged on somebody back to the flute that guy's got a good vault shot one white one's got white the one that's camping behind that is uh that's big around a little bit i did get sniped in the back a little bit i don't know if this team is backing up back whoa whoa whoa whoa who came to the side i didn't hear him that's what's here how much you need well played i did get sniped at one point it was like north east but i don't know if they're like waiting for us or a rainbow a little bit of time um all right um oh yeah let's just stand on the train train tracks really crack cracked it's easy kill is he running back yeah he's he didn't have any heavy got no socks less aim sway faster zoom in i think or at least faster weapon switch crazy we're gonna have to become the we're gonna need to be the jay god of of apex and make sure that these are all correct well that's the thing though is that they're probably all right so they're just out of a job instantly i know mate have you seen like they literally can't release a game of a weapon into warzone and cold at the same time without messing it up i know you jay god is just living the whole i know i know it's so good it's like it's got contact there that keeps changing the files on purpose so you can keep making videos about how they mess up they think these guys solo i think i heard a steam like they're coming yeah they've rushed they rushed right nice one in the back is one shot yeah yeah he's still up there i'll just i'm just sitting behind a closed door just watching how do you know where is he who's there over here i'll come in faster faster faster thank you round of payment okay he's broken he's broken uh finish and finish him he's running out the other side yeah no you need to hear me i'm gonna lose my assist now yes i was gonna bat charging on my shields this can you make you see don't don't worry oh you have three kp it's fine i think he might have gone down here and left you got his heartbeat he's down here go sneaky beginning have you got my heart bitter no no how did he get 80 meters away no he's fast he was in his butthole you might go back for manners yeah did we finish the oxen i think sucks i have to i have two kills i'm coming back this way where we were oh my god okay join this gold bag um yes take it at me what is this what what's happened it might just be one dude over here that's gonna erase all right i'm here though so i can't believe i'm standing still okay this guy's running hopefully the bangalore hopefully that blue hands are fine i'm using a phoenix kit fellas shake a leg we've only got a minute and the rings right there actually quite like having the pad it is really good so useful and he just full send like a team keep checking hardwood mate he might be running around trying to get banana what's your heartbeat like in this place barbie's broken rich i don't know what it is i don't know how you lost that blood home i'm going to come and say package yeah he is can we take this building i'm gonna pad if you wanted to get up there i think it's safe careful careful all right i don't know if i hate someone someone in here or something wait yeah someone in here the g7 fires so slowly the bullets that's the only problem with it i have a longbow there everybody's still focused i'm going to go scan real quick anybody can you come up with yeah i'll come up because oh my god this i mean i don't even think it matters where you scan this is there's literally like half the zones in on that rock yeah yeah i don't think it doesn't matter yeah i'm not humane big scrappy if we can just like do you want to get up top and pad on that yeah i mean you make it real quick okay might as well i'll be there in a second they're all fighting did you make it yeah easily team just rest death for that yeah i do hold on locked one second squad one's climbing on the roof are you honestly i feel way better with octane because we can just like decisively make a building and make a yeah that's perfect whatever you feel most comfortable that's all matters i need cells okay i don't know i need to get out of here by the way yeah five squads left i think it's a lot of uh like solo there's a lot of rats let's keep hopping yeah all right no no i literally keep forgetting that's it's like you told me the day what was i playing like it's like me right below me just watch the right right [Music] once cracked give me odds can i pat on that no i think we just wanted to increase all this no i four but like there's a lot of people left kinda i'll probably get kp on these in the end they have they have to either go down or push us so there's there's no way out of there i try to go in the back as long as we don't go down yeah they're in the middle section okay still not so they're still not safe oh yeah so you mean there's no reason to get i mean there's two of the squads left like solos right on the back this is the only thing that we need to worry about yes it's got blue yeah all right that's another that's another octane this week nice you might give me my bubble breath i'm trying to hit him i'll cancel it i'll cancel it i'll try to finish him if you can yeah i'll try it so broken a body knuckle cluster earlier bubbles don't we're going to get rose again behind there why did this give you behind his only small hearing he's going to pull back in a sec i don't have an angle on him there we go let's practice down all right we can pick this we can do this i'm [Laughter] they're like all different teams too nice uh littering is against the law and you can be fined up to five hundred dollars for trash less than or equal to five pounds or five gallons repeat the offense and you could face a jail time or you could face a fine of two thousand dollars and 180 days in jail good that's the way it should be it's kind of intense oh yeah over here on us they were just there still if they dropped down we could look down on them they might have because they yeah there's not much room for everything he's so bad without like a purple mag though i have patched himself nice sorry no i was on this like i was trying to hold this angle for you and like you went behind the swan i just couldn't see at all two seconds three you seconds cutting it close huh i did that hold on uh no i don't think so not me anyway i'm standing next to teammate say we head out to skyhook sounds good do you have any uh zero but don't worry about it i don't know of course i'm going to get stuck out here now you're fine you're fine you're fine like one's like the wraith is really weak on the top i've seen two down the race nice i'm not gonna get the kill for that i don't think they're just behind the building it's fine though they're just gonna get stuck in storm yeah we can hold this right here we can hold this right here it's high ground they have to come in yeah but we we gotta watch behind us yeah we do we could just get help 100 percent we're 100 percent yeah for mine but i do want to kill this team [Music] i see anything of mine do you have any like is that what is that over there just get back or something they know they can't come this way did you get you didn't get killed no no no oh they're here they paid you that pain they're like probably have another heat shield after that is there not a team over there i heard shots over there over here i'm coming back we can't kill this team you can't see that's a fk they're sending he's going back his back is back but that's kind of reach from there i feel like they're my pushed now they're pushing this way i think i'm leaving that for you i'm leaving up here i'm gonna i'm not with you i think you're alone now you're like yeah yeah i'm done want to retrain trying to get you i'm gonna go to you i don't think they're chasing i think they're it's like can you heartbeat and like see if make you maybe they're gonna be revived around this corner around here [Music] at least all right i'm trying to get an egg on him i'm going around see someone trying to run he's just gonna run let's go here he's gone he's roping there's a rope down there still leaving they've all cracked him i think he's gonna rotate around that i think we're fine yeah i'm not gonna hit a bullet on that i need some light after that good grief i'll get the kill yes nice follow through those there's a little bit over here in this uh light and energy has been i end up not using that much energy you know my i have 200 energy still this will do that i got 100 light 120 now you're 40. perfect i'm good should i pick up a hemlock over this like i feel like i might amaze me yes yes i just cannot use i'm so bad right yeah they're stuck in that building back there can you need that or you give me no i don't there's a team sniping from the right be careful over here one of the ones trying to peek right here i'm just gonna shield there's a fuse like going off behind us i don't know who's that team though thinking we were still there yeah i don't want over extensive yeah no no i'm not i fell back a little bit there's a revive going around around this corner like a respawn i'm trying to see if there's another team behind us i don't think there is i think it might just be us might be able to fight this okay oh that didn't that bad hit me taking damage grenade out i think they backed up i think they just backed up nearby there were people fighting there's a fight in here yeah we got to go back uh this way where we came from you get a skyhook yeah uh we're gonna be playing in buildings i'm gonna just pick up a brawler i have two i have sorry i have five cells two bats that's theirs now just watching behind us there's two teams in that building there's a team on the right and there's that's three teams there are three teams i don't know where they are buildings it was the team that rotated left off that of this thing near us isn't it one of them so there's two in that one yeah then three oh all this is huge any hobbies no no i've been checking around us all behind us to say because they're all in front of us see what's up on there i can drop you my bats and i'll just use those okay do you have a how much you keep me i have three nice should be fine after this is still like yeah nine people left at four all right well we should get some right now as soon as i get out of there yeah there's no cover like there's barely any cover except there's one big rock in front of us i need shields i'm gonna drop them about these teams are going to come out like in shambles probably yeah shortly honestly mate imagine if we just sit on that uh there's no cover there though it's not he's there i was thinking about it backwards you get padded on as well you're screwed like we're finally huh yeah i think this is huge because the only rock that they can play is this one big rock right in front of us yeah well we can we might be able to do something like that my friend i'm gonna take that oh you wanna stay back i'm staying back i'm staying back sorry ah that's not gonna it's not gonna work then we're on that building for engineering as far as i thought it was gonna what is the opening nice job he's gonna pull back and die on the bricks cracks here on the roof crack seriously he's one i hate a little bit a little bit no name last team last team yeah i needed that please corner last guy can you keep him yeah i got it i got it oh yeah i think so a noise that's just the best spot shout out to the teammates who for actually playing with us yeah exactly like that's what we need just play play with us we're in a good spot just wait for it to happen i was using the rampage the entire game just throwing i'm actually throwing oh he had five assists and zero guy dude at least he got five dp yeah oh thank god you won that gun fighting that that first one where you were literally like full health because i threw around the corner thinking thinking we're all there but i flew over your head like an idiot i was like a little because i had the 30 30 out and like i was trying to like poke a little bit and then like when you turn that corner i just could not see so there was like a solid two to three seconds where you're just alone i was like sliding and no scoping with the with the g7 and none of them hit so sad
