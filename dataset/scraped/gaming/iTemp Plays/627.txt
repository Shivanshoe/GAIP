hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some ranked with so far uh and i've been a bit all over the place with frank as of late i am in bronze for today's game so far he's in silver and that's because the last time i played ranked i was on pc but i've got a plan this time around i want to play ps4 and get to maybe platinum or low diamond and then i want to queue with a friend who's playing in masters or a similar rank on pc so i can experience those high level pc lobbies whilst playing on ps4 with cross play so far and i played for about three hours and we won six games i am just beneath gold as it stands so we are ranking up fairly quick so hopefully we'll be there pretty soon in today's game i was using the wingman because i need to practice with it this gun is incredibly strong in the right hands but i never use it because i have no confidence with this weapon the only way to fix that is to use it more so i tried to use it almost exclusively in today's game and i hope you enjoy it if you do be sure to subscribe we are getting extremely close to 1 million subscribers so i would appreciate it a lot and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh i'm gonna land at this door just letting you know before we land at the same door fighting yeah i was literally about to go for that door last time we landed at the other door together so i thought i'll mix it up i think it was i think it was every time we played it it's not this door you can see he's cracked on blue let's see so bad there's only there's only room for one here uh get his leg i just want to execute him thank you uh caustic i think over there he's gonna charge right please just oh yeah yeah with a charge rifle beautiful i'd love to see it my favorite combo to play against i'm using a wing man this is such a bad idea oh do you know 47 another 47. one's climbing up he has purple though second one has purple okay he's broken a few times i might just like you can have this building give me like i'm not fighting yeah at the moment i'm not in there i gotta back up i've no shield here i am so used to playing the game mode i was waiting for to charge back up yeah i'm going to take this on the ground this is uncharged i am using heavy what am i doing got a wingman they might try and respawn him they're they're literally just gonna stay here they're not gonna respawn their boy i i don't know what i might just loot for a sec if they're gonna sing now i need some shields i need yeah do your thing i think he might push me it does let me know hope he does of course how do i not kill him there what loving a knight through the window i'm out of shields oh that one i've got some shields for you guys i i gotta i swapped i got it in there anyway yeah i don't know how i'm gonna get this guy with that there you can shoot it you can shoot it dude ah that was so annoying that was so much worse than it had to be yeah it was and there's another team coming nice wait he's running my aim is really really bad through the window there's no aim six though right got the excuses ready for you don't worry all right cool nice thank you for clarifying that yeah yeah i got you you have a wingman yes i do i have a scorpio soon oh my word now i can't drop the wingman now you've embarrassed you really can't oh yeah yeah well you've sent me okay i'm gonna go loot this way i have two shield cells and that's pretty much it yeah all right i've made myself a gold wingman nice what can i actually do with it how many shots are we gonna land oh it's actually oh right here she's one uh running one's deep over here i'm gonna push this one right here in front of me they're like jumping away or something this one is avoiding god tops within the next 90 seconds he might go up top though man i'm getting shielded this is crazy run run run i'm trying to get to you yeah they're all covered in my shoes i have trailer sound one last job oh my god hurt i got the octane that was close so it's just that one i think trying to break the shield [ __ ] [ __ ] scorpio trying to finish that one down jesus i mean they have to get off that soon i finished my oh my god i finished my kill i got a slow heal for 40. it's basically crack that's retained i need one damage broke the shield behind what in front of me there just ran off it now don't have to worry about that going down low okay i mean i had to slow heal i'm coming back though it's kind of that way i only saw one of them pushed that way though [Music] one's one thirty years oh okay they already rotated okay crack one high ground two high ground two we're in a bad spot here we are they're getting shot in the back the high ground that's good we might be able to fight this team they're gonna they're trying to they're trying to res yeah let's commit i'm climbing up probably the shields one of them is already resin oh where they went i'm killing the sheila part of this uh rapper sheila nice the other one just dropped in he's outside uh like 60 hp inside 70 hp build practice again all right get a gold triple thing oh oh yeah that's why they must atlantic to get that any extended they had nothing at all like they were they were really struggling i had these guys this guy had one all right i'm making my way towards up here they're popping off my wingman shot isn't the best but i'm using something different you just fell down on this i actually know he's looked up he slipped off maybe he saw me scared 100 that's what happened um back to that cracks in that second one minute all right i'm all sorry what's going on a lot yeah steven popping um right below this is one more dude i think the worst thing when you're facing the goodies you're getting like really weak and then he starts adsing oh it's so bad and i mean that's that's why i don't like using wingmans and stuff because you put like two bullets into it and it goes down and by then you're you're dead yeah pretty much i know you mean you can't break the shield yeah you're right you're right yeah i have like a weird glow behind uh all the players in my game have a glow behind them it's weird good hands down my phone's dying other one's pushing broken i was trying to go for a headshot oh the shield bats champions i have seven oh my god i have eight now do you need any um i have three i'm okay might need some bit of heavy i assume someone had some there we go mate my i don't know if i should i don't know if i should be carrying this many i need some if they have throw balls i'll switch your mag but if they don't i'll carry eight shield bats i'll do it i have one mine you might as well turn that yeah um i have four i'm pretty much stuck i can't carry anything else see what the wingman is good when they don't move i will say that yeah it's great huh perfect lobbies to use again he's like the perfect lobbies to practice and just get good with the women it's true because any higher it's like the wraith is the craziest crouch spamming straight you've ever anyone over here would have to rotate to us very soon unfortunately just here 385 i think it's a corsica's done up top like that with like low brain like maybe there or something but he's going to cross no just he's launched his ultimate absolutely no one that's a hail mary shot if i've ever seen one that's kind of 200 ikea brocastic noise where are you shooting where are you shooting what did you see that caustic i didn't know where he was aiming i just assumed he was at you but apparently was not oh he was just shooting the air he was like spinning in circles shooting the air maybe he's hallucinating because who did he throw his ultimate i don't know oh annoying um i don't think so i think it's just two but that's a different team we're down to though right i'll just hit them again it's true right here yeah she's so laggy yeah i got one mate he was teleporting where are they playing from they were this way i have like a permanent bloodhound or something i don't know what's going on but i see every i see it like uh dude i'm seeing all these people i don't know what's happening it's i think they're right there they're rebels someone back the revolt's up top i'm going back up to the top oh my god i'm okay i'm okay i think he's pushing you i'll just crack he's in latin adults i'm coming down nice of course he's broken nice job i have health there's one close i really want to get involved in that look at the stay of it yeah yeah i mean if you want to i'll be there in two seconds uh all right i might just go up the ladders spaghetti i'm going to try the wingman oh i shut the down go i literally didn't land a shot buttons one oh my wingman hasn't been bad uh watson's one other one i didn't touch i think he just enlightened himself but i can't be sand they're coming up i'm healing nice hey nice dude you're popping off with the weed man i landed a few shots but then it all went downhill just like me sliding now when the watson was on top of that i literally i think i missed like two clips on it i don't know but i i'm kind of bad at this game sometimes it's kind of crazy i was missing so many shots i don't know what happens on my aim i mean oh very even games i see that was a good game 2.72.8 that was very nice action-packed
