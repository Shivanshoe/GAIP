hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some horizon who i think is a bit underrated at the moment she got some buffs in season 10 but i don't really see her being played too often and with last week's octane nerfs i think i'll actually be playing a horizon more often now she's really powerful i have two great solo games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both and i'll see you all in 5.5 seconds my friends i don't know why i'm landing here i should have landed it through the place but it's okay i'll give myself an either eight and an re45 loose a few of these and i'll run over someone here is body nearby answer yes guy's got an l star i've got five bullets this gun's over there think it's a mozambique if we go down there though wait there was no wait did not pick up an arrow and pick up the arrows i've got no space we can't really focus this team down low this other team will kill us looking up i'm inside the bin i reckon they got this uh key card from the lower ultimate which i think was their mistake wait i literally don't have a kill i i could have had a kill you too i could have had a kill but i messed up my right shirt on that it wasn't a rampage oh man what can you do i mean the team i played that so well we're not close all right let's see we can get from this i may be sure to use the low broad to get some light ammo but i don't even have a bag so i'm kind of struggling or i could have got a bag from the low broth they might not know that was like split i know we're both the same angle mate contact recharging my shields there we go the other bag as well look at this this is tremendous teammates pretty cracked we've got a good team here didn't mean to do that loads of good stuff i'm looted because i've got gold armor don't really need anything else i mean but kind of like to bonsai but surely there's someone over this way you'd think maybe probably not too much going this way i'm going to follow him i'll have to move this way anyway yeah there we they're go or are they just in this direction i think it just means they're in this direction they were here i did more damage while sliding i don't know how that's possible there are definitely still people up that way i think the teammate knows that too this is banana this guy demon he's a little bit of a demon yeah yeah i'm dying i don't like this one or two i'll mess up with it i should have looted a little bit more just looking for a two times whatever i'll make it work too bad i don't know i don't think he meant to do that i think he's going to turn right back around trying to i can see him on the mini-map train uh zones closing in and there's a good chance these guys have took the car and did we are about to find out numpty there this could get interesting it's got a sniper that's the my problem i did way more uh spray damage there than i thought i honestly thought i was gonna do zero damage there we've got a long way to go like this oh my god nice i made the right choices all right we are safe next ring's not very close i have two bats should just hold on to those i think i do need a little bit more light rounds thanks i think he can actually make it wait here we go i think he can actually make it over this wall i don't know if you have to i don't know if there's a special thing you have to do maybe on top one of these rocks i think you can actually make it over this wall saw someone do it once see up there as well i'm ultimate but zero throwables and not too many light rain so i'm honestly just down to push these guys i'm so bad he's good how am i so bad with this weapon uh you're the guys one shot nice i think you got him you can finish that kill shields recharging he's still freezing he's got him he's gone he's got it nice ah we held them all off i thought i overpeaked that because i thought i could down the lifeline and i didn't down the line and then i was stuck on a box it was an absolute disaster on all accounts we're still alive i need to switch out this e-brake i'm the worst e-brake player you've ever seen almost certainly rejuvenation uh yeah that's why i dropped mine as well i had zero i had nothing left there's something there he's seen it about i have no baths i just want to help team if i can whether to help teammate or try and pop small hills but small hills he's i don't know like with the time it takes to pop a small hill in a flight like that isn't worth the investment like he can only shoot one of us as long as we aren't in collateral range and he's got a crater you know as long as we don't stand behind each other we should be fine it's got to overcome it you need any bats teammate oh i have four of them you need this shield here teammates kind of a demon it's not much [Music] oh my god teammate careful oh my god one wants us to do against these no the guy's one shot the guy is beyond one shot i played that so well the guys literally won he landed a headshot i am absolutely furious i'm i'm i'm almost on the floor i'm i am horizontal in my chair right now i'm that furious a lot of assists a lot of assists faster it is mimi goes there's an octane here he's trying to steal my stuff oh my god get that off purple do we he's gonna arm a switch all right forget it it's a bit of a trade-off though because he's got purple but he's also got a charge rifle there we go it's the super dreams got these guys in the ropes reloading i mean i hit him for 86 i might should just push that shouldn't had a knife tour and now he's got my 30 30 all left oh god i should have just pushed when i had the chance but it's in a terrible spot if i push it mate got nothing on it he's indeed this please died that's i i'm so bad i mean i've honest i've been playing for about an hour and the amount of times i've done that with the proudest days he's bored lying not even board line it is it's embarrassing i still love the best prowler for some reason the last few days i've just been i've just been so bad with it i don't know why it's an incredibly good though that's the thing i'm doing it i've just been so bad i seen a shotgun bomb man hello for the head shots my teammate left me it's not even coming over they're screwed he's coming he's there all right we're back hey 135 there's a fight over this way though just on the hillside okay we're all over the map i don't know how this has happened but i've got a naked wingman and i'm 130 damage off red and my wingman is still naked it's all good though these guys are still fighting teammates coming over he didn't take the wraith portal but that's okay he's okay he'll get here pretty quick nearby reloading that's a sad way to die double headshot from the wingman more people to fight though these guys might be angry i stole their kill teammates coming in but he starts and he'll bless him now the charge rifle man or the dweeb machine user i need to make a video about the drive driver soon it's actually really fun and it's a course deep okay it's a caustic with a dweeb machine and he's launching these there we go he was trying to third us but then he realized that we that we'd kill them these guys had all the attachments may as well take it honestly i really like the uh the wingman iron sights but i mean the classic is too clean okay he's still around are you it's gonna get pushed by the zone we should head here there he is just cut him off he's gonna be stuck in the water stop it stop he's not to hear this of course i don't know how you'll start breathing to be honest with you shields recharging nice that got an arm switch but i think his stuff's just in the open all right this is a really slow start we've actually got a bunch of kills trying to third part of these people on the hill and they were top ten so man i hope these guys push [ __ ] i can get high ground for free here a little bit too high he's too fast i don't know what i can do we've been getting third-party a lot so i'm going to pop the back first i think we're okay on your feet darling got an arm for purple for the teammate all right there we go 2000 damage it was a really slow start but as soon as we came center of the mouth we actually found some people to shoot which is nice rejuvenation it's popping a phoenix kit on blue maybe doesn't have a health kit but there's a purple in here there you go there's actually someone there i think it's the same it's going over there for lift yeah we're good there we go two terms of fighting never mind the two teams that were fighting apparently included us or maybe he was sniping my teammate that's why i didn't see the sniper buddy go past my head or something barely even see them this is a tactic widely known as the get in their head tactic the fact that i am even challenging with a wingman and hitting my shots should be enough to scare these guys uh off the high ground and if they stay i'll do it again see i mean i missed that time but they're still shook i can't see you i literally can't even see him shields recharging you know these guys are absolutely terrified what kind of mainly i could peak with the wingman like this they are getting cratered okay i'm gonna push north because if they're getting craved if they actually get like shot by the crater there's a good chance they jump off the back which would be over this way if they jump off the back and they've been crabbed they should be one shot or maybe two 160 it's still a really bad angle though it's a terrible angle seem like he's going for it he's a changed man this guy get shot down see ya oh my word that's the crater no i've got a mobile respawn i don't even know why i'd try and place it there that's speaking deployed such a bad move please don't grab a bait thank you i'll be honest with you he might be able to see where this mobile respawn is considering he killed my teammate i don't actually know where he is and i don't know if he's rotating i'm scared to like stick the rest without knowing i mean there's not a chance he pushed his name you see it's the tactic kind of what kind of maniac stan stands there and trades with a craver when you've got a wingman at that range and lands a hundred i basically landed a crabby shot on him 130 damage that's a stupid no i shouldn't i should i need to stay alive into what like at least until my tier lands there we go otherwise the game's just over if i get headshot if he kills me before my teammate he's out of shape um he doesn't let him land and loot you know he just counts him as dead and it's got the distance i'm pretty sure this is a solo i think that's got loose he should be coming over soon please don't hedge on me please i mean i think for 90. teammates here the guy's in valley jet so i think he's healing come on come back come on come on come on this guy's got alternate craver teammates just took pres of the century i'm gonna play safety mate this is fine as long as he does like a little bit of damage teammate you're an absolute demon that's one of the biggest races i've ever seen in my entire life good job teammates nice you are the apex champions what a clutch from the boy i can't believe you head shot me that guy all those creeper shots i don't think he landed on any of us and then when he made moses god lands the most ridiculous head shot three thousand damage teammate i mean i crushed up first the 1v2 and then teammate clutches up reviving me when i got headshot cratered there's a there's a pure team effort there big w big win nice
