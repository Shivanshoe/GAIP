hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and do you guys remember the old gold r301 it was from when the game first came out back in 2019 and it had the sights on the weapons that you couldn't take off and it had the two to four variable scope i really really struggled with this back then i've sort of fixed this bad habit but back then my hands would tense up under control in mid-fight and i'd end up pressing l3 which was the button to change the scope magnification so i'd often end up just spamming this in a gunfight and messing my own aim however two years later i have managed to overcome this and i actually quite enjoy using the two to four on the r301 now i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends how many spitfires are in this building they're all low ground i think i got a heel everyone landed i guess oh my god oh my god shoot he's just the loot you know i was popping off this much old light mag i'm using the most toxic loadout over here do you remember the old gold 301 because we could change optics unlike king's canyon uh did it have the two to four times indeed indeed i'm using that i like the two departure sometimes it's not bad ah it's got it's got its moments goblin vault i mean i got no barrel stabilizers but it's okay i feel so bad he's in this loadout no no don't after the way people play shoes they may be a stuff about it i look right where was my flash standing so i have to avoid the thing but i know you were fine with the godmax spitfire oh yeah i i am chilling i die it's on my own accord are you up top yeah i think so being delivered recharging oh my god man you are trolling i'm sorry you are trolling me i can't help it with this loadout i can't i knew you weren't in danger i was fine beneath me wait is oh i'm so sad his drone blocked my bullets save his life where'd the ref go just inside oh he was that's a crypto oh he's a crypto yeah i had him not like 20 30 hp and then he pulled out i was shooting him from like up top and then he pulled out his drone and it just tanked like oh i that's genius i thought you took on a lifeline no no it was a it's crypto drone it tanked down it actually saved him it's crazy that's why watching uh i used to love watching uh i've watched him in a while but uh timmy uh play pathfinder because he uh he would grapple and you know all that momentum that you get like at the end of the grapple he would tap shave like multiple times and it would just look so cool what's it like for you to play with me then if washington was just uh just as impressive if you want more i can imagine i mean actually it's what you'd expect i would say i'm pretty sure we ran in 10 circles yeah and i think i think i hopped on a car to get to us and we'll just keep getting away we can't catch up trying to follow us you can't catch her 16 people's actually kind of a lot yeah but like where i don't know revive i'm pretty dead office hey you know dude it's the worst day of my life there's a mcbreeze point oh people here i was saying i could have responded oh that's not very likely i thought you're going to like try and trap tap strafe off something no i was trying to find like a little rat spot ah didn't seem worth it why are all the teams over here i don't what know absolutely all are are you sure are you dead it's gonna grapple in i don't care always yep what a day what a day it's been a game right here they're right on the other side of this band oh yeah oh this poor guy just has no clue that's damaged behind the rampart shows we just destroyed that same uh i was just kind of stimming around top shaping um so much fun it's the most fun i've ever had on apex at night wait for it he hit every single file i'm just moving in the most linear path imaginable he's kind of a demon isn't that building with the stairs the three floors oh yeah i'm gonna try and go around climb up we'll send the platform to the back what are you doing sir he's trying to make it so i can't get the kill it looks like that was the last one in the squad you seen oh yeah right there that's huge i have a two to four r301 uh do you have any bats uh i have two you go just for me one thank you oh maybe not no that's close uh do you need light i can drop something there's a time i mean i've got 120 i've got r9r3 thank you i've got rope oh i can't reach it oh it's tragic on the not ground floor uh oh my god almost working the ring is quite far there is not much time left ultimate accelerant and i'm good it's already got purple oh did he try and drop it here i think i think he dropped it or just wanted me to get it i don't know that's fine i'm already over it i'm closing any cracks let's go this way oh three more you drop if you can i can help from here yeah i'm dead you good oh my god sucks i was just spectating then the other guy came in really quick i like i mean i don't do but i like those mechanics it's cool when there's like extra stuff you can do yeah i think that stuff is great i just was i i didn't want it out of the game i literally just wanted to be able to do it yes i i gotta take it out just let me be able to do it come on i might might be something good this way really cracked oh this poor guy just has no clue practicing nice and uh digital spotted oh wait you [ __ ] i don't even see it oh yeah i destroyed him i'm definitely good all right oh god i'm dead oh this terrain is so annoying exercise the right guy i know the team oh he's got an eva i'm not med kits oh my god i hate that guy any medkits it was this way on the train tracks i have eleven bacarinos should be enough okay are they left uh i should be okay mate thank you though i was on decide five more so hold on i have four i'll drop you some if you need him okay here you go i want to make it 18. i'm just using my i mean maybe i'm just using themselves because i don't want to run out you know oh i didn't even realize it was about that oh yes the two to four and the r3 slaps facts is that what you've been using yeah i like it some nostalgia while you're at it uh throw a throw one or two time um on a wingman and uh nice nice job you're distracted you were punching me sir we've only got it i was not punching you right there fabrication and a lie i will not stand for it no i don't know if i saw some hop off this road what do i say did i just hear thunder this is oh i hate people this way yeah there's a fight in this corner of the map like what oh they're here it's interesting oh he did oh you're actually dead it's crazy oh my god that was really good i've hold up the law man can you make it up there with a pad not don't know i think you can right oh nice damage why is this lobby i what's going on well i knew they'd be in the corner of the map bless them their blue armor i don't i think that was their first fight of the game probably that's what happens if you land at like tree though yeah i mean a lot of people are content with that oh yeah he's just a greater success wow man you're still some more kills or something i do have the same amount of kills okay let me pull up about 15 games from the past two days boom boom just in sequence at the end of the video boom boom boom i'd like to see the games where i still kills because i literally haven't killed anyone the last two days [Laughter] i've had maybe three kills
