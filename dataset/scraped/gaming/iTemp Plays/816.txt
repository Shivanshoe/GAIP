every suppose it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more 8x legend supports and early today the apex legends team did under the deaf stream if you don't know what we sees it's about half now extreme where they talk about changes in the game that are open coming to any updates anything they've got in the works so some of the changes I'm just going to go through them really quickly here so they're booking bloodhound scan to three times the current range but doubling the activation time they're reducing the gibraltars ATS shields from seventy five down to fifty krypton now has an automatic reload on his guns when he uses his drone and the inventory is being changed to reduce the grenade spam as well all of this is coming in tomorrow's effect today however I am using the single fire hemlock again and I've rediscovered his power this is easily one of my favorite and saw rifles on the game at the moment I'm not sure if I preferred this or the habit either one of them if I see them I'm clicking it off the panel music the single fight is unbelievable I didn't use the burst fire once so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sorts in fact treaties my friends this is actually one of my favorite drops however I feel like whenever I land here I never actually make it for the end of the game you know there's always so many teams that Lundy I've seen that a hey back it up sorry path I took off all bad that's what that blue ages but alright what I forgot if I hemlock that's your kind of quiet here for saw in factory dishes place he's popping off especially the start that sounds somewhat close I've gone with the hem okay but the only thing with the hemlock is that without a sight I might be struggling nevermind after two times like a select-fire and drop this layer fire I can't I can't have three attachments find a piece keep on laughing friend we do they signify was absolutely ludicrous II wanna purple what these bunnies supreme I need to pick this weapon up more often I feel like I said about so many things but oh my god let's say why I'm suddenly saying that is because my go-to has always been by out drop that my goats has always been the author I want but it's just it's a shadow of its former self that is a prowler okay thank you don't even think about it okay thanks thanks very much French struggling a heavy hammer further up we get the are throw on he's no near as good as it used to be and the game first came out that thing was a laser beam no he's got at least amount of horizontal recoil which is the roof or that you can't really control Daisy Oh dropping the wrong things at all times and I might just be above yeah just on top of us here hope for their scrap continues though I found a drop down for the back but hopefully he comes back up I'd rather goes together sounds like there's two people at least that's okay that's incredibly lucky I could even see Saudis kneecap a few times and he's falling down all right well this has been a good body to Luke beforehand because the Peacekeeper I suspect I've got no big heels and walks all over 24 spare I've got a few syringes I've got puffs from that we are all small fields out of our mind see I'm afraid thank you that's okay hey look at him tomorrow's looking good Oh whose man is weeks who did that even the babies are one of the most dangerous animals in the world so I built this cage to keep them secure so there's no possible oh my god that's that's why I don't play Watson that's how a place in the fences damn someone is flying in on us but it's alright because we can seek refuge behind this blossom trap they won't be able to get through whatsoever I always got friends it's not worth it if I was Pathfinder I would Oh Joe nice avoid consuming minus 5 because the the Bart the orange all slugs you think that's going help try their love this single fire I love this single find this on a note both as people Rudy week and a pretty much stone from the Pathfinder I mean T that's just the way work that I love the control on the single fire I'm so happy that I booked it again okay that is a long way to the safe zone I have seven that's okay because I've got a jumped out here as well so it's not actually as long as it looks so we should be okay even with a Phoenix kit it's like a full 100 health please get down too much well fine you know panic zero panic it was like a nose off your hands 37 spare I'll tell you what's good about this as well that the same single fire hemlock is using next to no mo stats is it's very efficient it's not sprite but like do sort of spray but it's easy to land all your shots alright we've done separate ways here I'm gonna follow the path finder because he may use his ultimate and will leave us towards the safe zone even forget I places ulti down backwards just try and get the the octane out he's not using any healer boss here it's gonna go down I think I find it sticking around I mean I could just raise our mind a load of healable finally I can just use a Phoenix afterwards where are you going he's going where are you off to this is the least efficient way to the safes on earth ever so I'm going to follow him here because he's refusing to take the syringes he's come all that way to the right here for some reason I've gone in Dori sometimes I'm running in the storm I forget which way I'm supposed to go to have like a preconceived idea please take these teammate am I have to try and punch him to safety oh my quicker than him I was guys couldn't hasn't got his gun away I 11 seconds I can't punch in that fight this should be close enough now I reckon he can still run well should be fine make on this place downhill and it's the closest part to the safe zone as well and it used his ability to go three meters it's alright we made it lady in the end good great so who's gonna revive here behind as a train yard and the good news is we have a pathfinder team ring has fede father we should be fine there you go using the all ticket to get up top just as if no one sees while I'm in our spans I need stuff this game so maybe I'll have to hold on on the things from now and if we kill these guys though I'm tempted just to rush them it would be separate they are indeed the same team nice mother he's using single fire 2-2 a little bit risky one of them do you know you just get a respawn destroy name and the other one is maybe like 40 health good oh I think this is going mr. gotta respond yeah look at that women if the protesters did not find you can tell because he's lootcrate was still prayed and no color to whatsoever well the describe the distance I guess they were SEP separate teens have you made know that is a soccer ball alright doesn't matter these guys gonna have oval it I don't think I've had above 100 heavy rains this entire game things are about to change that I'll concise that off mr. mess myself up there i'ma live least without taking damage and he takes someone with my ulti you know hundred rounds I squat down I assume I got an assist on that claw did he sort of forty more people me Adam are the two girls Lee down Fabio I don't think I should have got 2 kills there I think I only got the kill credit because the other team died and I think they may have downed in to begin with pencil my strange horrendous they're all fancies got a blue barrel stabilizer for grabs more pressing concerns here let's hold them off [Applause] always got gold I want it I really want that what I've seen for a second he's healed and my team I was going to provide you I shall be doing this he's too much of a risk it's not way more help in I do mess him up teammate let's pinch oh really what's the kill there I wanted the dog chills I can't I can't take the gold chills from running from spin on a kill that's not mine people are scrapping in the distance it's worth trying to take a second ADA to make sure we got all the stuff we need done especially because I octane is only just respawn so okay checking everything for that nice is who the dilute up there I don't even think they I don't think they first did the octane okay that's in the storm now to run I think because he's been down about 12 times in the storm I think he must've just bled out really quick because that's what happens isn't it if you go down a cinematic times clouds a bad one you just end up bleeding out quicker I'm thinking mister blow down about seconds they're good they were they were finally skyhook and the ring is gonna push them out here this may be my favorite balloon on the game and the reason being is you can land on this building I mean it's our bones but you get 30 seconds hopefully they didn't already rotate it's looking like they did oh maybe they did and they made it up top that's unfortunate we could have landed up there when that with that balloon as well maybe I'm trying to take him off the high ground now it might guys are still one thing nice this is fun okay they've got a Watson ultimate up there as well there's no way I can crack someone's shield twice like that anyway that ever happens is if well it was a different person I didn't realize I saw this essential circumstance that's not the word I'm looking is like what it'll do it's good enough means that my ulti will be ineffective against in the moments the path one is used assaults in everything they've done a bit raining down fire I didn't even mean to do that one we don't need shield cells when he's a good good positioning before this ring could softly sir is flanked most important thing endgame is positioning even over loot it doesn't matter about your loops if your position is terrible oh this three squats that I thought he was us against them okay this becomes a lot easier then because now they're really distracted [Music] I don't think my dad's looking on for I have not been murdering people I'm good honestly I'd rather just take this if like I think we should three money I think we should all bombard this this is bad news because that it must be the person they were firing up I hope if I haven't come up this side notes in just yet Oh LD [Music] thinks it's a lonely Gibraltar a loan interpreter that's on fire there we go oh there's a struggle he wasn't really much of it that was a terrible bore jump it wasn't a massive struggle I mean it was a bit of a struggle to get up a storm and we landed what was that like southeast American Northwest we did do a lot of running three revives from me two revives in a respawn from the Pathfinder that was funny nearly two and a half hours of damage 13 kills 22 squad kills we eliminated over a third of the lobby that's actually pretty good I'll take that I love Bangalore again I'm telling you I these last few games i've chosen bangalore instead of pathfinder I'm really trying to mixed up with the legends go I know I spam Pathfinder all the time trying to change that but thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one
