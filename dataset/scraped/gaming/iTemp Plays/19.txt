hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and a little bit of a warning here i am about to spoil who is getting the next heirloom although this was leaked probably back in the 90s it is valkyrie now the problem i'm seeing here is that typically when apex releases an heirloom they buff that character to cause more excitement to make them more fun to play because obviously this correlates to alien sales like obviously no one wants to play a character that's bad and if they don't want to play them they're not going to buy an air loop but valkyrie is incredibly good and it got me thinking i wonder if they'll try and buff her like slightly just to make her a little bit more fun to play she absolutely doesn't need this by the way i think she's really good and i'm hoping that they do not prefer anyway when her heirloom gets released i don't know when it is but i'm fairly certain it is the next one to be released i have a great game here for you today the back and forth here is crazy all the way to the end so i'm sure you will enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends b-20 double p20 what the heck that's a bow online i'll take it i have all the light in the world so fine by me uh okay so i think we dropped name i'm gonna have to take it sorry guys we met online i'm coming i don't know the people are fair i mean we did good though only 90 damage i took like 20. that's going to drop down it's annoying shot in the back nice brush these guys was going to get on the back yes go get them on the nice team we did really well there to um to focus the squad trying to third parties and shoots in the back and double headshot with the wingman i still think he's going to kind of shoot you can use this inside like how effective is it honestly pretty good that's all good and different ones oh okay you were done i'm sorry it's one teammate nice try time that worked perfectly same tactic then bam oh oh my god no no no no come on come on come on come on come on there's like eight teams down there you're by yourself i've got no health do i just drop to go unfortunately left grenade let's get his banner let me heal up a little bit first i've already got a wingman i guess i should have changed that guy but didn't know he was like popping a bat let's bring him home i'm gonna leave him spaghetti you go that way okay well i have no lights does anyone have any see that's why the wingman is just so good you barely need anything for it i've got a naked wingman i got you don't worry i got you i've got a naked wingman and i'm just like killing people with purple armor because a headshot just does so much damage he might be coming this way he might be coming this way too i'll try and defend so i've just committed with the fuse like sometimes it's better even if it wasn't the best option for me because i had no health if i could have just gone in and let them shoot him instead because he had like full purple i still could have helped i guess i don't know i need light rains i'm gonna have to loot some of this see anyone here i took a little bit of light where do we go kinetic feeder i mean do you want a third that or do we just go how does this go not far enough is that my teammate's fuse oh that's actually so good that guy there have too move guy it's ash of course it's an ash [Applause] oh my god okay well they're they're out of here we could chase i guess nearly stunned him adam clutch there's only two of these guys so dodged they have to be in here right i hate when you have a throwable and you throw it and it's like you want to throw another throwable no one at a time please i'm i'm missed okay i've got a pretty good loot though we've got loot for the teammates no i wanted to use the mastiff so bad i think i just double headshot the octane and get the ash for like a hundred and something with the pk actually pretty good like you need a shotgun man like i'm like nowadays you need a shotgun i've got good teammates at the moment but most of the time i don't if your teammates aren't that good shotguns are so clutch they're like the 1v2 1v3 weapons poke in and out of cover minimal risk maximum reward oh right on us just in case there's someone here he's trying to keep them but if i were them i'd just go either way i have 24 cells good grief easy enough probably not if you guys see any cells let me know these poor guys oh there was a dj back there are they in here no downed one how did that god get downed i don't remember that can you sit on top of this or do you get he electrocuted you gotta kill anyone i don't mind leaves this is gatekeeper the century on these guys hopefully then we'll use it to yeah i thought we're going to try and pop it back honestly these poor guys man i mean we're going to get gay cup now why so elusive stop it nice that was the whole squad two other squads left too many of those i wish i still have alcohol which way this way no antenna side it's a good job i checked the map would have been stuck over the other side of that mountain i have no med kits i actually might be dead too much gatekeeping oh wait i have valkyr we'd have been completely fine i'm dead i don't have heat shields and i don't have med kits i have to go if i know i've got my velcro when we're in there could we craft medkits we can't go back on the zone with these guys here i have charge rifles too this sucks are you left that's fair enough i don't think we're gonna be able to get him i have three syringes if you need them got my mastiff let's scope this quadrant out here ultimates already say the word and we'll be in the clouds i can also have these guys over here if you come to me we can valkyr from here he's he's just he's disconnected to do what is my luck on this game i've got to play against these guys sat on top with a charge rifle don't know if i can clear this i'm valkyr from like here maybe i'm waiting till like 20 seconds and then i've just got to go like what is my look what is please but they're not even pushing they know they have the hill advantage i've just got to go they're already celebrating they know they've won this wait captioning not [Music] least i'm just a available i'm just a little solo boy hello can i find this hello you can't find that he's entered the game he's back he's back good timing mate i'll come get you i'm on the way that sucks not safe here am i safe here yes but then i'll struggle to get out so i'll have to jump out there i have to wait here for a knock or something i mean i was safe there but i hate the idea of having to run through the zone when i don't have med kits i've only got three that'll do like if that's like two ticks if i take two ticks of damage there and someone's waiting for me i'm just dead 45 seconds to spare too i have to wait until they are forced off there because they're just sat on top or inside just a little hello to the horizontal you don't want to do that wings one bed oh so close ah it was just this guy it was just him i only pushed okay i had him crack two if i'd landed that second a massive shot on the seer and downed him obviously i'll win that game how why are they horizon alting themselves i thought they were all in there what happened oh my god i'm like i'm one massive shot away from winning that game and i nearly killed the last five people that was a bit of a banger though i was a bit of a banger mastiff he's he's he's too good by the way i've been so broken did you
