hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and today we are playing with my good friend aleister ray into ranked here on pc i made it to gold and we're still climbing i have had a fair few comments as of late saying oh you're in bronze you're you're in silver i i just started ranked on pc okay i'm level like 67 or something you've got to climb through the ranks you can't just i can't just email mr respawn and say put me in diamond oh yeah i've gotta get there but anyway i'm renting now this was my first time using the red crater which is the heirloom glass crater from the care package you guys know that i'm not much of a sniper on apex legends and picking up the crabber never seems to work out for your boy but i hid some nice shots in this one you just gotta wait for me to get the gun it is worth it yeah hopefully you enjoyed the game i'm sure you will if you do be sure to leave a like creating and subscribe to join the item player and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sprinting at the speed of light to these things could last a while doesn't it love that it does yeah i think anyone was landed here with us so i think we're okay nice can actually be useful i'm gonna crack myself one two pick up all the light you can on the way as soon as you know you can yes good idea i'm gonna do two i might go for the same loadout [Music] replicator gang oh baby can i make something whilst the other one's doing it yeah yeah you can use all three terminals yeah it's great nice i like it efficiency you can use it just to print ammo constantly oh yeah that's a good point i don't want to make anything else oh wait i could how much this area have you looted um like all of those little caravans not really caravans but the r301 is 18 bullets as standard that's pretty low it is low oh nice level two are you gonna grab that yeah i've got one i've got one yeah oh i can hear shots well i say i can hear them i don't know if i actually knew me or not okay i think that means maybe maybe near him i don't know i do not know do you speak russian i do not definitely shots right next to me i think they're going for the um the vault maybe in before all of it's over get ready to run off if it's not yeah with that octane ability come out come out wherever you are i'm not i can see the i can see that the loot box is there i can hear people yeah i can see people yeah they're here i'm just being quiet they're here all the way down one nice another one to my right push up push up nice nice let's go gg rich nice work let's go he's got the full key oh yeah he's right there there you go i use it yeah push again let's go battle stabilizer bro i'm a young god of loot now in the golden good oh my gosh my first ever time opening the vault key come here teammate where are you off to mate let's get it center let's go oh oh my god this is sick oh look at over legendary stuff can i just grab anything i think it all mate grab it all right so there's a there's a bow stabilizer i don't think i need that knock down shield bro i'm basically rich in apex oh oh an extended heavy mag is that what you want oh no no no no it's not he's not use that oh i needed it can i be a little bit cheeky you know the goal he has the same defensive properties as this helmet here but it's like reduction but your ability is like zero call down anyway okay reduces tactical and ultimate recharge time yep mate there you go thank you thank you thank you it's the same definitive abilities i found i appreciate it small charge okay you set up a few kills for me that's just a very bad idea if we end up when i was dying if we do that so just kill anyone you see wait that's a lifetime that's a lifeline pack dropping oh look safe okay i'm coming contact he's coming out he's teammate very slowly yeah he is to be fair i can't knock that just seeing if there's anything else in here that could be useful they're here at the door i'm fine i'm fine i'm not gonna have commit i've been scanned your ability and just try and get a little bit further back yeah good idea bait them in bait them in i sent one of them back nice things you'd love to see good timing good timing i'm gonna need it big names yeah they're falling back once blue shields nice i'm so confused oh easy it wasn't it wasn't him yeah blue shield blue shield down down down that one close to you rich on your left i think come on back let's get it oh i'm spraying from the head from being less effective than i thought i couldn't really see i think i came all the way from epicenter to help us what a guy honestly you gotta you gotta i'm gonna gigi i don't really know what that meant and he's probably a bit confused by now but everything's gonna leave so gg see ya gg he's got a squad right done with apex now what gg means in russia that's a really good point we can give him the old flank roommate yeah i've got the laser beam still lots of players left which oh yeah this is going to be a big a big ending i'm going to clutch up my ball for that  shots yeah yeah we're getting on the mountain yeah here we go okay take me out beam me up scotty oh gosh i can help you with my ultimate if you want it i think i'm okay gee you could probably use yours as well but oh yeah that would be pretty sick actually just here mate he's getting ready to shoot him he's trying he's trying not to are they on the hill opposite yeah they're literally right here let me know where you want to go i'm ready once cracked nice mate one's right on me right down low here right one shot nice just his core stick stand down dead nice team oh team bro our teammate actually was so 200 iq and you to wait for the shots to go down i thought he was going to get a bit angsty but no he waited he waited or was a creeper in here i know you can't use it but our teammates max and keyboard oh uh extended heavy nomi i can't find what i'm afraid people don't really use light you know hey i beg our teammate just picks up that crate but turns around and pops that dude that would be so satisfying i'm tempted to give it a go oh i've decided level three it's light what's yours what's your do you need one because you're running double r3 right every no i've only got one but everything's been attached let me just take this should have dropped somewhere i think it's in the box yeah headshot one nice i think i got away i'm afraid i didn't really put much damage into him yeah [Music] you have to be careful here i'm just going to hold this high ground actually i'm going to go right a little bit rich yeah me too exactly where you are yeah yeah that's playing a bit aggro but they're just getting inside nice we should be able to get quite a nice line of yeah here they've just jumped up broke one of their shields here mate are so many teams i'm just sitting down and putting my phoenix kit on just try and get somewhere safe is this on me please don't be on me i'm gonna die here no i've got self-revive kit you gotta sell for five i'll try and hold people off this is lunacy this is the longest self-revive in my life but i will do it no i'm down nice nice it's our teammate just clutched up but you have clutched up that's the life oh no i've never been oh we got flanked by about eight teams are we dead no i'm a lie still just a baby okay that's fine that's fine it's fine it's fine it's gonna chill for a sec i'd literally turn around and headshot someone like from that of the same and knock them but we just couldn't commit to it damn all right i've got a little while i should i should have just gotten out of there no there's nowhere ready to go mate she's gonna get the notification i'm aiming at her not worth i need to try and sneak you guys it's okay don't stress too much about us as long as he's got 27 just wait for them to go maybe yeah just let him can i help his teammate i've probably stolen all of my sick r301 loop your last name probably has 14 seconds chill oh my god we just down so many people huge absolutely godly little you can't go on there no that's that's that's just not funny i'm gonna leave him i think i've done one from each team nice let's go there 30 seconds to get there you got this you got it i'm going to shield oh i need to go to your left i think let's go takes 10 seconds for you to get back so you should be fine to run from this just 10 seconds tick tock oh god nice your god i'm giving my shields when he's coming over trying to spy from the sky if you mate they're like upside down um yeah they're above you therefore if you've got this two there's one maybe two one still above i'll try and land them and punch you maybe one here okay yes sorry he just eliminated no she's not on the rest she's pressing him up oh nice name i need to i need to get rid of the lifeline she will just keep raising them final squad great little spot oh my gosh how'd that miss me oh please don't i have no big hair you got this i'm not pushing oh if i hit that shot headshot no that's so annoying dude he still he hoovered up some good loot i think chill chill chill chill chill i need to help nice big damage huge little play here love it love it richard love it mate love it get that damage in me i'm gonna start a race i think could have seen some of my earlier creeper shots i was oh i was popping off i heard them but yeah that's crazy i'm glad you picked it up man let's go i wasn't confident with it either but mate look at the sevens the lucky sevens why do i feel like i'm popping off and it's like you did 200 damage
