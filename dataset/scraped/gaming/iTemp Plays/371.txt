hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are running solo i want to improve my game on apex and the best way to do that is to run solo sometimes anyone can play with giant toys so far and win a game but trying to win solo in these lobbies is actually kind of difficult now my first game that i have for you today i actually got carried but in the second game i was beaming with the vault dropped 2700 damage in just a nine minute game i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay i did not think we were gonna land this quick uh someone's already been this way teammates i am weaponless i'm defenseless it's okay i've got a sentinel charge rifle uh would you like a charge rifle thank you so much this is the worst trade deal of all time for you you've been you've been big scanned to your lober the charge rifle's so useless you didn't even want the sniper rammer it's a good gun but not not not for at the start of the game where everyone's close range you know third party although i'm not sure how long i'm going to be using the uh i'm not too confident in my abilities with this gun it's fun but if you miss even even two if you missed two two shots then you'll just scream agreed if you miss one you're pretty much screwing the grooves my teammates are popping off you're dead my teammates right behind you it's the best line in the entire game maybe one voice line that's even close i mean maybe last one down at a boom boom from lifeline but apart from that i don't think any voice line gets close uh okay low ball tomorrow's inside i need a few light rains uh hopefully a bit more than 15. is the two times the best thing in here we could check out here all of these awful stacks you guys have dropped me like 180 bullets yeah you said you have to try and connect it to anything sometimes pathfinder's ultimately a bit awkward i think it's because i was behind the railing and i couldn't actually fly that way you know right it's pretty user error most of the time but i do find his ultimate a little bit awkward people scrapping i have three kills and not even 200 damage i'd like to apologize to the squad because i've clearly i've clearly been stealing some some of these kills let's explore this way cancel that it's almost left isn't it i don't think they're selling cookies that's what's launching out getting in the mix that's gonna walk and he's also fluffing the shield as well no he's not he canceled it's got five seconds of my grapple skill absolute disaster i barely went anyway how is that not let me climb there oh no how am i so bad with this gun how i'm so bad all right apparently there are people here we've stabilized teammates cleared up going back in the game uh there are 13 people left i mean that's okay we can get a win here it seems absolutely popping off replicators they don't even need me i feel like i'm just an accessory here maybe i should have just stuck with the sentence not sure how that was gonna work until you can shoot them when they're on the ground this guy's just they tanking everything one moment all right nice squad three teams left look out and we've already found our next track no i need two damage for red i don't want to pop this back unless i get red i'll walk around with no shields on yes down nice pretty sure we've got all of them we got the bloodhound we've got the path in the lobby nice two squads left we are absolutely destroying this lobby you finally might have been training skyhook the entire time reloading all right this is where we started the game maybe not just got red it must been scrapping someone don't mind me i've still got a level one helmet literally no one had better than a level one although level two helmets are one of the items that i seem to miss a lot so let's be real it was probably just my paul looting oh they're all just enemies no come on someone's got a crater unwind just out of top yeah they must be scrapping someone walking around with reds and stuff i think we just must have rotated around the wrong at the wrong time to catch him please don't eat me there you go this guy's dead for the hard carry good grief i never drop down okay but as you can see i don't know the tactics if this guy landed at this gun and he was an enemy i'd have been i'd have been dead well here we go my favorite gun ever but he right i need to get better with this gun the only way to get better with the gun is to use it all anymore oh bad i'm going to need my shield back that was an absolute tragedy i landed some shots of the eve right and then i landed about three shots with the vault and your shield is still better than mine you need this teammate for grabs oh thank you here we go did a little trade deal the blue armor for a medkit i mean if i wanted to miss every shot that i fired i'd definitely switch out the vault for this uh this bow check i'd run the bow check either eight possibly the worst two guns for me hey 135 spray not bad now for the third time this game all from a valkyrie i mean these guys are both cracked i've got every faith in the squad here look at them go nice any energy bullets energy i shall let you know if i find one i'll be honest if i'm not using a heavy gun my mind doesn't even register what i'm looking at when i loot i just look for things that don't have that like little red x on them oh here we go half the squads remain let's keep winning are we too late for the scrap it appears though it's ended yeah i should have i should have been using the eave right there as well this it's my main gun it's not my assault rifle whenever you don't know where to go on olympus got my name in the map there the unwritten rule is uh if you're looking for a scrap there's only one place to go do you guys even need that too no you don't you've got boom purple okay that was a waste of time oh the honest role is of course to meet at the fountain at any point during the match if you want someone to shoot it's just the way it works that was always going to happen wasn't it not too far away wrapping around here is always risky because there are so many ways to fall off teammates grenade well they found someone else to scrap which is nice they thought they were third party but now they're getting third partied why us oh how the turns have tabled yeah hop on idea i know he wouldn't nice teammate oh my god i forgot about these boys oh god i don't even need to throw into the smoke nice unfortunately for me these guys literally didn't they didn't they weren't moving they were just walking forwards like the terminator one moment how are you good i should have given this the bangalore i was focused on the compliment sure should i tell them the real the real reason that's that's my secret to success there we go you don't even want to mess around on this rope he says ah okay he thinks i'm a noob no yeah just playing controller the game plays itself patching myself up how about you guys but i heard a bit of a scrap in this direction most powerful handgun on the frontier i don't know like have you seen the hammer point mozam this is bad news these guys gonna land we need to deal with these guys pretty quick they should be on the ropes because they were flying away from the other team and i'm also on the road but i'm i'm trying to get to them you know it's a different kind of one's a metaphor my vault today is just seem different and from this point onwards i would like to share with you my commitment to try and reduce the amount of good grace i commit to the commentary like where did these other squad go did they ever turn up did they just leave us alone or what oh here they are three years later [Music] friends okay did we trade we traded okay big revive that go back as well oh we just rolled the lobby we just robbed them guys need to stand a chance wasn't even close how many one clips do i get there with the vault thank you for carrying you are the apex champions i went down i died you guys didn't come over and help we won't we won the one it's a team game a 2700 damage in less than 10 minutes and i could have thirsted a few times at the end there to try and boost out a 3000 not like i needed to or anything but you know we left a few people on the ground it sub 10 minutes i'm happy that that was a great game well thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
