guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and with how apex has been recently i've had no other choice but to turn into the ultimate try hard i'm busting out wraith and i'm only using the flatline peacekeeper combination maybe then i stand a chance in some of the lobbies that i get into ironically though once i decided on this tactic the game gave me a favorable lobby it could probably sense that i was getting angry at dying to more three stacks but i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends got an evo shield here level two i'll back that contact for target we can cruise over here to be honest but it still helps all right we have to get to cap otherwise we're not going to find anyone this entire game like we have to get over there immediately let me get some of these i have so many bats i have six bats take me to cat please i need to recharge my shields we could fly but they are right here i don't know if they're bottom floor or not it appears appear as though they are maybe uh this is a bit of a risk but i wanted to take it we have to get involved you know another one i really want this this pk recharging my shields they're reviving right here i need some help over here one second we got this could have gone to cover recharging my shields i mean they're reviving i could just go and get them headed to you have a phoenix kit for him phoenix kid here contact thanks brother one sec let's go this quadrant i'm taking shots enemy shield broken enemy down i was my teammate fortunately another team though second team be careful bring down some destruction i just if i was valk i'd just be flying up top right now let me give you a bow i like that reloading for is it just a revenant my abilities aren't working okay it was another guy so i don't know where he is that's the problem okay well one's up top but one isn't one's like here jump shot me from across the map i like this teammate he just likes to jump he's just jump shine everyone okay because we might be in the zone here we've got a minute 16 but it goes quick oh my god we got a valkyrie a lot of first thing going on i like this get him out of here i like that too apart from that we're looking good we can falco from here we should contact i think they're up there anyway don't they have to move enemies what are they doing hello that much i'm gonna be real slow where's this team at they have to have gone this way need to recharge my shields i mean i took a risk there i just assumed he backed up because there was so many of us shooting him yeah right here the original plan was to go up there and face i don't know he's over this way if we're talking about the same guy anyway give me a sec did he go for the care package yes he did he's down here attack with enemy solid copy oh it sucks i'm gonna bump into the team it doesn't really matter how far this guy gets zone awareness of all time though he's gonna bump into the last team yes it sounds like he did come back down amiga oh they've got a fuse and a seal i feel like i need to keep a lookout in contact with enemies there a guy behind or is it just the drone hopefully i get grief in the back oh my god he crafted a rampage what who we playing against i'm scared reloading it down i'm gonna take your thirst damage i'll take something oh my god he's got a gold one he didn't craft it enemy shield's broken i think he's getting shot on the side of the guy over the wing man enemy down what is this ending i think there's only one guy left i'm pretty sure after this fuse give me all the nights i'm gonna start launching guys where are we going i'm about to phase onto my own grenade it must have been close portal's ready nice good game yeah i like landing inside give me a god he's right with the two times man i'm ready to scrap hey what more does a guy need i'll tell you what though i've got a turbo if you find a hammer i got a i got my my 30 30 and i got my r99 huge i don't really know what's up this rope i'm taking it uh it's just like a vantage point but we should be able to throw them yep [Music] oh yeah they're inside oh i don't know [Music] [Music] i've never gotten heirloom just from packs but mind you i don't open facts yeah we should do that and whoever gets the heirloom the first that just want me with the pk wait you're pushing me he's awake always where's the other team now oh no there was they were fighting somebody oh down low guys [Music] [Applause] by
