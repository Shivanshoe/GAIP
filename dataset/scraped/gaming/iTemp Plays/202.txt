thank you to ea for sponsoring today's video today we are playing apex's new raiders event and in the background you are watching me open up the last of my raiders event packs and then eventually we get to watson's heirloom as well which i showcase in game and in the fire range after that game as well i'll let you guys watch the watson heirloom unboxing one heirloom pack remaining what does that look like here one apex pack has got it tells you what hello you're going to get on open packs 3 302 that's quite a lot of packs but this is the most important one out of the 302 that i have there is the heirloom energy reader live and warning high voltage hopefully is trm telemetry receiver module it's got the nessie on the top it's got some little cap pictures which i'm a fan of it's got a little power switch this part here looks 3d printed in fact it's pretty all 3d printed it's got a little joystick equip that what else do we get we got a little intro quick try as you might you can't kilowatt son get it on there equipped to emote wheel i'm gonna spam that all game long and there we get the heirloom pose as well i think it is time to play a bit of watson don't go there okay i'm gonna land here oh my word we shouldn't have we definitely shouldn't have never mind i'm gonna defend us flatline r3 that blues out though no no i need the shield please i want that shield down oh okay it's okay oh we've got anyway it's fine was she the only one that landed over there oh i forgot i forgot that i had the hello oh that's a great animation what do the ones like is it just this usually they have a ton of animations you can use you can hit them on the head with it okay i didn't expect that start to go that well what's the inspect animation like how do i do that again that's not it hang on there are a few of them there's the nessie on the way don't mind if i do little mag i'm gonna take a big hill just because it sucks not to have too many of them to start the game all right good job team i should get all three of those as well it's a light making the crafter which is a little bit annoying because i just used the low but ultimate to get a level two i could have just made level three but there's two people over here enemies over here level two of them but she's got gold armor and i didn't actually crack her over here i don't want to go on there shouldn't even give me the chance to get it she wanted to have that at all they were getting shot by someone else though so we should probably head back up top because they might be trying to get to us liberals here though i can't expect it to be too much in here oh someone made it for me wait that wasn't my teammate was he and then he came over i have so many bullets all right what happened to the team this keeps scaring me i keep forgetting and i have it bam i've got a hit i've got a bam i'm just gonna do that to someone this game i mean i don't need anything from this i might as well get some throwables uh two times or work and then maybe a frag grenade oh this hits with some venom you know not that one when you hit him over the head with the butt of the gun whatever the reader i like the the run animation too that's when you land when you start sprinting that's when you stop okay that's the animation when you start sprinting can i make it up here no absolutely not oh they've got a genius idea if you guys draw them into the water i'll go with these i will electrocute them i knew there was going to be a team over there white safety so that killed didn't mean to obviously he was fairly weak himself so nice job team bam sorry i just i need to hit someone over the head with it i really do like 300 heavy challenging she wants to get the care package i assume it's a good plan get ourselves a crater around one crater man you're screwed if you land down low here don't land or have to hop off because you can't climb any of the walls yeah she's going to get that's fine i actually i really like the r301 flatline combination what's nato nice are you taking it my favorite kind of loot is i assume she uh she had ages to take if she wanted it so maybe she just didn't fancy what was the animation did you see that it's like juggling i haven't used any more abilities yet just as an update enemies i got prowlers on him that's my favorite um [Music] animation no i tried to use his cover i'm an idiot and plus i hadn't alternated i didn't use it thanks amigo i messed up just stopping i don't have any any made any med kits that's a huge phoenix kit all right we've been given a second chance here by the teammates for some reason i thought i was hitting the shrubbery and i wasn't she could see where the bullets were coming from obviously oh i've got two knocks there okay nice bathing booth my friend goodness knows where these people died bam idiot need to get some of these one of those nice fantastic work by the squad i don't have a single assist yet which i feel like is a bit of a scam on the team but that's my favorite animation where she goes to drop it nice job i thought he's gonna come behind the cover who on earth revive these people i've used one ultimate in that state this game we've got 10 seconds recharging is that the worst grenade of 2021 or what are you kidding me are you keep silent okay necessary the prowler just absolutely trolled me by the way absolutely trolled me we need to get this our teammate back to the uh back in the game there's a mobile in the crafter oh there are people that way i have seven med kits please don't spot me that would hurt my feelings oh the defense is actually helped there because they couldn't push in low back you might draw attention to us but i think they're okay i think they're too distracted here we go oh it's hot the one behind me i'm dead i'm dead ah the guy went up top and i couldn't cover him from down low i could not cover him from down low darn it that is so unfortunate we had the easiest third party on these guys too what'd you guys think about the heirloom let me know in the comment section down below i'm actually playing a game what was that i didn't mean to cancel i was just sliding [Music] actually like the thumbstick actually wait the thumbstick is what i'm doing wait that's not no it's going backwards and it's going upwards every time i use my left stick it just puts that one further up you see that it's even got like the sensitivity just a little bit and then fully i like this it's got a lot of detail to it which i knew it would a lot of people were about this heirloom if i knew there'd be a load of added extras that make it unique and fit watson's persona and law so there you go thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
