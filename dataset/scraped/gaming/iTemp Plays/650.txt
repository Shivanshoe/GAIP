hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some more lifeline here as promised and i'm loving playing her at the moment uh when she was reworked it was quite obvious that she was no longer going to be the solo queue legend any longer you don't have the fast heels she's still low profile all of that good stuff but her new passive makes her the best team player on the game not only that but you can actually use those revive shields to your advantage and i can't believe how well it worked out for me here in the game that i have for you today i basically had to cross an open field and janks was down and i essentially used him uh to make my own cover so i was able to cross safely it worked out beautifully so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i hope you enjoyed today's video i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends finally we're back home boys what if what if they drop the new map on our beans tomorrow oh my god i imagine come back imagine the scenes were just talking about you yeah jenks called you bad get ready i did no such thing i i wouldn't even argue that

diva no it's real one now oh nelly okay so this is all it takes all we got to do is get a little bit of loot and then we're chilling that's literally it and then we gotta hope for like a pop in second half of the game because yeah you know we're getting good loot first half of the game is gonna be myth any zip lines nah play it and i got it now maybe we go you go train who's ready yeah or maybe harvester through through here and then go to harvester from the back right oh okay i need to go through like the tunnel or anything just because it's the edge of zone we'll probably run into a team rotating i'd assume i felt crazy because i have a gold bag i can play crazy because you'll go back oh yeah rotating with back off my jinx there's definitely a little trail but i don't know where you went yeah there's like little one times hogs and stuff on the floor yeah it's a little trail of loot and gas traps weird oh my god dude why is it so hard to find people flashing in the air we'll get third-party yeah all eight squads will be here like in ten seconds there you go lifeline package are you sure basically where we came from in capital by the way no way oh my god ah thank you me yeah so there's def there's a lot of fighting going on in in capital now a fragment whatever dude yeah it's it's i mean it makes no sense we literally could have just stayed there and fought like the whole game honest i feel like that's the way that's the way this goes yeah but all these teams have to rotate i'm actually gonna push up electric let's go to my hemlock though i got one nice uh no that was a bloodhound with full white though remember that the teams have to come this way jeez thank you they're on the right we're running we're running right into the sun he's right here what are they doing careful i'm coming back so we don't get it you grow yeah caps last team is that the team is that a team firing a tunnel uh i don't know if that pathfinder will got like one final grenade toss off at me or i don't know no they're back here yeah yeah one right here that's huge they're both right here bloodhounds dropping back oh i hit a jump pad right there right there other side of the side now one shot nice dude dude way to go congratulations that's called dude nice job dude i was gonna come out but there was a jump pad behind me i walked backwards and i got sent over to this court nice the gold bag lifeline is like stupid good like actually stupid you were in the middle of the open there like that should have been a 1v2 i know ralph is that mal yeah he just thinks i'm talking to him
