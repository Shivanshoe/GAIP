this video was made possible by ea game changers all right we're counting down to watching the new apex legends season 7 trailer this is going to show more of the new map it's going to show more of the new legend and the vehicles as well i got a chance to play this yesterday so i know a lot about the new things that are coming to the game i will talk over the uh the trailer here to begin with but i won't pause it uh i'll probably go back at some stages just to talk about some of the more specific details obviously this is horizon and we get to see the map more clearly here this is one of the rotational portals you get to see horizons ability the gravitational lift the map is like i just look at the colour scheme going on here the range of colours this is inside the rift it's like uh it used to be like the the research area but then something happened something bad happened you see there on the on the left hand side there it is uh that's going to be one of the hot drops i think it's going to be like a mini school team a bunch of people kept landing there when we were landing there as well olympus is incredible you guys are going to absolutely love this map i've i loved it everyone that i spoke to who loved the math there are so many positive comment about this when we got to play it yesterday as well i love how it's showing pretty much everything that's new by the way octane has a problem here the parallel is now a care package weapon it replaces the r99 which is now back in the floor link which is always nice because people missed the r99 me included i can't wait to try and bond click people with it and probably fail maybe if they have white armor i won't clip them but anything more i'll be i'll be struggling and look at the range these look like different maps you know the range of gunfights that you can have on this the the intrical places to explore within each of the areas you've got the trident here very easy to drive very intuitive it has a boost function in there too you can't waste uh give you the walls you can play sheila on the back as well the new legend is extremely useful especially on this map he works really well with this map in my opinion i'll explain more here back in a second and then you have it my friends apex legends season seven that's a great skin listen to battle pass that's one of horizon's finishing moves so i guess where we start we'll start with the biggest thing this is this is the new map and i guess for this i'll just i'll replay this because where am i going i'll go here because you get to see it during the maps the map is incredible you can see the range of gunfights going on here you've got the little small villages the points of interest you can see back here the uh it doesn't look as open as it actually is if you get caught around this area i'll just let it play because you will get to see again uh if you did miss it the first time if you get corny open in a big field and someone's got a g7 scout and you're not pathfinder or octane or maybe even loba to teleport your brace this uh you are screw magrude i think the term is you you will die i i believe this guy's got a crater i think it's pathfinder he's you see crypto got corny open and now he's i know he's a goner uh the map's incredible i i believe that when world's edge came out people didn't like it as much as king as much as king's canyon i was one of those people but now i prefer board's edge to king's canyon and i think this is an improvement on world's edge it takes the best parts of world's edge which is the fact that it's a little bit bigger you don't get third parted as often uh it's got the fact that you have more city fights like capital is by far the funniest place to fight on apex legends in my opinion much like skulltown was back when it was in the game because it it was like a little city it was a little town and this this map olympus has so many of those areas to go and fight people you just gotta avoid the big fields now in terms of the guns obviously i said the prowler is now a care package weapon but when we got to play yesterday as well uh it was obvious that some guns had been changed and buffed uh i'm talking about the l-star i'll talk about clubs here in a second you guys need to pick up the l star in the new season it's incredible jax was talking to me he was saying i'm gonna play rampa because it buffs the l star even more the gun is a melt machine i i killed saw johnny in a 1v1 because i had the all-star true true story and then i and then i popped to finish a move i'm sorry it was a little bit toxic i had to do it johnny killed me before like two years ago one and a half years ago maybe i finally got my revenge i didn't expect to kill him i was very very happy i'm talking over so many different points of the thing i need to i need to be pausing this what am i doing hold on all right so let's talk about club shall we this is the way that they've decided to show it and when they were talking to us the devs when they were talking to us about clubs they said that they decided to limit it to 30 people per group per club so it's not going to be something that i can just make the item pirate club and i can invite all of you guys over to join and get the opportunity to to play with hr i get the opportunity to play with you guys as well it's limited to 30 because they thought it was more focused it's more about a friendship group you can limit the clubs to only allow players and that have reached a certain rank so if you're in gold or if you're in platinum and you're trying to make a diamond or master but you just don't have the people to play with you can search for a group where uh your lifetime rank has to be a minimum of platinum or it has to be minimum of diamond and then you can find people to play with that also playing solo and you can climb to masters it's really good for that function it's not going to be something that i use as a care package is this guy floating of course he's like floating in the air they've just placed him there i think he's literally and dibby they're all floating this is the magician's club over this way so i want to talk about the new hovercar the new trident as well so these areas are on the outsides of the map you can use it as a rotational tool because you know that when you're driving around this area there's not going to be a gibby sat there away smooth ultimate because it's a death sentence there's absolutely zero cover around here so these cars they've really made the points and put the focus on making them good rotational tools but you don't be caught out with them too much because obviously when you're on the vehicle as a teammate you are you are hanging off the edge it's kind of difficult to shoot people and when the car gets shot it doesn't do damage to the car it spreads that damage equally amongst all the members on the vehicle so if you shoot with the g7 scouting it does 36 damage you're doing 12 damage to everyone on board and you can hit this car extremely easily because obviously it's a big boy it's very easy to hit so oftentimes if someone is coming towards you with this vehicle make sure your team is focused firing them uh and they'll have to drive away and heal up also this part here very dramatic uh they they fell off the edge of the map they got oxide that does disable the vehicle don't worry okay the people in this car were fine when your vehicle is driven off the edge of the map uh you respawn but well you don't respawn it just sends you upwards and you sort of float to safety that's sort of like when you fall in the lava on world's edge because i guess they did that so you can't troll your teammates you can't invite uh i couldn't invite jenks inside the vehicle and because we've had a massive falling out i'll drive him off the edge of the map and he dies i can't do that unfortunately i'd love to you know me and jenks are really hating each other right now so that would have been great it's actually the first thing i tried when we played together yesterday and also i don't know if you realize that like this is one of the smaller ramps on this map like during this trailer you've been able to see absolutely ginormous ramps and the cars the tridents come with a boost function on there the amount of cars that i saw just full-on heated is the only word i can think of you can go flying in these things you will go miles oh this is a good transition let's talk about the new the new legend horizon so when other legends have come out let's talk about crypto watson you got loba rampat i know there's others but those are the last four that i can think of they were somewhat underwhelming when they came out they weren't they weren't like instantly the new meta maybe watson was in competitive they did have to know for a little bit but in public matches you didn't really see her that often horizon i think is in a really good spot her ultimate is incredible her gravity lift offers some uh well-needed mobility on this map it is a good ability to use however her strength comes with this ultimate you will get sucked into it it's a black hole of doom it is so strong that even as a pathfinder i tried to grapple out to safety i was struggling i couldn't really make it i nearly died to this thing so many times yesterday if you see a horizon on the enemy team the last thing you want to do is is group up because you will get three men altered uh they will throw a corsica quarterman at you they will throw an ark star a thermite grenade they will shoot you and you will all die so you want to escape this because it's real good that's my advice to you some early season seven advice or even like wait this guy's using it with a gibby ultimate that's also incredible i didn't even think of that these guys are geniuses over apex i've had a little scan through the uh the trailer here and i haven't been able to find it but do you remember when they released i don't know if they released loba or if they released revenant for this one but it's when they did the cinematic and it was revenantly came and he killed loeb's parents i think it might have been when when logan was released but that area is on this map it took place on olympus you can go up there it's a restaurant you can take the zipline all the way to the top of the tower there are little walkways where you can go and fight people it's it's incredible honestly i know i keep saying it but the map is so good it is so intricate i've said it a few times it really is this video is incredibly instructed i want to talk about the vehicles again so the vehicles you can't run people over uh obviously some things disable it you are vulnerable because the animation of getting on and off the vehicle is kind of difficult it's difficult just to rock up to a full team and everyone be like oh let's hop out the car let me just take my seatbelt off and then do you jump hey and he's like okay i'm ready to fight you're gonna get beamed you're gonna you're gonna die unfortunately it's a rotational it's a rotational tool that's pretty much it but it is very useful i will say that and it's very fun a lot of you guys told me about this yesterday you could or i think it was a few days ago now uh horizon's passive is like soft landing so when she falls down from a high place it's like she softens the blow she doesn't have that like where your camera dips and you have to stand up again and fight uh and also you have more movement in mid-air i didn't really feel it but then again i wasn't really jumping from that high places i would love to get the opportunity to play it again and jump from a massive like a like a skyscraper because the idea is you can move in mid-air you have more control and then when you land you're ready to shoot more often and i'm pretty sure i've covered everything like the biggest points there is so much to go over i'd probably miss some stuff if you guys have more questions you can leave them in the comment section i can reply to you guys about what i played yesterday i'll be able to share the footage here i believe on sunday i think that's the when uh when i'm allowed to share the footage i've got some great things to share with you so if you're new to the channel be sure to subscribe to not miss that it is coming soon and i think that's everything i believe so so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one bye
