hey was a gauzy to each one and back to another video today we are playing more egg picks legends of course a nobleman's weapon and change my word the have a absolutely shred this boom is fun be you'd have thought with the removal of the turbocharger that the havoc wouldn't be quite as good but honestly the book that they did to the hopper which was reducing horizontal recoil which makes it so much easier to control at medium to normal I think I actually prefer the grenade to a turbocharger that it's that much better also this is one of the quickest wins that I post on YouTube in a long time and that's the physics on cruise Canyon because it's a really small map competitive odds edge and there's a lot of good players in these lobbies sleepers third party everything everyone's dead within the first five minutes but anyway hope you guys enjoy this one thank you for watching I see water in the five and half seconds my friends cascade cities my friends this used to be my favorite built-in cylinder because you can just I look I love the films where you can hop in through the I mean I was gonna call it a skylights but that makes it sound like it was an intentional feature of the house you're firing I've got no weapon friend the swatting to face back soon you know mas if it is indeed the same team there he is you popped him you're the world's greatest player you've killed all three and a boom boom indeed my friend has to be the best voice bone on the inside game yesterday and it's a practice I can I've listened I can wall jump I can wall jump however I just missed the ball now it's least you dare there was no warning volved in the boardrooms while practicing in the fine range mode I'll come back and it'll be added to my movement or a repertoire bob has more jump in everywhere the thing is water when he looks at all but it's not actually too useful really it just looks really cool if there's one thing I love it's movement that's why I play Pathfinder you know I need a gosh darn bag over here there's too many things I want to carry friends way too many things so sad like I've got to arc starts as my own eco wars and I have to drop them for energy range oh where did you guys get you good on the front look away for half a second I thought you guys needed armor level two level three iconic snails to drop I need another one day of my mind over this way unfortunately I only that one team London it cascades and trades on my team and he absolutely bought them all but he's what at least I guess this way the drum tower this wait I'm gonna go scrap some more people level three teammates white clothes than I am I'm not gonna get there alright let's go and find the next scrap one thing is for certain ease somewhere in the distance that's all I know I'm struggling here I need a backpack so that's helping guys I promise you I promise you I just want to remind them that I've done nothing my two times back very much help me fire I'm on the way we go take a job I'm lagging behind one more two times guys I owe two times I am I delete you just picked it up I'm gonna kill him and the only stop can name is because you guessed it go get a baby thank the Jonas was fat it's alright teammates I'm coming on the way don't be cooking watching Sydney in French as his friend on if this is all the same team as a creeped ocean way as those that drone at the doorway which means that he doesn't have moving mechanics which means that he could not have gone far did you know good apparently yes he did have a good yes he did he had two guns he had two decent guns for some reason yeah shields and everything he didn't even bother shielding up alright two kills we are still a little bit behind the lifeline who I believe is on the fourth tales of the moments but we will catch up and if I did see the level 2 it's indeed heavy my hair and mind it was a sniper stock I'm pretty sure I heard somebody's fine people are landing some une trans I don't even need to pick them up it's all kicking off here friends get over it okay this n gerb ultimate it which is not good you're brought emotes i believe the past participle of ultimate ease online tonight me too and fight I like it it's gonna revive I support a friend this is a hemlock man after this fortune we can live because of the reporter shelter cats gone yeah friends remember this gun is unbelievable it's an unbelievable out of ten I've missed too many shots the guns still good I'll just mix it is poor accuracy from you boy I'm how classmates the kill vada I think the life line literally just got her physical cashews dead choose the kiwi day came up I don't know why I said littering that makes face an unnecessary usage now are you gonna take all this stuff frankly hey this is my kill yet five kills your own to loose I can't ask for shields either cuz you know she'll drop like to shield cells she's kept the batteries for own personal collection okay fourteen people left the games on Kings Canyon I'm not sure I think it's a combination of things here they're going so fast it's it's a combination of the skill based matchmaking that we didn't see or give me that this combination of the skill based matchmaking that we didn't see in Kings Canyon I think it was in the game for the last like two weeks of season two but it's also a combination of the fact that the map is really gosh darn small compared to voltage and you can hear a fight from so far away that everyone just wants to get the hair can freak involved but I do appreciate you know you get yourself some more gunfights yourself you have fights with like six other teams at once which it's a different kind of didn't kind of game play on Kings Canyon and they're both gone through this Batcave listen I'll go this way through Scott scrap cave and we can meet up about that as I said as long as no one's here I mean it is called scrap cave after all there is no it's called that is because you are guaranteed a scrap when you're in the cave for parolin today is an exception to the rule says you are why though there are four other squads and two of them are fighting alright chill now all right maybe I paying too much I appreciate that just one more just then you know we're at least if you didn't see the pings are done I promise as most satisfying haven't killed possibly about generation okay I'm on the ranch someone's loving all the termites have tuck under the squads lands got the biggest prey for one I've ever seen and you are chilling in the shadows you are you might be a lone ranger to be honest he's not pushing I'll break these dudes get me if you're going to move me up here what an absolute legend what our heroes - you came back through a white thank you friends I appreciate that giving my shields a recharge something that always going back mr. Bert that's brutal there we go these last two teams these are the last two teams to mental healing so I might pay a little bit more careful here but I still want to get involved the Rings closing 20 seconds and we do have to go through schedules for okay I already have too much time here I mean I've absolutely shredded two of them then my teammates must be fine review their team I'm not going to commit to that because these t want to shoo us if we all commit to that I don't see nice job teammates oh I was sober if that bangle or if we don't kill that bangle and she manages to run away I think we lose that game I think we all die in the rink it's a good job I had to grapple off and I was able to spray it down with a Spitfire because we did woman cooking well cook alive in the rink in 11 minutes 42 I mean I've had quicker games but he's when I was playing with other people to go into a game solo and to win in sub 12 minutes I mean I don't think that happens on water it's just too big too big fat it's not too big but it's too big for a 12-minute win and to be fair maybe that's healthier for the game you know maybe they should be going 14 minutes but that was a ton of fun there is nothing more fun from third party in people whether or not it's a rap or tactic you can't deny it's incredibly fun to shoot people in the bathroom thank you for watching I do appreciate it shows out my teammates that game overall good but yeah I'll see you on the next one [Music]
