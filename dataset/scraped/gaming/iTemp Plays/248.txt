hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are going to be playing some more apex legends of course and today i will be revealing my season 11 wish list for apex legends that makes it sound like you guys have just been waiting for this list it's just an incredible list that the world just could not wait for any longer here we are so what do we know already about season 11. we know that we are getting ash and we sort of know her abilities a little bit we know that we are getting the car smg which i will be testing out on titanfall 2 soon enough if i can get into a game on there and we are almost certainly getting a new map to play on as well so my hope for ash is that she caters well to an aggressive style of play the teaser is about her kit maker seem like a hunter who tracks down enemies to take them out and moves on to the next victims i love that style of play moving on we have the new weapon which is an smg and if we look at the smg's in the game at the moment we have the prowler the r9 the alternator and the vault i believe they are the only four they're the only four that i can think of i actually love all four of these guns and i will often just run whichever of them i find first in a game i far prefer them to shotguns because they're more versatile and i don't often like fighting at point blank range anyway it feels 250 50 to me and what i want from the car is maybe something more similar to the vault than the r9 with low recoil but a slightly lower time to kill to balance that out or longer time to kill i love a secondary weapon that is reliable in so many different gunfights because then my main gun that i'm trying to use maybe for a video could be anything it could be a charge rifle it could be a shotgun as long as i've got a vault fall back on i should be good in terms of legend balance i don't actually think any of the legends deserve a nerf this season and that may be the first time that i felt that way i'd argue that gb is probably the closest one to needing a nerf he's an incredibly strong legend with near 100 peak rate in the lgs but i don't often run into him in public games because he's not the flashiest legend to play i'd be fine leaving his kit how it is at the moment but in terms of buffs there are plenty okay maybe i was being a bit biased in yesterday's video hoping for an octane buff he doesn't really need one let's be honest i doubt we will see one but i'm sure that we will soon see changes to watson and crypto and maybe even fusion lifeline to switch up the meta a little bit now getting away from the weapons and the legends for a moment i think we are in desperate need for more limited time modes coming to apec something to mix up the public game experience making a bit more fun a bit fresher we've seen some really great modes over the last few years and i would love them to return in rotation to give us more options another thing that i'd be grateful to see in season 11 would be cross progression i've been on pc for over a year now but most of my heirlooms are still on my playstation account my skin collection is split in half and there are skins on my playstation accounts that i cannot access on my pc at all like every battle pass skin from the beginning of apex up until maybe season six or whichever season i made the switch they really need to implement this somehow because i miss my battle pass flatline skin so much and my havoc skin and the piece and the peacekeeper skin and i'll do the ones that i don't have now the biggest thing that season 11 success rests on is how good the new map is going to be because it'll be the only one that we are playing for a good while you would assume i liked olympus when it came out but i'm not the biggest fan of it at the moment hopefully the new tropical paradise map is amazing i really cannot wait to play it and i hope it plays like world's edge more than olympus if you guys have anything to add to the wish list let me know in the comment section down below i would love to read your suggestions thank you for watching i will see you all in five and a half seconds of some game play my friends you guys are you guys actually have like a lot i i've been searching through so many games it's funny and then i'll see who has it downloaded and then every single game you guys have like 10 minutes of play time i'm like dude how can you even develop an opinion off like playing a game for five minutes easily easily did you see my netflix i've watched the first three minutes of pretty much every film ever made oh my god i don't even bother with netflix at this point it's too it's too time consuming i'll spend 45 minutes looking for something when i could have just put on twitch and watch 45 minutes or the office just put the office on that's the only reason like not the only reason that's why i'm watching i uh i didn't watch the office for it's probably been like a few months and then i watched it again yesterday oh what if so does it um it was the one where jan has the baby and she like uh surprised michael and she just like shows up and she starts that one scene where she's uh yeah yeah that's the thing she's absolutely classy and everyone's okay well i've already graphed away from the wingman so the decisions we made there's somebody here man you just got owned you just got loaned what do you want from me uh you didn't check the corners mate i would have checked every corner running up there yeah that's why you're bought that's why you have to join in there like a demon that's why i saved your life we started early today i did yeah you always do i you literally always started i'm stealing every kill from these guys that are down just a little heads up yes we killed the last member i'm on five kills because i killed the team and 32 people that's the best what's your damage on 500 nice it's the high temp special you know what mate let's do the girl rice as soon as you say that you're going to lose the crazy part you could be winning the whole time and then you you say that and you'll just instantly lose you'll you'll i don't even have to beat you you'll beat yourself oh that's the problem with me yeah that's easy like i cannot handle pressure so much yeah yeah you get in your head so much that i don't even need to beat you it's like i already won as soon as i'm the last guy remaining i'm done for i've picked up a body because you really do get in your head so much 100 i can't deal with that so even if i was good enough to play competitive i couldn't my mentor is not strong enough i have the mental of like a a baby armadillo you know what i was i was absolutely thinking that excuse me that was my kill he was like of almost full shield for 19 field come on man first dibs oh i'm mid reload i'm mid-reload a little bit angry because i hit that guy for 19.2 so that was also my kill but it's okay what are you is your uh damage to kill ratio 700 damage six kills it should be seven but whatever i think i think you'll be fine i don't know i'm not playing a little bit like recently have you been averaging like what like maybe hour two hours a day i get a game then i hop off so same same same thing but how long does that usually take you i mean i put in a decent session the other day like i got a game early on and i carried on playing for an extra hour and i didn't get anything after that that's just wow see and that's why you need to stop while you're ahead in this game you you don't keep going because unless you have a duo because then you just you're just gonna ruin your day even more i spoke to myself for an hour straight which wasn't good one of the funniest things to me is stay when he told me that like he when he records that uh if he like speaks on something that he he likes to put in a video and he dies he just keeps doing it until it works that's that's amazing and i just i tried that i honestly tried that and i could not do it like i just physically could not bring myself to repeat like things that i would say in earlier videos that i died in i just could i gave up i was like dude i can't do this you know what the level of that is and you know i'm like doing that with jokes yeah yeah you do that yeah yeah all the time i pretend that it's the first time i've said it and it's absolutely not let's see i yeah see i won't let the viewers be lied to but it's like a stand-up it's like a standard for that point you know it's funny you know it has that got some comedic effect effect to it you know but i'm just i'm the guy that kind of like you know tears you down when you're up yeah exactly and that's what you know yeah yeah being a bully i'm very that's the crazy thing is you're literally the bully in this relationship i don't know that's true kind of is oh that's the whole squad up there oh where are they i'm not with you uh they're on this thing with me oh one hp she gonna chase me would it be an item game without some shots being missed no i wouldn't i'm here she was finishing a bat in my face and i had no health so my sense is not equipped to track uh horizons when they're flying through the air oh i hate it that's some nice and cable job i won't even shoot him just let him he's the worst real housewife of yours oh man that's a ninja is there already a show of a real housewives i don't know how many places are they there's there's like a hundred of them are these real people i've never actually watched one of them are they real people uh have you ever been to america right 48 hours yes definitely not enough to experience it's 48 hours too long get me out of there okay well i'm gonna enjoy your one mcdonald's that you have in your whole city nah i liked it i'm saying there's a in my in my city there's about 25 mcdonald's just like that way that does not surprise me in case you ever want to come here and choose from multiple mcdonald's yeah but they're all exactly the same why do you need so many of them i don't think i think the last time i had mcdonald's actually no i had mcdonald's maybe a few months ago but it was a breakfast breakfast solid what it do what you need you need beans with your breakfast is that the only way this is this works i mean yeah you can add your own beans but then like what's the point well don't you guys just keep like a stash at all pockets not even in the can they're like emptied is there like a specific uh pocket yeah would be a bean bucket where are these people fighting do you know i don't know this is how this is how apex goes i need to fight in the beginning no fights after does no because this is actually what your damage is what is it at right now is it uh let me think uh guess any kills i'll have first aid eight or nine eight eight and then you have 950 damage no not that bad 1170. i'm not impressed at all what are your stats looking like i have four kills 1 000 damage that's a laugh that's funny i'll do that again a lot sound like an anime character i've been practicing mine in my vlog i'm trying to get some bugs out of work i think you could do you could do voiceover stuff you and ragtag would be amazing like voiceovers frag tag would be rag will be the best i don't know why oh no you got i don't know you're an english guy i feel like every english guy could be a owning american yeah only in america though you can't do it over there so i just got finesse to see you i'm back baby in this modern day first quick please yes i got a lot i got a lot no no no i got most of it no no oh you're dead you're dead i'm blocking my body never has to stop firing dizzy you're the only one that can get up there okay sorry repairing oh that was close that it never has to stop firing rampage fortunately because it's so slow i had time to control the arm switch right in his line of sight well i was doing a lot of body blocking i saw that i know i appreciate that i appreciate that beating you kills as a full-time job um yeah i mean i got eight by my own accord but you know what i got eight on my own accord and uh i don't know about that we're gonna have to we're gonna need a replay to replay that i did steal something from the evaluation yeah lots of people on the floor things on us i'm literally just everything yeah you are a complete officer i'm not there at all not even close i should be okay for a little bit i think i'm weak okay i'm popping her back these guys hate me these boys hate me i'm gonna i'm gonna rose i can't yeah yeah i got my grapple so oh there's a big thing okay well that was a pointless hole that was a bloodhound nice scary i'm using a two to four time on the flat line okay it feels better than it used to i don't know why because you're sending me here i can't uh i can't zoom it in though which sucks oh yeah i forgot so you're literally literally just talking about the blue part i mean the two times part yeah yeah i'm a top shaping demon you can't have you can't have a you can't have it all right come on drop it for me i'll zoom in for you i can do it on my on my keyboard no it's pretty easy if you just drop it no no no no no i'm gonna do it on my keyboard i'm using my mouse hold on let me kill him i've seen eight damage you're a full time zoom there aren't you i'm in like the most awkward position with my keyboard is like halfway off my table man that was a tale of survival against that last teams look at this guy with his like with his chain and his breakdancing okay every mirage skin is literally the ugly scene in the game
