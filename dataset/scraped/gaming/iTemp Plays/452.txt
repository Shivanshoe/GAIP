hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and wright is probably the strongest legends that i never play on this game she's obviously always been strong because of her tiny hitbox but since low profile and her recent nerf to set hitbox uh it sort of balanced her a little bit kind of i mean she's still tiny let's be honest she's like half the size of a gibby and even if you get your shields broken you can just phase out the safety put it this way there are a few things more intimidating on this game than a wraith with a demon strafe and a wingman i still get scared i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i can't believe he will actually land here it's a i was dead yep thank you i'm done i have i'm just going to look for a tiny bit more light i've got a spare back for you if you want it um i have one okay weird um a little bit light i'm going to thank you i'm fine 500 oh huge huge things shooting was over here right uh yes indeed it certainly was oh they just no they're taking that no should we fake fight i'm gonna beam you they're going around where where what is this driving any cracks literally impossible is cracked a little bit not much ladies treasure pack here pick the right road i'll save that save that i'll i'm defending for you are you saving it don't take it i've tried to take i already got one earlier don't take it don't take it yeah please i can't you good i got you mate please i think if someone says they're going to fly over there so i'm going to defend it my life oh there are actually people coming for it no no don't let them thank you nice yeah 360 360. yeah well done yeah well i don't know what this other guy is so he's self-raised somewhere all that matters is this guy got destroyed we made the right choice now you should have seen what they were doing they were like spam jumping like bunny hopping up the wall that looks so stupid i don't want a pair of deer a bear deer yes a pair of deer let's galloping of the waterfall faking them out don't go watching because i'm going to do the same if you look over there we're just doing this both of them of the waterfall oh that's my thermite it means you know what if she her regen nearly killed us there she was so close to reaching back to full shield she had i was actually kind of scared i mean i'm surprised you didn't think she swapped four times i was like whoa stop rejecting so quick stop swapping armors what are you doing you getting these from it's funny because it you know when you crack an are like when you crack an armor and then it regens and you crack it again it feels like you're doing a hundred damage each time but it's like five damage i have an extended sniper mag here level four i thought oh in the vicinity i mean that's not even my fault that's mirage just having a little little dainty arm that's true if you're fused what have you needed that these guys are dead that's true they're gonna steal the top uh this team's gonna be low ground i don't know never mind they're still up there i'm gonna go do the yte was a distraction my friend enemy down he seems dead this is the thing that was foreign reloading i downed an enemy nice wait are you dead reloading that's the last of that squad nice i am what i'm telling you we're going to uh go kill him about yourself i'm good no i need your help yeah i do unless i have anvils which i do i'm good might be something good this way oh my [Laughter] but let's be honest you deserved it so you still won that though i made for a cool clip i waited till you moved to the right a little bit so you weren't just like completely in their line of sight so it kind of helped in this completely throw i get it uh you know you know me software is what makes it amazing the software is really so nice there it has a couple features that are just i really it almost made me stay with the uh but the only thing it doesn't have a doesn't have eq it doesn't have noise gate i need this kind of voice of that eq sounds bad yeah it's kind of unfortunate yet it's still a really good mind oh okay jesus dude octane is just like broken thank you for spending so hard and you just can't get out of it um yeah oh no there's a vault in here if you want this i'm going to drop my my energy um i'm going to try and use the repeater probably not a good idea i want it i want to use long grain i know that sounds obvious but every time i use that gun i try it close range and you don't have any you can't move left and right so you just yeah exploded oh that's purple right next to you uh all you need to do in this game to count someone is just hold hands like it's so difficult to kill someone yeah you stay together it's so hard to kill a team i don't have my boost so i'll just go this way jumping off here almost broke one found one [Music] both my guns are reloaded that was awful thank you for too bad i cracked me no no no no no you took that feel very bad i have two backs if you need one um i got two okay you small healing the worst yeah i mean when we're out of a fight is the only time i i'm okay with it just it's just horrible i think they should get rid of shield cells get rid of syringes bats and med kits only what dragon i i i don't know i don't know if i can get behind that but i definitely feel like shield cells and syringes should be way faster yeah just a little more he's like 25 percent faster yeah or if you use three in a row the last one one's right below me is there someone on the right oh they're both right right next to each other oh one's up here oh okay you went that way that's interesting dude my aim is just not it today that's just not it from the top rope spitfire is it though i know if you've tried this gun the spitfire might have it tell me about it oh hey i did not know that pretty good i mean i have i'm using a repeater i have 60. i'm fine wait oh thanks i think they just did the finisher or something was that i don't know on the right broken oh they run that way no why would they do that to me oh the new team no dude protect me i'll try not play yourself i'm himself present okay he's resting too okay nice that's not that same nobody seems let's go this way okay it's a pathfinder and now octane so they're really fast oh here we playing yo replicators where would they have gone i don't know oh this way already he's talking about he's fine enemy taken down all the vibes have been lost i need someone maybe uh probably not it sounds like they're on metal and there's no metal around us so it's probably just you probably i'd appreciate if you didn't do that next time i'm sorry yeah might be something good this way faster faster faster why does she wobble so much i can't understand with these oh these are the teams here horizon's cracked there's she's one my r9 shot is honestly i you could say horrendous you could say that i mean i feel that the speed flies all right but like it's a spitfire but the r9 [Music] it's not good thank you insane feels like a little pea shooter should be using a vault honestly on my way we did it i try and keep it mate unbelievable
