hey was the closet which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here at Kingston Canyon I'm making the most of this de Jonge loot event I've said it before and I'll say it again the matchmaking in the de jour loose event has been so nice it's like taking me back to season one apex not just because of the map but because the the matchmaking just seems completely random it's great anyway today's focus is going to be on the hammer play trains I've very rarely make use of this and I think there's a very good reason for that you're not going to walk around with the P 2020 and look for the attachments or the hop-up of of hammer point rates because if you don't find the hammer point rounds you've got a P 2020 if you're looking for a follow-up roller you can walk around with the Pretlow without the hop-up and you've still got a decent weapon so I just think it means that unless you find them both at the start it's very difficult to try and commit to caring around a Mozambique or a pre 2020 without the hop-up I mean you could do the other way around where you find the hop-up first I guess but anyway I should definitely use more often after the game you're about to watch I hope you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the I attempt iron I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right be a bit of a detour here a bit of a detour we are here in V swamp we were going to land at the Wraith poor sort of do will choose an appropriate name there you go it's kicking off how can this is - I looked how can I walk into a building and there's not one weapon there's gonna be 14 in here guaranteed by peenics with 2020 it's not bad because I've got having points all right well it could be worse I guess I could still be good listening that in this one which would be something terrible it's risky with our points but I'm doing a charge leads up because if I level two shield up maybe not do it at level one it's it's a hundred damage and then I've already returned to what I had beforehand but he's a little bit nerve-wracking with hammer points because if you think about it you're going for the kill with the self of attachment so this is a perfect gun when you're using the Evo shield because the evil show that rewards you for sin back and Tron it charged up with a bit of pub damage whereas the hand points is the opposite that he's getting their face need to be shooting him back actually just in case our final can answer a one it's up the g7 Scouts combined we've gone on sorry the r3l one I don't do you listen going hemlock there's level two consenting man right there we go beautiful alright well laughing can we go to the race Paulette in it's still keyed off there I've got the signed the wrong weapon I'm leaving you behind what T my stars no shield so I'll wait for him to get some shields and then I'm going to the race ball that's the plan the lifeline press deeps on level 2 shields the Gibraltar didn't want the level 2 shields for some reason a little bit confusing that's okay alright hopefully still can off down here it doesn't sound like he does in fact the times right here as if there's pretty one team left I never mind they're so scrapping scrap in the portal they say oh my oh he's been doing the hurdles Susie run away from though that's most majestic jump I've ever seen a caustic achieve he was run away from Samant but they obviously have an escape route with the portal so I may as well just try and push them over there struggling hopefully see stroll down oh we got hit caustic okay you you did have weapons to bad thing I thought I just shot a man he lacked no good it messed them up your balls let's go okay how about those you should see me because I have both the skills with the tremendous performance with the hammer point Reims right there you gotta kill leader and we didn't even have to land it you just rock up light full shields for flama it's not struggle team thanks back let me hear a little quick here I've got so much ammo for someone that's using have a points where necessary is the word that comes to mind all right come on team this is a free man once again if someone's close range I can't lend a stronger I'm sure some people can but you boy cannot different you if you've ever seen me use that you'll know that's the truth too yeah there is indeed a care package dropped in my friend rock of late there's someone third party nurse when we look there's no one here is that reporter there's no one here is that there's no I've been up there there's no one there the trade I'll never trust you again I've heard the care package in London well this has been a blessing in disguise Doug because if this'll tell us yeah there we go we would have been contested as the blue lights gone and it wasn't a lifeline package the lifeline follow mink this is good there we go look at him screwing around the phone call level 1 Evo shields this is a dream hey back it up you're trying to shoot your teammate yep okay [Music] mess him up teammate get him I didn't even hear the Pathfinder job back but I'm still gonna rock the show battery [Applause] get me out of here this is ludicrous so it's gonna revive as well so may not chaos love there I didn't realize that other team was still alive this is bad this is real bad I couldn't get back there so don't do use my grapple I think there are two teams still left jab what is just left the game nice absolutely no faith if these two teams start scrapping it's an easy than a recovery the problem is I believe that team making contact with the enemy they stand on top of the rooftop and the team that killed my teammates it's probably gluten all the boxes in that I assume is about 15 bucks in there teammate could play it safe especially because I don't have the best close range guns I mean if their shield miss I do [Applause] that's right he's gonna revive but my telescope eight seconds left I gotcha police said he stores gone Thank You Rudy Rudy wanted to push that they come in all right I just got to get out of here better get my teammate back I was really wanted to push that I'll see it like the Bangalore with the smoke I'll see down the path fine already if I take that challenge I can't get my Tina back and there's still a bunch of people left as well there's 10 or top 10 named odd Matata a team I wouldn't come afterwards I've got no I've got no help whatsoever do you mean to thing that see me I know you're dead I know you can't drop your drone yet oh there we go beautiful I'll swing she's there too even more beautiful Baba this team hasn't pushed at all unless they're taken that the craziest length maneuver you've ever seen and my team is already gone Arthur I want to his name which is decent this is unloaded in there please that purple shields some posts purple snipers doc same thing for really if you think about it happy to help friend I forgot Remender tomato sauce juice some some purple armor and an Arsenal back and there - okay I reckon we should work because they may push a NYNEX shield just be careful there's a terrible spot Sabine because the team that I run away from have you come behind us and now what you can you getting cooked up here package you tell me Scott leveled one as well I'm going for you guys um the first I was gonna run away but now I'm offended that you shot me with delivery but is shoot the cost ecology zoom what he's a little bit of a better technique here works a little bit better than trying to shoot the guy that was damn I don't know why I was even doing that okay now we've both got gold back to ice got tremendous leap once more he already had the shields and hopefully now he's got some decent attachments and stuff all right for slate hey kills the shame that you brought left it's okay we're still doing all right nearly well Shawn trouble take man ruining my plans once more I've even got chills too nice after man half double takeoff dodge gold chills tremendous you're a terrible position in absolutely horrendous I feel like any one of these themes would gang up on us at any one point this way way oh really it's firing a peacekeeper Attis i've tickled him these 15 is the fighting though I think he's just building to building combat and now they're firing me this is all gonna kick off soon but for the moment I think we're in a bit of a deadlock f30 spare heavy rains they both have our throw on peacekeepers yeah they did unbelievable it's got the dual set of here exactly the same stuff laughing eh this is a decent setup I've got a full told gun as well which is nice because this is going to get close quarters real fast after the zone pushes people eight yeah take that trouble that man you've been owned once more I'll just kill credit for that is the triple-t man no it's not represent man okay gosh darn it alright this is this is literally like that scene in the office where they're all aiming each other with their finger guns we've got a certain the hill I've got these guys in each one of the buildings you are maniac you're a lunatic who's going for a bit of a sneak tactic here I like it Liam now can't make it across okay what I've got to do I'm not gonna put that down yet because it's gonna give away my plan I've just got to put it down when there's put about two or three seconds left I have one grenade and if it's gonna make it happen it's the edge of this building I will show you today again say that 14 the edge of this building is safe to play hiding places nice god I didn't stand in front of the door careful teammate oh my god I knew any mess out of me I should have stood in front of the door alone oh my god I think it's litter just one guy vise jaw flame I nearly left him need to stop these two guys pretty much solo I did a bit of damage to go into niihka stairs I don't nearly through the game against the Bangalore good brief reinforced his house and says good game we enforce these house and says again item play says GG two and a half thousand damage the Gibraltar left with 355 oh my god I was a twenty three many game good great nothing happened for about ten minutes there absolutely nothing and what can you do though I can't push a building with two people in it with a hemlock and the P 2020 hammer points I have appointed good we need to put some poke damaging to them first and then you get involved listen we won we won and I'm happy with that one of the final wins I'll have on Kings Canyon on Elysium until the new ranked season of course but thank you for watching I do appreciate you I'll see you in the next one
