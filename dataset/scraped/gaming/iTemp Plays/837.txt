hey mr. Ghazi to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the legendary Prowler we haven't seen this gun since season zero I think he was I got my first ever 20 kill game with this gun now historically uh 930 legends I have slept on the Prowler often I was dropping it even for alternators in the past but towards the end of season 3 that gave this gun another shot any time so it was pretty good it quickly turned into one of my favorite weapons in the game and they go ahead and they both fit for season 4 alongside some are 99 and damaged nerves in there too now in the game that you're about to watch I had all gold everything with a legendary prowl left and I've managed to fully cut out my Arthur I want as masked I was pretty much unstoppable now I'm interested in least let me know in the comments if you've tried the prowl in season 4 and if you prefer over there are 99 because honestly I think I might prefer it over the online tonight now I think it's overtaking it so thank you for watching I see war in five and a half seconds my friends look at this look at this bitter rumors rumors circulating apex legends if you manage to make it it's a tough 500 and you get the new IT experts rank this is the the dive trailer you'll get it's just one big white ball of fire unbelievable alright sorting factor it Eve my friends Mimi goes people already dine in the feet well I just drop in never mind there are people here you can if he hates her this is my loot good he's still green that means he put it doesn't have body shield and a weapon he's still running okay this guy go we're leaving unless it's still like that I just assume they're gonna leave the game use their least try and crawl to safety okay now I have gold shields well chop that man listen if you'd like to resume our scrap I'm all for it see anything still man should take your shields off could have use the thank you so unless he you already used your something which would have been weird to start the game as a flatline I do indeed on that because I've got the t100 a battle path skin on this I did buy it people have speculating whether or not I am only to level 100 on a bad password II don't know if that's possible shout out my teammate I'm pretty sure he was lemme loot there what a great guy are this good by the way look at the signs like unreal fine enemy here again for the Maness making contact with the enemy I can't hear any more he might have gone to the banners already - sorry Sox's I can still sort of see there we go I can hear him no concussion it is chilly inside her teammates BlueShield everywhere I can't challenge that insight because he's got a he's got a blue army switch who knows what he's doing he's gonna bamboozle me come on a friend Tommy out here I was don't him to switch the armas I mean I can heal this up fairly easily in the open team okay my teammates haven't moved that's fine if I knew that I'd have played it differently I didn't wanna fight some insight cuz the blue Armand was there oh my gosh yeah I'll get it okay Sheila's there we go no my teammates just thought I had it covered cuz I had gold Chilton stuff they probably thought this guy's diluted he's probably fine over there uh yeah I mean what can you do first game today it's gaming the day that's what that's what I'm gonna blame it on but the theory this thing still stands you know I think that the right idea I just saw this messed up in a few the mini gun fights we had it's all good that someone's fine here someone was definitely flying I saw him don't worry I ducked into cover to make him run away and then that's when you firing him unfortunately someone beneath me as well I think all right Tim isoquant over this time that they've realized I'm actually a pretty bad playing it just be careful this quite the obstacle in this is my rooftop that's why I thought okay I heard BAM it's a TV one I heard them but I thought that would download and I thought they were gonna go for the revive on the right I mean I should be finally still we've got a sniper don't think about it I'll keep miss I shouldn't DISA soon they're gonna run off and try it yeah that they did the right thing still get involved in the gunfight rockin and revive in there why does this show that they were not gonna do the right thing and that's when you get yourself killed all right it's fine we're gonna we get a second chance do you have any having rounds for me when the protocol for the revive name I would assume on alternates are in the dream Dejan food here there's the last fine nice job Phoenix I'm glad they were there because your boy what's missing there no all right I need to get better I need to start playing better I've got three kills but I definitely could have more than these after l1 I'll take it I'm I'm gonna carry the six or threat I say it all the time but I'm not even that big of a fan okay sorry flatline eventually I'll make it no hay eventual make a video about the t100 far past skin on the flatline the amount of times I've had to drop before gold weapons recently is actual on rail I have a lot of ammo yeah I've got batteries and stuff another blue shield straight input this three of them oh my dear it's here it's a portable team none of the pallet I love the palette good great last guys that way who's this son of the Squatch how do you think he was in a different position hey why didn't make me jump over his head like that I didn't even press the jump on that he stated here is Hannes Snipes ohif if he pushes up this could be that the solo guy he could be trying to get the banner nevermind these guys trying to get the banner I don't think he got me [ __ ] up I don't think you got it missed every shot I'm not chasing that no one my teammate Ernest scrap lit retold as a bloodhound if I saw that was a mirage [Music] I saw that's a mirage character I was out obviously of not shopping I did think it was weird the Bloodhound business standing still I'm ready I can't hear the storm here it's mighty mighty with me I'll be killed I thought of what I'm doing here honey I need to warm up I need to play better I've somehow it's still got seven kills for the coming to the end of the game we're nearly top 10 13 people left the scrap of scrap scrap will CC as well my teammates are heating up I'm gonna play aggressive I just wanna get involved now trying third part some people okay you can't get across this way I always forget need to get used to that dying and we are not involved makes me incredibly sad are the good news ease usually that Lal Chowk point there was a bit of a problem but it was not problem for us because we kill everyone right here oh okay honestly I'm an idiot self-devotion please - max beautiful two bags and a Phoenix kick just what you want from a I like em care package is that what the fight was bunch of purple body crates of course dick trapped there too and you'll respawn back on my ultimate let's get over are they closer they are indeed my tumors are facing this way - all right let's fight these guys then credit I've got my ulti and I don't have waste my ability because I'm playing aggressive so I needed a way to get out that first guy wasn't even wait the crowd is is that good tene it something isn't the quartic that's supposed to go when they die come on now that's all fair I'll just try and live my kills here alright three squads left and all of them just had that respawn to redirect their fiber then I would have been in line DS straight over to the scrap receiver might be useful alright I've warmed up I feel better I've made some stupid mistakes he's game but we're in a good position here two squads left I'm surprised that team hadn't come back here if I had to guess I would have said there with one of the teams that was involved in that scrap to begin with we're all those by the purple body Chrysler and YouTube people's come straight back to the loots but these guys do not want it alright devotion round two your battery mastiff icon I thought that II I'm gonna be massive fat in fact I would go as far as saying I'm pretty bad Mastiff your friend that's a beautiful based and he so telegraphed I've been mighty much have tickled them a little bit so they're shielding up I accidentally lined them up don't you're playing card and they say line them up I that's that's what they mean for us check your Maps no syringes for this very fun interactive gameplay [Music] careful teammate this is the team that was the team that was them no wonder they were sugar dough and bring that that Pathfinder way for the banners and I thought he missed that was that team with the core stick in the race he got them he got the banner did he respond or scrapped at all reckon that was them or is that different team I'm confused no one did they were scared though no one did they were carrying and Fiat 14 gives 3400 damage I was playing terribly to start that game I feel like I bombed up towards the end but at the start good grief text me some time to warm up gnome gained old you know just the way these that was a fun game a god proud - in there - I'll tell you what I'm gonna go ahead and say I prefer the pro that's the on i-29 the pram is the pros and rail they increase the damage on it and they decrease the damage on the online tonight and I think I think it might be a little bit better I don't know that ia leave a comment let me know you think in the comments thank you very much for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you on the next one [Music]
