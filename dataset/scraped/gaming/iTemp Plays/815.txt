hey wassup Ozzy - rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more effects legends of course in the background I'm opening up each of the 24 new system override apex packs but I'm opening them up on PC I'll give you a very good reason and it's the same reason I gave in my revenant video as well updates come so much quicker to PC compared to ps4 you update takes about half an hour longer to even appear on the PlayStation Store and then the download is incredibly slow compared to PC I'll be honest with you today's update was 30 gigabytes I reckon the difference between the two he's well over an hour and I've got incredibly good internet so I thought why not despite the heirloom on PC - this isn't a smurf this is my main pc account and you'll see that I actually get into a fairly skillful Lobby some of the gunfights that we going to were hectic to say the least I was a little bit flustered because it was non-stop my teammate was incredibly good I spent I'll be honest with you I was like the little guy I was like a mini him and I was falling around trying to help him at every opportunity I got completely carried I'm gonna be honest I did I was flustered as I said and you can definitely hear it in my commentaries well I'm not making a switch to PC mainly I'm sticking on ps4 but for updates I've holy balls a live on PC just makes more sense so in this game I'm playing Dasia old boots which is the gamer that came out today I'm using the octane heirloom which came out today and I'll pick up some evil shields which came out today that's three new things for your friends and hopefully you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join our temper and I see water in 5 now seconds my friends okay Laura diamond players wanted to apex predators hopefully these guys don't know if you land here you get yourselves off score some level 3G olds if you go here because you don't have a weapon you get yourself an alternator with a little red dot sides and just one alternator wasn't enough you can get yourself a second one from over here and also this guy I don't think would have any feel right there's a maximum you've got a gosh-darn havoc quit but do you have a shield battery see I played I've been here a few times now I've been here a few times so at least I know what I'm dealing with they may need a little bit easier on me because he left the game I didn't have to firstly kill octane is nice again a bit of help back get that out of here I need to stop spamming my lutes because there's some stuff that I just do not need from those from those supply bins my teammate is getting beat up in here don't grab that friend who's been you okay yeah level 3 this mod is my first starter kill my apologies trying to tickle him tickle own success on the freight I just want I want to tickle him so bad I was getting charged right for by someone else havoc is the worst weapon for this come on yeah charge rifle in being some night that's the separate team I you've read join I'm coming firing needs of trying team of my alive team I here if I can he's never gonna repeat that nice to you make your the best Oh God there's another team this is horrendous one HP Evo shields though oh my gosh what is peace these things lunacy but I tell you what I'm getting used to smoothness of PC with the control at the moment its guide even shows where I'm not sure I entirely wanted moment so I don't know cuz he was level one I was the issue if he had level like even level two shields there he's getting bucked so I'm not using me just check your batteries and all kinds of stuff okay he's out of here I can't believe we survived that share tab my breakfast specialty right there seven kills we have top 20 all right hopefully that's mostly aggressive team's done for I've played the first pilot pretty bad but then I just I don't know what happened I saw red like I'm crazy like two shots of that it may as well just take business Tiffany so choose instead there's quite a energy rounds 94 as well you know what that might be worth it let me just take it but are you sure we're going to be losing here for a little while anyway because that portals been set up and the angles gonna have to come back and join guess it's different to go to hey not bad not a bad start at all haha he took him over by that Oh my wife gave up oh she might be she might be using evil shield okay maybe she is a little bit confusing I can't really tell but she's definitely had purple shields beforehand and she wanted to forgot about that there's no way if anyone finds a spare all 99 can let me know please I've got an alternative moment oh why did I put my radio voice on for that that's my that's that's the voice I use when I'm on the phone to someone when I found an iPhone I've got to know that the bank or something that's unfortunate it sound like a few people how many people are over there bangalore see one I see two I see three I think it's a full team of three they'll have to come this way though walk over me yeah nice guys confident I like it there selling cookies it's as though moans tell my friend here that I'm on controller I wanted to have a bit of faith in me but okay he's up to poker night beneath it somewhere nice ready something spy -
