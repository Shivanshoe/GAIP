hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now there aren't too many guns left on this game but i haven't really given a fair go the game has been out for nearly two years now however there is definitely one the eva ate shotgun i don't remember once being excited to use this gun i don't remember the last video i posted using this weapon i either avoid it or i drop it instantly but i have two games for you here today trying to use it honestly i feel like i've been a bit unfair on this thing i need a bit more practice with it and maybe i should avoid fully auto fire to work on my accuracy but i had a good time i had some good results i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's not gonna fly with me okay i got 45 nades and a mozambique top it off all right i got guns now that was the last one i'm a hemlock and a wingman but i'm not planning to use the wingman reloading you stuck no i stuck somebody oh very satisfying nice surroundings guess how much damage that was i saw you getting shot and i panicked you know um i i kind of missed my shots i should have killed him but so that's perfectly fine with me it's very mature of you yeah i agree i'm very much here now scrapping over this way someone's not there yeah oh my god ah there's another one i don't know where though all over the top all right i'm gonna heal that's you guys i reached anywhere thanks there for the backup you could have been if you you would have been if you could have been you know yeah in in my mouth there's a little purple right here r99 here so grab an extended mag uh thank you thanks there's just chill in there i have three bats do you want to trade a bat for like three cells um how many cells i have i have four okay well you can have that give me one cell please yeah yeah and we'll give you two cells no no there's one in here i'm good thank you you're fine oh there's loads more in here already gone already gone but you were literally right there but off the scene can't go back it's impossible uh just a heads up um i'm going to be posting our 1v1 later on today so if you get some hate comments because you got destroyed three nil then that's why what was our what was our 1v1 we had a 1v1 yeah when do we have a 1v1 like what what's this mean don't act like you don't remember just because you lost three nil are you are you talking about when my controller was not even working and i was trying to fix it and you were shooting me in the back while i was trying to fix my controller no don't have one that's what you're talking yeah that's what you're talking about all right i remember yeah i remember i was going to try to fix my controller but it wasn't possible because i tempetron is just unloading r99s into my back that's what happened that's what he's sticking with three nil then ragequit oh imagine i scared you'd be seeing that coming over there's a bunch of lunatics but probably they probably are at this point okay we were here that's where our last fight was and we ran around couldn't find anyone oh someone's that way too horizon enemy over there like in the distance there's a there's a classic at the top of the construction i can ask if you've got a pad but i assume you don't because you're playing platinum i mean i could manifest one what happened brocastic [Music] i think he's cracked at the top broke down nice did he get bounced i don't know i don't know when he's i'm confused i'm confused i've got a call stick please come on oh my god are you kidding me that squad that pie that is indeed oh he's down here he's just running around in circles i'm not even going to worry about this guy he's going sort of craziness this man he's got i think he just went all the way back up top i don't think i've got my cause i'm fighting what the heck what's going on here no is it outside oh look who it is i'm not with you i'm so low nice she just dropped down from like the heavens just to get destroyed by my headlock i scanned and the caustic didn't come up on the scale i was terrifying that's a little bit annoying giving my shield to reach out yeah they are kind of scrapping over there it's real legend 27. legend 27. the real one then i'll miss everything you because you got your ultimate i'm really smart you really are it's crazy seven yes uh who has a wingman um i think this guy up here may or no honestly i don't know sorry to finish has a wingman and doesn't have an extended but has a has a scorpio i'm confused what they didn't have an extended mac but they had a score piece so oh well i mean that's just unlucky i've had a hemlock the entire time without an extended mag oh there's a purple mag right here okay let's solve that mystery thank you they probably just robbed it you just need uh oh you know what i'm going back right i know no shots back in action oh yeah we got to go i have two shots in my crater but it's worth it i'm keeping it nice be right it's kind of nasty not gonna lie to you oh right to my left pretty sure they have a lifeline though this way yes those i didn't even know those last team but all right yeah i hit great beer shots be more observant with this scots romanian yeah i i feel like i say that every game you are the apex champions nice i played gg as they say i'd seem like straight out of there didn't want to see it they do say that they do say that she just didn't want to see it double purple that's kind of crazy nice double purple and this guy didn't have armor i feel bad neither did this guy oh my word i hope that they're spectating i know what they're saying to each other i can hear a conversation in my head they feel how we have felt for the past hour and a half yeah and then i'll get a comment it's like which and so far land on double purple me p20 mozambique oh i know dude we're all good we're all good on the corner 50. nice the other team will be here shortly i feel oh it was another team okay no i just i sense it i feel like i know it well some extra paranoid do you have any extra energy oh there's 40 in here i'll get that yes wait let me double check this with you mate 20. there you go this way how far is it cracked okay dude i don't know which one it is 75 you can't block this door my friend open sideways was he trying to block it he was just like healing behind it but then i think i saw in his eyes it was like wait a second he's like wait i can't block this oh my god i have five bats let me know if you need anything um i don't think i have anything i have one actually okay well we have six in total so if i drop you two and we're good there you go mate because these duo games tend to go down to the wire you know people usually no one really dies in these joe games so yeah i wonder why oh getting fancy with it the wall jumps on on revenant and aren't as long as anyone and you're the character no they're weird you can like you can barely wall jump with them it's it's weird they're like little baby wall jumps they all just like so far confetti i could call it i know i can rub i mean i don't know it might be a waste of year old what's the puppet yeah if we combine it with my rope but i don't know if anyone's actually here you see would have been a waste yeah i don't even know where anybody's that that wasn't the plane against on the back by a charge rifle i'm having a good time giving a giggle now i'm gonna giggle get up i can't have a shot there's more i'm going to oh don't be charged in the back to mate oh god pick this up oh god please stop charge rifling me please i cannot wait to kill this guy multiple teams i lost my red armor too yeah i don't know where my half my stuffies okay let's go that way i'm scanned there's another team i'm getting shot by another yeah yeah this is really weird mate we're just turning the corner away the corner chillers do you want to rush i need to get my break i need to get some shock and ammo there we go perfect i say we just hide here for a little while just a little bit just we're just going to blow off just by about i'm going to pop an ulti so real quick what are you going to do buddy they're coming up they come up that's a really bad play because there's a billion people shooting at us yep i really want to rush the charge rifle guy do you know where he's i have no clue to be honest you've got 22. okay he's really low really low 28. oh my god i'm actually just gonna die i'm so stressed out no give me that let me back your friends they're up top they're up top on this little thing i've got my rope but i don't know if it's worth it i'm just trying to get to this one cam on an angle i say we push this i say okay she's like 20 health mate oh my god thank you get that red get that red i have five bucks you need something um i have zero heights or do you need anything i swooped all that no no no here you go here you go there's two does you have lights yeah okay two squads left i'm so stressed out dude how much money is this game for again what is it is it 10 000 or is this wonderful i think we get like a uh 100 000 contracts 100 grand one yeah i think i'm going to drop my bolt and pick up this flat line because i'm running out of ammo yeah um right there he's really low i got him where's the guy she poured it away uh she poured it away over here somewhere in here i think oh i accidentally took the portal nice i was getting away from that and then i'll pop something all right i know that last team heard all that there's no way they didn't so it's got to be they're just trying to go for the dub it's either solo hiding or to do just really going for that dub it's for a rope oh wow dude just didn't even think about me i did after you're coming over didn't even think about me over here there's no way to push me i'm going up to you the other side all right this is not the time thank you not the time though she's literally waving her fluffy tail in my face all right someone's near me not now they might be down low maybe it was you 26 slash yes obviously the guy that means i can use a finisher on this one hold you touched it he cranked it uh they both had blue shield which leads me to believe they didn't really do anything in that game they were just they're just vibing out having a good time it might not have even been their fault because everyone was on us and they may have landed like docks you know well they probably didn't even have any kills again actually i thought we had a what that's crazy i thought we had way more damaging kills
