hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some more soloq ranked here in diamond trying to make our way up to masters before the end of the split next week and we're doing a pretty decent job last week we got to see newcastle for the first time we learned about his character and his abilities but hidden away on apex's website was this announcement it reads rise and fall through the ranks together in a reworked rank system that rewards teamwork and skill so there are a few points to focus on here i think the biggest news is the rise and fall for a long time people have complained about hard stuff players in diamond 4 at 7 200 rp and masters 10 000 rp because they play as if they have nothing to lose and that is because they have nothing to lose once you make a rank in apex you cannot be demoted i haven't suffered from this too much personally as i haven't put too much time into ranked but i can imagine 10 000 rp plays in masters just rushing everything mindlessly throwing the game themselves and whoever they rush would be frustrating i would probably be at 10 000 rp the hearthstone masters player so absolutely zero disrespect here but i do see the frustration now demotions aren't guaranteed and confirmed just yet but you have to feel like with the wording that we see here that this will be the case and i think that's a good change secondly the reworked system rewards teamwork and skill perhaps kill participation now will be spread between the team instead of you having to get an assist with damage like it is now it can be a bit frustrating not getting any ranks points when you're clearly helping the team be with positioning holding a flank or if you've damaged someone and the assist on the front sect this would alleviate the problem and make it way more consistent i think they sound like great changes and i am really enjoying rank these splits i'm definitely going to put some more time into it next but as well let me know what you guys think in the comment section thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed today's video i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends so i'm coming here because i've got ralph on my lap and i'm playing at a weird angle because ralph is just ginormous oh my god they are here i'm going this way because there's four beans and you can go inside if i die it's ralph's fault if i died ralph's fault i don't have a gun i do know feel free to enter the experiment papers he's teammates let me get the assist on this guy come on all right it's me again in the post game post game commentary section the analysis the post game analysis desk all right basically what happened is the octane got away and then we did absolutely nothing until there was one squad left and we had the high ground here one of the diving boards and we sort of just played our advantage and kind of destroyed this team it did get a little bit shaky this uh this give the ultimate did destroy me but i found some uh i found a cover popped a bat and then immediately we are back on the front foot and the reason i've shown you this game because it wasn't a banking game absolutely anywhere near a brand new game the reason i'm showing you is because i feel like the road to masters is more of a it's a journey it's about the journey it's not just like oh hey guys i did it i'm hearing masters and then that's the fun these games i'm gonna have them along the way where not much happens but they are very important for the progress and look at that we take out the last team i get 3 kp oh sorry 4 kp and it's a ton of uh ton of rp overall there we go you really can't get rid of me you thought that was the end no i'm back listen i do have a live commentary after this game but i wanted to show you another one of those important games along the way this time we're playing with a fuse and valkyrie we landed at the very northern part of the map and had no one in our hemisphere there was not a single soul involved in any of the places that we were looting so much of the action happened here right at the end and honestly i i really don't mind your bullets i can i can uh what my muscles here i was i was doing a commentary idiot i'm doing a post commentary trying noise people you're annoying me mate with you with your actual live commentary anyway we do i spent way too long waiting we should have got involved here way too soon but we had every opportunity to get a decent amount of kp here kp and good placement means that you are going to find this team managed to uh take out everyone's squad apart from the solo horizon or is it an option i don't know but they are dead i managed to have been with the r301 and as i said i do have a regular live commentary right after the end of this game but these guys are up top unfortunately for them they did have to push us uh push us i've got a little bit of better positioning here on the left split from the team kind of being this here i think i might have missed someone go down there to the left there he goes to the horizon she's going back up she thinks that she can challenge me absolutely not i've cracked her as well unfortunately they do oversee it so cancel my bat and i am on the radar for this game and i think the next game as well they could still see me because it lasts that long horizon goes for a bit of a flanking maneuver i could see a head like a game of whack-a-mole i'm trying to reposition up to the spaceship i'm trying to fly out of here unfortunately i'm playing against horizon as you know and she gets a high ground and i'm kind of screwed magrude so i have to reposition and at this moment i thought the game was lost because the seer ultimate is so powerful in these team fights but you just got to try and take some of the heat away from your team i got two people busy over this way grappled up sprayed them down and managed to secure the victory with the squad and this was a load of rp and kp as well beautiful all right on to the live commentary team who the heck is this that guy's lagging that guy's skipping everywhere why don't you try my teammate did i get an assist on this yes i did it's unbelievable did he leave oh nice oh yeah wait he left what making contact was trying to reload i am repairing myself scan myself that was a ghost here or something no my sniper stock man i'm going to be zooming in real slow until i get that that's so sad oh huge an instant win on this gunfight out there i've got faith in my teammates after they're looking that way wait they're running targets i think what are they doing where they going oh come on man i am taking fire friends fight reach oh my god that guy's in the gym that guy's in a god spot hopefully can't see my massive pathfinder head i don't think so i mean we could just turn we could just take the rope here we don't have to change these enemies wants to push these they have caustic be careful and horizon this is a terrible push this is a bad push it's bad push hitting the eject button okay so obviously this was a bad push for me i didn't realize that all three were up there i could hear my teammate shooting from a little bit further away from down low i thought maybe one up top all three of them were up there and the server was lagging i got those three red squares no idea why the caustic was lagging everywhere it doesn't matter though my teammates got my banner they've respawned me i crafted a load of medkits crapped a load of bats and we got back into the action right here using grapple watch it also landed near me sir watch my back tracked one two that's two cracks knowing these guys they probably want to push yep they are reloading i don't have a digi though oh my god firing i'll see what is with this server man this server is so horrendous well this survey's so horrendous look at it i've got the three red boxes man this never happens to me in uh public games it's only ever ranked and i don't understand there can't be that many diamond games going on right now uh what do i actually need i need to take a second here to think what i need throw balls shield cells maybe no i don't need light touch more heavy shield cells and then some throw balls ultimate accelerant here i'll do nice i had to save for my teammate there one minute the ring isn't far only got three kp though i was a team this way too that's a mirage target over there he's looting call him if you nuts him i don't trust i mean can you see that that's skipping it let's go this way let's see anyone inside which is surprising this decent little spot to lock down this we've got shield basin if we need them anybody need energy these stupid bars are they saying once down there right here they only got tough i think that might be decent shows oh come on we're inside the ring over there are who's ready to fly on a zip line i am thermite grenade this should be a solo around here i've been i don't know if it was a courtesy because there'd be more gas around i don't know who he was though oh if i could have caught the wraith we'll head shot get some flesh damage on she was puffing a bat so i'll do we're in a strong spot but this team up top's going to be annoying that big scrap in there i fall back i'm okay let's move back this way as well this is a really bad angle i need to make it so like i'm down here and using this as a head glitch instead i wish i had some pinks i don't know if i didn't know there was some beneath us these guys aren't communicating with me could have got an extra kp i think that might be solo lucky us we are already inside the ring giving my shields a recharge well i don't know we've got trouble i don't know abs cause i want to keep my charge on this i'm gonna leave that guy back here because he can shoot his team in the back i'm not safe on this little corner should be around here somewhere i'm going to save that yeah he said don't shoot that guy yeah yeah i like it team nice that's just a solo i think they might get some kp if they need it nice well played gg yeah as soon as i saw they they had to get the solo there unless they wanted to play inside and as soon as i saw one back up we take the roof from them even if you take damage along the rope if there's three of you you should be fine you know then you've got the high ground nice and i love the fact that my teammates said don't shoot these guys i'm i'm frozen no i'm back i'm back on the map i'm back on the map i've got some more people to kill hello who the heck is that my teammate oh there we go nice team oh 7kp oh and in the uh the valkyrie fuse game that i did a postcom over on earlier i actually made it to d2 so there you go we are climbing me migos we are climbing
