hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are continuing our solo to masters grind and i have two games here for you today listen i am playing solo i just bumped into the same two players that were playing together in two consecutive games in fact it was three consecutive games because the intro clips here that you're watching was a game in between the two games that i have for you now i've been loving ranked recently i think public games the moment are just i don't they don't do it for me you know the lobbies just die out so fast it's hard to get fair fights in ranked you have to think about what you're doing there is strategy and it feels like a real struggle for survival i hope you guys enjoyed both the games that i have for you today thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this is a risky drop i've spotted this though so we're all good i'm gonna let the teammate look the rest of that this is worthless i mean bodies this link i can't complain i can't complain here we go my loot is tremendous tonight's ping the blue armor less than 10 seconds after we dropped and none of us need it that's how you know looking for some extended heavy i know has gone well uh the light mags are in the crafter so i don't really need to look in the hold i need a lot i need to craft light mags and i need to craft bats did anyone else land over here i don't know i'm kind of scared i'm here i've really wanted to craft a light mag but i'm coming over i wanted the light max so bad look at that for a grapple when i don't have a light bag but we've got such good armor is there a crafter down this way yes there is nice we win the fight we get kp and as a reward i craft a lone mag he said don't craft this one is for you hey thanks man extended late night here level three what guy crafting here that was kind of greedy of me but i really wanted kp nice so i shot the last second because i could have just let them run into my teammate kind of greedy of me but literally worked singularity deployed reloading target over there please let me get on him and this guy's gone let him leave opening fire who the heck is this guy is that him he's going to get lobas he's going to get lowe's uh uh banner i need some light guy has none but he did i assume i mean i'm kind of carrying you know i don't look at the damage 39 damage i'm landing on him get him get him mess him up kick him right in the teeth [Music] no teeth left is that too aggressive it's not it's not whack him yeah this guy's upset because he can't chase like we can look at this we're way too far ahead for him my inventory sucks i'm going to help by protecting over there really it's sean of that man out of bounding these guys oh if you can see me i'm here i don't have any med kits reloading my shields i shouldn't really drop beat uh be dropping syringes but it's only first zone what's this guy doing in the corner by the way getting the cup is the answer bless him we just grief him in the zone oh my god man it's a full team of three just leave my banner i have kp it's fine i have like four med kits maybe maybe three i don't know worth looting though i can't believe i'm alive pop this can probably make zone this team is probably gonna be waiting for us again though they're pushing the pushing can you give me one sec okay then i'm here never mind oh and also teamwork 10 seconds the ring is fairly close my team already went peaked by the way this is going to be tough i think i found a mobile respawn beacon i am taking recharging shields broken enemy shield repairing nice teammates recharging enemy down recharging shields one minute before the ring closes we have time don't worry orbits that way i need help they ain't trying to back did we just grief do you have any make it i sharp the rings near and closer so much damage teammates moving up here took out an enemy nice work how are we alive man i just kind of peppered those guys teammate absolutely popped off as well is that that better team mate that's just the shadow coming down from the head from the heavens wait i have no light rains man i need light ammo i can use that i need to recharge my shields thank you one absolute beast this horizon is contact with target any bats i only have one bass friends nice teammates what the heck is going on man repairing my damages enemy taken maybe this is the guy that started the game i'm pretty sure we're fine looking snares maybe this is the scene from earlier there's only got blue nice team his teammate cheating like how do you know this guy's there i don't think he i don't think he is because he would have warned me about the people earlier on so i want to grab on these guys i forgot did someone push we should go this way what is this i should have grappled up top we're getting oh that was the last team i didn't realize well play guys nice try man we look at this damage man i had two kills and 2400 damage but still it was fun lazy gun not terrible could be worse i want to get with these guys soon because they like to go this is the third third game with them first blood contact oh man this guy had the jews never mind oh that was a nice little tap straight from this guy too though pretty well to win that fight can i pick it up i want to offer one so bad i've got outside too uh and we've killed this team i destroyed those guys anymore this is horrendous my teammates are so aggressive i want to go up there i guess not i'm just grappling whenever i need to though opening fire that's not good oh my god what a demon this horizon is way too good i'm kind of suspect to be honest with you over there we should go this way now for the right choice i'll try and cover for if i can that one guy dude is that that team that's that team oh my god how annoying is this team man watch out tremendous i mean there's another team there are a few teams uh east as well be careful i mean it's an it's annoying like they're sat back with a bow but i mean i've ratted for an entire diamond game many times before like if you've got a bow and arrow that's exactly what you're doing you know attacking here if i can't nice work thanks just a tick healing up eye sharp the ring's near and closing and dirty oh i felt good i might as well do that using my phoenix kit that felt real good my aim there was kind of snappy a little bit snappy especially on the it's hard to hear bangalore sometimes and i don't think i'm that good with the mastiff one hip firing and two um with a digital uh digital throne and i still landed a few shots so i'm happy with that engagement i mean i'm sorry i'll use the arthro one for three times a lot but when you're trying to play solo solo uh ranked is there anything i need here like what am i running around without maybe another throwable would have been good i'm sure there was one there this is three and seven so there's uh two people missing there there are two people missing oh my god nice everything reviving there i think somewhere oh she's just heading lasers landed a hedge on me what oh my god this guy just lands the crazy swing manager on me so unlucky oh that was a nice try the right is so aggressive this guy bless him he's in a 1v3 like he's not even trying guys let him give him a win hey give it away no
