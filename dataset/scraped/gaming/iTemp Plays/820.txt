hey wassup gauzy - rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course today we are going to be talking about the new event coming to apex legends on Tuesday it's called system override this event brings with a new item and new game-mode 24 new skins and a new heirloom from octane which happened little preview off start off with the new game mode is called de jour loot and this mode sounds really interesting the premise of ease so the loot is actually fixed there's no more run around looking for a weapon at the start of the game well that may happen to begin with but as soon as you learn some of the good loot splash you can just return the next game to guarantee yourself purple shield and that honor to know that you always dreamed of start with even the plain path the dropship and the circle locations all be fixed for this mode and these will change on a daily basis to shake things up for clarity the loot is fixed for the entire week is the plane and the circles that are fixed on a daily basis the first week is actually my own Wars edge and the second week is will be on Kings Canyon the most exciting part of this event for me however is the new item it's called the Evoque shield and this item starts off a little weaker than the common body shields it sounds underwhelming so far but there's a twist Danny damage turn-on band plays will progress the shield when it can eventually become even stronger than the purple body shield evil shields change color as they progress where they can be differentiated from other shield types by a distinctive blue you can sort of see that on screen the moments the progress also carries over to whoever picks it up now this is an experimental item which will have a highest spawn rate in the day jaw lutes game mode and then respawn will actually consider adding it into the base game after the events another heirloom for this event is a butterfly knife and it's exclusive to octane we even have a little preview on the screen at the moment there was actually some good news with heirlooms for people that don't have them from now on respawn and making it easier to get the heirlooms that you want rather than just being a little bit random when you're open in a pack from now on opening packs gives a chance to be rewarded with what's called heirloom shards and once enough are collected you can in exchange it for whichever heirloom set you want that's all for this event it's coming on Tuesday the 3rd of March so it's less than a week until this event but that is all the info I have today but I've got a gameplay for you as well so I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right larvae cities me amigos this is actually a bit of ranked team divers that I barely have any time left and I don't even have any loops because there's no the team that landed here and she decided not to shoot move it up June 7th scale I'd appreciate that one race thank you very much well I need now is a decent weapon because my team eyes are still over that way here we go Crayola might be some little top mighty Knights aren't fighting just yet worth checking there we go worth it my surprise I reckon into the race here I'm coming it wasn't a caustic maybe it was the Pathfinder punching and that's it's such a process with blue shield sees impenetrable is getting their job Raza IDs can you feel them it took the whole team take notes oh it's great for there's nothing more terrifying than a reporter with decent shelter the star the game absolute hero what I have rowing acts I preach I that one now we've got the Gibraltar now a team that works I've got nothing I'm afraid I've got some energy rains and that's it I find a havoc on picking it up someone who's actually respawning they're teaming these boxes these this must been a separate team that must been in a separate fight this must be the guy respawn in right now you know I was having for some more bullets knees the catch up to him actually hasn't gone far all right so I guess that's the guy that was respawned he's on his last legs there you go Sheila's that's just sad it's matter famo beautiful arrangement of he'll boss it yeah look at this guy all you needed was a bit of she or they would have been a force to be reckoned with and unfortunately for him he had all the shield and healer balls but none of the actual physical shields it's a key components they're not dying on this game if you went away thanks except he not me to drop that at all I honestly I hate dropping oxides especially when there might only throwable but I don't like carrying our loss unless I've got at least a level two back because I just want to have ammo and he lost way too quick otherwise there we go I'm glad you brought us off looking it this man's going on an adventure well you often is off together will speed your boys Pathfinder I can catch up real fast might be good to watch right here I'll do it it's been absolutely rabid if our supposed to try and tap the gun there but it doesn't matter what he might have definitely got weapons what a waste I know it's looting what a waste of time let's all just get the hair can freak out of here no worries sir I got you I dropped syringes back there too but I forgot to ping them there is no way I had to try and quick stop that should be more patient be sort of out Gold children guaranteed or to begin instead oh my god every single accented heavy mic I could have at level 1 level 2 or level home I'll tell level 3 please thanks very much that just means that if it was a gold cargo but it would have dropped a gold extended heavy moment I've missed out on that a shame only because you found the ball 3 though that's not an authentic level to drop you know or maybe these it was telling that hey listen undersupply be and horsin expected it's a pink at level 3 armor of course oh there was someone here anyway what a waste of a journey could have just diluted a stir private but where is everyone by the way I thought Trainyard here was gonna be absolutely popping off maybe because this is sauce in fact you're not trained gosh I always call it train yard because he's got a train station that's a care package that wasn't on the map it it means there's a lifeline over there picking up a free level three shields I'll tell you what absolutely not that's what some fences the world's greatest building hasn't been looted for some reason we'll just see what all right listen this is the world's greatest rock I'm not having then it's not let's see what you missed Article II level to extended mag Arthur 1 and level 2 shields and then you'd have been set you've been renewed scrapped or city absolute laughing it's just got the best loops I'm telling you my level 2 art a white scrubs or city that's more level to shields than anywhere else on the map whatever see here oh my god there's the undeniable sound of it you could I think you've seen this way there's the undeniable sound of a scrap in the distance I wish I say my ultimate because now my team it's gonna be struggling to follow me over this mountain but I'll tell you what teammates in 84 years since I fired my weapon and I'm not missing out on the opportunity I'll just try and play safe you need a trophy if you find a select-fire instead let me know it fire oh hey friends how did you get fortunately Walter is that life is steroids the revives come in quick and quick and easy ready for pods a good price the burst fire problem maybe even better than the floor top in certain circumstances I think teammate help me out here alright my team I turn a 2v1 I believe in him vegetable to help inmate there you go kill him leader eliminated in the world's greatest third party however that wasn't too bad as a third party they still stood a decent chance they what I was talking about 24 shield sauce it Latrese like looting me from season but to me I was going to say from season one from them from last week I got seven batteries someone come take these someone has to no idea what I'm losing here it doesn't even matter there are three of the squad's left we really don't need that much I'll be at the Prowler in burst fire I mean I prefer to be fully altered but it's DPS it's actually higher I start like a select-fire though didn't have one I thought I will finish this points the burst fire DPS is actually higher than fully auto however it's just more difficult to learn shots the recalls higher coming you have to focus on trying to spam the trigger that's why full auto is preferable in my opinion cuz you get the chance to stay your shot a little bit scare the living daylights at me both need help there you go here happy birthday friends thank you happy to help friend back it's London might be something good this way I'd land on the care package but I'm a bit scared there's gonna be a team over there let's see if this is Luton or not first if it's not loose like an assault over it's still very good we've used to Ultimates one a Kramer on the wards of us create a sniper so that's up for grabs I should have said multimode just use the right bottle here because the best thing about pathfinder in Trainyard don't see you go 6070 he's been able to use your ultimate to get back up top just text your whole team there as well blinded every sean practice shields there you go alright questionable accuracy but it's okay but in this always got a Garlock downhill may be the last one in his team I'll do this cuz I might actually get kill credit for it he's one of the team's I used my body shots though the last two teams and you could rice no okay we knew that reporter to make sure that they're not running over now we know were the last team is he's looking that way that's good try and get some I Grange it's not worth it I think we should just be careful yeah I should have went to do the birdcage I can still get there it's gonna tell me a little bit extra time I don't think that Russian anyway I think the tronic gate keep the safe zone yeah now what huh you've been bought this is a Sunnah hell he's launching stuff now this is good news that wasted bad Bangalore ultimate as well all right that way closer than I thought what are you doing I left the car shield was polishing he's held up by name holy dude blessed it was a 1v3 anyway thank you I appreciate the give people a beautiful day I think there was a bit of a law in the mid-game but he started off strong don't we end it strong that's the main important thing there especially 1819 says Gigi Gigi friend how your play says Gigi eighteen hundred damage eight kills we've got four kills coming out that you brought someone kill from right right death maneet deserved whooping one kill for nearly 750 damage solid game though I think I think we may have ranked up we did indeed there we go plannin one for me one more rancor till we reach diamonds and then it gets a little bit more serious because then we're starting to get the Masters and the Predators in our lobbies well thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one
