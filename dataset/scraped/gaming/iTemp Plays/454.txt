hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the other day i made the mistake of saying that rampart had the lowest win rate in apex but i was wrong and many of you guys my loyal viewers were quick to let me know that fuse actually has the lowest win rate but i like fuse i like the idea of his character i like the theme i think his passive is kind of useless though i've never needed to send an ark star into orbit who is throwing stuff this far i i really don't get the knee i think they should change his passive to actually giving each of the three nades a unique advantage compared to other legends for example the frag grenade could become a cluster that does more damage afterwards the thermos could leave a trail of fire where the enemies run off to once they are burning to let you know where they have gone and the ark star could have a bigger blast radius i think the arc star is already opie if they did make this change i would hope that they would just nerf the ark star the original stun and the original damage if you stick someone is way too good it's like 170 damage in total but apart from that i like his closer tactical and i like the fire ring of doom ultimate let me know what you guys think of fuse in the comments and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wherever the people are a bunch of people come this way yeah yeah i'm skimming off the atmosphere of the reef to make myself go faster i'm landing here no yeah um he's running off into the sunset i still don't

way i'm getting punched by three people just saying i mean it was one of those situations where all three were on me i run you get there at the that same second and then all three are on you and you know it's just kind of you survived though you're doing good yeah the i'm saying chase man at the rink i had shine him in the body he's dead and his team i was just in the ring watching in horror i could see the look of that face he was he the watcher was just standing in the corner just watching it was just oh it's so great i love the ring because of that because you can just like maneuver around so it's so great i hate hopping out and you have to press triangle to get your gun out and if you don't press it the right time it's like yeah it's kind of a little sketchy big value i'm surprised that it wasn't taking these lobbies oh sorry i was laughing all crap you know i was testing the trajectory that wasn't even that wasn't even a failed grapple that was just a failed uh attach attachment i'll fail you i know you mean not really foreign oh lifeline is actually one html i've literally loved so much i've done about five damage and toe off with that that's not it according to that point behind that don't first one kill don't that's my kill what is that oh it goes over here what what you know the last name that guy made it entertaining you are the apex champions
