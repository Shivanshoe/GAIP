hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and usually when so far and i play we sort of have an unwritten code of if you're not having a great game yourself and the other person is popping off maybe just take it a little bit easy there is no need to try and compete for kills when you already know that you're not using that game for a video however every now and again we do get a little bit competitive with the damage count and maybe even the kill kegs but this one was more damage and this was one of those games it went right down to the wire and we actually did so much damage as a team hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um i'm gonna i'm gonna go to four story i missed four story yeah let's do it let's do it i'm taking no no no no no no no oh what is this just dead dropped where the heck is she she's just jumping around and like every time i touch a rope i have to reload it's the most annoying thing he fought the first two i was trying to aid yes but he wouldn't let me but it actually worked out i would like to drop this uh headlock as soon as possible oh i i hate this game i hate the sound just one whack him just punch him double punch top of the g7 okay it's a mess as always recharging turbo charged evo yeah that was yeah that
