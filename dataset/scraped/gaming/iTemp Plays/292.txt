hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got a new trailer for the upcoming rampart town takeover event happening on tuesday the 14th of september with it comes a new area on world's edge a new heirloom a ton of new skins and some changes to weapon and legend balancing as well so let's start off with the heirloom it's ramparts of course and it's a wrench it's called the problem solver and it's probably the most fitting heirloom you could think of for rampart it's useful for fixing things and also whacking people over the head with as a secondary use though you could argue that that's a secondary use for literally anything i mean it's pretty cool looking the ramp up mains out there will be happy that she's getting some love i'm sure though rampart isn't the most popular legend in the world so it will be interesting to see how many of these heirlooms rampart you see out in the wild and the public games next up we have the town takeover as you can see on screen here this new area is called big mood i think i'm pronouncing that correctly and this new point of interest is just north of lava city and it's rampart's modding shop which is really interesting to see on the map it's quite a big point of interest with a load of looting points as you can see on the screen and i got this from ea's website inside the shop you can use collected materials to purchase ramparts custom modded paintball weapons from the new vendett machines these guns cost a bit but they come fully kitted at different tiers this should give players a reason to rotate here mid-game if their weapons aren't quite as upgraded as they would like to and it probably explains why many of the guns in this trailer come with the one times two times variable scope which for some reason the apex legends devs absolutely love i don't know if you guys remember the limited time mode where those care packages would drop at the start the blue care packages always dropped weapons that had a one times two times variable scope that you just could not get rid of so you can go to this spot and you can upgrade your guns and materials that you've collected which i think is a pretty cool concept however this area is really quite far out of the way of the popular point of interest on world's edge meaning that i'll probably only come here mid to late game if the zone takes me this way it'll be interesting to see how this works though and maybe they could implement these vendor machines throughout the map at different points of interest that change from game to game now alongside these changes that we can see here we did get some patch notes too and the most notable changes for me were the ramper buffs she can now move and shoot with sheila which you may have seen in the trailer it'll be amazing considering how her weak point beforehand with sheila was that you were forced to be static and the animation of getting on and off often got you killed on a turret so this should be a lot of fun alongside the ramper bus we also have some slight octane nerfs some shattered cat buffs and a slight hemlock buff as well so let me know what you guys think of this update i'll have the full breakdown of this event on tuesday the 14th of september so if you're new here be sure to subscribe some daily apex legend content thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends mozam let's go over here i've landed on about 12 volts today i mean i'm not complaining i love the vault i'm honestly probably better with the mozambique and i'm really bad at mozambique so that lasted all of about 12 seconds but i'd still rather use the mozamed in the pk not sure what it is i sucked for that gun oh okay purple vault rampage jackson when you absolutely do not need an extended mag on the rampage i mean it never stops spawning anyway i am down to push anyone who's fighting i'm ready to scrap all right rampage with two thermites a vault with a level three extending mag we've got three purples if we don't fight now enemies we are never going to scrap we're ready to go no one's in this building i mean this is such a broken passive still they nerfed it a little bit but it's still so broken oh god uh we got the octane coming the lifeline is still looting a little bit i'm hoping these guys are going to make their way across the bridge they are why you aiming at me when there's a big scrap over there there's no way you're that interested in me we've got to get over that teammate it's all popping off wait i'll do three damage with someone i first hit them on the ground for three damage i can't hop up stage is gonna get this cooking again there's no one behind us which is worrying say the least i definitely should have had the rampage eliminated hello amigo oh my god i love this place especially when you come in late third party with like three of us with goodly she's ludicrous i have way too many heavy bullets i don't have any thermos give me some more thermos please any of these people then here i don't like to eat right that much if anyone's got anything more suitable i'm gonna get my old vault back my heart goes up to you unveil yourself storm's coming in but we should be fine i was unfortunate oh my god there's a post in the way and now we're screwed i saw you teammate 10 seconds can i make it god what a game that guy died to a third party i need to just loot here i've got a violent teammates banner it's gonna loot in the zone stack up on something the balls and some other good stuff double flat line might be time i can't find any of these hey there's another squad this is my red i think isn't it nope it's a vault key why would i pick that up when you're solo it's really good to have a shotgun me [Music] prevailed over an enemy okay that's our third party i've gotta run as far away as possible i'm not i'm honestly not gonna go there there's one team left there's absolutely zero rush here we can go all the way in fact i might type it no rush gonna run far i'm trying to type whilst i mean it's one-handed time for more so holding the left stick there this direction let us go i'm going to keep team are all high easy w this is looted i mean they better not be here there's no way they're gonna they're gonna be here right they're probably going for care packages right now watch them both leave by the time watch them both leave right as they're coming back now what to create all right loads of loot round here i mean i don't have a single shield battery to my name which could prove maybe i should have looted just a just a tiny bit for a shield battery or two i thought i heard someone back there that's why that's why i was running there's a replica coming down and i have 70 i can just make some i'll just leave these guys to heal oh sorry loot up and i'm going to go craft might be a bit dodgy i don't know i think these guys could be running over because you can see that respawn from so far away it's the last team like where else can they go i don't have to die i'm gonna go craft you need bats especially for the last fight you definitely need bats gone that craft be risky because the care package is here please don't crave me i'm gonna start crying i'm safe don't throw don't throw don't throw i'll put them off my ultimate got an enemy out there okay so they were just chilling near a care package all right i don't think these guys that great i don't know why they sat there and they didn't go for the care package at all that was right next to them so my shield bass is safe they are you know used i want my shield bats i want them so bad definitely three of them perfect okay this is she just like running into the sunset like she's literally not here anymore she doesn't even have anything to heal with nice gg guys well played thank you for patience you are the apex champion that's a fun game this is all you big team effort there's no way like there's no if i don't have teammates there we don't win like stoke works oh nice
