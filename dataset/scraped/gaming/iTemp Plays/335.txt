hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apex legends themselves just revealed the first gameplay of sia on their channel we actually get to see him in action in season 10 and how his abilities properly work and interact with other legends now of course his passive is the heartbeat sensor and this is what it looks like whilst his ads this appears on his screen as like a circle which pulses and the orange parts seem to be the location or angle of enemy heartbeats this is such a powerful tool for finding enemies if there are any rats in the lobbies trying to hide for rp for their team seer will find them and hunt them down next up is ability it's a delayed tunnel of micro drones which reveal enemies and it's also confirmed as an interrupt which should stop any enemy action including any abilities they're currently using but also things like healing as well this looks extremely powerful and from the legend trailer the tunnel itself looks generously large as well so landing it shouldn't be too much of a problem for sia his ultimate looks amazing as well the dome of micro drones highlighting footsteps and enemy players even through smoke this is the best third-party ultimate apart from uh revenants probably just throw it down on an ongoing fight you're running there and you're clearing them all up with your team see looks so much fun and i can't wait to play him what do you guys think about his kick because i think it looks amazing thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends dollars is i i have to like think about it for a few weeks the worst i think when i bought my herman miller it took me like uh like like three months yeah you told me about that and then i was waiting for it to come to the uk and you're like i got it and then you're like you know what it sounds great and it fixed your back yeah it was it was probably the best investment i've ever made look i'm sat down all day so i may as well sit down in luxury yeah it's 100 worth it and i had a secret lap too which isn't like that's not a cheap chair either like a four or 500 chair and they're really really high quality but going from that to the hermann miller it was just like a complete night and day difference i deal with back pain every single day so it was so
