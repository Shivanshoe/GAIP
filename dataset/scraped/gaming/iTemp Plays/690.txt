hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing bangalore i had to put an end to the caustic maintenance it was getting way too toxic there on the battlefield and with pathfinder nerfed i had to go back to el trusto bangalore my first real main on apex legends when i first started playing actually i did my mirage but not for long it was literally like like five days it doesn't count and bangalore is still so much fun her passive makes her so difficult to hit and her hitbox is deceptively small as well she's still such a fun choice and in yesterday's video the majority of you guys said that you prefer the lesser edited damn videos so you can hear the conversation so thank you for the feedback i do appreciate it i've taken it on board and i have edited this video a ridiculous amount i haven't i'm kidding so yeah thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this is your champion you know what i look like are you gonna get a cyberpunk when it comes out nothing wrong with that do you play it regularly no i have to stop myself because if i play brusca regularly i will literally set my alarm three hours earlier than usual to wake up and play for 12 hours a day and probably isn't that healthy so yeah that's not the game to uh mess around with no no there's lots of people here yeah i have purple but no gun someone's in between us oh here take this take this oh thank you give me a sec off by that way someone's in the charge the game they get they got triple taped triple ticker from where i think before there's a lot of people around here i'm coming into you i'm coming in i'm coming in let's go nice i have one shield cell i'm gonna drop your battery in this box thank you nice nice nice yeah there was a predator call stick with a truck tank somewhere just letting you know okay then you know i'm gonna go jump on his head i like it i got a purple bowl massive i'm ready to fry there's a team underneath me full team full team in my building oh yeah cracked one's in here down behind him like it nice nice 100 oh baby nice job man no you too you're frying look at my health you're really weak appealing is there a phoenix by any chance no oh and i know oh i'm using small heels it's so easy make it make it make it thank you do you need cells uh i have two hold that thought rich anyway i'm helping this guy's really laggy behind here oh my god oh my word he just managed to get out of that situation because he liked the crosstalk it's a team of two it's a pathfinder and a mirage and a date counts as three though because he's so laggy right there and then we're fighting another team so there's two still two teams here that's interesting he was shieldless i just couldn't heat him looks like the final boss everything went extra bad when he popped his ultimate yeah that was not pretty there's gonna be even more though i i don't know question is where did they go yeah no they're interested there it is respawn i don't know the pad glitch when i was rushing that as well which is very sad you know what causes it is uh you know you do you do the jump to get extra height right yeah if you do the jump a little bit too early it'll do the pad glitch every time yeah i think i think if you slide in there as well that can do it yeah slide and then do it about time we got ourselves a fight oh care package sweet i'm running over jenks i'm on the way oh is it tough two teams here i deleted a bloodhound badly i killed a bloodhound nice there's a guy over here trouble here what's up crack damn nice shots he's still in here somewhere i can get your thirst and i think he hit me for about the same let's go i'll okay i'll take it do you have any heavy uh no that i do not i have zero heavy what about the guy i killed over that way let me go see my sprint's broken so i keep like wait did we get the kill from the top that's the right here i think we did because i only shot two people there uh yeah you got you got both your kills uh i have no idea where i killed him thank you very much i i watched him fall down he his body is in this building down low bottom oh okay i think i must have looted him then yeah this is him right here thanks yeah i think i'll need him we just double check yeah i did dude that was kind of that was kind of fun that was a good little start it's clean a lot of people there yeah i had i've had to heal so much this game is ludicrous i was like i would turn the corner i would find a battery you would lose all your health i'm like take the battery there you go purple armor the battery delivery man i have a little i did that i think i did that three times i think you did the beginning yeah i can't even clutch though yeah that was perfect i'm still home from heavy by the way if you just if you see anything in passing yeah yeah heavy ammo here on padres thank you a level two bag would be nice here you still have a level one bag oh yes it's very sad oh there's gonna be one right here for you all right take it back i have been scammed oh heavy let's go do you need a wingman there's one there wingman here new sir most powerful hanger on the front here according to the cops yeah yeah i got the nine i got the nine massive my nine shot right now i don't know what is going on but everybody's catching a one percent oh there's a sorry there's a car package over this way and it's got your crater in it i doubt can you even get level two bags out of care packages that'd be a scam it's gonna be at least a level three no i think you can because doesn't it like have one gold and then i don't know i don't know it works oh god what are you shooting a flyer right we're here no i'll dream rachel good luck yes richard good luck and that fly you just shut down i'm gonna go looting if this is a level two bag i'm gonna quit the game i'm quitting don't because i've got a crib no i'm gonna quit and then i'm gonna play the lottery ah i can't believe you just pulled this for me i'm astounded oh more heavy here and your favorite site here close range oh thanks man oh i'm so excited i got the craver you're going to create right some people for me i hope so see listen the goal is i'm going to hit him once with the craver a juicy little body shot then you're just going to wrap it up yeah wrapped up with a g7 wrap it up or vice versa you know yeah one of the two ways you know what's probably gonna happen i'm gonna full sound like an idiot with the crater in my hand because you know attempt to know yeah and then i'm gonna get destroyed die and say it's completely okay because i did it for the content it was a risk worth taking and then i'm not gonna find a craver for another month especially at that point in the game yeah welcome to me finding a crater there's a lifeline package at bunker what could it mean oh there's a loba i just saw a loba crank the fattest bracelet toss i've ever seen in my life okay it's actually a huge toss dude yeah i'm probably just gonna stay on the oh they're in the water i'll let you cry before i do anything oh she did a little wiggle bro i got a no rig on her little lifeline guy he hit a little wiggle on me i need to do 47 damage okay oh yeah yes i got it i'm here for 68. i'm going up top i'm making a distraction downstairs oh that's not good uh no she's got a nasty and she saw me that's my bad nice love is just like chilling near the door she's she's coming off she's going same angle my strengths i had every confidence i love that little spot i was just trying to make a little distraction for you you did good yeah my hero that's why when king's canyon was like not in the game anymore i missed that spot so bad it was free kills on campus they just never saw it coming it's so fun yeah i love it scrap cave it looks like such a cool little clip too when you do it there's so many little little doors and windows you can do it too there's some really good ones you can do on world's edge as well uh yeah they have the windows as well that you can jump up on fire i saved one on each team i'm being a bully do i need to get you back no i'm debating i'm debating are they tough on me they're going to res it's a lifeline so the lifeline's going to get this res up here the pathfinder is going to be one shot unless they have a gold bag i just killed this oh it's different squad they're not yesterday rich i have an idea although it was so sick oh my god i got lasers that would have been incredible you could jump off maybe yeah let's go nice job i think i've gone back i don't know what that means you see what i did did you did you go for the jump pad no scope here come in uh hey battery um probably isn't that confused mate be honest with you yeah they're confused i don't know what they i don't know they're they're trying to gate people so i'm going to be setting them tracks on the plateaus practicing the guy nearly peak you all i love the smoke the product didn't help beside the bloodhound what happened on that rock hey no i should let you go for that that sucks i'm sorry i don't care dude i was already dead no
