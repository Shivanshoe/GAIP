guess how many kills i have on crypto zero uh no no come on zero okay uh under under 50. yes 49. oh nice nice guess if you emp your pathfinder he should just die you know he's just completely shut down she'll just melt this is not a good start oh no my binds are not correct that's not good i have a mozam there you get the rest time out time out time out time out okay simon right how do i nah don't worry instant respawn are you ready hold on i've got you they're gonna thursday falls foolish behavior how do i go upwards oh it's just like flying all right i'm down everybody chill chill chill chill that's the only reason i did it is so you could do this hold on okay can't get through that i'm outside i'm outside oh okay i got on the balcony can you rez like this instantly oh you can rest like that yeah i did not know that crazy does not know that that's so cool you may die but i just want to 100 100 i'm going to without a doubt i'm not there to protect you mate without that i mean but i have come to save them let's get out of here there's a mozam but that's it okay no please oh it would be a pathfinder he's crouch-striking like he's playing in the algs he might but you don't know yeah he might be we might be in there in their server by accident is he on you oh yes he's trying so hard don't worry i've got you man i've got you i have a plan i am sad don't be sad you're coming back very soon surprise i did not know that you could wrestle isn't that crazy uh how long has that been in the game season six haley i don't remember that oh wait this is the pathway that i think i've cracked up top when you're not giving up on them are you kidding me i'm fine you're killing me here mate no that's all right i'm it's for the cars i'm helping can i get here drakken i'm losing signal no no no no can i leave this hold on let's see l one x's i have to press l two so confusing good to go only ten seconds left and there's nothing i can ask the path i don't reckon he's looking for me oh no if you don't move they don't see you they're distracted he is aware oh we're good we're good figres you have to do the drone oh yeah oh no someone just used it oh my word big scam big scam no oh where's the next one i got you outside oh there's one artillery oh gosh oh take him to take him to the no chill hey friend do you mind finding this team for me oh no we're winning this game i'm winning this game with zero kills there are two people there though what can i do why are you still here this doesn't make any sense oh god i wish i had my grapple when i respond i have to wait 45 seconds so stupid activate i am activating okay incoming i think they're in the lower yeah they're down there they're going to see they're going to be oh no he's going back to you mate he's going up top you've got to watch your live crafting you can you can probably punch this guy you've got boxing gloves too where is he he went up on the he flew he flew [Music] putting an eye in the sky these guys are going to impede over here just because i haven't used my weight how do i use it are you kidding me okay it's a good job i came out there's someone that way careful okay there's people going up top i'm scared oh they're big scrapping they're gonna have to fall down i'm just gonna i'm scared here i go i might even pee i just don't have to use it you don't know how to use it different when you're in the drone what's me oh no no way there's no way he stops to shoot these let me out i just don't know the buttons it's so confusing there was so much loot there too i couldn't get it i couldn't get it fast enough i don't know anything buttons that's like how semi-loaded times have i someone say yes oh no i'm good to go i have 19 shots and an alternator i'm not just run you can't die it's right on me i'm actually terrified what how do i get shot by that between us but who cares i have a i have a havoc and uh i have a turbo oh you want the havoc you should use it you have better loot in everything okay thank you thank you this guy's so confused you need a big brain to play crypto yeah and i feel like you need to you need a good teammate too and i'm just dying so that's not true i've got to use this passive three times it's exactly the opposite what you need wait what's this passive i mean just like the drone respawn thing oh heaven you just need a work you just need a terrible teammate yeah exactly thank you terrible no no i didn't think you know that no no you did no i didn't oh you already did it is this always lifeline pack i think get out of the scam i have 20 shots and a hemlock that can text me there's gonna be a gold gun in here too i'm tempted to have a little sneak peek oh i hear some on me i'm gonna go down oh i'm going to you he's got the crater i won't it's so bad uh there's a little bit heavy right here oh thank you we can win this we have one kill i think i have two well you have two kills i don't know how i got them but i have two i'm gonna go this way yeah they're up there with the craver so we'll go together they were just waiting there little i'm afraid that's it that's a big shame oh so close to you he probably deserves a win he's got eight kills kill leader yeah all right i've done some good news though that was my 50th kill that's a little milestone oh nice just put that gigantic lg one just oh yeah the 86 inch yeah just imagine that and then i'll just use it just use it for spotify 80 inches of spotify oh my god imagine the immersion i'm the worst crypto in the world why i just crushed my own drone to death how can you do that i don't know in the doorway there are people near bunker they may have gone inside on my way i'll tell you if there's a fight but i'm recharging something there's a um i don't know if this is a good idea don't if you just heard that i'm running in there i don't care if it's a good idea or not oh okay i didn't hear that a call stick with a mastiff in bunker like this is oh no he's pulling someone in there too and even that's it me this is made in there catboy oh this might they're my i'm burning him in i can scan a few through this smoke hold on i'm gonna get that guy in there he's on me behind behind i can't get out of this thing oh god nice where did he come from did he get back i have no clue i can scan for you hold on why are you awake big brain play big brain play i can't find it i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this somewhere hold on how do i exit this place l2 i'm back nice the guy's like that's i'm gone chill no there he is they are you see him do you see him nice oh that was great don't worry about me i'm just fighting the whole team like you're trying to get the drone over here oh i don't like this guy he's so bad he's so just not useful at all it's only good if you come across that annoying like watson it's someone when people say oh he counters coursey he's like have you ever played against the caustic you'll get rid of his traffic i'll throw another one yeah i'll throw ten more he'll just hold yeah was there a period of time where it didn't slow your teammates i feel like it did and then they changed it back right i think yeah i don't i think it i think that was recent yeah why i feel bad for gary bob dude i don't come here let me thirst you gary bob where's his teammates see me just ran in america is gaza like a it's not easy i've never heard an american say gaza guys gaza hargas oh no i've never never heard that here sounds english how do i get out again how do i get out of it l2 l2 it's the same button to go in i need to remember it's the same button button the ring he went down low i scanned him big scan big scan intercepted two him again i aim for 144 oh my god you're insane hi yes oh these are looted in gold armor coming here peacekeeping oh i won't land any shots with that you pick it up nah i probably should disappoint yeah you definitely should alright i can get it yeah i should be able to get my drones open care packages and bring the loot to me like an amazon delivery drink oh it'd be so cool you would just take care back as you drop in and like eight crypto drones fly over there like trying to get the gold armor all right well this is useless the ring's finished no what do you mean that's huge okay don't don't take this one don't take this when he's right there okay yeah he's waiting go bottom yeah okay um [Music] oh gary bob died not gaza they're just camping inside okay i'm going to hurt open the door hey thirsty gary barb give me one sec i've nearly had my emp as well i'm good i'm healing real quick do you want a hundred she's absolutely devastated with the news for these next crashes oh someone's honest oh my god where 121 with a jump shot have one shot okay that's a huge scam i don't know what another oh he's a little red some of the names in this game are horrendous this he's throwing hands back hey i love the audacity dude i didn't know you took damage from your own emp yeah you do i don't know when that update was but yeah i think it's just you i don't think it's your teammates that would be great yeah i think you just slow your teammates my pk was hitting like big game from me hey you're hitting those massive scans i wish it was just a tracker for scans because you would be up there i might be the best crypto in the world i have not listened i don't know
