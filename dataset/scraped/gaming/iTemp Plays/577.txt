hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this video is undeniable proof that the hemlock is still after the nerf completely 100 broken beyond belief there is something about burst guns in this game that must be very difficult to balance because the hemlock and the burst prowler are some of the fastest killing guns in apex in the game that i have for you today i did 105 damage with one burst for hemlock it was ludicrous and i would never use the fully auto prowler because the burst killed far quicker on that little gun it was disgusting and i miss it i never get to use the prayer anymore it's it's just a sad time i have a great game here for you today over 3 000 damage in a short amount of time so far stole so many of them i'm still furious and i hope you guys enjoy it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh where are you landing again broken broken okay i think there's 45 people at four sorry uh yeah as always hey i have decent um i'm happy for you i don't know again this place is broken is always like outrageously there's literally somebody here oh my god he's shooting him you shooting my back i don't i i i don't know again i'm broken i need to go loot back here not with you guys at all almost with you hey what a mess dude i had to loot so much to find a a havoc oh that's about to be purple i'm taking it back i'm just gonna put some shield cells on actually you know i could put some damage on the replicator this is this is big this is a big brain it's literally very big it's literally quicker oh there's a big scrap going on he dropped down they're rezzing yet huh there's another one though i don't know where he is that's why i hide this building oh my god he was back here how are you i thought i checked that guy how are you back there i got my purple i don't know right um i think yeah landed right behind him uh there's a level three extended extent [Music] because half the lobby landed at four story you can just that's outrageous because they were they were like healing in the bottom thinking okay this one on me he literally landed that show on me i'm actually dead this guy's the best i'm tabbed out bridge okay already come here kind of started i have no idea who's man that shot on me i'm intimidated to say the least i'm mid reload i don't know horizons i'm trying to get one oh my god i'm getting some kills mate i'm doing i'm doing it same dude it's it's insane that pathfinder landed the crazy shaman i was like mid-air flying over his head and then i heard the graphic noise and i was just so scared i've never been that scared in my life never in your life ever no literally that's a deal do you know that was there he's gonna raise me i'm gonna chill i can you top up top yeah i'm outside and lifeline raising some way bottom floor i guess 13. wait need i thought to myself all right if i'd run out there i think i've nearly cracked him on blue i can miss his one charm okay and then i'll reload then he zoomed in me and that's always killed and i was like i've made a massive mistake i was so disappointed because i was like standing behind all of you guys and then uh wait is this your goal oh no it's not anyways okay i'm gonna go back to him i mean it was mine to begin with but i donated i'm almost a red anyways but um i was standing behind both of you guys and then that race came in and she shot and all of her bullets just uh just like gravitated towards me yeah they went straight i dodged it i saw it coming so i just ducked out of the way and that was like you were standing behind me yeah yeah yeah that was so unfortunate yeah you should be supposed to tank all those horsepower um yeah sometimes like i mean that's the most scared i was ever it was before but then and it immediately got taken off the top by that situation there's literally no audio on the i think i didn't know about the giveaway and then the race disappeared behind us destroying us so i probably should have called it out i saw the give you all but i thought everybody was inside so i was like we're chilling i'm obviously showing the route having a great time popping the shield [Laughter] i mean they have to push us so we're in an advantageous position we are indeed how many kills go that's seven yes i've got a good amount of damage okay where did these guys come from faster faster once they were like right they're all right they're all right there they have a sentinel and a triple take so today i didn't think i was gonna hit any shots i was shooting in with a havoc from that far i was like there's no way i hit those shots i'm so beaming with the with the r9 i'm still doing some damage with it are you yeah with the uh let's go let's go it's obviously online to be fair i don't often land too many shots at least but i'm just good if you if you take your thumb off the thumb stick you can aim assist aim for you you know and i've landed i only have shots this game i i do agree you literally don't have to do anything you plug in your controller and then you just put it down and then you're just kind of good you know i wasn't even flipped in i turned my knife after i just knew that i was uncontrolled before okay he just knows then put you just plain and we have just decided to live inside capital city basically we really haven't left have we no that's about as far as we went right there so this last one has to be someone that just landed like the icy pile in the doom and lose it for 10 minutes these wait there's two squares left i thought it was one uh those two yeah i didn't realize yeah you're just not as perceptive as you thought you were no i thought i was a tactician but yeah i thought you were too but not anymore by myself i'm afraid yeah yeah over there whoa whoa whoa where are my bullets going my aim kind of just disappeared did it yeah that's the last time i take the gold mate i don't have to hold it i'll drive full see him he's back getting flashbacks he's back already whoa oh 105 on it diving in i don't know where he's oh he said is it really you guys i don't even see that you are the apex champions noise like the hemlock is he's literally just not fair wow wow wow okay you're using a hemlock by the way using it by the way that's the beast broken by the way wait you're using a havoc you're using it from like mid-range that it's not broken like a mid-range you're you're that's not even close literally unbelievable this is what it's like so far oh god that's not broken
