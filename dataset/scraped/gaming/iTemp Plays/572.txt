hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and some of you have definitely noticed that i just do not use the scout anymore it used to be my favorite gun in the game i used to say that it was the only gun that i could use properly and there was a strategy that i would employ when using this weapon i would just sit in the back peppering people up from a distance with a one times hollow on it or something that was my game plan it's what got me my best results but since bumping my sensitivity up to six and changing my response curve from steady to classic i have just been loving the close range fights so much more recently another part of this change is that i've been playing on pc with the controller for the entirety of season 7 near enough and i'm up against mainly mouse and keyboard players and one thing you have to realize as a controller player is that mouse and keyboard players have the advantage from further ranges it's easy to make those precise movements but up close and personal is where a controller player can shine with the added help of the aim assist of course so it's a combination of those two reasons mainly i do love the g7 scope still but it's just not as fun as the volta mastiff i have two games for you here today i'm sure you guys are going to enjoy both of them please subscribe to the channel if you around here and i'll see more in five and a half seconds my friends let's do it anybody else here i don't know i'm trying to i hate when he does this i have a vault of two blue shields i had an alternator of course of all guns you were as good as the last guy you landed everything yeah i know mine just does not do that damage so he just must be really better yeah i literally forgot what the penguin was started shooting uh i don't know what to use helmet here level one nice huge i love this bracelet if you um shoot him with the alternator i'll do like 16 damage again if you want yeah i did drop it but yeah oh okay we can still do with other guns you know we're not limited to alternator but i agree that's the plan that's how i operate nowadays wait what i just saw a bullet fly over from really far they're in it i blocked some fences and purple armor i have white armor i think they're going right side one looked like he was going left so if you hear someone that's that's not all three nice i stuck him while he was dead yeah one rotated nearly cracked on purple on this side oh this is a window is it a disaster should really heal up i'm watching you i'm watching all my time the god is chin in the sky mate [Music] nice that was a mess i got it i got some like kill credit whilst i was throwing at this horizon so i unzoomed i was way longer than it should have been i was just kind of running in circles watching you guys chase her around it was fun is she the last one she's now gone um oh she did it really no uh bloodhound scan then we'd probably know but i don't know i'm not sure yeah we should try and find a car she'll be able to um pop lobes ultimatum oh yeah just pick up the car but you tried that you said you tried that oh no no

it's a very french oh my sense oh my god my scope sense is so slow but if i if i do it one notch up it's just rapidly high yeah i don't like it they need more control with that stuff mm-hmm i'm going back to uh el scrappy toe as they call it nowadays i don't know if you've heard that using the patch notes oh what do they call it uh el scrappy what's her face no you know do i that's three kills and

that was not a 360 there were zero angles involved there i've been dropping 360 the whole game and you're just going to end it like that yeah but just a kill i don't know if i was i don't know if i had more kills honestly i've literally been scamming the whole game i've been scammed so okay okay well i literally stopped shooting the crypto at the end that's why i said a kill count and that damage count
