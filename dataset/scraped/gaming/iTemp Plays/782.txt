kay was a gauzy twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back playing with Jenks in duo's and we've gone for another combination attack here we're gone for the Bloodhound of Bangalore combo the idea is that Bangalore throws denser smoke and then bloodhound either useless scan or their ultimate and I can see people in the smoke it was somewhat difficult to orchestrate I'm not sure if it's because of a lack of communication we need to focus more on trying to utilize this combination attack if you have any legend combinations that you would like us to try out that really complements each other then please leave a comment and we will try our best to get to them yes thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I see you all in
