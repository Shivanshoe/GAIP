hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some ramparts which doesn't happen often her kit doesn't really fit my playstyle however she is definitely worth playing for her passive alone she gets a 15 increase magazine size and a 25 reduced reload speed on lmgs and they've recently buffed both the l star and the speedfire you don't even need to use her shields or her minigun to be forced in the lobby you just need to find any of the lmgs in this game today is also the first time having ragtag on the channel as well he's great guy had a lot of fun playing with him recently and if you want to check out his channel there is a link in the description so i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's what makes it worse though like the need to get home there's classic literally just 14 barrels really i love this place [Music] i can't even find him second floor horizon is nice crawling to safety i'll just run any circles i don't have any big hit or any heels whatsoever please be phoenix please be phoenix series this gun is ridiculous get it out of the game with the rampant it's the driver nice i'm gonna go like big boys construction oh where'd you start far should be back i've just had enough been a while since you shot him you know you just got to just kind of get your dominance once again i don't even turn around anymore i get you all the time oh right in the middle of the wall jump predicted too predictable oh look at it i know you like that acknowledge it i don't see it i actually didn't see it uh-huh i swear time uh-huh uh-huh i know you saw that one too where are you no one knew look at three in a row dude [Laughter] [Laughter] i think when i play with you [Laughter] apparently people apparently people like it though so we'll just break each other in between fights we just yell at each other we kill people we're quiet and then when we're not fighting we're just yelling at each other remove cross play hashtag aim assist names oh my god i need to kill this guy please wanna meet me or rich have to kill this guy everybody thinks he's playing against a lot of playstation players he's not maybe one or two per lobby against on the side we need to be careful i'm dead can you take us like up top oh yeah you want to go push pop into phoenix yeah i'm gonna get under this team you see that put some shots down knowing you're going to be there soon big plays right here oh i'm coming back me can i get you here this one's free remember that let me yeah you got them you got them okay cool they're just healing back here max horizon i got one behind him right here oh my word good job i can actually fight for three years with an all-star it's unreal three whole years it's unbelievable my bad just a little i got a little excited wow i'm using so far doing it but now i'm just getting bothered by everyone what it wasn't you no i heard it hit me ricocheted it's funny because you completely clueless while you're wall jumping and he's getting you right in there um do we rotate through the tunnel i think i hear shots down there oh i'm going down the street i nearly won't click two people which one anyone have any energy energy energy um i got a little bit i'm running double energy too oh this guy had a lot here um let me know if you need more i have 300 extra oh okay i'm i'm rocking elsa i've always got speed fire so i should be okay thank you okay yeah that's fine i mean if you need more i'll drop you some right now i appreciate it reckon anyone has ever taken a treasure pack from the lower awesome on purpose there's no way right there's no way a hundred percent yeah there definitely is something i could definitely see someone doing that 100 i'm not just in the comics i'm just saying there's you could just open a bin you know oh my god hold the whole team and they're really scattered i overheated my all-star i don't know how this happened to me i played how are they looking this way when there's a humongous scrap going on a capsule they were trying to get out of here they didn't want to fire they're trying to get out of there um i think they're below now i think so right yeah yeah they're leading a box below all lifelines are actually one oh god you've been a mastiff give me with a mastiff the rings nice i think it's time for the universal uh signal oh yeah there are yeah they're over here we can't lose the spot i've set up a shield at a back up if we need it 45 nades apparently yeah [Music] oh no wait so it's a 14 that's just like three two one me oh my god are you kidding this okay we're fine with final five why would they do that and they missed the arkansas when i was on ramp but i think i i think so i don't know ah that was scary that almost happened what we were talking about about them just really dudes it really did it was close apologies i wasn't sure if i was being annoying there oh yes gonna be behind us no i thought i took that from you but you haven't known so it's definitely worth that team that's probably a decent way look at their teammate [Music] good night he just fell down how do you have one gun all right the dreams are over about the vault transitioning yeah oh wait i don't know there's a vote here oh there's always in here i've dropped an r9 and stopped the skin on it if you fancy it this guy's doing some crazy rabbit hops hey i've been bamboozled just here well i have no idea what these guys are up to i really couldn't tell you hopefully they jump hopefully they jump they did i'll play it thank you thomas enough they jumped they just don't need i think we're okay for now okay they jumped really cracks on blue just right here oh beautiful man i played in the squad for a think i landed no shots but that team is kind of far away one shot on this lifeline nice certainly it's nice he's one shot think someone was like i don't know if i saw something i heard something i seem to remember i got scared that [ __ ] up on hammond maybe it's just ingrained in me to be scared of that though i don't know i think that's the reasonable assumption yeah it's my my immediate response let's just be careful be careful of scrap phones in gotcha oh big scan i've no idea where that came from okay now i do oh my strike pack there we go in here single shot but they are intimidated i don't actually have a strike pack by the way i'm sure you don't on the left-hand side just here near the box yeah i can feel it i'm going uh for a cheeky 316 appreciate it great already inside the ring these guys are plenty weird i'm down to rush them i'm actually sure they're very very close oh crap moving all that clothes and they've done the same thing on the other side oh wow what's going to happen to the middle of this turbine it's just going to get pulled apart i'm burning though you down here did ha yeah i'm not with you like it sent me the wrong way i'm here once down i don't know did you get either one of you [Laughter] let's see maybe he's uh his brain was fried from the two the two black holes present oh my word she lands those i'm looking out i've covered no i can't i'm still track path 150 nice going in yes oh man this could be it could we put our differences aside to join forces to pull the victory out this hasn't landed yet if this is a cray bat oh i see him just on top of that all right it's a creeper yeah he went for 20 is he's going to land or where is this thing there we go all right if it's a crater we need it to be a cray bet and you definitely need to use your medicine keyboard it's they have to they have to push us getting eyes on them whenever when they're this far away it's kind of scary i think i see a pull what's that yeah they're over there they're rotating left going in they're going above um i think they're kind of far away so it's not a problem they're here they're here it's all you know what shoot this big nate 64 649 has just no scope created me he's just literally turned the corner and no scuba he was at the top and i had to i should have maybe even just grappled
