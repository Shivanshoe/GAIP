hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in season eight i was really hoping that they would update pathfinder a little bit i don't play him too often as of late he just has such a big center mass hitbox and his cooldowns can be so brutal octane has definitely overtaken pathfinder as my favorite mobility focus legend in apex which is such a shame now patronage can still be good of course but i wish they'd just remove his low profile debuff i feel like i get exploded whenever i play him and today i'm playing with so far and vickstar and at the start of this game i had fixed star's mic turned up a little bit too late but i do fix it a few minutes in so just bear that in mind so i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um what do you guys think what do you think to the new uh semi-auto the lever action rifle well your mouse and keyboard so it's one of the best guns in the game it'll be really keyboard it's so good i used it a bit but i guess i probably didn't like give it enough time it's it's tricky it's tricky but once you get the hang of it the dps is just massive a team on me i've got myself in a fist fight [Laughter] there was somebody here i don't know where he went i have a scout and a dream if anyone finds a shield let me know uh there's one all the way over here which is pretty one of the biggest scraps i've ever seen going on down this way yeah i was going to say we thought it'd be quiet here mate it's absolutely yeah yeah yeah there's going all the way up top there's two of them up top on me i'm struggling to climb right now i'm safe don't worry about me or you guys i'll be there in a sec i'm sorry that that is entirely my fault but i will avenge you absolutely yeah yeah i think it's caustic oh boy oh he's cranking it on me i was mid chicken nugget not my fault at all why would they kill you i know that's just disrespect man yeah they should have known that i'm eating a chicken nugget like relaxed unbelievable um you know there was a there was a another fight going on west so we might get rid of we want to go through a quick rest over uh i've already i've already started the res they're sorry for me we try which way we're a pink we're a ping to watch i must say i've been playing with uh two of my other friends who were they're we're all apex casuals and i've been we've been losing for the last three days so it's nice to be back with the boys you know the squad back at it again we've been having a lot of fun you know it's like literally you like land die and you're like oh you know that was unlucky run it back run it back like you know there's 3 000 excuses every second he's sir this map is like that honestly it's just carnage and if you die yeah half the time it's like a lot of third parties here yeah yeah but when he goes right it goes really right yeah i cracked one they're pushing me there one saying let's go behind that yeah yeah do everyone left open they're just going oh i got some mirage my brain i think you baited this one's really good mate these guys have purple shields okay yeah they uh they lived for us which is very nice of them i down one over this way i don't know where he crawled off to all right the one thing that i always do when i come back to this game is i i'm always out of the habit of running without my gun out and you run so much faster oh yeah 50 making such a big difference yeah i don't know i've just guessed but if you say it with your chest exactly i don't think anyone would have questioned it on this very though making contact i have a lot of mates where do i throw them uh i've done a race on this roof with a very accurate one g7 shot i am needing oil they're all just blowing up in the air there's one inside here uh she has a purple oh you guys don't need it here man where did she go oh she's dead yeah right here we gotta go get these guys we need to i'm gonna absolutely i think we can go around we can go around the right let's just let's just circumvent yeah they have to move oh okay goodbye these guys so much oh you know i really want to run straight at him i can't lie there is a rope i mean i have two shield cells and know that and like one minute yeah you know what you know they're being rude even if we lose it's worth it let's go yeah yeah right below somebody uh right here i thought i mean unless while they're distracted with him and i sneak up on them i'm done this guy's getting absolutely bullied i'm gonna i'm gonna like i'm gonna open the top where they're at yeah yeah okay i don't think they know what i'm gonna get on the back i'll get oh yeah the other team's top of this hill i don't know how we're gonna one more to the left one still there one like dudes are here oh my god there's literally a gold bag in here i should have just used that uh i'm gonna go around left side so we can we can actually get up high ground i'm gonna regroup with you guys once on this roof close i have no shields left so something on the roof she's got gold i'm trying to tag broken broken surprises one's one that the others are jumping oh my god over here do you fancy uh sniping again vic you know what what what have you got a little crater action there myself what um yeah down craig rose goes to the mercy people player that's just the rule all right respect that was a messy jesus yeah that was a mess that was a horrible hill to fight over he's awful terrifying it was difficult enough with just the original team yeah these guys separate this crabby crab crusty the crab i hear that oh yeah right right i think they're right at the bottom of the hill oh it's perfect we're right behind them yeah down right i think there's an argument over here all right guys there's three down there let's see i'm getting the crater out one of them is getting it in the node here nice am i going then if you if you hit one of them with a crater i'm coming in i finished your kill i'm stuck i can't help you guys at all i'll be there i can't see nothing where'd they go oh just under this hill the lift of this hill right on me uh i'm gonna apologize because i have zero assists so i'm running a flatline iron sight that's not it all right oh here we go brian's the next fight i don't know unfortunately but i think they're getting that pack yeah they're up there on the top i'm going to bounce back oh good i am literally throwing everything in my inventory if they would peek i would do something but they're not real oh they're at the back yeah back right come on oh i might get hit here i'm trying to go for like uh basically crack one at the back there on my thing yeah this way i've got one crab about it i don't want to make it peeking right here nah debated me i'm going in and you're not allowed up here but i'm cheating i'm literally trying right now i don't know when i done one i'm going in with a mastiff i'm going around i'm going in he's cracked i fell down i've got an arc star up there practically nice i need a good yeah whole team in there they're dropping back down oh they are absolutely terrified they really are charging me um they've got quarter healthy all right where does this lead to down there uh towards that way hydro they just saw they just ported and they just boarded yeah they have traps down there too so it sounds like the worst idea over parking rat pack here i'm gonna take this mobile respawn that's the biggest scam of a care package at this stage in the game i think i've ever seen why are you only getting some something red you need red yeah perfect for a little while now was it i think so i'll take it back yeah you should just slandered it feel bad now there's got to be multiple teams here on there right there's ports on there they're going for this care package okay they have a caustic yeah they i guess so because they went down the stairs and there was a trap on the stairs so yeah oh right back here i don't have any needs no can we just no you can't even destroy it can you is there another staircase we go around this side uh there's one on so far i mean i can't see what's going on here i'm correct i'm really hitting them a lot in there okay i don't have a dj so if we don't get third part in the back here yeah yeah once once one shot one shot one shot mini crack rice [Applause] yes nice that's what i'm talking about all right now we start uh last two teams are fine this way i have my ultimate so i can like um yeah yeah one team's gonna do this i'm gonna try and go to this left one oh my god i can be right behind you and we can um okay [Applause] there's somebody literally beneath me inside this uh wall bit i think oh my god are we gonna die oh my god maybe oh my god i hear him i hear them no please they're gonna die oh yeah somewhere yeah he's down here nice there we go that's how the boys do what a victory all right
