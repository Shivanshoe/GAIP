hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today a new gameplay trailer for season six charged was released and we are going to be going over all of the details here in the introduction about the new legend the new weapon uh the new locations to fight and also the new crafting system as well and after this i will have a full gameplay for you as usual so first things first the trailer starts with rampant on her minigun sheila it was pretty obvious that this was going to be one of her abilities it does look like it will be her ultimate and the fire rate looks insane you'd expect the damage to be outrageous but it definitely will leave you susceptible to incoming fire especially from snipers that looks like the way that we're gonna have to try and counter ramp us here so next up we get some map changes a little sneak peek of some new areas on the map this one is near sorting factory a little bit south of it and it looks like hammond robotics are expanding their harvester program by the looks of it we only get a quick sneak peek at some of it but it definitely will be new over that way and this one is just a little bit north of train yards which you can see in the background it's west of capital city or what's left of it at the moment it looks like they could be setting up a new harvester there as well i remember seeing some rumors or some map leaks and people were joking they were literally just copying and pasting the planet harvester and placing it all over the map they are definitely expanding their program there speaking of harvester this area actually looks quite barren now this is south of capital it looks like they could have just moved the harvester to one of the previous locations we saw and this one here is south of the of one of the vault locations near mirage voyage again it looks quite robotic it looks quite planetary if that's a word it's definitely not but i love these kinds of fights in these areas there's plenty of cover there are fewer open areas to get caught out in it's a lot of close quarters action which will also suit the new weapon that we get to see a sneak peek of here in a second but in this location we also have those big cranes here just like the ones that you would see at sorting factory which means the pathfinder will be pretty clutch to get you up there with his ultimate unless of course they nerf his ultimate in this update to 35 minutes which is always possible um apparently they hate pathfinder which is very very sad so this is the same location so it's not the current harvest that we have at the moment but a new location close to it it moves whilst people are fighting on it perhaps this is triggered by a button that's nearby or another series of events that we just don't know yet but it looks like the map evolves mid-game it's a very interesting concept it changes up uh the look of the battlefield and thus also the nature of the gunfight in that area we can only get this tiny sneak peak though it's like for a second now you can see from this angle that the current planet harvester is very much still there by the way it looks different though i think or is that just me it looks more more open or maybe i'm just remembering rank here i i don't know okay this is a really interesting part of the trailer crafting we finally get to see some details of how the crafting system works so it looks like you go and get yourself some crafting currency or materials i suppose and you can go up to one of these crafting stations these look presets it doesn't show the legends calling them in um but you can exchange your materials for different items or ammo or hop-ups and even guns and these are on different rotations as well so you can see the evo shield here is uh it's actually a permanent rotation so it doesn't actually rotate at all uh as is the med kit but the purple knockdown and the portable respawn beacon are on a weekly rotation so next week or the week after launch you would be able to expect them to be rotated for different uh consumer balls also i'm not going to gloss over this but the devotion is back and it looks like somewhat flawless to me because they've also brought back the turbocharger and the extended energy max this was to be expected though as the vault will most likely be an energy gun and bringing back the devo as the care package increases their energy gun loot pawn enough to warrant the return of their energy mags as well so devotion takes up a gun slot on the crafting board which is also a daily rotation so return every 24 hours to be able to craft other guns i would assume so if the devotion is added to the care package what takes its place well there have been a load of rumors saying that the r99 will be going into the care packages after nearly 18 months of it being a meta floor gun and one of the best guns in the game even after some nerfs it's heading into the care package which makes sense as the vault will be added to the smg loophole to take his place now thinking about it the replicator as it's called or like the crafting station could just be the same as a care package because that's how it distributes the loot once you've crafted it it zooms out here to show that a blue shock wave is emitted once that it's used so it might be a smart idea to craft and flee the scene my friends do not stick around and get ambushed like these people so next up we have some apex legends gameplay of the vault the new smg coming into the game we have seen it in titanfall 2 but here we can see crypto using it in apex legends season 6 and on the side of the gun we do get confirmation of it being an energy weapon because of the ammo energy text on there which is a dead giveaway now the iron sights look very similar to titanfall 2 and the overall look of the gun and its behavior looks very similar it doesn't look like there have been many changes whatsoever i'm very excited to try out a new close range gun on apex legends it also looks like a new location that they're fighting here by the way it looks like a cavern but with a jump tower so that's interesting and the last thing that we get to see early here is the new legend in action rampus of course the rumors are true her abilities do include the use of that deployable cover you can see here that she places two dame so i would assume that they are on a charge of bases just like corsic traps uh watson fences and also revenant sciences as well where they have a cooldown but you can hold two charges of that ability now you can actually place her minigun sheila down behind these walls and fire them through the wall my goodness i hope these walls do not last too long because getting minigund through one of these does not sound like a fun gunfight to me we get to see one of her finishes here as well by the way which also looks great because she just walks away and lets sheila do all of the work and that brings us to the end of the trailer it was a load of information bundled up into a short trailer season six is coming out on tuesday i'm extremely excited if you saw anything that i missed in the trailer be sure to leave a comment and i will see you with a full gameplay here in five and a half seconds my friends switching is so difficult yeah so i'm switching between two different types of controllers two different platforms like it's i'm just completely different like aim assist yeah yeah frame rates everything like that is completely different that's yeah that's crazy to me how you go between the frames it's not good let me tell you i would i would throw up that's probably why i was playing so bad the other day yeah i mean i'm probably gonna be there soon because i'm gonna start playing a lot more like uh other games war zone and stuff so this guy is completely cracked he's going up top it looks like all the way up there oh god my shot is terrible join the club i cannot see it i feel blind let's finish my kill enemy taken out i killed him he's got some healer balls on him where's this guy looting oh there's a dude right here level three what a little rat he's just chilling in the corner so a different team livestream right i just said um this guy was down though so he has a teammate okay i think market well that's your kill my bad nah i honestly i just thirsted him i didn't even got any of the cars is the climbing funny it's nearly cracked he's got a wingman there mike's in the way i broke the pathfinder nice oh i doubt it oh and i'm getting shot in the back too yeah i loved it nice yeah that guy you made the right reload i don't know oh thank you all good how did he not push i have no clue i have no clue yeah yeah me too i'm good why did they not push i thought that was a suicide revive but i thought i might as well try it it actually was that's insane they're still being pushed they silence just both you just are they just maybe that's why i think that's why oh he's solo i have a have a grapple oh no wait oh my god he would like he wouldn't fly up he kept getting stuck on the rock oh my god i am so furious right now oh you've been dead absolutely i've played my friend how does it feel it feels terrible i'm about to uninstall this game i was looking for him and then all of a sudden i turn and a lifeline is punching me in the face oh team's pushing for where are we just oh my god oh you're so good reloading that's your friend this way right here yeah right on this she's broken idiot opposite me get out of here nice where did this guy die where did the path die get some purple there we go oh right there yeah it's so the hip fire is still the same it feels like so good um they're kind of splatter there's an octane and then there's a dude over here on me target spotted okay the enemies are shooting at me oh he's got beams on him are be far behind nice giving my shields oh my god that went right over my head he's broken he's weak i am repairing myself i'm popping the med kit i'll be right there he's run off somewhere oh yeah he's gone and my audio so low that i just can't hear anything though controller usually linear if you have stick drift it'll be a little bit worse oh i found steady oh you plant steady oh i'm a steady gamer i never seen that before really no i i've seen a couple times i usually don't see too many people playing on it that's cool though i'm a pioneer i'm starting a steady team you know eventually we'll all be playing steady traveling i'm gonna come up and never work oh my god he's one hp i just wanted to ride there i was knocked in oh you got oh that's it that was so nice that was so nice holy mirage race one's down one's life down low like the octane jump somewhere nice uh yeah right next to me right next to me right here oh there we go i thought i saw something it was just blending in yeah i'm i'm not very i'm not really good at sniping in this game but i was i was good at sniping in um like blackout yeah same black guy was a blast so fun the sensitives is really weird on this game yeah it's not meant i feel like it's not really meant for sniping it's more meant for like a mouse and keyboard fully agree where are they nice try buddy sorry about you ain't that all good i was just here fine with the g7 yes sometimes that doesn't go so well what am i doing carrying that oh my yeah that can't be kind of nice on the g7 love me some auto sprint i like walking places i i i hate not sprinting it's so it's so i i i even on blackout too i hated it
