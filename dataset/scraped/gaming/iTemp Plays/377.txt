hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing the legend who noah wants to play but when they do they win it is of course big gibby you don't see too many goobies around in fact i would argue that he is the best legend who you don't see too often because his kit it just isn't as fun compared to an octane or a pathfinder or even a wraith but it's still incredibly strong and that is actually kind of a problem for apex because they can't they can't buff him to make more people play him because he's already in a good position maybe they could try to i mean no there's no reason to he's in a good place you just need to play more often if you want to win that's just those the rules so thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what's up are we playing some ranked this flip not necessarily today but oh we can do i'm what was the purple there foreign oh i've got a gold hemlock yeah this middle part is great there's always at least one hole here always and i've got a gold gun too is that called hemlock gold hemlock nice move is pretty weak when arranged users weak on the top oh no i'm trying to loot guy come on look on me that's armor switch next ring isn't close i'm shocked oh crap i gotta switch off this again do you miss coming on the side here [Music] it's got like a pretty high skill ceiling and i played a few games i was thinking i haven't got time to grind like eight hours a day i will never get to how good i want to be oh i thought i heard something it might be between two teams here right nearly cracked unless she phases what she's literal one dude i don't think the red can get to us i'll try and first leaf you can arm switch if you want he had a mastiff 13. giving my shields a recharge look at me with the with the abilities and the ultimate stuff i think we should win the long range fight dude the question is do you even want to have it uh i don't mind i have a i have a decent ass well i have one about seven cells but if someone gets 30 it's probably gonna be us i would love one of those to hit me oh my god you did not mean to do that dj alright and cracked i wasn't really weak on this side oh my god i cannot believe she survived trying to keep the horizon off here blade that's how you get that job right there so are they still across the road you started rezzie's friend oh is it yeah i just caught him at the beacon he didn't quite didn't quite get him but he was flash so let's go find a shop after their batteries run out too i think he's probably gone to the other beacon uh yeah probably oh nice hello probably yeah he's self-reviving you dude replicator falling from the skies the creeper nice you've had every every sniper which ever see if there's a brother or something here no i can't do yeah i have him look online but i'm not opposed to a prowler i hear an oxen on me now he's above me you might drop for me uh the octane is beyond one shot if you can delay i can sell phrase that they heard me oh man oh you had to try oh yeah mate i i guess they were sat on top like what they were doing it seems when uh yeah definitely i'm gonna land at this point next to it watch it i think someone's with you love when we play together because i'm not on 112 pink new york i i actually worried that when i joined you that you'd actually selected that server um so i was playing solo the day and uh i'd realized me playing new york the entire time for no reason obviously they're a little bit softer sometimes when you're so i like new york uh yeah it's probably just cause it's early in the day too true that must be that is it dude you play like 2 p.m they're just waking up yeah they're trying to sleep just gonna do this little shield swap so there is an empty purple if you uh use some of your little cells are rooney on that and i'll drop you another couple thank you i've found myself like trying to grind for that damn ultra camera on cold war i don't know if you know what that is um i don't however i'm intrigued it's basically where you get gold come on every gun okay okay okay nice [ __ ] damascus dark matter does it do any of these people have guns i've got one of them too foul correct the horizon oh nice so you that's all the competition for have you done don't don't

care pack now little friend oh i see him i'll show them to you oh he won't work yeah they they i guess they have enough time to get around but i would love to see you like do a mid-air throw of your
