hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are in some ranked and ranked is a mode where if you get bad teammates you will get caught out of position your rotations will be hindered and slow but if you get good teammates who understand the flow of the maps and how the circles work you can really take advantage of that and just farm enemies and then the second game that i've got for you today i had two great teammates and farming is exactly what we did i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh my god give me a gun i said give me a gun one down i need shields revived right now or lifeline with the thank goodness the lifeline had a bow by the way let's move here contact hey give me a sec i need a thermal grenade right yes i hate this angle shield reloading here thank you thank you very much i might reload the alternator because i put it to work i am repairing myself oh my word well all that started because that has nothing in there i need a heavy ammo i'm gonna like i'm gonna use this for a little bit i'm gonna be honest with you i'm switching to this makes a lot of sense i can grab some ammunition here too probably worth hospital over there had a show back dropped from the teammate there was a grenade here it was so useful i needed that heavy emblem to go to the fight these guys will have loot for us gotta be careful taking i think you needed those thermites thinking about it right down here oh my god oh they are screwed reload can't reload i have to like turn around okay no i should have arm switch on the first one oh that's ridiculous that was fun though i will admit that was fun oh i got the squad i got the the squadron here we've got poof and conker heard that might be slightly good this way how do you know i'll go ahead supply been there maybe something good this way got your wins never let me down see this look at this a shoe looks outrageous i've used the ultimate alternating terminal choice i'm going to stick with the r9 today give it another shot i like the hemlock i don't like having this many throwables with no bag give me a sign for the hemlock that's not aside from them luck target spotted out what's gonna eat that i can use let's go this way broken i may be slightly over committed to that one gunfight i need help reloading humongous gunfight there from the squadron gg is all around uh i can put that on there too i am repairing myself i over committed to that wraith and then i missed every shot when she was quiet it was extremely terrible it was real fast is it just one hello i thought she was turning to firing me i got scared i thought she was gonna beat me we just eliminated the whole squad exciting good job okay there we go reloading 3kp early on i've got a good squad here we've got a whip i don't know if we're going to decide to use it or not listen let's move here you want to go back i'm down what's over there okay always enemies hold on enemies oh a champion enemy we both suck i'm so bad one second we got this we should get phoenix kid here don't shield out give me my shield using grapples oh my god that gun fight with them with the maggie i should have been on burst mode 100 every time i fired i felt like she strafed the opposite way it was not good i definitely deserved to die in that gun fight it was so bad you're 78 what what for i'm using a wingman heavy ammo here gotta hop up here barrel stabilizer here level three oh my god enemies i got you friend nice that's all three one of them must be self self-raising good job reloading giving my shields a recharge yeah i don't know where the cell phone is making contact reloading recharging glad she started landing some shots shield battery here which was definitely needed enemy over there i think i saw someone i did reloading frag out side of feeling he's going to grapple into it go on go on nate ah imagine target they spotted me i'm taking right here i'm getting shot i'm trying to get an angle for my team here nice we should go here not moving up are they going this way this is a good idea it's a better spot to fight for 100 oh my god they already though contact with hostile nice i cracked one as well [Music] they can't dance with themselves well they can but pretty boring who will challenge this the enemies are shooting at me reloading that's the dream that's the dream come on vault come on vault let's move here ah i feel like i shouldn't even be taking it that's a waste i just couldn't be able to go over here what a waste of time i should have altered giving my shields a recharge great the ring is close less than a minute i kind of slapped him a little bit zip line here i need to recharge my shield i've always worn i think there are just two solos left i think there's a mad maggie from that team that we killed and then whoever was left on this team we got the path and the red i don't know who else there was there you go they take off the banners this is a solo noise this last team chances are they go this way to get their old stuff back no am i wrong patching myself enemy shields yes indeed yes indeed you are the apex champions that's a lot of fun we still just w kid everyone or because i'm a console player or you know controller player i held the left stick upwards in an upwards trajectory you know that's the equivalent i think
