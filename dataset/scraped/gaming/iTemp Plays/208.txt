hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing horizon and i don't know if you guys remember this but i had a game maybe four seasons ago on horizon where i got 3983 damage just shy of that elusive 4000 damage match and now that i'm playing more and more legends i'm trying to get the 4k badge on as many of them as i can it does take me a little while but i'm definitely capable of that if i wanted to rush getting the 4k badge i'd just use it three times on a charge rifle and be really annoying to the rest of the lobby but i want more action than that today we are going into the final two teams with 3700 damage and all i had to do was close it out i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i see some purple it's not armor though god i'm sorry team oh we are literally all over the place here keep running amigo well i got some good stuff tina got purple from that one which is great i was gonna risk jumping in the love there and see if i could like jump up with my horizon q but it wasn't worth what's the point do i not automatically have the bullets reloading into it i don't understand all right this is my first game of the day so listen a little bit a little bit shaky i'm not doing too bad watch out for the new kill leader that one of us no it's flipper or flipper hey we got bad guys over there i stuck with this gun like i'm actually so bad with the car it's crazy i'm low on heavy but it's two so i might just take this serving man again more use our 30 bullets in a wingman oh my god i am my god my controller my controller has been planned planned executed perfectly got me into a full sense of security they started whacking me one i knew what i was doing okay i know what i was doing please let me on uh yeah i'm kind of lacking too unfortunately although this place that is looted this place isn't stupid controller it's not the controller it's my uh connecting cable there's a level three extendo mag in the crafter and there's a crafter over here but is it worth it because there's one at fragment west oh it's a tough one i might just go fragment west by the time i go over there and craft ah hey i'll take too long i feel like i'll miss out on too much you know so what's the problem you don't land a fragment too people here oh yeah maybe should have taken that two times we're doing pretty good there actually it's the same team and they just split or what do we want to just sit up top that's 89 over that same 500. i swear i heard them i definitely heard someone over this way whether they carried on run or not i don't know but we should just get a fragment this is a waste of everyone's time here they don't want to fight you know it's fine whatever we just lost that one three minutes there we go energy mag obtained people to scrap tremendous yes just in time seriously i am hello amigo no she's so fast she's way too quick us i thought i'll kill that i thought i'd kill them i thought she was dead sound like they had a lot of heavy i mean uh energy which i kind of deal with i don't need this many heavy bullets i heard him pick up like three stacks i heard octane pick up like three or four stacks of energy i swear he's got like 250 energy bullets and i've got 30. i'm in desperate need fleas i know you got loads i know it oh here we go that's huge energy ammo here thanks very much that's perfect there we go nice all right we're in a great spot my wingman shot isn't great right now and i definitely should have killed that wraith but uh i thought killed already honestly we're doing okay nearly 2000 damage still a good amount of people left i had to play horizon because teammates are two uh mobility characters and i didn't know who else to play i mean maybe valkyrie who lost his mobility ash with her ultimate perhaps i don't know but horizon is so good on what's edge especially in capital city that's so good flying all over the place i might try and craft some energy to give back to my teammates thankfully stop and now that we moving me up did i get the kill through the guy how do i have 2200 damage i feel like i'm playing like the worst i've ever played in my 83 years of gaming i thought this might be rock bottom and somehow i'm still landing shots i don't know hold on i know what the problem is i'm not leaning forward i don't know if you guys are like this this is the ultimate game of position okay let me move my monitor a little bit you lean forward elbows on knees okay ruins your lower back you don't need that no one's ever needed a lower back what you need is a good kill death ratio that's a life lesson for all the young guns out there keep that in mind okay no i'm not gonna use my gravity need to get on me yes i am can't climb uh are we rushing uh the replicator is that what we're doing or is did we just want to go this way anyway i can't tell which one it's true this way i agree i mean there's 11 people left here there's only one person missing from the lobby in terms of everyone's a duo apart from one team i mean everyone's a tree apart from one team that's what i mean yeah i think i thought they have to be this way it doesn't have ultimate just yet i do need that that's not good my mistake i forgot that this guy is an absolute tank and your wingman shots do 12 damage to him whack him punch giving my it a recharge wow looks like that was the last one in the squad hi only two more squads they'll feel my do i need more bats probably not i feel like i'm in a good place all right good job team all right catback is dropping i could have done with that gold heavy mag but i've got i know it's in here stop shooting me stop it i'm warning you let's drop teammates let's keep them at bay as long as we just need to make sure they don't take this rope they take the rope we're kind of screwed but these are the last two teams i cannot believe i might get a 4k this game like what's going on do these guys want their teammates banner is the question oh these guys have to move them i've already started moving i don't know don't tell me they're born out from the top thank goodness these guys must have already started moving oh yeah they ported just trying to farm just i just want my 4k see this takes us we're still safe this is glorious these two teams are going to bump into each other over here cracked one of them not like moving up for anything just yet wait for it now we go i wanted to make sure they were actually right next to each other i think they're two teams of two i don't think i got it i think i was like 40 damage off no i'm pretty sure i was like 40 damage off i mean to be fair though i i genuinely didn't deserve it i didn't deserve it you are the apex honest i think i might have got 3926 i don't know you're so strong good job i mean that is so sad i'm sad ah it's okay i mean that is probably three times more damage than i deserve so i'll take it that's a that's a great game you've got to play horizon your teammates have already locked in octane and pathfinder you just have to
