hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not so today we are using the havoc which i haven't done too much since it had some of those nerves to its magazine size but more importantly the horizontal recoil for the first part of the clip the old havoc used to have a lot of recoil but 95 percent of it was vertical which meant that a little pull down on the right thumbstick and you had a laser beam on your hands since the nerfs it hasn't been that good at medium distance it's really hard to track opponents but i remember janks giving me this advice he said my attempt he said just hit fire the first five to ten bullets and i'll tell you what the man is a genius because this gun is still a melt machine close range he's got to think of it like an smg with more of a punch it's like a heavy smg but yes hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh wait that's the only door oh god i messed up once again with two doors speechline eva no armor i keep finding that thank you he left oh wait no i think you killed his friend uh possibly it was a mirage and i wanted to have it obviously it was invisible this trick's flashed up here nice yeah i gotta ebay with a purple bolt oh no probably drop it soon though not bad early game not too shabby all right we got guns something like that we have weaponry that's fresh one all right i'll grab that shortcut turn the plate to this little area it was happening on my way oh some big scraps going on these guys are tucked this way i don't know my grapple i would have had it back one night there's one uh bottom floor i find you thank you she has blue i'll take this one is phone yeah i was behind you i'm sorry nine hours nice no you're good just about armor swap again i have no i had no helmet no wonder i'm getting destroyed i was like why am i getting this jesus select for a havoc okay gonna get weird that's a load out it's gonna get real weird oh this is a way better way of playing just like a calm just literally you need the first mini to be calm that's it way more consistent yeah sets the pace for like the whole game all right right here rez oh yeah i can't even hear that on us audio solo yeah my eardrums are almost bleeding probably not healthy but that's your size reloading down with her mighty don't turn my teeth nice different team oh no she had a background nice extended lightning ice thank you okay not bad some kind of a start yeah random uh maybe i i think it was either side the mountain though but okay my audio might be too low if yours is tired trust you yeah i i did just hear shots um like northeast i'm not sure though my springboard's messing up why does that look so funny it does it looks weird now when people want what was my favorite place to grapple oh you hear them over there no actually that was your footsteps i thought i heard someone lose your footsteps oh no that's on the other side of i just heard some shots on the other side of bunker now oh my god let me solve pathfinder i don't wanna grapple everywhere i'd have my grapple right now and i've still got 15 wait no they increased by 20 didn't they i've had it ages ago oh my word yeah it was it was 20 seconds i think it was like 15 35 yeah i thought he was overpowered he was that's stream feat i i mean 35 is way too big of a job 25 to be fair yeah i mean people would have still complained but 25 wouldn't be uh that bad he wouldn't i'm gonna go for this guy yeah go say hello dive right on his head again so i managed to sneak that one from here oh no literally shoot everybody shoot everyone around where our games have been going we need to understand chances that's so true it's like a rain game dude i'll pick this one up i can take us all out of town okay i've taken the jump pad they're gonna fire us if we do that i have no real long range yeah they're just literally they're just camping that um i mean we can just push [Applause] oh god i'm okay you're good okay oh yeah i'm not with you oh i'm a point i'm a point all right oh she's up there i need your army switch wait what just happened oh i'm dead i'm not dead i'm trying to get to you i'm with you for the team they're in just a sec phoenix in four seconds nice one yeah i'm sure that i'm showing you wait it's actually kind of gross don't mind yeah it's not ticking that hard i'm a pop of phoenix actually nice first ring sorry i saw five squads left with a question mark and thought it must be at least two yeah you think you'd think it'd be like literally like third fourth rain but i've been bamboozled once more the top ten um what's that like one more squad yeah like at the very most there are seven people left so five others because it was like a question mark and then two people just died i mean i feel like they need a bigger map what do they what do they need i'm an idiot there's only four squad steps that maximize like six of this i don't know rich you went to school for math no but since then i feel like i've sustained a brain injury i'm not even kidding honestly like my my memory's terrible um my mental matters just deteriorated okay three of the squads left two people max per squad two of us that's eight people max however he said question mark and two people died that's seven max he lost me at like two which i think was like one of the first numbers you said i'm streaming i'm struggling myself yeah i did not go to school for math sorry i can't help you there i scraped bite i scraped by only two how was that going to school for math by the way easier than i thought but i got through it because i had like good friends there if i didn't know anyone there or if i didn't manage to like you know socialize there i don't think i'd have done it but manageable manageable where else are these people i think i heard some shots maybe like a southeast no i'm not done might be hearing stuff i do have a devotion though so there's that the old diva that's something hey i just want to have your head i think i'm a leapfrog i've got oh i hear them oh look someone wandered into our safe space gonna go up the hole in the roof yeah yeah yeah yeah you are oh i'm back don't hit my wingman any cracks i have it's on unreloaded i am i'm oh my god i just don't even know how to describe what i'm just doing like i'm so stupid how do you turn up to a fight after not firing anyone for half an hour with an unloaded havoc [Laughter] and then i fell all the way down like it was the intimidation they had they didn't know where you were going so he panics oh cause i was running away from the storm that's fine good news these diving boards no longer safe yeah i feel like they were up there at some point yeah i think you might be right incoming page is still safe let's have a little look i'm hoping on my video the bongo drums have kicked in that means we find them soon you know what i mean if the bongo drums are not playing at the moment then we're in for yeah anyways yeah yeah it's to have a ways right and there's one squad left i never know what people can be out so much when there's one squad left like you're gonna have to i know but anyway there should be some unspoken agreement where if you're the last two squads and the circles this big you shoot in the air yeah until you guys know where you're at and then you fight i agree not top cage and go check what's in that care package yeah i got a feeling they might be on that side that building in scratch yeah it just got opened way out there like little cucarachas coming yeah where'd they go i'm getting actually destroyed yeah i'm picking up two devos they messed up why would you leave that for me why would they believe that oh there's one right on me the itty cracks not bad thanks i didn't even hear that race sneak up on me hey see ya pretty nice that would be some players yeah they were annoyings good shots i believe i'll have more kills than you but way less damage because i definitely stopped i think i had three different kills that game where i had like nine damage done to them and i nearly took the one that was all about the win at this point at this point that's all i care about don't even care to be fair you are not wrong
