hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now months and months and months ago i can't remember when this skin came out i did buy the most expensive skin in apex legends or at least the most expensive legend skin there's only one of these it's the only mythic legend skin it is of course the evolving bloodhound apex hunter it's called it has three tiers and to fully unlock all three you need to deal 100 000 damage i had a problem on release where the progress got reset the damage wasn't counting properly it was a bit of a mess to be honest with you and since then i really haven't played bluetongue at all and it's a shame looking back because this concept should have been so much better i would have loved it if the skin evolved in game and those specific animations that you've got when you've reached certain thresholds it could have been so cool but this skin is actually pretty underwhelming all right there are probably better legendary skins for blood end but now that i've bought it i may as well try and finish the 100 000 damage i'm not even halfway i have 42 000 it's a shambles i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends a fight night arena once again because it's the only ship that exists however this place is actually pretty fun to land at when you land here because no one really knows there's a lot of loot spawns here not just loose balls a load of gun spawns they're all always about 35 guns on the floor here look at this spitfire r9 we had a an either eight as well but that's one of the worst guns in the game hey crypto you landed in king's canyon mate where are you die crypto we're on the way hey nice you can look after himself life here oh you can revive i guess that makes more sense absolutely none of us nice guys what played we had to just fight across the map to try and get back to the crypto oh another spitfire it's a sign you have to use this game my season one my favorite gun from season one actually was it was either the spitfire or the diva come on guys let's let's go let's roll these guys are fighting having a big scrap we turned up with a gold spitfire high ground good armor killed with the car you're aware that's the guy with the car the thing is why would we stick around and fight this team in a fair 3v3 when we can go up the rope and just shoot people in the back they're just going to sit in the ring let's go this way i'm recalling my drone extended lane back here level two i didn't know it was possible to be bad with the spitfire but apparently i mean i'm just a surprise every day we have to push them otherwise we're going to get through we have to get out of here right here i mean they should win this one vita all right not not to be listen not to hey on this particular crypto too much but sometimes having a crypto on the team is he's uh more of a detriment i'm really trying not to be happy to me it's not this guy's at all they're just they sometimes this is better to shoot than it is to be in a drone you know i feel like that was one of those situations you get one of them down i've scanned them you can see them reviving there we go this team took their sweet time we actually got away with one here surprised his team took so long to get over here they're still taking their sweet time that's what i mean though we could have thirded that team and shot him in the back but instead we entered into a gunfight that almost got us killed okay this guy heard that i was the worst spitfire user in europe but even i can once with you if you're gonna push like that like come on that is just disrespectful get him contact with hostiles oh my god i don't want to run with my gun but then is there a team behind just kill this team don't turn around fight another team by himself when we could have just killed this team it's all messed up i think we kill both these guys they're still over and around somewhere ah they're big distracted fight is not over i'm going to respawn here because it's actually kind of easy to defend up here oh they're so distracted too which is perfect and there are so many death boxes yeah let's do it look there's just death boxes down the stairs if we just sit up top here and don't let them push that's even if they know we are respawning because they're kind of fighting i closed the doors and you got rid of his ulti i apologize profusely they're not pushing they're scared they know they've got a team behind them too we could just wrap around whilst they're distracted get safe and then gatekeep that's the plan let's go this way you got it push it why haven't you the team putting an eye in the sky marking our are you shooting my surroundings no perhaps gotta kill that guy free spit fine nerf because the reload is a little bit too long i have no heavy noise we could just disengage maybe gonna try and help this man's full health edgy stuff oh that's unlucky we know if i had more heavy i don't have to push up maybe i didn't have to push up anyway but then i never would have got the banner in the middle ring and i'm gonna turn right around me i am ready to go i got guns me too i am i'm leaving to the fight night arena even a flat line here i'm good there was a lot of teams that wanted uh carrier was that really yeah there were more teams my carrier than anywhere else oh my god which is kind of surprising yeah wait look at you guys look at your armors yeah i kind of got juiced up a little bit what they fix it yeah they removed it oh you gotta reload oh you're a teammate we've been landed on i'm dead yanks they've all landed on me i killed one three other ones cracked oh my god nade oh i got the armor just in case just in time ah i have phoenix on phoenix in here okay yeah they're just hanging out in the ring i hate it when people do that i absolutely hate it yeah it's kind of annoying like get out of the ring and shoot your gun at me there should be a timer and then you start taking tick damage come on out boys 2v1 one's cracked please jump out and they look like they might actually damn the champ okay that's my last bullet [Music] when people do that i mean he's not what they want to get out of the ring then rich we got to play rank more i'm down to play i guess so far let's get some ranked games almost 100 already we go did you actually wait i was thinking i needed these guys hold that and that one smoke out oh hammers re-45 hammers nice down oh he he's a digital threat nice [Music] i might be dead no i'm okay we traded okay [Music] oh my god oh [Music] he was mad because there was they didn't have any gaba ghoul for him you
