hey what's up Gaza twitch welcome back to another video today we're playing some more modern warfare today I have a two-game place for you both in ground war the first of which is just a bunch of noise streaks that I've got after a late drawing and the second of which is the fast nuke which the title is talk around only care about the faster nuke you can check the description for a timestamp and you can skip right hey anyway hope you enjoy - it's probably a blessing in disguise of you let me stay in here it's a now something you mean let me reload so dead I don't have any idea on this classic got overkill this window is LP I don't know why wants to hop out of it look at this for this restaurant no one knows what's going on no one knows what's going on I got my teammate protecting the stairs for me I feel like I should talk about neither I'm getting bored one exploding Globox there you go got a kill for that early beetle I'm beat like what mean die sweet though you're trying to get up top there's my chopper gunner oh my god please don't hop out the window they're just above me here I'm one of my van TIV I've literally just joined the game what's going on here mighty light diet top I think you may have don't kill me oh my god I am top of the team and I've been in it for half the game I'll tell you if you get a good position with a suppressor on ground war you are laughing it is free kills my friends absolutely free kills okay see the difference between this like that life there and the other one is that I was behind them on your life in this building again please I've got I've had like one kill my bench Rosie let me in final spawn here I'm gonna die that's the problem my glance amusing someone's gonna be back up top somewhere we just got overrun Oh the advance he's gone I had one kill with it what an absolute shame click on my chump were gonna do and I'm sure you helped the team it's tough so probably too angry imagine imagine the scenes teammates one so I call the chopper than ring the chopper gunner of Dean I'm gonna do because am I gonna know the good streak and then I don't know overlapping when you're on a good streak he may as well use when you spawn in you don't know no advance rate of these or anything now you have ease in general that will be met question is how do I get but they windows there I can't remember that building I really cannot remember whoa stop that I strike them where the heck are they this way as well I found them okay that'll do a daddy's man that kills it we are on a 31 and I've only been in here for half the game it's crazy how far around the map you can go but I guess they've done it so you can always flank see another stuck in the meat grinder which just makes sense look how far away I am from all the action that's a pleather sniper nice and wide double wide that now it's my kill that's not boning me does it like down here I got a munitions box as well motors throw that out not that's attacking sir I try and move though cuz I'm pretty sure these guys know where I am you see that's close oh hey Mark the guy standing still I'm so close to my be top three kills that could have easily just been two right there I don't need to go to four flags because we need say five points to win like what actually he's gonna win this game it's not even that close I just get DEFCON noobs name and I've said no I just want one more set streak before the game is done I'm getting extremely close here Sorry mate it's freaking me out how did this happen how am I here with every member of the team I thought I was on a crazy a crazy flank that VTOL might be honest and then be there we go lost squad feed for the boys out here on the mongoose bit confused about one I lost one on here don't kill me Tom I think they lied in the meat grinder no there's still one of buried level six are you too sporty I'm beyond angry with that did I get my chopper I did get my chopper he doesn't even matter who cares all right I've only been in here for half the time I've done no objective work I have Nazi when I joined Dean we would win in any way here possible well it's because the game is pretty much done for they're all camped inside there okay well I messed that one up that was an easy kill if I just use the Rockets Esme's I'll fire these up because the game is just about to end I think there you go 61 kills with the late join I mean I say late join joined like 30 points in it's still there you go it's me you've just seen this kill there you go sixty-one we paid carriers waiting for your mark you ready for the sweet things Pat you ready for deployment oh my god okay I asked a ton of girls ready China key you catch a new doc Clinic
