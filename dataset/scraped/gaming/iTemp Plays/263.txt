hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with a legend that everyone loves having on their team but no one really wants to play it is of course loba her bracelet though somewhat fixed has always been unreliable her passive is okay i guess for the first maybe 45 seconds of the game and then it's fairly useless but her ultimate ability is amazing after all of the books that he's done but it's amazing for the whole squad lobo gets no added benefits from it so in my opinion she's pretty much an ultimate bot she's a walking ultimate boss that is why she's on the team it's worth it though you will never run out of ammo ever again so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends whatever this place is called it is me migos containment that's the one took all my brain power careful teammate when it's got blue armor so it should be okay happens there's a third team just giving they're both chilling behind a cage oh we're getting fancy are we old jump shot wing man huh when i say your feet on fire never mind you're inside okay i ran out of bullets oh i ran out of bullets the guy left we just quit the i'm game sure if you have joan i i don't even if you did you're off the scene doesn't matter i've got a med kit it's just the path you know he took the eave right that i dropped and then use it against me i'm pretty sure that's what what's just happened there because that's where i dropped my either right shotgun i shall come i was gonna use my bracelet to get up top and then use my ultimate but then my teammate wouldn't be able to get there very easily i'll just drop it in here it covers the whole poi anyway i've got zero ammunition here we go what we got standard stock didn't take it i think someone's pulling our pathfinder friend there's someone here and then why i've killed him actually here they are enemy over there i wonder what they found reloading they went like a very beige outfit and it was fitting into the the landscape that guy was one even if you popped a shield back i think you've got a huge advantage oh you got it nice all right there we go 800 damage at containment never let you down ever uh the one problem i have when i land here sometimes is that sometimes i struggle with ammunition but when you're playing loba you don't actually have to care you do have to care about the local trees though the local foliage because they will block all of your bracelets gold energy banks gold heavy as well and a dj stacked all of a sudden i've got purple two gold mags which is my favorite thing to have on the game i've got so many inventory slots for throwables talk about throwables [Music] left one on the floor i've been literally okay well the frag grenade disappeared but i got the thermite back nice thankfully they are the opposite direction of that very terrifying watson fence as well is this the offending watson i don't know she'll bat so if this guy's got batteries even though i hit more than he hit me i can't see trees my enemy in this game recharging shields replicator incoming and i'll have to move i can't see some idiot set the forest on fire where are you that why tim i need to die where were you go offense watson went to go and check on her offenses they're still there they're still fine you've got a boosted loader but you don't have a turbo charger you got a turbo though don't you uh no two gold mags though everyone's got gold megs all right ammo's looking all right i mean we're logan so if it gets if it gets drastic in the energy department we can just uh we can just throw our ultimate down we'll be fine all right five kills basically top ten do you know what king's canyon is actually treating me well recently i need a hop-up turbo charger just as a reminder i mean we've checked a care package we've checked about 18 different gold death boxes and no luck but if you come across one i see an enemy over there we have 45 they trying to hunt the care package that we looted there was nothing in there leave anything good behind only the best for my friends teammates come in is that even a person that could be a hot that honestly this could be a hollow spray no that's a person oh there are two people they've multiplied and it's another rampant second recharging shield i can't see this guy we're in a pretty bad spot here team mate yes they're shooting at me okay recharging my shields we honestly might want to reposition or as it's more commonly known run away they're in the zone not in the good way either and we're on his own now they might push off that you're an absolute psychopath it's your lucky day recharging my shields so it's basically full health which is good they died from zones they didn't lose any shield from it that's a rock oh there you are thank goodness for the digital threat coming in clutch no one's got any energy annoyingly i mean i know i'm low but i'm just going to commit to the r301 more people use like guns i'll probably just get more light rain at the end of long as i don't this in the zone we should be okay no just dropped you hold on teammate i'm messing up my looting i'm using a phoenix kid we've just absolutely farmed 2000 damage now with four other squads remaining i am down to third party why am i so incredibly slow in the water let's see what we have over here so it's not really with me and this guy's got incredible high ground oh they're distracting okay oh they're up here we have to change from top otherwise we're going to third party ourselves i should have had to prowl the whole time 64 with one burst that was the end of that squad so we're gonna trade for the alternator i don't get to use it very often where were the people they were shooting at is the question i've fallen off the cliff cliff richard i bet we'll find something good here don't drive out one minute i mean he must have been my teammate right it must have been the chance there's a straggler back there and the next ring is right there they're alternator i mean one's got so many bullets teammate that's got like twenty fewer bullets or whatever i don't know kind of close uh we are not playing someone that can get up top which means we could get a gate kept don't forget who hooked you up i hate this part of the map it makes me want to play pathfinder we don't actually even need to go we're gatekeeping ourselves i'm tempted to sit near these doors because i honestly i think there's a straggler at least one of these guys is a solo i think and i think they might be trying to flank us i've got a feeling i thought i could hear someone before we're already in the next ring here's your birthday present if someone's got a crater there's no way they could see me through this respawn beacon's green stuff right i'm practically invisible there we go i wonder what they found you have to push up though okay stupid gravity hello so i knew there were people behind us wait they're both called matty it's going for your lifeline package careful he's got himself two shield cells and an extra syringe or two i'm absolutely terrified this guy's looted out of his mind uh that is the worst name i've ever seen ever looks like we killed the champion i thought it would be more exciting nice that's a great game lowberry's so useful especially like containment honestly i've run out of ammo so much when i land containment i think i might have also got 3000 damage that game there we go 3040. we revived each other once teammate got nearly a thousand damage two kills five assists though and the afk revived at the start of the game ggs all around that was a good one we had a big lull in the mid game but we still got 3000 damage ggs
