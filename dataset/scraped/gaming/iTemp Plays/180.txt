everyone's just thinking who cares let's just land cap anyway and i'll be honest i'm not that opposed to it especially if i'm going to land on a sorry a blue bolt a mastiff can't complain about that not sure how good i am with this thing though ah i want it but i need a bit of range looking for a thermite grenade thanks best girlfriend i don't know why my best boyfriend mirage is afraid of you thermite grenade here we talk about pathfinder i don't understand the law i'm so behind i have no idea i know that ash found no i think wait who was found in a bin was that pathfinder i don't know i don't know at all you couldn't tell ah i went back for the two times because i really wanted on my headlock someone's cooking something i think we're cooking a door they were definitely here they were definitely people market as well i'm gonna stick with the boys enemies oh they might need a firmware although i did pink like three of them taken down the ring is in close proximity less than one minute grenade careful you are try i can't get that no i don't have anything i'm going to destroy an alpha yes i know but i'm a one shot i'm a one shot that is not helpful at all seriously wasn't helpful just saying still my friend i can but he was just trying to help but still standing by it makes you all angsty and stuff you know all the pings going on it makes you feel like you need to to rush in but sometimes you don't donnie's a heel so bad shield here is cool oh god watch [ __ ] absolutely just melted their faces off i'm pretty sure if if we get a close and personal you you won't see a face on either of them recharging shields we need to get somewhere we need to decide what to do here having a big scrap team up here it's gonna tp nice huge i'd uh i talking game but i talked earlier on and someone said that my mic was too quiet oh that didn't work it was a good effort though guys gg we tried yeah you can have a shotgun on your left hand and then like a regular like pissed on the right one like and it was i don't know the mix and match was so good that sounds so broken yeah but you can't ads so that'd be scrapping by the way hello hello any bullets sorry good wait where are my bullets going do you know let me first let me first i get a kill i get a kill if i first aren't you well i cracked either one i revived one of them i'm using thermites even though i have a rampage i'm using two of them where are they up there yeah just a fair by the time i saw they just revived so two of them but they they killed their teams they have arm switches on me too they're all split suck things cracked uh someone below us i think recharging shield oh they're on my head all right the octane run off so we have them split right here uh i mean he was down so he's gotta be caught outside the ring if it's the octane then over this way i thought three times i could have thirsted i hate the two times sometimes i don't even know where the bullets go i've mixed feelings about both of them about all the sights in this game except one time even that sucks on this gun anyway the rampage on the rampage he does sweats misaligned or something he's probably going for bananas i've just crafted three bats so oh different team different team he's here he's going back to bananas you see him 24 28 cracked close this other team's gonna be coming yeah wait i fall back let me know if you need some i broke out right they're on those bins right there on the race i'm using two guns that both require charges uh sentinel rampage i'm just stationary 90 of the game because i can't move unless i i can't charge it unless i just don't move for like w when you charge because then that's not what it's been right i don't know how it works oh maybe i don't know this is you're asking a lot for me i you have nothing on your vote oh here we go pretty much no my own game i have to run i have to run this one has gold i need to go yeah yeah i saw that i was gonna res you but i was scared to res you behind this little piece of cover always no that's honestly you made the right play there i've been here i was still in the open oh she has gold back i think which one uh the wraith right behind that wall that you're on oh okay that's thank you dumb suggestion sorry mate nice that just looked like the saddest ball jumper ever it was so far away i just faced plenty that looks so sad oh my god watch these watches watch these um neck beep i'm neck deep it's too late sorry you should have seen that was a beautiful one what you wanted plus i can't even get myself a moment bag like hell me uh i can craft your bag thanks you have to ping it for me oh i'll be here for three hours release it yeah yeah if you ping it don't know that much see ya ten seconds no i don't craft i'm blank some knew the player level three thanks mate you need to be at the front of the pack so i'm not dying to a full team just camping a door again do you need something crazy made you craft me a bag when you literally told me there's a gold back back there so i had a gold bag already wait are you oh my god there's no wait hi i forgot i'm sorry what were you gonna use the crafting on anyway it's not the big the worst thing ever right i could have crafted like 19 bats we could have been batted out of our mind right now i've already got two we're fine that's just the worst thing i've ever heard and of all jump combined that might be the saddest minute of gameplay ever how is this only me i scanned as well a little bit too far oh yeah i'm cleaning dead i'm dead i'm literally dead don't come by i dropped i dropped i dropped i missed it i got on the back really bad i had to drop i down two or down two i can grab them back up there there is another yeah [Music] oh my god dude i have the worst luck i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm cursed yep you are look we didn't need to craft anything man i need to crank both my guns i haven't been doing this remains three hospitals and then no crank in an altic cell i am repairing myself just stationary this entire game 30 seconds kind of got to go you blocked a bullet for her like the secret service 88. you're actually you actually throw more than anyone i've ever met about it it was extra we got an extra two yards man oh we did it it was because i was pulling back on my stick that didn't fly off the edge look did you see that huge fuse ultima love that i love these players like chasing we're getting low-key chase right they're under the bridge right now i'm gonna get on the bridge okay i'll come with you oh this
