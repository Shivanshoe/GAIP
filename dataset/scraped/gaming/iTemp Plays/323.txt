hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are dominating fragments with corsic himself his gas has been buffed to scale in damage every other tick starting at five so the damage numbers per tick are five five six six seven seven and so on and so forth meaning that fighting in his gas again is really quite difficult now people say that corsic is a boring legend but i actually feel like he's one of the most fun but i don't know if this is just because i enjoy annoying other people in the server it could just be that so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right screw it all city it is me amigos and i i'm playing the gas man another eve right little extending mag my teammate lucy down low i believe my setup's not too bad especially for the start of the game i actually wouldn't mind fighting over there far off attention this is so risky i'm running past the team but this is where cause it thrives you know which is great because the armor i picked up wasn't even full uh yeah sorry team i've led us into the the worst position ever here if you can get up top i'm going to put loads of gas traps down this is exactly what you want to score stick this is caustic paradise these kinds of buildings i mean they're surviving money's heavy some here just a little bit that's a huge ultimate [Applause] i don't know what the heck's going on here team harry potter is looking at the stairs these boxes like eight times each i'm struggling i need an extended heavy mic so desperately i need an extended heavy man i need an extent i need an extended heavy nag honestly the the prowler rivals the wingman for something here needing an extended mac you get four bursts with the prower if you just get that extra even even uh one extra burst he's just so helpful actually i'll just i'm gonna craft i'll craft one back you know what they call me there's a humongous scrap i'm not gonna waste too much time here i just hate fighting with like purple or above without any batteries you just you can't enter the fight in this area very quickly at all it's just the worst [Music] okay yep yep it might be time for the old seat i had a feeling that that pathfinder was trying to get to the respawn beacon to respawn his teammates but it turns out not only did he have backup but there was a separate team with a charge rifle as well so oh god needs to be extending back that's okay is that you yes i mean there's a charge rifle team and i'm pretty sure another team's rocking up after that i think we should readjust to the other side we can just get easily flanked through this tunnel as well that was a gift recharging shield yeah it's quite heavy but no heavy extended i'm happy to run another broke building though let me see up top here he's in his ultimate oh my god i'm so sorry i'm the worst i need my shield back i'm risking it oh god nice teammate there we go he's the good stuff right we've got arthro and we've got a gold extender for the prowler and those are the two teams that are just fighting each other this is perfect we just need to regroup here look that must be my teammate dropping heavy ammo down there right i don't need any absolutely fine i think we just try and get involved in this scrap people are here stocks are undervalued at the moment people don't realize how useful stocks are now what on earth happened to my trap i think the play here is to get up top and just put some traps down because if we need to if we get third parted we can just retreat up top my shoes oh i tried it i tried it he's gonna pop a bath he's gonna get that bat off i got you friend one in the huge we're doing great only two other squads remain oh my word caustic is literally the best legend of all time not to play against though playing against him uh won't well he's still um here we go i didn't get time to try and explain myself here my brain's all scrambled he's really annoying to play against is what i'm trying to say they're actually pushing through them that wasn't the play i've been buffed you guys in using a phoenix check your mini-map i'm actually kind of sad because unless someone pops out it's looking increasingly likely that we are going to have to leave a scrapital city which is the courted capital of the entire world as you've seen in this game play so far what the heck oh i think he's oh this guy's a genius i suspect we will find something we've got a care package always worth checking for the alternator the spitfire i mean i mean the triple techs are okay but mainly the alternator in the spitfire and the crater might be something good this way yeah he's gonna set up here isn't he he went back to scan the ring and now he's got his ultimate again there we go and we're good i am a little jump required but i'll give i'll give it a 9 out of for the ultimate yeah i've got the worst angle ever unfortunately timmy's got a thermited up rampage though so do they i can't believe they didn't push i can't believe we got away with that nice teammates down one as well sky [Music] that's unbelievable i don't know how we escaped that situation you are the apex champions that was one of the squad performances of the century like we are all like all three of us were always right next to each other i mean i'm sort of ruining the team coordination here with the yellows and the golds uh with how we were dressed and stuff but you know i made up for it for the for the damage you know nearly three thousand damage four revives and i have two like we were just water units what a squadron we've put together there if you want to dominate scrapple city play yourself a bit of caustic he's pretty good thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
