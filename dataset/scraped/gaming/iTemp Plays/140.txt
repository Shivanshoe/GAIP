hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and season 12 is upon us and i have a new favorite legend going into the new season though this will probably change tomorrow when maggie comes out because her kit seems ridiculous but anyway my favorite legend at the moment is ash which is kind of surprising now this season i've probably got a win with every single legend in the game i've tried to mix it up as much as i can of course i've got the classics like pathfinder and octane i'm always going to enjoy using these legends in apex but there's something about ash's kits that i really enjoy the one thing i need to practice with her though is her q accuracy because very often i will just throw it into the nearest wall and that does happen in today's video because it's difficult to aim you know i've got no aim assist on it what do you want me to do i'm useless without it but thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the heck is that the heck's that do you see that but there's a flight path that went zoomy i think it's a bug i see that sometimes uh i'm gonna shield that i gotta show that four people please i've got two shield bats no gun not one gun like no gun two shield bats i got a bow i don't know again i'm coming to you present okay there's a show about here i'm not taking it we're already in the next ring now we wait i need to kill whoever was chasing dude valkyrie i don't know who's chasing me though a lot of people are chasing me yeah they were they were mad recharging shields first blood has been taken oh real mad let's go right here just trying to jiggle peek this i'm coming back you want physics day nice you pretend he's stuck on that okay no he's not yeah you try you got tea bag when you after you've lost the fight you're trying to shoot me for five minutes be honest enemy on me let him drop let him drop drop down so happens drop down taking fire give me one sec this fight isn't over get up god we have to every time we drop i'm telling you like somehow the entire fight lands on us yeah i think it's because we're so aggressive and everybody just kind of gravitates to us right yeah maybe it's our own fault yeah i need heavy uh people are dying to the north of us by the way i have a 169 extra i can drop something heavy just a tiny bit would be fine and i could craft a bat i mean uh nope uh shotgun that could just be two teams though right cascades i'm hearing stuff yeah where they at we're there is it giving me blue right here follow me these bonds aren't easily broken i might be dead oh that guy's so happy that tattoo is getting oh that guy's gonna be so happy with that is getting there he's got swamp i think he bared on me oh my god thank you please oh we routed that squad oh thank goodness challenge you are one mate is there anything scarier than a gibby sat behind a bubble with a fully charged pk with his arm shielded he's hitting me for 108 i'm hitting him for 12 maximum you gotta bait the shot at mach oh she was so weak too and i suddenly died repairing my damages charging on my shields i have so much of my entry extended heavy mag here this poor soul got hit with the double whammy the double tap shaved 2 000. i will pick it up uh at some point we'll be back this is a very popping part of the map you know never mind i didn't know she was using a sniper there you go useful thing you still think i have people here marked my next location okay they're shooting over there and they're shooting over here okay i'll come to you finger wherever i don't mind i don't mind i don't mind that one's pretty close enormous on you i'm putting a rope this way who's ready to fly i am the rope or rubbish lord ropage that would be your rap name i feel like little rubbish yeah you know inside let me add him where'd he go first damage yes that was that thing all right yeah turn back turn back another team oh they're down here she tried porting up but she got scared time to bind you oh should go right on it she's gonna come this way oh she went the other way i can't go in there because the port so what's going on over here oh with my new friend bound wait it's just going to go stay that way that way oh gee i can't i i'm stuck in an infinite loop oh my god death where did she go going backwards what does that mean backwards she's gone but she's so far away she's just having a good time no it's okay i need two damage wait i need two damage i'm gonna shoot spider oh that wasn't i didn't calculate that right no you differentiate the quadratic sequence uh yeah quadratic that's what i was going to say i don't even know how to punch boost oh no i actually got you stuck in the door it was insane third dimension a fourth dimension immaculate having a good end it's funny because that could actually happen in this game which oh yeah it's like a that's like a fear of mine it's just dying to a crate that i opened that i'm standing on i suck oh they're all in there they're all three there's a total of three three healthy okay oh god oh god shields are depleted recharging charging i need two times back to back this race is pointing weirdly enough she's got blue oh i tried to punch her oh god i just launched my tactical i don't know where it's going nice that was fun that's fun whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that was my line recharging shield i mean it was fun it was good well i'm running i'm running low on shotgun but i don't care i'm not moving i uh eight extra bullets in my havoc and i'm not okay this is an escape from talk of me we don't have a stash okay you don't get to keep the energy bullets afterwards i don't care where's the next crap coming from i know you tell me every single well hold on you ready anyway you like this you like this where are ya oh nice oh then you're gonna rope again in order to get another rope you know have you ever seen this have you made this actually a pineapple here [Music] make the game more like fortnite that's what i've been saying yeah you have you said that for a while but i keep dying so it won't be in any of the videos i'll probably die on this one too let's say again the videos because i had some dude who took took it like very very seriously he's upset hey he's very upset with me it's not happy not happy with my opinion you must be doing something right over there yeah this is enough for like a quarter of a fight i need a i need to lose what am i doing positioning i'll put my old thing my lobe would you need energy ah yes energy there on the voices enemies or i thought you sorry i thought you said enemies i feel you looking for enemies not energy also until there's enemies here then no no no no all right then you lost me oh here we go here we go i'm coming in hot full team coming in hot 800 right he's dead right he's been on one right he's facing thank you that's my fault the race was one shot so instead of like trying to fight the people that were right in front of me i ran into the open and tried to wing manner out of the gravity cannon because i thought it'd be cool you know that is cool sometimes you've got to go for the spectacular no no tap straight dab i know if you appreciate that look at that look at that it's cool yeah can we can i take this no can i take so this is a genuine question how much tightness he said that's embarrassing using my phoenix gift should be able to take it one way but one way either way right yeah i agree with myself so you use it on like a weak enemy and then you take the portal but then they just take the port back and then you start there like an idiot that that is now gone i thought about that after i said it but i don't want to say anything it just tries to change topic quick okay that's still a good idea what about those right socks huh the care package has touched down over there it's gonna be cray back i'm gonna throw the game away plug in here plug in your keyboard that's a plug in it plug it in okay that's what they do right yeah plug it in right now plug it in i've picked up a sweet fire because the second one i found i feel like they're trying to tell me something oh yeah but i shouldn't be using a wingman they're punch boosting is it that's that's a little oh god no no bannon they're banned don't worry it wasn't flesh dpi oh man that was a game you are the eight that was one of the games that we've played today yeah it was definitely one and hold on my ultimate is ready let's go it's gonna alter wait hold on oh now you've really do it like a frog oh it's another day ah another day another day that was a good day that was fun
