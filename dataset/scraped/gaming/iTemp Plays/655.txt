hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more ranked with vickstar and so far and the end of this particular game felt like we were recording for the next apex trailer there's a lot of downhill sliding kills the fast streaks we even tried setting up a trick shot for the final kill and i'm gonna send the footage off actually for whoever makes the trailers for apex because this could be used at the end of this game it's really fun i had a great time recording and hopefully you guys enjoyed watching it thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right trying it can't go worse than what two games ago oh yeah okay yeah there's one team dropping in here all right actually that i got a bit further so we'll go yeah we got this whole side it's a weird gun it's so strong but it just you're not i don't think you're gonna put down a lot of damage with that gun any shoes you have to be good what do you mean crap come on now we're already watching nice wig with it i thought i could i could replicate the success blood oh but not see nice wig is like another breed though destroyed their whole team is uh kinda laggy um anything with range on it same yeah i've got a longbow i'm ready but you're kind of people though they just shot down a cargo box for blue idiots i got the longbow ready another time even even further i'm gonna tighten one of their heads though you have a spike for your my purple tagged one the guy top was purple too if you want to which one one of them charge rifle nice time up here no no it's not it's now star i've been trolled i've never heard someone so excited to find one i know that's awesome dude i've been playing apex for years and never heard enthusiasm behind a card maybe when he was op but not not since then yeah it's been a while nostalgia nice to hear nice change of pace i like to bring something for everyone you know dude you never know tomorrow everyone might be using charge rifles there you go there you have it uh whoa this lifeline is you have blue oh wait are you oh my god this lifeline was the world's best player oh you're fighting a completely different yeah one's there there's one oh there there's there's three around me i'm gonna [Music] i thought you bent the wrong way through the wall oh oh he just got sniped through a window need a drone right here right here yeah i didn't mind one yeah nades carefully lights up [Music] all they're rising too we left he's them low really though i literally didn't hear a shot mate you will never get this you will never get there you will never get this yes dude he knew that was his last his last resort i ran away and he was just in the next window a panic imagine the panic on him trying to kind of gotta do it i'm gonna craft a d-bone turbo charger i'm doing anything off over there yeah i crashed the devo and then i got rudely interrupted yeah you can still hear it 50 yards out too oh i really do miss the first day this crafting thing was in the amount of times we'd run off on one of these and just don't need to be crossing almost out there with no armor on yeah i don't realize that thanks a while yeah look at the productivity out here the efficiency the workplace efficiency now i'm at that i'm okay you guys you guys do you think i'm coming wait what was that wait he just jumped in this just jumped into the lava what's wrong with that he's killing himself what are you doing little guy this is a stupid gun it's a stupid weapon and i'm upset okay i don't know what i just witnessed but oh no i need some more crafting mats i need less than 100 damage to upgrade my armor sorry much and uh end of the ammo i have a hundred space if you need any you know i have some extra for you guys what we're going we've got people out here uh oh there's a care package oh i thought they opened it there's a care package over there that's really far i don't even know if it's worth it no i don't think there's anybody on this side hope i don't see nobody well at least we know oh here we go i have a subject in view in the open version isn't really content one more minute just on the train tracks yeah one of the back is almost broken too and here's where i would have liked to have hit my shirt here he comes to me you guys need energy i got a lot i have 200 spare okay is there a third one yeah somewhere i think he got away but a little bloodhound oh that's the team oh we just got exploded in the back that one oh really low really low caustic it was insane with another thing behind what happens here blood on the last one subtracted from the equation i think they killed someone here as well oh my goodness this is awful i've hit all of zero shots i i just don't need to go back is really low oh i took a patch oh this is nothing where did the path go this guy's one oh zone's coming too oh god i'm gonna get involved it's a different team i have no clue what's happening um i'm getting shot from the edge of zone uh make sure when you come into the zone you go north east i don't think i can go out oh no can i get your things or not even uh if you've got a paddling kind of there's one like i know i put one down um i come into the zone and try you ready oh yes i mean that was great that was great that was great oh yeah 10 seconds there's a lot of fighting over here actually i think it's the whole server i'll let you have zero assists i literally have zero kills yeah same i have zero it's all kicking off this one right beneath us somewhere oh boy just do a left victim between us uh more east over there they might try and get up top on us i need batteries i have um i have i got i got okay someone's coming in i know you're fine all right let me just get some good stuff in my life all right i'm ready to do things no lester team sound like they're fighting just in here all kicking off i see one over there the troops like fight so fast oh i do not even see him our whole team wait i'm gonna try that let's run down the hill [ __ ] people are you creating the intro for the news oh yeah bangs obviously not one but weak oh my god oh my word subject down be doing one further up the hill above you he's uh oh my i was lying down the mountain with a diva i literally was creating the next trailer yeah i watched i watched the whole thing i i shot two bullets and i after i realized what you're doing i just wanted to watch it it looked awesome should we try and get a sniper trick shot i think it might just be at max too someone just died wait okay i might be hearing things very possible very possible that i might have been hearing things what the odds that he's in there closed door here look official forget that i want a crater for a trick shot dab it the triple take trick shot but what will it won't it like will it kill like the hip fire because it doesn't it doesn't like power up doesn't it it might be really hard yeah that's what i'm thinking it might be a multiple trick shot tonight okay so i have to hit 360 three times and shoot him every time i spin like a 720 but fire halfway through so it's like a 360. yeah okay i can do that i've got a launch pad ready if you guys take his shield off i'll hit him with the uh particularly right where is this guy i'm gonna kill the lifeline okay i would try and help if i could hit anything uh keep the lifeline keep the lifeline anglers down to finish their bangalore yeah right we need to get the lifeline to know she has to move soon 40 seconds yeah who wants to be in charge of taking off the uh shields uh that's so far oh god no meal pressure on me i'll shoot he i don't think he's he's decent because he's healing up and stuff once he comes out of here i'll attack a little bit he's got shield again actually vic if you throw a pad stand next to a melee onto it it just sends you vertical and you can keep jumping on it he's broken i don't know if you want to do it like that he's a 80 hp okay i'm getting ready to go now now he's uh like 60 60 hp right here weapon switch i missed i'll knock it off no shield why did these not hurt i said i'm doing it off a rock [Laughter] come on oh i yeah a quick scope i did a three quick little three three quick season show what did you see it was pretty clean i can't lie let's find out when you need it i know that'd be great oh my all right i think that's a high note to end it on oh that's great win chase for playing boys was good fun that's a lot of fun oh thank you thank you for playing
