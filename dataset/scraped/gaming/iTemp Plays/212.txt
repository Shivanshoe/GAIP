hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing big dublin because my new goal on apex is to be able to play any legend as if it was my main and one of the legends i'm really bad at with the legend himself he's really good is gibraltar and i know this because when i tried to play gibby in a previous ranked grinds like two or three splits ago when i actually played ranked uh i was more pain for my team than i was game you know also talking about ranked i've recorded a one hour video going live tomorrow because i am silver in ranked at the moment and i want to post more storm playing gameplay and the best way to do that is to play ranks but i'm silver so i thought why not just record every game and just throw them all into a video see what happens so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends gibby this man's playing gibby oh my god time's a stressful okay you gotta play everyone you gotta try and master every single legend in in the game you'll be ready to pull them out at a moment's notice this is one of those moments unless i was just my team i could hear no they're rushing over run into the distance or what yeah they were just down low still nice job team the flatline is so good was he out off heavy what does he need got to pick him up but he doesn't say in the fade he should say he's using heavy energy i have a hundred here you go teammate oh god i seem like a big [Music] recharging my shields [Applause] remember the guys down over there with a bow and arrow brothers let's move this way don't know if he's over there don't think he's over there i think he must have moved light ammo here craft a bat whilst the boys are running over but that's a lot of effort i'm the big gibster i don't need a backpack darn it try to steal a kill right here this way teammates you can hear the gunshots i know close range i mean it never ends capital city does it never ends does he have ultimate there's no real way to tell this game i mean they're rushing the roof with white armor everyone get in there did i just crack someone else i have so many med kits just need to zoom in and it's gooby just need to zoom in you'll be absolutely fine here we go i've got my red shields i don't think i've and he's anyone with the longbow maybe once over near the library we're apart from that anyone else coming over here i've just been destroying everyone with the flatline this thing is so gosh darn good all right did anyone have a better sight i could do i could try and use two to four looking for a three times ideally what did you have oh man sniper rings i need sniper ammo hold on i'm actually gonna craft a level three sniper mat because i don't know what else we can do whilst we're sat here in capital city we've absolutely cleared everyone out pretty much everyone's worst nightmare and if this isn't everyone's first nightmare then it absolutely should be you know what that might be i don't think i'll need it for this one ah fine heavy i'll try and use the longer as much as i can i could pop it now and get my ultimate but i think by the time we pop into someone i think i'll have it already so i'll save this one so i can use three ultimates this game that's the plan here we go straight through the tunnel everyone's getting pushed this way too so actually they could go the other way just the staging i need to call it staring there miss ready there's no way it's called staring okay won't make any sense i don't think you need the eye in the sky i think they're too far away they're like here careful because they could just run to starry you know i could come back through the tunnel i guess yeah come back through come back through see what happens all guys different team they're probably just going to run to the is the best phone archer i've ever seen this is a big big emp coming in i can't move my aim oh guys we finished the squad that's how you get the job done they'll ride my sideline but i couldn't address my aim quick enough backpack here level four that's a pretty good i guess we just got north it's not worth risking that that's a pretty good box though our last two teams are fighting we need to get involved faster faster faster he's probably picking up the gold bags because i've already got one we've left it behind that's fine ah the envy clan is going down unfortunately we needed them to trade back a down or something no i think that's the entire clan name no wait that don't a lot of things are going on i think this might just be a free win i think he used it back there how are you still scrapping we're gonna get there do about eight damage with one guy and quiet and and win he's probably on the respawn beacon right now that was on the respawn bacon are you telling me there's three of them you're telling me there's three of these guys just here look teammates other bats have a gold bag but these guys are probably reviving as well all right i went in a little bit overzealous there all right little reset because i assume they why would he ever go this way giving my shields a recharge why would he ever carry on going that way makes no sense are we reviving i oh my god that was i thought we got to turn up and do eight damage i just ran into my death but fortunately i then clutched a 1v3 pretty much good grief that ending was way more interesting than i was prepared for i swear about eight people died in the feed between two teams what happened i mean who cares i ended up with a bunch of damage shout out the team we're always together play it as unit good win guys gg last like two weeks no no how damaging you last game was that we're talking about yeah sorry crazy damaging you i need a shotgun are you laughing yeah what was that he just went up sorry no you're not i'm on 90. there's no way what server are we on that would be uh west coast oh that's a lie ha goodbye it's over here balls close i haven't no bulk pk that was close it was awesome yeah it was kind of close it was a little bit repairing and he wasn't easter and they were big scrapping over there let me know if you see a bolt please ah i never saw one why are you yelling at me just a reminder one minute before the ring closes we have time at my ultimate do you have your ultimate uh i do i'll use my purse do anybody have any spare bats i have one that was my battery for me the ring is in close proximity i'm just launching everything i have here [Music] whoa whoa whoa she's going crazy okay oh no i'm not crafting i'm going to take the balloon and just risk it you know that's a vgs champion all right just be careful a vgs what does avgs stand for advanced video game i don't even know what a lgs stands for i don't know i was thinking i don't know apex legends global series global series yeah yeah spain recharging shields i have no bat so i'm just coming up no man uh one of the squads is that bangkok itself raised i couldn't find her so we didn't design a lot i think we just screwed mate yep i'll go this way i may have chose another route yes okay i have a spitfire let's go let me know i'm glad i leave because then i got more damage because before i did 28 damage to killer and i was embarrassing you know what's embarrassing is me letting you i'll damage you and kill you i'm putting on a performance oh what what'd you mean what do you mean view me i said i'm not damaging i'm not killing you oh yeah that's true and last game with your 42 damage kind of clean yep that's what happens if teammate baits you that package was open by the way so i feel like they're over here somewhere about nowhere what package was it i wasn't here it was like uh it's behind us somewhere well they haven't looted the tree the trees are looted was that you oh here we go oh my god i just use my grapple drive on that guy hold ready wait get just watches yeah yeah you are the apex champions she already thought i was going to give her a chance she really thought i cracked her and then she dropped her purple shield like you can leave that on okay i know there's nothing in there
