hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i made a bad mistake with ranked it's the same mistake i always make now last week i uploaded a video called it's time to take ranked seriously meaning i wanted to grind from platinum to masters and i thought i had a week to do this which would have been fine i actually had like a day and a half and it was definitely still possible but seemed kind of unnecessary to put myself through the stress of the grind when i could just attempt it again the next split this time i'm starting early so far and i've realized that some content that we haven't explored at all is just reaching the higher ranks and playing in those lobbies i'm definitely going to have to step up my gameplay as i haven't felt 100 this last week on apex but i think by the time the grind is over and we are in masters we should be fine hopefully you guys enjoyed the journey thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah i was going to say it's probably the same three angle and middle grow i don't know what that's supposed to mean yeah maybe that there's a full team going there okay i'm not going there it could mean three things there's a yeah there's a full team on that one and there's a team on ours that's just this is a tragedy i wish you the best of luck there's another team on this one we should go this way i'm really gonna use bubble yeah yeah thanks mate don't smudge only like med kits yeah i have a phoenix huge wait i forgot what button i was using the res i let go of it thanks mate it turns out that the spam pink was like be careful there's some teams there so i've learned that uh maybe in hindsight it was a good pain yeah it was this guy's a resident i have two energy bullets so i'm just gonna give me a sec i love that gun so much such fun gun is he awake well they they were the people punching me at the start so i feel a little bit better i mean there's a big scrap over here i'll try and stay safe just poke him well someone definitely cleaned out my box oh really but it was not me hmm watch out for the new kill leader friend yeah team up top left recharge i'm barely on my way okay i'm fine i think there's a separate team here on the left cracks looking they're chasing me i down the bangalore if he's kind of chasing yeah yeah nice my enemies again yeah yeah i got scared when i went around the corner i was thinking i'm gonna punch this guy and then i heard his pk and then and i saw his arm shield and i did think that's what might have been a mistake but no it was worth it it actually made it all the more sweeter you know i respect it sounds like it's pretty far away yeah it's all the way over there i got a crypto drone too okay i don't think they're in a position to hold up on that shields now don't really understand what point of that was maybe you needed like 10 damage for purple nice the other the last guy over there that was a different team i do not have bubble you're good i'm just farming uh we don't have to push them we just have to go like you gotta use the phoenix way now we gotta wrap the left because this is an awful push like we damn won't they just tail revive pointless i have somebody i got here really laggy oh my god come to you come to you [Music] i broke his teammate there's a guy like they're still on that on that building oh he's up top 83 on him and there's another guy just right there apparently i knew in here yeah we need to be careful i need to crack one of them yeah brook one nice i think it was about crew i don't have rope for anything no they're not uh yeah good idea already wrecking that one's broken it's almost like half shield for my ankles you know what's happening that's broken it's a good job we push 51 one's got red she's one shot he's really weak i'm trying to finish this entire finish you're good they just i have no close range going just letting you know i have a vault with no oh you said you had some energy right um i bubbled the baby love the baby mate lovers are really low i well played well i got played it's a good job we push up before that this team has been right behind us it'd be so strong man that bubble like the fact that you can just isolate some of that bubble you know i hate i think i've talked about this i don't know if i talk about this with you but i hate action american made action films um like which ones for example like well now let's specifically not not not like the action films i hate the fighting scenes in american made action films like the ones where they're like they're shooting but everyone's missing somehow no no like uh so like a lot of the fighting scenes like hand to hand combat type stuff in like the american-made movies there's like it's like 50 cuts right like it's not one take or like two takes it's like 50 to 100 cuts of them like one punch stop one punch stop one kick stopped one kick stop you know and i i hate that i don't like that and i there's a lot of like uh like japanese or like korean films that they're uh the fighting scenes are like they're unbelievable but the choreography that they put into that stuff is so great i'm about to get punched out well kill bill was great it's intentional extraction no i have not that's a good one finished i know that guy's really sad nice there we go i'm gonna go to that team right back [Music] okay well then we're not doing anything then apparently you want someone to shoot i hear a scrap there's a sentinel over here i kind of want that wow all right i respect it i respect it no you don't you just want a good guy no i actually wanted it what do you mean why would i not want a gold sentinel tonight greatest thing ever here's someone yeah there's a team here i thought so that's why it took me a while to respond he's cracked contact now she's cracked maximum 70 health 45 flash oh no oh we got a bangalore here okay i guess she's got digi give me a sec octane's uh broken rocks right turn around and stupid you guys think one of those it's kind of wild that's me uh i'm sorry did you get killed uh kp though yeah i see it's all matters oh that's not good uh okay i gotta drop mine soon too second flatline they were so close each other oh my god i did not go where i wanted to oh i don't like this digi what the heck is that slides broken huge which one what's that i i need a purple magia i think that valve pulls if i were to just hit one more shot i've won i have three campaign 800 damage one kill that's a rank for you he's beyond one shot uh you're all alone by the way yeah that's right sincerely i'm always ashamed less than one minute then i think i rest i'm back he's awake the strafe man does this rope work oh oh right on me this ledge though recharging my shields there's a fight behind them so yeah they got something out of that i don't know what though oh team dude why am i being focused so much they're up here as well mate this is like i got your friend i'm deriving quick yeah i mean i'd probably die here i've seen scratch cracks you cracked it cheese i've got those are risky it was the pictures around me around me right i brought blockchain left one shot i'm just popping that hold on i should have committed i think hope is done i played my place last two teams good work taking out the champion that was a risky rope wasn't it yeah i almost fell off i almost said like because i was like the guinea pig i almost said just don't hop off it'll take you to the top but i had faith yeah but if you fall you got to grapple yeah i die next down here that was a mistake ah that was a huge mistake i mean we should be not the third point we should be sandwiching these guys right but they're falling back a bit yeah i mean they repositioned already he's emptying them i don't know if i can do anything with that they're just partying watson's flash solo i don't have an end goal against on the back though i broke one back there i just gotta hold this we're fine yeah i think they left one i'm gonna try and watch these guys behind us you're all alone okay crack nice this is the two people man they're pushing up careful actually punch this i don't know what i was gonna say i have two seconds on my grapple two seconds on my grapples no teammates stop oh he's absolutely beamed up he's beamed up he's just a demon he's not messing with the flatline nice gg we handled that well as soon as i realized i left someone behind i was not letting him leave the shoots in the back you know i can't believe they just left must have been like a miss click yeah probably oh they didn't like them which one who knows i played one played 666 yep lots of assists
