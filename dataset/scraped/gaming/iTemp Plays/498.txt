hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be sniping in apex something that i do not do very often at all and none of this like longbow or triple take sniping they aren't true sniper rifles in my book a true sniper rifle is a bolt action like the sentinel or the crater i believe that's a term anyway honestly i felt like i was better with the one time scope on the sentinel compared to when i picked up the three times i might have to try a game of just using the one time scope and the sentinel and see how it goes but it's still a really fun game i hope you guys enjoy it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends place but i'm landing here i'm gonna go it shouldn't be too busy because it was really late okay it's the only reason uh 50 people oh my god yeah fluffy people good luck my friend oh i let her own a nine i'm landing laughs i don't know knock down shields i just got exploded from every direction i had that i hit him for like 140 144 that's what i hit him for 144 are what he's dead we got we both got their party by this guy he once had both of us a watson pathfinder and a horizon in this building okay draconic t uh they're coming to me i think there's a blue switch in that guy i've just killed and i have some halos for you okay oh i just pat it back oh

i've got flatline i'm yeah i'm good thank you [Laughter] he's up top on the left i'm charged up he jumps off he kept going bro this octane is so fast right switching that thank you i want to find out where this octane is dude this is awesome i'd say on the on the raspberry pi is it a bang yeah yeah yeah nice that was sick i know it's him on my head no i need to hit these shots oh there's another team as well i'm getting shot on the side yeah i'm backing up shields recharging that was so sick oh this poor little octane that's the difference right here there's a guy here too yeah he's there okay 108 on a lifeline just reloading behind us team behind us he's behind us i'm gonna flank him the ring is near and close are they down though yeah he just jumped off the map where are you going lee just charging my center up again it might have been a fun game i keep missing shots now though panicking where did that team go uh should be an octane and a lifeline they went to wars i don't like that way but i don't see them i mean we all need to go so i'm gonna look for some shotgun emma real fast got some i feel like i'm better with the sense now with the one times hey that's respectable i like that oh nice uh nearly 100 lifeline did oh he looked underneath it he missed his pad he missed it i relate to that octane so much awesome in sheer panic you throw a pat at your feet you're just watching you just walk right over it our last team is here i'm charging my sentence i'll be dead it just tanks it don't worry i'd say i'll clean nice i can flank them i can pat right over their head i'm going to get behind them when she'll give me again nearly 100 all kids uh a hundred and something gibraltar on the way because gunshot back no stop it this whole thing didn't even what was he pushing me a psycho he didn't even heal he's dead on me like a true octane would of course my it's just the same way wk only yeah or one in the same i hit that give his arm shield for like a total of 230 damage that's what i see before like the gun shield should up it should bleed through it's crazy nice good job dude good game that was fun apart from a few missed sentence shots but we're gonna talk about that
