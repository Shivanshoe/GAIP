hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today is april fool's day and last year apex released the buffed up mozambique that had nine shots per mag and this year we get that same mozambique back but also we get a uber-buffed p2020 the rare p2020 is gold it has 25 bullets per magazine and i am almost certain it does more damage per shot than the regular one but do not be fooled however as there is a regular gold p2020 in there as well which comes with the regular amount of shots per mag but also with hammer points i hope you enjoy the two great games that i have for you today and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay i can record yes nice i'm landing uh here again on the road again you sound like johnny cash oh yeah i think that's the song right i'm running here those those guys pulling me out of my own place i'm gonna bully them back yeah come here i'm not doing that no shot no shot arena someone out there oh that sucks for that guy guns for me not looking good i have a havoc with 28 rounds okay so we're insane we're on the same boat then still people know you or yeah i'm coming over i'm scanned i think from behind hopefully they just start scrapping each other oh what's going on here that's what i was using right there it kind of went crazy and you've landed your shots right yeah a dragon ball uh no i'm good thank you i have volts flatline and i'm going to push these guys up here well that is quite defined oh is it sitting on the floor right beside us uh that was mine that i dropped in my havoc and i had no ammo so i should have remembered he was there oh he's right here what was that little stutter leg good job oh nice job you say that uh did i drop you back let me drop you this anyway thank you 60 seconds until the ring closes why always on days like this oh no oh low broke this way i don't know i think it was loaded it was something us no it was something i swear i believe you oh yeah right here fact one crack two i think i know the same with the same entertainment of the team i'm looking for it on the top one's gonna pop him back i double headshot him i double headshot him he's actually furious there's a pate this man's angry where'd he go i have no idea attention where did he go how do you not get caught in my scan care package it was the scummiest play in the world but like so worth it that god probably still hates him he got put on the main stage because they were talking and they were talking down on controller players yeah i remember that controller players playing pathfinder they can't even use this grapple blah blah blah blah blah blah oh hey 25 one javanese do you have any line rounds yes yeah thank you oh that's tremendous thank you 170. who's that yeah is that someone up there i don't know what you could check out here do you have a jump pad i do where do i love it oh yeah we can make it from anywhere yeah i remember that event because two  the craziest grapple ever and i was looking through the highlights and uh they were here by the way let's go through the highlights and the caster was making fun of him then he was like jaw dropped when two uh hit the grappler oh crafty [Music] man get back up i missed i miss i missed i'm missing i'm missing i'm missing oh no just quick yeah yeah from where we came from [Music] 100 on the bad guy this thing caught me all right last guy hit 400 red in the in the storm uh gold helmet here you you know you would be the guy that likes uh the gold p 20 20 too you're you're single fire shot it's actually pretty insane very impressive i honestly when we were in that building of the day i was watching it back the way like when i when i do for a laugh when i do this with the flatline i'm doing it i'm shooting with my thumb and i tense oh i've got ambles on so i can't even find that quick but honestly it really hurt i pulled the muscle genuinely that's hilarious it's so funny by the way i'm actually convinced in each bomb when you kill somebody how many is it every time we wipe a team we get them it's kind of true i knew you'd be happy with it i knew you would you and chicken you and chicken are the two guys that were like i could just pick your love in that gum it's got a fire rate cap on it i feel like i could fire the flatline quicker that's pretty fast that's that's not the p20 he's got a fire right cap on it you could go faster like this is ridiculous it's yeah you could do faster if there was no cap yeah it's annoying drug game is really annoying for that stuff call of duty 5 world of war don't if you remember they had so many single shot rifles on that game but if it detected you firing over a certain limit it put a really hard limit on how fast you could fire your guns really yeah and i i could find them like way quicker than the limit allowed you to and it sucks i'm wondering oh oh god i need them this is gonna be a big name that goes you have a goal knocked down he did okay hold on listen let's see if we have the dude i see one of them i see one right there too you know what i didn't hear i didn't hear it so if you're close to three again maybe it's whatever it was yeah it could be maybe we're just killing too many people jenks all right let's go straight go straight into it give your name yeah one there's one on the diving board once horizon he landed behind us yeah we threw an eight in here i love the patch [Music] he's coming over to me i think oh we traded we tried we tried to trade he's back he's back he's back oh he's learning how to play austin oh yeah that's the best i thought i heard somebody walking to the north yep me too hey how am i that's all you right now i don't have an arm he is uh 50 flesh 150 flesh there's definitely two i couldn't find him uh there is a spitfire in here if you are a spitfire kind of guy you know what i am content with my loadout i'm happy nice nice nice so am i i mean i've got no i'll pop syringe [Music] right honest oh this is wonderful one h oh scam is there any health deals on that one uh no but i have a few syringes you go thank you i love that dude it pops out i think it pops down whenever you kill a team like it goes over like dead corpses do you see i think so he's right that's what i've noticed we'll have to we'll have some mythbust it might be a coincidence that that's how it's working but i'm pretty sure i don't like horizon you got perfect one team here on the left as well pad for pathfinder for 100 that's dead nice wraith of 20 over on me it's got to be one more i think because there was a knock guy down here that i thirsty but i there was no yeah [Music] obviously you got a rider don't let her get away all right i've got his strengths oh no i'm coming nice thank goodness that's what i was trying to do and then i was you know you don't have an extended mag and you just yeah that one worked out good you got to keep the pressure on you know absolutely oh he had a phoenix for you if you want i should have 21 with stuff so i don't feel too bad though just turn around and shoot me in the face man those little sweat ball races all they want to run is horizon they nerf their they nerfed their race and then you just want to play their eyes man i'm honestly these last this last week i'm actually sick of it i'm sick of horizons that's my video yesterday i'm sick of it i missed p20 p20 p20 turbo you go check that one oh just see me i got hold on i almost tabbed out there's nothing worse than rocking up late to someone what do you think and then you see them finish the bat yeah the timing the timing is uh unlucky exactly it makes the game so much more interesting oh there's people flying to salvage oh someone just did this too someone's out there i'm between two teams by the look of it which way should i go uh i'll i'm gonna team up with you i'm gonna i can put this on top of this big i don't know if someone's up there already is anyone up there there isn't there isn't there is up nice there was two up here i saw them i cracked his teammate too but let me pop a little shields out i got the sticker mode on nice i hit one for white ruxin they're both in there mate they're both in there bloodhounds p20 they're coming across yeah yeah you're a little weak i have either had to get over there i heard it for uh oh he's got okay this is okay this is a fake p20 yeah no hammers no hammers but it's like it's got a big mag size on it no but this one has got hammers this is what this is what's confusing me i've had i've had like two versions of each of these i've eaten like the mosem and the p20 now i've had one with hammers one without i'm so confused all right your friend one coincidence or if they actually know it has to be they have to have done it on purpose it has to be on purpose because the uh what's it called okay i'm going to archive this and we can push across because the v2020 is not a gold gun this season oh yeah that's true that's someone here i'm choosing i think it was you come on come on yeah you're right you're decent no no no bro i think i heard somebody um yeah they got the they got the two versions they bought uh they got the beef with the nine rounds in it too yeah that's what that's what was confusing me awesome i was playing with zeus earlier and he had a lobo alt and when we would open the low but all there was so much hey there's somebody's diversions it was kind of sweet this guy's going to go for that box i think if you can send that guy back in the rebel i'll find out [Music] i hit him again with the knights and we can with the nade he's up top oh he's underneath the moment yes oh good that guy had to sell for us nailed that whole squad i'm gonna see if this guy's got a couple a couple extra shells i have to uh sell success oh thank you he sat there all right yeah do you not hear it when it falls down yeah another moment do you ever make a video back in the day of using the mlg air horn dude i thought everybody did anybody that's made a youtube video at some point has pulled out the air horn i've pulled out some names i'll pull out some some old names before so definitely pass this out by date i remember there was one video that you uploaded you had uh out of nowhere it completely caught me off guard i was not expecting i got clothesline by it x games yeah yeah yeah whenever someone does a wardrobe that's that's the only thing i think of every time oh that lock it going that was legitimate i think those two things every time really broke his octane [Music] he's still got a teammate somewhere oh that's a neutral who's throwing this stuff where the hell he was right here he fell off he went in the water i can't for you we got a runner he's trying to imagine oh just so we're clearing out just so you know this last team it's all you because i probably going to miss i'm not scoping it good luck rich uh i'm gonna pop a charge tower hopefully no one craves me [Laughter] i don't know how we're going to get him off there too i must say that's gotta be one of the most satisfying crabber shots to hit this is the tip of the head ah this guy's so good janks i'm just dark sorry i think he raised them up one jumped off yeah yeah they're both up there they went for 29 we can just take that high ground but that's going to rinse the other one all right oh my god [Music] [Laughter] [Music] i saw you fly past me on x games mode certified x games and just no scoping uh i was in sickle mode that was tremendous nice dude good game that was fun that was a lot of fun oh you dropped 16 in a 3k i was wrecking hammers where was i you may have nine assists jank so i mean
