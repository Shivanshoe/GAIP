here we supposed to treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some more war zone of course and again that I've got for you today it's a little bit slow in the mid game my word the end game is so action-packed there are 26 people going into one of the final circles and me and my teammates had one of the building tops I had a sniper and I was having a great time let's put it that way I've been really enjoying playing war son but I'm definitely gonna jump back on apex legends sooner off as well so hopefully you enjoy today's real if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the Empire and I will see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends are my friends we are here at the dam I have not landed at the dam this entire time please there we go there's no brain my ankles down on that floor I've not lands did before I've landed at boneyard about 74 times I would estimate but never the dam so it's a bit of exploring need to do it here we go if you can remember where these little chests are you're laughing here we got an old p9 section as well pigma scrapping my teammates in the gulag at the moment which is unfortunate Mabel sent to the kool-aid they'll fight for it it's a bit of a risk oh I knew it's a priest I knew was it now I'm in the goo like - I'm gonna wanna be one more team right here yeah I get it I'm captured I know I don't straight you know pounding okay he's nice bunny hop nerd star will be toxic love be toxic hey listen I've lost a fan for you of those today it wasn't toxicity he was just happiness that's all it was my team was still around Jesus Christ on the roofs reckon this is the showing you don't know where you're landing because Oh God is getting to the chopper I broke your shields ISIF you know that he's the literary making an escape right now there's not much I can do I can't use their chopper with that turn little pistol you may have some Lutie for me all dead body okay that may be my team actually you piece of armor arm is my favorite thing to find I mean you can buy five armor plates for 1500 per user absolutely nothing on this game but you need to find a buy station but early on in the game finding armor is tremendous I need to find now he's a decent or weapon and we'll be on our way I've got two kills the goo like what they want actually counts as a kill which is pretty cool for what it's worth I guess I mean I guess I did kill someone how do I get this game is half parkour 1/2 FPS that's what I feel like it's like mirrors edge meets Call of Duty so I could leave this thing blowing up top or gas mask I'll be taking them off your hands if you haven't used that yet automatically applies when you're in the ring in the zone and it protects you from I think it's about 10 seconds I wish you saw it on this game because the zone hurts and you can't you can't really heal yourself did I say here I mean he'll you can't replace your health that's putting that way I thought much I can do about that at the moment I'm afraid there's a fire behind us as well that's like further towards the edge of the map though that's it's close close mm-hmm I can eat you somewhere but the good fight ended and it's a lot of a lot of buildings yeah I don't know if wanna rock up this late because the gunfights already over I'd much rather go to the air at the airport if possible I mean I know it's further away but this is the edge of the map and if we push that too much then we won't see anyone for 15 minutes afterwards is that all no he's shield this shield us in Seattle yeah I'm not surprised he's not peeking again that guy's absolutely terrified after that look I heard of Rangers leading the open this is I'm praying that this guy doesn't have a sniper he's gonna take his revenge on me here I had a shotgun and a basic assault rifle I need to get enough money to call a loadout drop-in and then I can get my load at drop which is gonna decked-out kilo and a decked out HDR sniper and then we're fine enemy UAV overhead I mean always had enough money to buy off I'm $100 off been out to buy UAV I think is I would like to know if that's if that notification only pops up if the personally called the UAV is nearby or not because I don't care if someone across the map is called the UAV that's a humongous scrapper to Paris on this game it's probably further away than it sounds and the UI v doesn't actually last that long oh that is a nursing death bison a little bit of SMG action here well okay we're boarding the plane I'll sure I'm allowed on with my current set-up contract started alright now got to get the supply bins and I get three of them and then we get two grand and then by the time we do all of that we probably have enough to call in our load at all last night the warden it's okay this gun I've tried it before yes sine it's nice it's okay it's not the greatest it's not as good as my load eight but I wanted to hold on for tonight how many UAVs these people have good grief alright here's the plan there's a buy station right nearby this is the final contracted law bin thing to open up bit of stopping power now we've got ten grand load a drop in mind I don't even see that on the map though so I don't think I can guys that one probably has to buy my own one here unfortunately I have atronics I need to remember I think so nine ran something alright it's only six okay okay scams no one killing what's on mas I'm going for this listen I got the greatest load outs on this game I've got the cerulean which is the key though and he shoots blue lasers and I got my HD I sniper as well I think I may have even seen two of them to be honest hopefully they do not hear me because if they get the high ground here I'm what is commonly known as screw Magritte I think the Thomas it was definitely two of them our friend [Applause] Schatz broke right through the car he's running all over the place all right the only issue I have here is that obviously when you shoot on this game you show up is a red dot on the radar and this guy I would assume as some teammates nearby there's some ladders up top I've got a plan I was going to get high ground they're probably gonna expect me to either stay back with the sniper or maybe you can try and rush consider I took his shield off here we go I'm hoping they haven't moved too far my teammates are too close for the looks of things when I got split up because of that contract though it took me all over the place yeah I think I was a backed up terrified this guy absolutely petrified the dead bodies disappear that's the thing like it could give me a bit of a notification if they only disappeared like a minute or so we know people have been around here oh my god okay now I concentrate see cuz the shrubbery someone's bride beneath is a small team is called the you a theme which is key here that's a full team that's the squad wipe they were fighting people over this way though I'm gonna head that way just for just for a loot I guess to be fair I have five armor plates full armor below the police there's not many things that I would need right now but sometimes I have like a kill streak or something they could have been carrying up a cliff to strike or a UAV for example and they both find people over this way and I tell you what I want to get involved so I am being shot oh I've no idea what I was even doing from how much cash you got two grand nice not bad I've been spotted okay think it's a drone I think they're using a drone on me here it's gonna hide because the spots actually tracks you through buildings now they've got a UAV oh god I'm being tracked as well there's a bounty on my head right here they get like two or three thousand pounds if they if they men should take me out no Nicholas you're striking us that's definitely us isn't it look at these right now building breathe these people want us dead so bad hey friends they can maybe Scott Clara I think I'd let you just hit them both as one Dame sniping this game Isolde fun wait which building was he it's always the old gun pop out and I think it's gonna stand up I think he's kneeling are they firing a good movement I just miss those shots do I another drone it's a drone yes it eats look at this man look at him go he's droning it up I don't think mighty Knights have long-range have long-range guns because they're not they're not even challenging and he's behind these guys have been pushed out by the zone seen I say we protect this way you should be able to shoot do that I don't think I should have spied implement when you get spotter like they tells you yeah it tells you you've been spotted so of course not gonna stand still okay all right well what's great Eastside over this way apparently and now I've got no armored plates left if these guys are all scrapping if you're still looking at me it's a absolute travesty headshot and I'm being slide from across the way and I have no place left I think if I get sniped I'm pretty dead yeah that's not even white challenging I need to try and finish the kill on this guy and I need to try and take his loot with no armor plate I mean my teammates got reduced armors Volvic so maybe they're struggling too okay I'm on single fire mode lefty Pat here we go nice um a teammate support is possible he was only down still okay so he was in sat and I've seen that these guys were teammates but he was getting shy in the back please don't shoot me and please have some gosh-darn armor plates the man had none my teammates a hero to cover me be careful this guy was getting shot at we're all bad I need up I'll play it's beautiful I want one singular arms plate you can request if there there we go if you guys have any spare its follow me it's Danny still oh absolutely hero this guy eats thank you friend there's more I have the greatest teammates in the game yeah look at that I appreciate that because now we're going to the end game I can't really make it to one of those by stations to buy more armor I feel like you should be able to carry more armor plates though IRF you should be able to carry like ten it's it's only putting you on even footing with other people at the end of the game not having armor at the end of the game is is horrendous to say the least so at least I got three now I just got to focus on my gain shot out yes it's all 26 people left stop firing my teammates hey back it up head shot him unfortunately I can't really finish the kill but there's more people this way I want to get shot so that's the only problem oh if I'd have grenade I'll be able to nade up there and maybe even try and finish the kill but I got c4 I'm not strong enough to lob the c4 cost that across the road unfortunately we've gone back to our building this is this is the building for this zone I think I feel like we got extremely lucky with the safe zones here so yeah Ram - thanks a plane not gonna have to finish the kill on the freight we all have to move here in a second unfortunately and these guys are safe in this building we've got to try and move when when something's going on I think there's I mean there was an airstrike at the moment but it's not Rudi near this building unfortunately 20 seconds left I haven't challenged for a while I think they know Venator challenge I've taken their head clean off twice after just up top you just try and rush and gain side as nothing I could do for your friends that's a fixed one okay can't be one guy up here unless you had double self revive which is impossible I don't think these guys still fighting I'll cave in neither of those shots he did they don't shine it back that's a full team I guess he had itself revived now I'm at that's my first victory on this game my friends I'm in pain this all day all day hours and hours but oh my god sniping sniper on this game it's so unbelievably fun and so powerful then I feel like the start in the middle of the game I sort of just like a warm-up you know you're trying to earn enough money to get a few UAVs of you a loadout drop or two for your team but then the late game is where the real action happens there's like there were 26 people going to that final circle day well not done not a final final so but one of the end circles 26 people good grief don't kill Santa please I don't know actually had an incredible event however how many people did ice knife and then they got a revive how many people hundreds I would estimate honest I reckon about maybe even just one hundred to be honest 13 kills four thousand and sixty seven damaged timox coming with the total of four kills then they were I don't think we've been a game if they don't drop me those armored plates they drop the armored plates I had nothing left and we came back and we won the game that was beautiful thank you so much watching I do appreciate it that was my first ever win on warzone but yeah thanks for watching I see war the next one [Music]
