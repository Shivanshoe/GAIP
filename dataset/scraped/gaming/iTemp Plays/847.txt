Hey whatcha got to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back in the ranked mode and the reason we are back is because I left ranked mode I hadn't played it for a little while maybe a week or two and we were extremely close to getting an apex predator like extremely close and I've got two game planes for you here today these aren't my best gameplays ever but because we are so close to a FX predator it won't really make sense just to show you our look I made it without showing you the games that led to it so hopefully you enjoyed if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join our template and on a sea wall in five and half seconds my friends are a larva C series my friends people are already dying before we've even landed I tell you what I actually don't mind usually I'd be borderline devastate gladder because it means you've just landed in the corner of the map which is definitely we've just done but because he traits and because I I don't care about getting low skills name i I just want to get predator to be on CD I'm getting a little bit tired of rants this season because of the the glitch that means that people can not lose any RP and still be in diamond and even predator if they've grinding enough if there's no punishment for them eventually they're gonna have a decent of game and it just means that some of the players I've had on my team of just finger to be fair bake dashboard whilst I was in their game too so I didn't take any punishment for it but it's just it's been a bit of a waste of time to be honest again it's been a bit of a strange experience so hopefully just get some decent placements points up and lick a few kills here and there and then we're well on our way tape expects that's the dream that's the goal oh gee seven Scouts I'll use you so much I've got to smg's I mean I could try and just get up in people's faces I've been living the prilae recently as you guys know I mean I don't know actually maybe that was a mistake leaving it behind it's a g7 scale and it's Frank there all right this is a sign yeah this is definitely a sign I'm sorry powder I'm the big Prowler fan but in ranked mode you definitely need like a long-range option otherwise you're screwed the group does they say that's what they say there we go what's my sights always drop on the most random like I don't send why after time I'm gonna get cited for this in the comments first five extra bullets on a g7 scale is worth more than I'm pretty sure it's two extra bullets in a 999 like on if it was a blue extended line mag I've put up on the line tonight or purple on is well but level one definitely not definitely on the scope is gonna stupid gracias amigo thank you very much appreciate it not really sure that he's in Spanish I haven't got a clue my team that has a vault key though it was tempting to leave the shield mines just because I will probably get that one from the vault are you I'll just use the ability then Charlie the least athletic robot and you've ever seen yes we're going to this fight instead I thought were going to the close one maybe it's already been loose each I don't know what do you mean no well if you'll say no I'm going to speed off into the sunset I'm gonna get myself level full body shot there we go that's good right let's go to self level four which means that there we go there's two level three that's fine then I needed just said Lutie bug routed that would be that won't make any sense screw the group works but looted the protein I'm not sure that's gonna catch on I'm not sure screwed McGruder's caught on either he's not exactly sweeping the nation but thank you boys I see what can try you know am I going to put it work out first look how low that is look how I always get comments look how high in the sky you have to aim for it to go where you actually want it to go by the way I know I always get comments saying you're aiming too high absolutely not okay what's an aiming high enough go went all the way to the respawn chip I mean if I wasn't messing about trying to show how high you have to aim get turnaround frames back it up which was one shot which repulsive a fun tweet machine man what I'm trying to do is kill some off respawn leave me alone an honorable honorable robot that's not led my friend doing the thing Lord no shields or blitz very low brawler hasn't shove it up for lesson one else boxing I'm not sure this is where you need the escape in in ranked I'd better just run over to these guys otherwise we'd be proud that's a bit of a waste please send it across not behind this rock it's hard to risk it the risk is paid off the same one just finishin to kill fairies I thought I heard so what my food chin out up top on the rocks it's the world's fastest Gibraltar don't you dare steal my kill yeah that's an asteroid making free time today I'll kill credit for that Gibraltar it would have been an absolute tragedy if I hadn't I've taken the shield off like three times next time to get the race you tried to steal my kill so a separate team can email it you need him an attempt to use the gold knock down I guess because to be honest with you if your teammates on up unable to defend you or at least distract it's fairly useless we've got knockdown shields you're just dying and you just get tea-bagged two hours doing the animation this isn't goodbye oh right we're gonna push quite a storm here these guys have stolen our hide range don't get hit too much not the storm right behind us must be mighty Matt I thought I heard someone my friend got on in here oh my god do chá Raptor is that fully what's up oh my god Meg I should have got the powder that was affluent of private system that's Mary George unbelievable scenes here give his one shot oh my god I'll and some hipfire that's that may be the first time ever burns that's me oh I'm trying to lick on this much else please don't ah if they only had Blue Shield's anyway I'll to taalib over this way much one's sneaking after it but I only got one assist for that I must that must have done the Mirage I did some damage it did you brought two though my snake some don't punch me again I'll show a few or not I did a decent man's damage need to heal though so between teammates no no that is not a good idea oh the teammates there that should be I think I've died did not expect someone to the other time I think she's just gonna call not down mind the doctor teammates I didn't really do too much that fight you mess up Adobe's a cement snipers messed up I didn't roads that someone's gonna be up top I mean that the strategy the star was just to get some poke damaging their because I knew my teammates are rushing up and I know that I could just she'll battery and get back in the fight great to de-spawn guy Craven so what was it so far away I think it might just be one guy craving us but yet fiendish off the initial plan was was decent I messed up good grief if we think is if this was a guy with a child rifle a dig machine with like a sniper scope on it I'd be more scared you'd probably do more damage to me right now all right I'm sorry for the disrespect okay I won't say I won't dese you ever again cray Batman looks likely we've all got Scouts got one for top team I said tech move as if I'm taking a suppliant this guy's scream agreed to follow chance it's got blue shields to find me thank you three times at close range Timothy says thank you very much [Music] thank you for the fun fight good game slow start but first I honesty I don't care in ranked anymore I don't care that's how that's how it should be really you're not gonna heart drop every single game you'll end up losing too much I'll RP just off that three kills but 1400 damage I didn't get the two assists honestly may have even been like four assists if we if we had that new rule in place possibly even five a bunch of Arpita but on the way to predator here all right friends skyscrapper d it's not sure it's gonna be skyscrapper today though because i have flown pretty much the length over here we will land in the corner again if he's turned out to be a good game and you turn out it turns out that you guys actually watching these this is the game after we've just won so we are currently 340 points away from apex predator and if you get a win with five kills Anestis combined you get hundreds enter seven is that action enemy is there someone here what I'm trying to say is I am two wings away from apex predator so if we can get even a solid game here a decent game I'll be happy I can go through the door actually finding there shouldn't be doing this those blue fields Rudi shouldn't be doing this as a Gibraltar with purple shields that man has over 300 health right there if you combine these 15% damage reduction with the 75% or so ten five damage ADF shield here's got far more health than you boy in Miami I got some mr. Needham urgently I'll drop him opposed these these aren't really accessible but there's a scrap going on my teammates over there I really should have jumped up top we love my family stand to her is that everyone I do after Ness another team I'll do the roofs up shooting someone sounds like he's dead that's the last that's quite all right I messed that up entirely that's what I'll tell you what that's why I don't like the long but because I get so distracted or visions trying to work trying to just shoot one guy trying to snipe someone but I don't think my back was so vulnerable then we had the race behind us and then we had the Gibraltar up top as well but it was I think there's a pathfinder actually turned it behind me so maybe he just grappled up top and there's nothing they could do that's what I find it is that's Pat fine to do Pat part of things being even get a single assist outta absolutely tragic we're still alive thank you to my beautiful teammates if they're a an enemy though that's the question we need to be asking ourselves I mean I've got no reason to not believe you I hope it's an enemy ship mate don't be cheaper nice oh okay we popped a squat the squat has been successfully bobbed I had to run away because I don't have an extended mag for my online tonight I honestly don't think it's possible unless I lunge every single shot so that head shot or something to down someone it's got purple shields without an ex a Mac I mean it probably is it properties but it is pretty difficult and then as soon as I heard the Peacekeeper that's how to get out of it because that's a good you don't need to reload you know you get six you get six bumps you get six attempted E and if that's not enough then you screwed up along the way I didn't even get an assist for that got injured I should have checked the box of wine I'm fine teammates don't worry about me didn't even get an assist frustrating your boy needs all the RP can get what am I doing with a hemlock I had a wingman had a wingman and an island tonight the true season zero season one setup that's as fast tell you what because I've got no kills or assists I am extremely if I hear something I might just pathfinder over to it even if it's stupid I don't know I don't trust myself is it okay that's a separate sniping people I'm on the way you know what I just said I hear your friend there's the ginormous crap oh my god mom once I look at the sweets comes my makeshift reports miss need anyone I thought oh he's going to find me no weights that full team this guy's not showing his tail there you go I didn't I didn't heat one shield there and somehow now I've got three kills hopefully my teammates would have got some assists for that I'm not sure thickness my teammates or not I'm not sure if it's my team that's what I do shop tonight they just came out fight like this is definitely the play on getting crowded at the same time it might be a long boat and it's I need to defend my teammates from up top we take how much damage fine I've got I got I got shot by the other team I got third party I think I would have been all right up there because I could have just dropped down anytime I got triple took it in the back other teams are fighting to the dough this is looking good my enemy let me just quickly grab some he levels I might need them teammates careful friends that's definitely a crater by the way crate with versus hemlock who's gonna win why have I got this guns still severe hemlock when I trained to get our big trouble Sandman Blotz I need one more Cecil kelp please for maximum points we pretty much won just give me the kill that storms cooking in from that storm is cooking this man can call me that full health [Music] well it wasn't pretty that's pretty one of my worst performances I mean I've had I've had games where I've just died off the start but in terms of in terms of wings in diamond that may be the worst one I've had but possibly one of the most importance they the difference between having teammates that are competent and can cover you when you mess up and teammates that should really be in the ranks to be honest with you I was playing like I shouldn't really be and I'm drunk a hundred damage five kills got lucky with those five kills as well all of them came at the end of the game I had one go to kill with a single fire hemlock I'm taking that all day I'm taking that always the bank that is another 177 RP my friends are well getting extremely close to apex predator name five kills zero assists 177 RP we are 160 RP away from apex pro so we are one win we five complete combined kills and assists away from the top ranked we finally nearly done it I'm not gonna get ahead of myself I could demote down to bronze 3 but shares a mighty much for that last game didn't deserve to win but we still beat I'll take it
