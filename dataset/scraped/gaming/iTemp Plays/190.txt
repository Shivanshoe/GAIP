hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course in the background here i am showing you some of my ranked gameplay that i didn't really talk much over uh so what i've done is i've deleted my live commentary because it was nothing i barely talked uh but i still wanted to show you this game because it was actually pretty good now i've got a few things to talk about whilst this is going on first of all i've been away all weekend it's currently 9 p.m on a sunday um meaning that i probably won't have enough time to make masters however i've been very happy with my progress in solo diamonds basically i've had a ton of wins vast majority of my games i'm going positive rp i'm climbing and if i had a little bit longer or if christmas time was a little bit less busy i definitely could solo to masters and with the new split coming up maybe i'll start a little bit earlier next time i was more interested this season because it's on the new map i wanted to see how it was on ranked and also it was great to play storm points on ranks rather than public games because i got to explore more of the map there were gunfights in more areas it went down to the wire so much more often it's just more interesting when you have that new map experience on ranked in my opinion another thing i wanted to talk to you guys about this video or at least this little introduction that i'm doing is whether or not i should focus more on ranked next split because i always start so late what tends to happen is it gets to like midway through the split and i get a little bit bored of public games there's been no updates nothing but rank sounds pretty fun right now it gives me something to do it's an extra challenge it gives the games more substance it feels like and then i don't really give myself long enough to get to the rank i actually want to achieve so should i focus on that more do you like the rank content on the channel uh should i do like 50 50 or should i just stop all together and you prefer the public games like i used to do because those also have their own merits in terms of me being able to just talk to you guys more often be a bit more silly try different things apes uh so i think both personally i i'd like to try and do both more of like a 50 50. and the game that i have for you today i didn't get a ton of kills i did get some good kill crit and i got a lot of damage in there as well but the reason we were is because my teammate was playing valkyrie and valkyrie in ranked i know that a lot of pros been playing valkyrie recently uh she's completely broken in you can just rotate wherever you want every single circle if there's a mountain in the way it doesn't matter if you're getting put down a choke point in the little tunnels which are frequent all over storm points it doesn't matter you can just fly right over the top you see where people are with velcro's passive and you just take one of the buildings that you think is safe it's so much better you probably get rp a lot more consistent with this strategy and i played a lot of different legends this ranks a bit with valkyrie actually it wasn't one of them now this is the final thought that you're watching i've just absolutely murdered that race i'm not really sure what she was doing but i picked up the wingman hadn't really used it too much recently but i destroyed her life and out of three on two uh it was eventually going to push them off the roof but we would have had to go into the open far more sooner or far sooner than they would have had to so they've really messed up pushing when they did we capitalized i'm pushing with my vault i got the blood hand scans coming in and it's another victory for team temperature unfortunately as i said didn't really do too much of a live comp for this particular game but i've got one coming up so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends no not a storm catcher or this i don't think they did oh they get there so quick they were fast unbelievable speeds hello i've got an evo shield here it's cool level two all right so a lot of people over that way in the middle of the map no one else i might just move these cobins okay we've got gold armor two lip two blues we're laughing flatline evolves gold knocked down okay we really are laughing the command center now of this i was going to take a chill get the beacon craft some bats but we're looted gold double blue i've got flatline faults our teammates must be looted if they if they want to play aggressive you the know on the ropes oh god is that like they're on the ropes as in oh you know they're struggling or does that mean they're on the ropes like they're going up top i'm going i'm so slow i'm not here i'm still please please rp please kp one of them is really really weak we'll almost have blue armor that knock me off isn't that was him i thought that was a decoy i'm the new kill leader trust me oh wait valkyrie must have done the thing before i left oh it could have been blood out i think all three of us can right can't put him do it he's a recon legend i have absolutely no idea i don't know anything about this game under fire firing scanning the area reloading let's check this quadrant oh my god if i down the ash i think we could have pushed her but i can't really talk whilst i'm playing because i have to reach up and press t on my keyboard otherwise when i'm talking to you guys everyone can just hear it and that's not good i need help myself i am taking fire friends nice job team i'll try to cancel the bats recharging fields i need at least one of them completely out oh my god i'm struggling on an engine i want to switch out i can drop in my 90. could just pk should be fine got my three kp didn't get a kill there but it's honestly absolutely fine big two uh energy in there actually not that weird when ranked extended he's got 6kb i have three they're padded away i have seven bats if anyone needs some i got that one minute it's good oh my god there are four of them why are there four people there i hate not having like long range if i had a charge rifle i'm telling you charge rifles are so broken even a rampage to be honest maybe i could just switch if there's one here i know in that way the pros wouldn't be just that idle i need 14 damage for red and i have zero kills baby it's not worth it oh my god a little bit too far we could probably navigate these rocks though and that's gonna reach amigo they're shooting someone behind them it's not definitely not worth rushing let's have a look she my teammates recharging shields they trying to get on the roof cracked me again giving my shields hey we defended that great that that uh rooftop just op unbelievable just firing down and everyone with the flat line that's where the flatline is good not these long ranges i've been fighting at three teams are fighting i think there's a solo octane in this lobby because they just kept padding is that him that guy might be uh he might be solo that octane i don't know he keeps padding everywhere first let's get to here and scan big idea okay is that two that's a two right there we could play around the ring is nearby this is a decent spot they're not gonna they have to come out the side i think yeah that is inside oh they got front doors should i shoot him i'm gonna get crabbing in the head aren't i how much of a maintenance have to be to uh scan that beacon i'll do it for five pounds it's on paper tell me five pounds right now i'll do right now all right we're looking good decent positioning pretty much max kp i think i think the only way the only way i'd get more kp here is if one of the kills i've had is like platinum and i can replace with the diamond i think you can go up to seven or something i don't know how it works i need to break the patch notes there's at least three people missing from this lobby ah what the heck was that jeez hurts i think the only full team is on the left there are three in there right not two no two spotted let's check this quadrant that goes on the roof i don't have all the heavy am in the world recharging shields i missed everything i missed everything well played guys i i missed everything i played i suck at the pk i'm telling you if this was a massive i'm telling you i'm telling you i'd have at least hit 11. at a minimum with a peak i'm missing with a mastiff i'm hitting 11's all day it's better than nothing quite a good team there valkyrie came in clutch maybe i need to play valkyrie those rotations are just clean like unbelievably clean still two two kills seven assists 2100 damage i did so much damage in that second to last fight though so i'm happy with that another one for the collection it wasn't pretty but it's in the collection
