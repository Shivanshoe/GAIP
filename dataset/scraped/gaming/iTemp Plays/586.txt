hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have been having a particular frustration whilst playing this game recently i'm sure many of you have the same experience as well it's being scanned 83 times per game every game they nerfed bluetongue a little bit but after about 12 successive buffs their scans are just dominant people love to sit back and scan you every eight seconds for a wall hack for their entire team but i have found the counter it's revenant it's so fun to play because i just leave my silences everywhere you get two of them now so you can even cut off doorways and choke points by leaving one there if you wanted to i guarantee if you're a bloodhound who is altered there is no worse feeling than getting silence for 20 seconds now you're just a fast character with a black and white screen who's making so much noise that ever on the map can hear you it's a genius tactic and it works beautifully and i have two games for you today and i hope you enjoy both of them if you do be sure to subscribe and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends at least you don't see anyone inside the map at least we can just bloom tower right i'm literally looting one side and then i'm like i'm out yeah yeah yeah i'm looking like these three i have two all-stars elsa squared i have a vault let wow your big head i'll block it with my big head yeah your big head blocked my my pad my skullet face it sounded like i just hit a big whole thing of metal that was like something like that yes metal head uh i guess horizon are not horizon uh what is it lab sorry or whatever it is yeah seven six five four ah nice might go through the tunnel right here what the oh my god what was that oh

just kept jumping i don't know what you need to do let's just mark someone i don't know who he's marking there their balloon tower they're blowing town to us it's honestly fine are you going that way no i'm just trying to i'm trying to use the pad so i can get rid of the gosh maybe no it's yeah it's like you can double jump it doesn't actually do anything nice this way and once more they're just

in the game and then oh then you have to hear looking around the wrong angle i guess i thought that always happens to me but i'm playing with you by the time i've like put two shield sounds on a scene i'll forget that revenant and just sprint at the same time yeah you just it's good i think i feel like it's really good for healing your volt is kind of nasty it kind of is this firing right this way

there nice nice play but we actually had a good game dude finally you are the apex you just look at each other and not straining each other the strength is too good that was kind of it was kind of you're kind of fine that was a good game nice okay don't land do not land at this door it just goes outside there's a lot of loot right yeah there's loads of loot there yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay this goes to the other side of outside oh it's a purple what the door i told you why yeah i landed at the door and i just got a purple and that's outrageous a gold wingman wow are you welcome this middle spot has a lot of lead oh is that where i should be landing so i don't land here often i mean i don't know i just i don't land here often either but every time i've landed in the middle i get really good loot okay well i'm not gonna land there when i'm playing with you but i'm playing with the people i'm gonna steal that spot okay i'm gonna borrow around that's good uh if you've seen mastiff please let me know i have a blue shark involved or if you have one i can drop you a blue bomb wow you just saw heavy ammo didn't ping it for the guy that thing's asking for heavy ammo i don't hear i don't hear voice lines i there's something in my brain that oh oh there you go yeah hold on i don't hear it i tune out the i tune out the voice lines uh yeah it's fair enough often times especially when you're playing horizon you sort of have to are they craft no there's no crafter here i just saw no i think it was a loba oh maybe yeah i don't know what it is but i've tuned out like voice lines so i don't hear him anymore oh right in front of you oh yeah aren't you in full uh 40. he's broken the other one's really laggy like super laggy oh my god they are oh they all sound like down the laggy person i didn't touch this other one oh man this way all the energy the three purple evos off the purple shield and i'll just run to the fight brawler let's go i took a race i took a risk they're fighting in depot where are you running to a fight too they're fighting turbine yeah okay i'm going here i'm going here they're getting pushed this way too from the storm so oh i have a load out of that crawler we men nice that's kind of crazy and he doesn't even use heavy name obviously it's a care back weapon so yeah this guy has to be one shot and he's definitely going to talk to me there's no way he's not coming this way that emp oh that was indeed i have my alt i will throw it at something one in the back is one shot i think surprising i'll take yours oh dude i haven't even used the prowler it's actually popping off i've never hit so many wingman shots in my entire life you're a changed man now you're going to be looking for in every game i really am in contact no i cracked him i cracked him no i cracked him no it was me who did that no it was me i actually think he wants you to be fair i him a lot but i didn't get that crack noise which is just um i i mean i hit him for flash for 45 so oh okay don't get bamboozled all right all right he's just crouching that way yeah whenever you crouch and you send it out it's so weird he just like crab walks like is anybody gonna fall for that i don't know i've got my little i call them it's like having a pet hold on i always try to i always try to send him out and then keep him like keep him with you and just run around with him it's one of our friends like a team of four it's hard sometimes oh there's a team on me whoa my decoys had a burst of speed just absolutely demolish me in a race what is going on over there i'm gonna racing my oh good oh she's actually one did i get a no wreck i'm so sad hold on girl train some 90s nice crack some 90s he's trying to res me i have to go back and look at that i don't know if i just potato or if i know rigged because one of the two is definitely one of the two uh be careful right here last time we were both running these parts we just jumped off the map the world's best opening you jumped off the map no i saw it i never jumped off the map i have no clue what you're talking about you slept you saw i had a great four kill start absolutely destroying everyone and you were just you wanted to reset because you thought this guy might beat me and damage this game and you couldn't have that i mean it never happened so i mean it did happen because the game ended there because i threw myself off the edge of the cliff too that's that's how good i am yeah but you saw me do it and then you did it in the same spot so what does that really say got basically you have death box you literally went to the same spot and jumped off i was i was so confused as to what happened i thought you just left the game i was like there's no way he just left the game after getting all those kills i mean i'm a good liar too so you were just bamboozled that's why i'm playing mirage because my art of deception is just next yeah if you could if you could talk in this game you would definitely win i'll tell them i love there but i'm not over there hey i'm over there proximity chats i'm gonna send out my army of decoys so they think there's a team of six russians it's just a team of six mirages running now yeah yeah yeah yeah they're porting or something they're porting i'll be there eventually oh my god oh my god what is happening i'm okay come on decoys dancing where are you oh my god are you allowed up there oh no it has to be done it is kind of i cracked i just absolutely melted his face off that sounds close and she's burning oh my god i didn't get a single one of those kills not one yeah i i just look i guarantee i have all the damage i guarantee because you thirsted everyone no because i was cranking wean man shots left and right what do you mean you're cranking wingman shots and i'd say i was cranking 90s that's a good question he was cranking 90s dude long girl no yes yes wow fine every time i say something about damage you actually out damage so glad so glad that worked out but he was good i kind of was
