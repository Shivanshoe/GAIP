hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing ash who is the next legend that i want to master i want to perfect my ash gameplay now she's actually so good that she gets used in the professional leagues however my ash isn't that great i think the ways i need to improve are to combine my ability with throwables because if they can't escape the arcs are then they're kind of screwed and also need to figure out the timing on her ultimate because the amount of fails i've had with her ulti is outrageous and it's the same sort of process as pathfinder he's ultimately a little bit weird too but i've got the hang of that i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them but thank you for watching i'll see you all five and a half seconds me amigos stream i mean they got crazy if it goes in the care path you know let me drop it through this flatline that i just found out superior positioning someone got the party started what is he doing i don't know i think she i think she thought that the maid was going to stop me from shooting us from shooting or maybe the guy's here reloading behind us maybe he's going to get this blue yeah that's that's the team hit the vodkas chasing you i'm not with you at all i'm safe i just gotta patch myself up i'll go back yeah they went back to the streamer all right i think i still won my building it's an octane right i think i love it too no where's the logo yeah i would just take that ulti i don't know any seems like a common occurrence it's happening a lot lately i have [ __ ] one of them oh i got a havoc i'm down a barrel something throw my grenade nice yeah sure there's another team i think i'm not oh my god it's funny it is in the door another team over here um i have no shields yeah i see ourselves yeah i got one that's it is that what they call you you call me the one but she's pushing she's on the roof is she's dropping it no she's at the very top on the stairs now huge i i don't know i don't know what's happening she's gonna try and stick i think oh man i survived on that health lady i'm popping syringe holding a sec like now again repairing somewhere there's a lot of bodies right here nice nice one sitting in a corner and you still miss all your shots they'd be sick if they knew how much health i was on they should have just shot me who's that oh they're down there hey he saw that kill that idiot are they just here one's close yeah with the team here's the team i'm not with you i'm shielding opening fire is i don't know are you really top 750 i was a one point 120th in the world for this meeting i just don't even know what does that even mean smithing uh i was crafting a lot of like what was i making i was making room two-handed swords out of like bars of metal and i was 120th in the world so you were 120th in the world for crafting bars of metal yes i spent basically an entire year crafting room two-handed swords oh to get 120 smoothing okay i've got a cape and it's got a particle effect at the bottom would you have put that on a resume it's it's it's at the top is that how you got accepted to your university yeah pretty much you just told them that yeah i didn't actually get the grace to go to uni because um i didn't turn up to basically what would be the equivalent of high school you're a bad kid weren't you yeah but i was bad but i was smart but i was bad you're bad but you're smart yeah it's not possible i've been down unacceptable what are we doing have we made it to first ring yet i don't know now we did one game we did one game we did okay i'm okay this is where we win winners pov only this guy's got at least blue armor dude sounds like he's right next to him i know it's really confusing what is this audio they're right below us i'm gonna drop down this side i'll come with you yeah now we're talking let's do this i can't see this is a good day the champion has proved unworthy of the name i'm popping a faint eh okay using the phoenix kit pop into phoenix recharge there's a blue armor down here i'm going to grab you okay path is broken nice the guys wing manny mate i'm pushing it's pretty scary i'm repairing damages oh i shoot it before i win there's a lot going on you know uh you can't ask me to shoot people and think at the same time that's what people get wrong though they they don't they never watch their own games back they don't realize they miss anything no one no one thinks they miss something you know this makes sense oh yeah it's always different when like you have people watching your gameplay yeah and they they assume that you want different stuff to them like when i'm using the sentinel they're like why didn't you craft a two to four so mate i can't even change the zoom on that i don't want it oh you can't i can get rolled yeah well you're an advanced hit have fun yes i've got a three times sorry about it thank you oh you can't toggle it use the dude i've dropped um heavy a lot of heavy weight where's my i got 300. i have the worst loader ever what i have a double tap like behind me here [Music] they're behind that truck i'm going to need the truck for you where are they i like her shield so i could get more damage are you kidding no you're cringe is this guy also got a goal knocked down what the heck he's all wow he's i guess i'm running out of ideas you just got wrong i realized uh i'm pretty sure there's a team over here there has to be because they were fighting that fragment hey come in a little bit behind i don't see anybody at home they might have gone around that's what they call me they call me a little behind a little behind it probably the worst rap name you've come up we've gone blind yeah i don't know oh yeah they said if they say first here enemy heard little behind us in the what's that area yeah yeah they're coming in for an autograph good one why are you aiming at him give him an autograph i could do i'll wait for you were just jumping about i don't even know if they crossed enemy don't let them slip away you just can't about it for him like a secret service please oh i banned him and cracked him in one oh that was fletcher yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you grapple they're both flesh they're both really weak why don't you go that way i don't know what he's doing cool we're close to the ring we have so else is there broken [Music] shield up you know what last time you waited for that guy to shield up and i ended up dying to a fuse i thought you were just waiting for this octane to shield up so i the the fact that i waited for him to shield up had nothing to do with the fact that you died because you got overruled and smoked no if you did that order no if you do that no that order if you just killed that guy i'd have known the fuse had a self raise has it happened so you died either way he was like 800 health i hit him for like a minimum 750 and he killed me so kind of got rolled and smoked oh i can easily [ __ ] behind us can you hit a portal right here no i'm gonna kill this guy i don't know right here you gotta come look no i know i know you all gotta hit a point over here there's no way you guys are going to just chill out over here the other one's like 30 health so there you go ball but yeah come on come here now you got it there's no way you actually okay you're that's see that's cringe that's cringe at unlucky still going to make it all right this thing's got to be zoned just chilling on a very tall blue on the bandits probably a charge rifle the babs it's little it's a little behind versus the babs oh my you're just like one of the backup dancers a little behind us no i don't think backup dancer would be kill either you're like a secondary uh i don't think backup dancer is rezzing you're not even in the credits oh that's crazy not even you're not in the credits i don't know like you're a supporter no you're just a fan oh they're going to get packaged i'm massive very good they've got to be up there right i mean yeah blue blue armor bandit blue one with bandy we don't have a band there's one hard rifle come on this this has to be two blue armors two blue armors [Music] [Music] yeah that's the big one that i was talking about [Music] oh bom i mean i didn't feel bad about that one no i'm not gonna be honest the boys got to fight you you guys got to fight you got to because then that's what happens um you like yeah you just have to because then you're gonna run into a team that is on discord calming it up yes double red out of their mind package guns like think of the advantage we have over them they have 75 shield we have 125 you know not bad not bad for a backup dancer i'll give you that that's bad but the main character love behind with the tennis east that's the importance that
