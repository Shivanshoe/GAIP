it was a guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex Legends season 5 of course and today we are playing a little bit of the most buffed character in the game I think ever Mirage now in season 4 all the way back to the style of game of ROG has never really been that good but to be fair to start the game he was kind of fun because everyone was new when they saw a mirage decoy koonak than they thought who is this man and they shot him like everyone was bamboozled me included but then he just wasn't good he wasn't he wasn't convincing now however he really is because decoys now last for 60 seconds and you can control them you can take them for a walk with with you you'll see in the video he's not just his ability that he's been buffed that much he's ultimate is now called a life of the party and it's described as being a mirage deploys a team of decoys that mimic his every move think back to the emergency dance party from the dummies big day event and the core down of at least 60 seconds and minutes for his ultimate and his passive unfortunately don't get to see this in this particular game or the two games that I've got for you today but in addition to being quotes when don't Mirage is also cloaked while using a respawn beacon and reviving a teammates and the teammates also quote he's also a tremendous support character I've had a lot of fun playing him and I'm definitely sure I'm gonna be playing him in the future as well for these sweet sweet bamboozles so thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alright I'm a solo Mirage on a mission just turd just a solo Mirage on a mission here at diving board just by myself actually I'm not by myself I'll just tell my decoys around the mat with me on my adventurous it'll still be a to be to give me this I'm pretty gonna need e let's be honest this might get rough I think this is where the scrap was the whole way French that was the chair that made the noise if you would if you're curious I did not expect you to be pushing that you are a certified lunatic and I say what I appreciate it I really do 60 there's gonna be Blue Shield's for you boy because I'm not sure how long I can 1v2 people with just level one I thank Sally a how do you get bamboozled that bad oh I've just made a mockery of you fat fighter that's not good whole squad ends this is a seperate teams this would be bad possibly two people not selling the fires got my pan like that No I've no throw walls on one word y'all turn SOP okay it's not as good as to scare at this range let's provide a friend to survive come on to survive let's reset Shelton's chill out please just revive you you can still see me you can still see me I thought the first would have helps out along be British playing League of Legends okay well if we need to army switch we can always come back in here for balloon we both played this horrendously so far but I'm very confident I can win this gunfight let's go friend that was 80 damage bearing are you going where you off to and his name is Mirage I have just used my ultimate to kill the Pathfinder and then once again to kill the Bloodhound it's a 60 second calling Karen mind Pathfinder's ability is a 35 second called a which is I'm not gonna get over that that's how they change it I'm very sad oh okay okay I know Rick Jack I can make my decoy wardroom I'm gonna test that one today what is this let me up boys he's good losing losing bees old no he's not going for okay not my shots goes into the den laughing okay he's got a personal shield I'm extremely fortunate that you were crouched never we're extremely fortunate but I'm not fortunate because I have my buddy's wedding to the dango the first time and in the second time the down guy pretty shielded it's rather in a nice language they're actually quite like the Scout knife that they did really difficult heat shots at range when they're sprints like that and that's the way it should be I'm fine like like ammunition if you want to do this you should be forced into using a sniper really it wasn't a season five nerf it's when they it was a little big actually when they change you so you have to I mean the light projectiles and with the Scout travel a lot slower so there you go way more difficult so yeah so I find with the cold chills actually yeah you can do that thinking about it a life long with the gold shield is Opie with the new changes ultimate I don't have to wait for this next team I think it's two teams of two all right just an update everyone was camping up top I couldn't get up top fortunately didn't end there there are still four people left on each team and one is directly above me I need them to start firing at each other knee their little tippy tap little feet in the sand shirin's closing in 10 my god there we go nice and he's got his bubble plant out my wood the team to come over and even to actually start fighting I've seen better come over nay [Applause] I'm right that's what we do anyway hi grant Adams Bremen rude I'm dead they're gonna kill me my only hope Rose was break hopping down and then I could have maybe tried to 1v1 you have got you guys are so you spent ten minutes not fighting anyone when I was the only solo guy that was a waste of my time I'm absolutely few minute you guys good I'm this guy leave me like that I'd need to set Mirage Mirage I'm so used to say Mirage followed by montage because I never played this little bamboozling man and there is someone in my building in my building knows there are four mirages in this building and only two of them are real one of them is on the ground now dent nice good job there's blue then you've seen it that's a shame all right listen if you're going to try and pick up Mirage into York it's my word this is some tremendous loot here into your like a player rotation or legend rotation one of the things you need to try and remember is to press down on the d-pad me to friends lets us get into the X crap here let's go tremendous blue for the side again same but we're good we're still pretty healthy than everyone else people are scrapping I press down on the d-pad to take control of your decoy and it acts the same as you which is far more believable it lasts for I think like 60 seconds which is a mental mental have tender blue shield right here which means they are pretty healthy you know serene joy my team I salute you come on friend there's a humongous crap going on in fact there may be two separate ones people have this way and people over here and I can't work out if they're foreign each other party perhaps Oh big big scrap going on at the one of the ultimate charge look like you someone I don't think these guns mean honestly I can still control the record fairly well considering its fully auto and stuff it should be somewhat weak already I no idea of what happens to the blue turns around I'm fairly certain it's a blue taken on a pathfinder he probably uses grapple but they've increased the pull down on it to 35 seconds absolutely ludicrous behave you trust me 35 second used to be 15 he'd mind and now it's 35 I just kind of believe it's over double I don't think I can play pattern here again I'm not sure it's even worth it man's bare like a fridge freezer a little while we finally made it set well I finally made it to safety team it's like him behind a little bit in a wingman shot for me thank you who is that escaped could be escaped follow me I hope you buy your Ottoman teammate cuz I'm very gonna need some help how much Tommy says that was there's a good amount Messer beer because markets right decoys can't claim so this is not a believable bamboozle no Rach no rape shields it appears as though this rate is by themselves which is unfortunate and I've got them on the ropes what are you gonna go name that will do though that will do nicely I'll see this guy was living the life all right unfortunately no one landed on our side of the map so we've had to spend half with this rhyme easing get across that I'm not sure people know who rainy sees its approach to the same as was his name Bear Grylls bed girls knee across the the wilderness here 15 people have one of them is getting respawn now these are bump the numbers up to 16 I should I should think if my calculations are correct come on teammate it's a freak girl never mind just chill just chill please don't fight I'm no need just be careful I'm coming he's firing this is fine it looks like he's still pretty far away from this crack he's still healthy wait let me take you for a walk watch this here we go there's my new my pet Mirage just come on with me hop over the fence so that loud there's a damn one of them please come over teammate she's run away finite Springs good job teammate that's my fault she must've been chillin in tiny log corner having a great time that have been an extra kill which is which would have been nice considering this isn't gonna be the thing it's all right I mean the bamboozler has been bamboozled you could say please don't say that I'll be very sad yes oh we understood let's go I said sit on this is feeling way too high I increased it unlike a the two times and above and he feels like I'm gonna start missing shots at least three times three seven here one here lefty so easy C's teammate was East as a solo guy never this way someone was fine over this way so I assume there's someone left taking my decoy in front of the walk I said Galt I'd come and get that but it's the end of the game testing can I go bamboozled what a find like does he walk if I know he literally just miniature actions bamboozled I think I think my decoy just happened to walk in front of me sir he's line of fire there that can't carry natural bamboozle he's feeling good fun righteous feeling real real good we all knew the the ultimate Wayne from the decoys gained under fire let me see we say I'll take a second no one will suspect that that is not me and I mean the care package and you know what the g7 the Buddhists do not travel that fast or whatsoever Oh hop over come on there we go I wasn't the charming it's an expat package are these guys are firing they'd better not want a boxing match sounds like time for this I'm not boxing you I'm sick I'm sick of boxing people me huh I'm well over the boxing video that's one of proper scratch it's good a gun we only scrap I'm interested in saris are four times ten times digital sniper threat you've you've just pinged on my screen yeah you know that's what make you very obvious then listen I mean if you were trying to get a stick box you but that's Lobo he's already got the high ground yeah all right what it's my two-times institution another no reg no registration on that families or friends I don't who shot you fyz I hate fighting here we don't actually have to fight them here I can't get the top I like the only one here that can't get up top nice this isn't a [ __ ] I once it's a g7 it'd be strange [Music] go ahead Champa she's weak your full health you've got these temper us if we finished the killing the other night it turns out you she's doing like a finishing move over there or something [Music] or a tremendous victory there with Mirage a few times I could have gone a few pillars mixed most the people died whilst we were traversing across the map but a wins a win let's say what Mirage is definitely in my list of characters that I will be playing this season I know I've said a lot with like bloodhound I mean blue town got a Buffa's mob with me but now a compact Pathfinder I don't know how I'm gonna play I don't know if I've got even got a may many more it's very sad these are very sad times thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next [Music]
