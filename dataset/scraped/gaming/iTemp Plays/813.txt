hey was a cottage which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are back at playing bloodhound we recently played them because they had a booth today ultimate but now they've also had their main ability buffed as well he wasn't a small booth he wasn't like are they reduce the cooldown by two seconds they increased the range on their scan three times over unbelievable and if you want to test bloodhound out to know that they have had a buffed ability the best place to go is built up areas I personally am a big fan of scrapped or City I've got two games for you today and I think about 95% of the time we're in scraps of City and my scans go through the entire place I can see every one 400 people were scandal of one point so thank you for watching I do appreciate in our seawall in five and half seconds my friends this is the the scrap east entrance to scraps all since you've ever seen what I am used to it's the loot in this place that you get yourself a habit you get yourself a single fine hemlock you drop down and you get yourself some dilute shield and you are what is known in the trade as looted mob rooted within the first four seconds my team I got the club for this down low okay that's that is one ugly kill the recoil was keeping it just above his head that's what I'm gonna flame that on I was trying to pull the I was trying to pull the the recoil down I is there a blue armor switch in this building I'm pretty sure I remember there being two or maybe not across the way is unlooted but I can't I can't bring myself to run over there just for like a Tier one upgrade on the armor because her flawless punch out that way I say we just looted below bit and then just get there hey I can't frikkin off teammates so no the hey we'll have purple i'll send me running across scraps off city together as well and you have landed 70 seconds ago full team looting up top that was my plan to try and flank them they've got to try and revive their teammate low so hopefully they just run away from her completely bop something that's an option there's one more and I assure neither one went down low to try and revive his friend teammate is rye in the corner you've won bonding with a prowler and was here with the smoke - does anyone have a medic this is two teams here you're trying to scan make sure they're not china rushes two hostiles and they are running off into the sunset these guys are terrified right now I hate using syringes it's honor it's putting my pet peeve on this game they just take salt longus outrageous behind the door well I hate about small hills we could probably just brush this guy know hey you take that friend I've got blue we're fine one of these guys might have it of course deke it's got straps at every single entrance there's two of them though now that trigger traps every day take me away my friend the 2v1 name it's all I have to do is just rain I'm gonna dice this highlight that's that that was one don't walk back into that did i crawl back into that that's horrendous bangles running off into the sunset to get my revived on-the-go here I at least I appreciate this I'll die I can hear footsteps near the octane is well hopefully that's just the it would be the lifeline because we killed them all stick and I'm responding to an approximate and I've got no mobility to respawn without my ultimate I can't believe you've let me walk off it's all downhill I should be fine here I can't return to that building because there's a lifeline checking around it's always late in my loop fox-body crate think I find level 1 shield or even just like 29 Rams honestly I'm going to go back in knowing like what about a shield as with the spot there are two squads teammates we might need to regroup here because it appears as though my Bangalore has no more shields hopefully that others harder scrapped when it's no longer looted I mean no not looted still miss earlier on it wasn't looted any scraps in here an evil shield at level 1 shield anything I tell mr. stalker now that's good news it's so sad running away from the fights you know I'm not used to it I'm used to play line he's straight to the scrap and Here I am running the opposite direction ok that is gonna be but some purple shields of this way I think we just need to regroup and reassess our options here when you when you know the Bangalore is and hinder for anything it's more like rains great to the hammer some people don't think that isn't upgrade I'm sure but they have a keys outrageous out of ten seen my purple shield thank you very much all right hopefully my teammates are able to find some stuff as well and then we can just run back over there Bob good that's good bangles got herself a shield battery scrap is in the distance I see the Gibraltar shields we're going out to get some higher ground on this because I think that the scrap is distended with Newsies they're all loose enough my grenade and then what anyway that's fine right now fields burn mine today I think [Applause] magic on irwadi zero feels their level two so that it doesn't take long to get them up to level all you need to hold it I guess it's hamster sat down Grady we go for the Auto Prowler my team just got a revive I think they need some help but I don't have to come back with people to loot I'd rather go in with what I need let's go friends on back as a separate team now completely bumping me get my back French I've got a good hand as well I know what they're doing already up to red shields up because of it he's a bit blue does Qin name I assume this is the last one here we go perfect for this goal knockdown shield oh good grief theyíve our shells are the right call right they're already up to read doesn't take longer alright I can reach all my teammates but the thing is the deserves and change so I know for a fact it ends over this way which means that there may be some competition not gonna be looting McGrew to myself to fend off people that are never to be coming here this free vine or respawn even not love it time there's a chance that we don't actually get contested here but I mean listen that's a completely optimistic to say the least we should just beelining straight back to we know where the loot is it's gonna make sure no one's pushing for my train sort of area we know that the East is probably at least two please try and cover for them as a mirage all teachers used do you assume me shoot me instead just run friends just get the hair can freak out of that keep on him he's so weak I don't think he's got his hard I don't think he's got a smoke call down back hopefully my team I can think of a gun or something first these vices my teammates in a five minute of the team like any flanked they're just trying to loosen myself a free kill I didn't mean to fall all the way down and apparently you can't climb stuff if you use your ultimate watts how much 3000 tor damage we place faith there are still over 10 people left let's get to another game okay first of all I didn't mean to drop Damon if I can just kill someone that's looting my team out there it's a 1v1 easy and second of all you can't climb water use your ultimate I had no idea either of those things are different and I probably win that one V 2 and I can respawn my teammates 3200 damage unreal alright scrap it's all cities again I don't know how many times today I've said to scrapped I'll say to you and brought back it up French Dip we knock double havoc it and he's going straight to go that's fine it I don't like going for the purple until I've got the blue because if you've played this mode or at least if you've landed at this building people will land on the purple because they know it's there and even though they don't really have the best weapons scrapping look at this another three people there as well he's pretty what you gonna pay for lunacy I don't care my friend I've landed two shots they somehow got to shield cells they don't ping my own loop back to me hey well okay I've got nothing oh god absolutely nothing I sure don't think that's my loot I didn't get killed prints oh never mind I'll take you back you have a friend one left up top there is that's someone lucky I think my I think the octane was some first in my kill instead of even reviving or or just trying to help me in the last two if you want we could have dis double-team do preventive now if I had to guess I say it wasn't the revenant the survived he was probably the race in the path mine it was the race I could scan but I done wanted to know that I know why she's I've ever read that I knew that she'd come out for the hill you know yeah let me just arm switch it in case says she put it yet she'd die if I just went to revive the Uptown I thought you know don't worry I've actually no okay never mind I was going to be the one to revive but I lost him some a alright it's work tank if you're in that situation though and your teammates fighting someone like that like I was with the revenant it's not worth trying to thirst to kill unless they've got like a dog knocked down or something I don't know even Venice they can't get too far you may as well just help them in the to be one I only took that that fight against the revenant that's why it's not even hitting him because it was a 2v1 but it's worth tale I don't complain too much I do need though shield cells though alright looks like I got listen this is for a peacekeeper theses for $9.99 if I find either of those I'm happy because I can't do all happen as much as I do want to do whatever I'm not sure I will find the necessary energy around to support that lifestyle choice you know - try finding me a secondary weapon if possible that chump I may as well take that I can't lose because I've got 1,200 attachments in my inventory might as well just take the re 45 it's not too bad I'm not gonna complain about it it's ok it's up the honored signs younger brother you know Neely's good I'm growing impatient friends we may as well go to the west because the quest is where V the dropship came from a new it expects more people never mind that is a scratch or hand it is Easter okay we've already had scratches wait I don't mind in fact this is this is preferable because bloodhound scans aren't as good in fields as they are in like a built-up place like this I can see where live their company in any other buildings if have any Watson fences if they have any caustic traps I'm able to hunt them out of my scan my new and improved scan is the scrap still going on police on fire but there we go tonight screen over as well Bangalore ultimate suggests that they are close which indeed they are nice oh my god he opened it a messed up team I didn't know so we're gonna double P me like that and there's another squad that's the third part that we tried to third party it's quite a bit of a waste of a second party here this is my car me the other two teams are scrapping on one car honey just through the entire game you know I say we just get we get back involved I say we just messed him up now since I put on the ropes here oh my god go to Greece that's a lot of information come soon kick me now come to the line would need scraps or city he's a [ __ ] ruse kungfu free city those the Vols I'm afraid II can it making a new teammate semion nevermind you got him one team left I'm talking to my countryman over this way people which is a shame again this cyst absolutely horrendous and the other gold shield that's finite it's okay she can take the gold shield if I find the evil shields I'm throwing them on a power stabilizer if you guys know where the gold Brown stabilizer spawns please leave a comment because I see people running to scraps or CT color later that attachment and I'd like to know what it is I know where the gold back spawns or at least I know where the care package lands with the gods with the gold back against that I how much damage do we need to turn this into a level 3 shield here 41 perfect it's like three shots with a havoc I've been playing this mode pretty much all day not all day few hours at least and this is where the final circle ends and as always a team of three on top of this building with the Gibraltar and they're always extremely annoying so I'd rather get here first especially this is a good reason to early as well I just need to do some poke damage if I can hit someone with a single fire habit upgrade these to level 3 shields and then hopefully we got enough time to turn into red shield as well we'll see though that's my dream and I don't engage on people properly until I've done for you on damage Mazal just push him to two teams left there's one singular Wraith running around these parts sinop top was extremely boring I mean we could probably go into your wing because that is the best piece of high ground and then after that by the way you just drop down onto like the the railroad and you still have the high ground on one of the last circles it's unbelievable it's unfair that's the bank or smudging blobs earlier on this is the gold bag care package if you're curious dollar experienced plainness today well how nice you spot him I do not and it got a quick no no and I don't get corny open because he's product yet I'd only be real sir when they try and rushes I see stupid when we could just get high grounds free of charge oh yeah look that that's my favorite bleach on the game you can't climb on the rooftop these guys a point out all the stops look of Newsies none of us have gone down and we still have a better position than they do there we go to level three shields now the drones back I'm not even tempted to shoot it I don't even care I thought I could never hit that finger special Nick's these folks yeah they already know repaired honestly it's not a problem let him let him just sit at least that means is not Souness should be wide sounded Shore batteries because small hell's is okay but party should use this single Friday oh that's French we're very much appreciative me amigo oh when did you rounds 447 damage and I mean get Redfield's here after me I want if the off hands got his ulti I don't think he's using a G's learning and I've taken shots it's bad timing for me I'm here you're not alone I got you know and are consumed with me mum these all we've switched positions stupid single-fire that's the only fun with with using two firing modes I always do that we've been aided by another team here unlesss now it's funny these teammates just get some higher ground you better end them up I'll do the anvil rise all the time I forget which one I'm selected when you can't check but I don't like tech miser I don't have taken my eyes off the screen you never know when someone's gonna balk to you all you can easily missed up on apexis is it tough to position it to be in alright I'm fed up with him let's get him if they were so good they want to run off that farm that's my that's my theory let's put it to the test crows remains of someone's house four seconds on scan mrs. Buckman honestly daughter [Applause] this night do I get both of those I think God has got kill credit for both of those there are separate teams left I had no idea I thought we were rushing with on team I'll tell you what I don't think we're in escrow City I don't think we left scrapped or City which is exactly where you want to be as blood home because he's scan is ludicrous ludicrously good 2080 damage I don't know how I'd be 3200 damage earlier on I have not a clue like 50% more damage in that game I've done know how that's happened shout out the the teammates there because I mean I leave you through the game when I rushed into that that building but they got the revive off and there you go blue tone scan has turned him into a viable character if you stay around sort of built-up areas in fields it's probably not that good it failed you put on a play pathfinders you can just die surround the place but in building places like scraps or city the scan is outrageous so funny thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one bye
