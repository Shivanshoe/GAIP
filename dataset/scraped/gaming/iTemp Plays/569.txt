southeast until the ring closes we've got time but not much i don't know i think they just ran though maybe they did maybe they weren't doing straight yeah i hear them okay you just keep saying that

like where we came from and there's a fighting forever way more fun let me know if you see it three times please sorry i know i'm being a bit annoying with the old give me like but no i mean part of the video yeah it is it's sort of decked out as well i have a level three extended sniper like oh you actually gotta kill it yeah yeah blue sniper stock blue barrel stabilizer and it's kind of tomato sauce is gone you just jumped off this building i see an enemy over there what do you mean yeah [Music] went to the left nice come on right i know these games i don't know what these guys are doing to recharge did they finish the killing of the guys i guess yeah as soon as i had walked up they had just killed uh somebody else oh there's a team on uh and train oh that's okay i'm up top graveyard of armor everywhere yeah there's so many armors that are just broken in there so don't swap in there someone's gonna go and try that don't worry scooby's just killing people with his gas oh scooby oh i can't wait to fight this cause dude you build a name the close one ah big one right here i don't know what floor though uh bottom actually i think i think this place needs a little more it might be two teams to recharge to this team i don't know how i lost that he's one hp literally one he's just hiding in the corner oh play i have no clue how i just lost that i was sketching my bracelet didn't work it just banged off a scene and came straight back to me i feel like i did a thousand health damage to this wraith and she just didn't die i don't understand let's use my lung one more it's difficult when they're in a building i feel like i heard something like safe oh maybe it's the lifeline pack it was on the roof oh yeah i don't know i didn't really hear much i was kind of focused on not dying i have a bag if you wanted it oh what let's travel back up for business um i think i have one here i have one we have 45 seconds and the next ring's right there mama's got a brand new someone needs uh okay maybe we got safe might as well go safe even yup yup so 10 people left or eight people this is longbow territory name yeah oh yeah provide some cover fire my guns are like if i got a gold barrel stabilizer and a level three closet stock i'd have two gold weapons what are you using a lambo right yeah and the all-star is just like oh you've got a nice stock done that's all you need are you using the um the four day time you're not right no these are the three times already in the next ring good more time to load they're getting shot by someone else too i tried a nice headshot though so it's worth nice nice nice and short damage i wish i was horizon me too i'm getting up top on this and climbing up i'm just going to go for it yeah oh yeah i can't even really help terrible i don't want to just outside them i'm going to try i guess if they're just going to be fighting in here no visual let me know if you just need help at any point um they're both inside recharging shields why would they do that to me angles i hear the other the last team's fighting okay nice that's nice i'll meet you as well whatever this is i don't know what this place is called um it's called come on man is that really what the name is oh it is okay i don't know i don't i don't ever look at that i didn't know remember yeah i saw another place on king's canyon i've been playing it for two years nearly i know bunker and sculptain school said they got rid of it so i probably not right oh real quick headshot for the kill oh nice you're firing that hey the longer with the three times okay hey i feel like just snipers in general in this game are ridiculous just three tap those guys well not really because i missed a few shots in there on the second guy but still three headshots nice dude the meta that's why i suck this season is because i don't like snipers and i just won't use them yeah that's fine wow mate keep up jesus okay pop mate team team gameplay right team gameplay by the way i have to still be out for a more capable teammate yeah kills who are you shooting obviously everyone 14 kills 1700 to be fair though when you're using a sniper as precise as me they don't get back up you know is that the case yes
