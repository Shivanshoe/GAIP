hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i think the tables have finally turned in the heavy versus light argument for the longest time light ammo weapons were completely dominant thanks mainly to the r400 combination for a short time you probably could have argued in favor of the energy guns when the havoc was ludicrous and the devo i mean that's always been ridiculous as well but now heavy guns have made a comeback i mean the wingman is timeless it's still such a good gun the 30 30 is a little bit niche but it's still great the rampage and the prower are amazing guns and the flat lane even after its nerf is still so good so every single heavy gun is amazing almost best in class i think we are living in heavy dominant time so i'd love to hear your thoughts on these so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends in case you didn't know you get here by winning good luck let's we are here i have landed on some energy bullets team the most efficient drop of all time got to prioritize those energy bullets listen you don't want to be in a situation
