hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are back at it again here on apex legends of course i don't know why that was like a remix i was an intro remix but anyway we are in ranked once again and i finally settled on some weapons that i enjoy using in this mode because the meta is so different between regular public lobbies on apex and ranked mode when i try to use some of my favorite guns from the public mode in ranked mode such as the flatline and maybe even the r301 to be honest with you i find that i struggle to have an impact at those medium to long range gun fights and now i've started to use the charge rifle the longbow the sentinel and definitely the gun that i'm using today the rampage this gun is so crazy good when it came out i didn't like it too much because my focus the entire game was how many thermos do i have i was so obsessed with trying to charge it up at all times but you really don't need to towards the end of the game it is nice to have some thermites in your back pocket because people are running around with red armor but you seriously don't even need the thermoids and i've got a thing they actually might nerf this gun a little so i'm not saying it needs a nerf but i reckon they might thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends never seen me like it before i had to strap you down oh god that's funny there are there people here sounds like it's are you not saying i have a purple armor i have another rampage there and the firmware they're everywhere in the middle i think oh in my building hello i'm trying to help i'm i'm trying i'm on the roof i'm good i broke down 100 on that on that octane i can't even i shot myself i got sad i'm literally punching him oh god no i've got nothing nice to switch i have to arm switch i only have a just old building just hold the building recharging i'm out of heavy ammo okay i see this on the roof yep i'm trying to climb up cracks i have five assists i have 400 damage in five kills oh yeah 500 damage and no kills it's fine we're yeah yeah yeah fools uh ultimate starting the ultimate accelerant here stressful man what are you doing socks come on socks what are you doing eating fluff off the floor why do they do that i uh my cats like uh plastic they're like licking plastic oh yeah they love it what socks is she loves it i was curious what that was and apparently like uh there's like something in plastic that makes them think it smells like food i don't know yeah they think it's food or something she'll just sit there licking plastic like a plastic bag for like 10 minutes it yeah that's kind of dumb they are kind of crazy that's fine they're cute gravity sweats sometimes not mine

in the back we gotta get over here to marketing in the market ones need to crack on red climb the backs needed cracked themselves and popping souls don't worry this crafting thing is taking on myself they're trying to they're trying to run i haven't used a single charge on my rampage yet it's just difficult to find the time it's gonna go to a building it's gonna be impossible to push yeah i chose the west on amma right now i'm standing on someone's head i got boosted up over the come right set there three times for this what ammo do you need you can craft them real quick i can cover you or you can bubble it but it's like a full stack just just bubbling and put two in there you like you're fine i need to go get the crafting stuff first what else is in the crafting mobile respawn and they could have like they could have really destroyed us when we were stuck in that place you know crafty but i'm still ready uh yes please mate i can drop it for a frag grenade here rampage is so good yeah it's way too good they're fine over this way i think they're just like shooting on top of the library you know library right uh no tell me where where where's library libraries golf yeah i got it i wasn't going to acknowledge it but you have made me oh here uh there's no i don't think there's any cover up there if we do go around another fun game i wanna try and push someone can you put a rope

drive bats here here i'll drop you two bats bets this is i mean we need them to get dirty right like how are they not getting shot in the back uh i mean if we need to we can just go back where he came from yeah triggered the wall they're gonna get eager and drop i got shot from the right by the way someone said now okay i think we need to go left where we came from okay i don't know if that's a play because we'd have to go look at the map we'd have to go so far if we went if we went to the right yeah that's true let's go let's go no no no no wait what no if we go to the right it's way too far yeah we go to the left i mean this is we're gonna have to go uphill though on this part which is and there's no cover so this i think okay let's go this way let's go this way we can bubble we can bubble we can walk up and bubble okay i have i have rope we can [Music] i need to drop back they drop i think they drop we have to do so now don't drop go for the lifeline go to the lifeline i missed so many shots after chill here for sake oh my god there's no way we win that what do they drop like that for i don't know that was i told you they're gonna get eaten yeah they're so easy because they got that down honestly it's good that you went down there you got your bubble up i had gold bag like and it made them get you sweaty late i went down to that silence she was dead for like a whole second and i went down wait though yeah i'm gonna try and go right and see if i can get some charts 93 on one nice job there's a path back there really weak already see i need to recharge my shield i
