hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and today we are playing some solo queue and we got the rarest thing in apex some good random teammates i was playing octane and i was still having to play catch up to these guys so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends found an extended energy mag i'm surprised it wasn't busy down here so we saw like five teams maybe we got miraged oh nearly cracked at least is there anything worse than trying to oh my god you down someone that's outrageous teammate i was just about to complain about shooting down but apparently it's no problem for this uh watson why you shooting me oh my god look at my health and a postcard if anyone knows why this guy shooting me whilst my teammate is standing right beside him with an egret uh actually outrageous much like 14. that's that might be a new record i mean that's nearly half my inventory at this point and i'm octane too so even running four sometimes it's a little bit but you can easily get away with with running zero it's him and lifeline right which way are they are the liberals inside teammates have been there oh we go now we're talking anyone needs that i didn't even realize i had a level one all right where are these people at thank you well with them i've taking the race portal so we can just get out of here never mind they've already used this there we go they've taken the rifle as well they're landing on us okay they're landing on us a lot of psychopaths nice teammates how many hog stars are here like a national arkansas convention in this corner got party be careful audacious is it one guy like do you actually need me i'm sorry team some idiot octane put their pad right near the corner of the fence i mean i'd i don't know who it was they shall remain nameless for now but listen they are they're an idiot one of the worst octanes of all time i would expect that's the watson i'm not used to hearing watson footsteps i'll be honest with you how am i playing octane and find it difficult to keep up with my teammates these guys are lunatics nice get him out of here let me see this guy all right well i guess i did some damage at least i cracked them nice work team all right so two teams here i was confused by the pings but why is this guy got no shield did that oh nice i thought that naked damaged him i think it landed right on him hello friends i've got a good amount of shield batteries there my two minutes are doing okay actually don't need to worry about them at all i feel like they should be the ones worrying about me here i feel like i'm being baby baby baby sat what's the past participle of babysit who knows well i've got a pad but i don't want to descend 1v3 i'm trying to get an angle here become reinforcements his lifeline raising i'm not going to get that kill i did get the kill thanks team wait has 180 oh is there something light there i mean i'll be honest i didn't realize i had 180 but i'll still come over because it is the r9 you know uh i thought you were trying to ping that there were some light rains here but i don't need them anyway let's just get safe or at least try and cut these guys off somebody took the rope that's actually smart play okay i mean again i've got my pad here but i don't want to just send send before we do some damage there we go 90 damage it's a caustic so he's extremely tanky so of course he could have no abilities but the fact that he takes 15 is it 15 reduced damage oh god got an alternator thanks teammate 15 reduced damage and he doesn't get slow down when he's shot if he had no abilities i feel like people would still playing just because those are just incredible perks all right i'll tell you man this is the combo of dreams here i've got my disrupter rounds back on king's canyon we disrupt around it's like season two all over again but i'm down to rush them i mean this is always a sad sight when someone's getting respawned with three squads left you know that the two remaining squads are just converging is the one that got respawned fraber oh my word there are two of them i don't know who i'm firing at i'm just shooting one team let's they were just different teams this could just be one guy left it might be the wraith and she might have gone off to try and find some loot ah okay okay my teammates are outrageous but i still dropped 2200 damage i mean i'll take that water treatment to these me amigos we are on the hunt for some uh legendary guns i thought that was a shocking ball i am sad no it's not i don't know how against okay that's my teammate making those noises i was confused they're gonna rush [Music] him did he get thirsted in all of that i think he got re-knocked oh you have to hold that i'll forget it i forgot i had to hold it i thought you just tapped it and then it was i think you have to hold it i have to drain the toxins from this place gold pk gosh darn teammate just left with joseph trio zero comes all right well at least we got oh gold helmet we've got a gold gun a gold helmet that's a lot of pads back back we got teammate that's been stunning god why am i out of breath i'll put the kettle on for any survivors i actually just stuck around and tried to defend me whilst i got my food that's outrageous teammate like do you want this i know it's a little bit cheeky as an octane taking the gold helmet but i just i like the pads you know the pads are great he doesn't want it okay i'll keep this all right obviously i don't really care about this game before this it seems that ray teammate just left us but way out there we're gonna win this this is an easy dub as they say see they're screwed recharging two teammates we've got two teammates not teammates not teaming don't report me two teams over this way one to our left these guys struggling and i'm being focused by fusion hey oh my word they've got around for shields what what is pubs turning to recently it's not it's not people playing rampart that's not the problem it's just i don't think any of these teams actually gonna send or play aggressive on anyone okay teammate i'm the best g7 player you've ever seen no one is going to play aggressive here we might be able to make a move on the rampart team if they start getting destroyed or people getting knocked in the kill feed i mean they're still looking this way uh then we can just try and rush in there throw some archetypes or something i don't know i was hoping he's gonna i was hoping he's gonna throw his ark to destroy the door and then i throw the ark over the top and they weren't suspected shut that door in fact now you can't shut the door that might be a bad thing for us actually it's got shields in there yeah i feel like this is a bad plan what's going on here yeah this is horrendous i mean i don't know how much money these guys are playing for but it has to be six figures i think we just rotate here teammate whilst we still got time whilst the storm's not right behind us i mean we don't even have to go that far these guys are not moving there's a team cage there's a team the rapper team there's a team above them and there's a team all the way left i say we just try and commandeer cage it's like the best spot at the moment and we've got a horizon to take us up to the top i mean these guys are firing but they're not actually doing anything you know nothing is actually happening i don't hear anything in that cage they might they might have actually moved which is astonishing all right teammate we are going all the way over the top i see those people i'm not too interested at the moment i want the high ground oh they are there what do you think is over here right to the tippity top there we go nice nice look at the top yes tremendous first him i'm risking it oh here we go listen if we are going to sit if every team in this lobby is going to sit back and long range each other then i am more than happy to see you in my escape i'll take all your shields off i'll drop a 12k damage game i'll no i'll do it no i won't i'm sorry this guy's the best i don't know who he is okay the rock man the guy behind the rock he's the only guy i'm scared off the rest of these guys are getting pelted apart from these guys too quick okay they're the same team i wasn't aware what is this game man i've got 1600 damage i've had to take my little slippers off here so i can lean forward this is i'm going to lean so far forward so i can actually see what's going on because all these people are 200 meters away uh we do have to go but not for two minutes but we could try and get ahead of them all right hopefully no teams is playing for us you need heavy you've got zero heavy bullets that isn't good in fact i'd go as far as saying that's not good i can offer you this site what do you think objects here close range these guys might have rotated this way we were pelted over there i thought this is a new team i don't want this fight that much i don't know if my team can get out of there someone's out there they're far out try and cover him from this guy so bad here only switch and run maybe grab some bats i am surprised it took them that long to get there there are four teams in that close vicinity that's i really didn't want that fight but it's actually worth it at least at least we took a team there you know i'm down to my last cell after this which isn't good did you mention any bats i appreciate the back but now i'm battles once again and we're between the last two teams okay the storm is closing i didn't realize i think we'd just sit underneath them this is this isn't good the tide decide if they send down here they're throwing the game there's no way they do let's go over here i got my ultimate in a second we can horizon cure but it might be too slow ultimate ready to fly comparison it's popping ultimates okay well that's nine percent it's actually pretty far away wait for the scan to go against the side of the hedge do we just go he's down one of them this is perfect you could just rotate safe these these teams are gonna okay that's a charge sentinel i've got no shields left i mean there's there are boxes up here the guys that we killed let's go here i'm gonna get a chance here oh here we go this guy didn't have anything i don't think my teammate has anything there you go this is these are public games recently like everyone's like everyone's playing them super seriously so i mean i don't mind too much it just makes me have to play super seriously i have to think about rotations and final circle tactics and stuff not used to it and this is where the other team was slash is hopefully not looks like these guys have already moved are these teams gonna fight at any point here we go all right this is that time this is our cue i got a call stick that's not good like that down the lifeline there we go we have to work for it we have to work incredibly hard for it good job teammate i'm pretty sure it was 2v3 v3 so we had to because of this guy because of this i don't think he even got first i think you just i think he'd quit i think he quit on us i mean i can't lie it's not like i've never quit a game before but there we go 2500 damage for six kills i i really wanted to win that game because the teammate when i had to go and get food he was there protecting me so easy dub big double use all around
