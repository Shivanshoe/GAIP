hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the bangalore heirloom that came out called cold steel you can see me unlocking it in the background and i am so happy that bangalore has an heirloom neck one of my favorite characters on the game has been shown some love finally honestly between pathfinder bangalore octane a little bit of caustic and lifeline i feel like all of the legends that i i love to use in this game all have heirlooms which begs the question who you guys want to have the next heirloom because i'm struggling to think of a legend that i enjoy playing that doesn't have one already maybe horizon but she's so new it'll be a bit out of order to the older ones anyway i have two games for you today i hope you enjoy them thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends energy um energy yeah i've known so i would like to push these guys can you crack that guy come on oh god we both i mean i kind of deserve that i have one cell and that's it wow you got it look look look look this is crazy i think you're right but it's in the package and everyone's um i don't have any heels how many bats do you have i just dropped you a bat did you not pick it up yeah i i do but i already had one when you dropped them oh okay i have two bats too okay yeah i have two um either phoenix i have i'm sorry i have a med kit which one draken you should have i'm dropping the phoenix make it smaller style all right yeah that one's not that yeah thanks i've smoked it so they survive longer they've got smoke so they're aware that they're being pushed from this i know oh they supposed to know where that smoke came from i mean you know if they're an aware gamer they're not i can see them standing still if i did craig obviously okay i think that's just what you get and i'm not i'm not sad about it at all oh [Music] wow yeah more than 14. uh it's so low rich that's like a that's like a good 10 to about 50 health all right i don't know where he went he had a low profile he's dead taking a knee 100 he's on he's on one's edge i can't stop sliding so i'm inspecting my gun my ass i think i'll just heard someone next to me but i want to finish the inspect animation another worth it finish it i think someone's like in the strawberry over here a ring fire's opening near [Music] oh that was like that was the so far i like what i see um what that was the so far had mercedes um give me a second chrono smack screens on the flat line ah yeah yeah yeah one of those okay yeah the custom one yeah i like it i like it was that the pathfinder yes wait wait he had red why why did i just use about on purple does anyone know i don't know i was trying to think almo literally 100 percent of my brainpower was trying to remember cronus max so it's not my fault i'm sure your viewers will have a field day with that all right well there's three squads and no one's fought for like five minutes oh hey he's really happy okay are you in the are you in labs yeah i'm gonna take the thing i'm gonna play safe i'm gonna fail eyes up incoming replicator oh no i'm dead yeah he's pushing us one on me all right whoa yes i don't know how we are we are clean mate comms are clean ultra clean i mean i usually don't do that all right whoa i just popped a bat in like half yeah it's 50 quick read the patch notes it revives the quicker term no i'm not going to rich if you want to heal quicker you sit on the edge one of these because you can't the effect isn't if you just do in the open right so if you did it here you don't get the faster by fast fail you have to be protected from the storm so it has to be in the zone yeah yeah but because because of these things you find one just go to the edge of it and if you fight there you get to heal quick commit to the team smart big brain i'm hiding i don't know ready i'm going yeah yeah it's on the rice on the right i'm gonna risk it that's one last one lifeline's weak that's what i always say oh my god no um so he definitely like left the game because there's no way the storm would have killed him way faster unless he was just trying to out heal the storm maybe uh wraith with the new flashpoint skin not new same flash points again i hate that skin i'm dropping it let's go this way kind of it's kind of ugly i thought i've always thought it was really early i like it that much i feel like you're going to see everywhere it's like when skull trooper came back my skull trooper yeah he's everywhere are we talking about it because it's like that's it's like when that came back everyone wanted it back oh yeah everywhere yeah yeah the airship is assassinated move fast folks yeah they have armor switches and stuff in there i'm going from the other side there's a knight on me hold on got one that one i know i mean it's just 12 squads left that's crazy package incoming let's get to the bad yeah got a live one out there let's run inside cowering 196 186 goes a long way that's a lot of damage to 45 people yeah yeah yeah lined them up reloading what about safe wait i full shield cells that's a scan it's pretty much like having eight though yeah you don't need any more than that you want two i have ah it's okay you're coming alright anyone stayed here oh there's two here okay somebody they're just cranking i can like kind of pinpoint the direction i wonder if that's where they're coming from i can pinpoint the direct sound's coming from north carolina let's reposition here yeah that's right this one would line up as well because the distance doesn't matter but it has to be this vicinity this one just started though could be the other one or they could just be doing in the open along the way yep 896 rampant swan 886 isn't gold i'm just stacking big hills i mean i do that a lot too i just forget they're still good though i want a batsman in two cells still it's quicker yeah it's faster i just it's so nice probably one so i'm getting it it's nice being able to do it especially with octane because you can pop a cell whilst you fly and it doesn't really affect you too much at bat you still have to land and then skid that's why i like um gold on octane more than anything and horizon any reason this is cool some reason though i like using horizon though because you can pop bats in her tactical really control it well i definitely did now where do we go what a thousand downs not too bad from its top ten yeah these games are so strange like it's crazy that we're having like 15 minute games oh god oh yeah there's another one just lip lighting right on your head i assume they know [Applause] myself i'm out [Music] please look over this way practical in the building i deserve i don't deserve to be alive oh it's kind of crazy i would just kind of leave why are you doing little guys you guys doing over here yes what are these guys doing they're just chilling over your endzone all right last squad last squadron i need more than two somebody out no um would you like to i guess that's very very aggressive i'll make that noise too might be more aggressive whoa it's one right on me chill actually that actually scared me i wanted to capture the ring flare that's your real enemy it is sick of it oh my god get destroyed if i got headshot they would have been so depressed this guy's never happened i don't know it was like a somewhere i didn't see him this was a guy with a crater just pat on his head oh my god you want another beat no no she's like one shot i went in with mate i'm sorry i went in with the knife lifeline's extremely weak i wanted to decapitate her is i cannot believe you tried to punch him when he was still another one alive you've gotta risk it all sometimes i don't even do that dude holy i could have healed i was behind a rock i climbed on the rock i jumped off the rock i whacked him in the face they shot me that was the end of my story wow and i did 90 more damage and you had all my kills this is just i mean that's that's just what happens when you're rich and you're so far with octane all right god it's kind of crazy that's my r3 right there absolute demon i am with that gun
