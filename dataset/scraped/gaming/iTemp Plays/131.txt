hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are celebrating apex's third birthday it wasn't actually today i think it was uh i think it was a week ago or more towards the start of the month it was early february 2019 apex came out and it's still going strong but today the celebratory anniversary event is here and we get a first look of the new mythic skin it's the first mythic skin of its type it's actually an evolving skin and you're not in the same way that you unlock the heirloom so you can see them in the background unlocking all 24 apex packs and then we get this it's the apex hunter you get three challenges you start off with the regular skin and then to evolve it once you need to do 30 000 damage in total and to evolve into its final form where it looks impressive and you get a cool finisher you have to do 100 000 total damage as blue toned after you unlock this skin now of course that's going to take me a while so today we're using the basic one but i am going to try and work hard and get the tier 3 unlocked for you and then i'm going to go into a game and try and use the finisher as many times as possible i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends no i'll take it i saw someone jumping about he was going kind of crazy you see 45 seconds on the floor someone traveled through here optics here close range if we get a few hits on him oh my wounds [Music] i need absolutely give me sight why is he such a struggle was that two separate teams or was it just a mirage that i got like a little bit scared off i've got tomorrow so i got a little bit scared off shout out to the team now the bad news here is that i haven't done any damage i don't need damage to evolve my uh i need damage to above my skin dead reality friend i'm coming up with you where'd she go where'd she go she's going kind of okay she's dead that's huge that way are [Music] i need damage i need damage why was he not running away i went around the back to try and get the kill the guy stood there like a maniac fighter psychopath unfortunately i'm trying to first everyone to get these damage numbers up enemy in the distance we got another quality obviously nice job oh that's two teams of fire in each of the two taking a moment where on earth could they be ash might know i guess and i don't do second place let's end this box there huge we'll just go here and keep them that's such a good passive such a good passive now all we have to do i mean and without ash what would we have done there i would have been looking like because we can't hear it and we came from the north i might have been tempted to look at air base runoff and this game would have gone on a lot longer than it needed to but at least now we can have our 3v3 and we can dial we can win those are the two options we've got i'm leaning towards win but if we die i don't mind that much either oh we could have just val caught it over here really can't we but that wouldn't have been the stealthy option oh they do be fine over our heads oh god everyone reconvene we have coming up actually now give me one sec taking a moment my shield i shattered an enemy's shield quick why can't i finish not the uh it's not the bloodhound finisher it's not the tier 3 one i'm going to scan for the sake of it nice job team nice oh my god wrong choice please there's nothing here our enemies have missed their fate that squad is out okay i got kind of popped off though you know landing on a diva got a few kills that wait i got one kill i was because i didn't first the path there's no way you've got to revive come on maybe the maybe he's a guy don't i don't know i've got i've got nothing to first with you know i just run off self preservation someone's been here i will hunt for loot here someone's been here i need a weapon my ultimate's ready to go all right let's just try and surprise this is our best bet i guess gotta get spotted what's this today my god's got blue armor he's winning his fight reckons [Music] reloading right through him oh we're still live we're still live somehow i think there's another team here though maybe not i don't know there should be a good amount of loot we're still alive come on teammate good work out there on the battlefield god i kind of suck with this gun though don't i be over 30 30. did i land one shot at the 33 unless it was on the down guy oh my god oh my god with me taking a moment to recharge my shields scanning the area well she's not up here which is fine it's a different team using a phoenix kit recharging my sheets two squads take me and run come it is our on to recover our fallen brethren our brethren's fight is not over my enemies will find me inside this ring recharging my shield okay well we couldn't find anyone and then we found everyone where is that right blessings upon us yeah let's go this way i got you all right after these guys don't take too well hopefully they take ages i'll match the first one of them what was that pathfinder challenge and he got way too way too aggressive way too eager it's probably because he's also been running around for 15 minutes so i can't really blame him all right little ultimate accelerant i have my old back is a shame i'll confirm both of those i thought they would have horizon cued up onto the roof i feel like that would have been the smart play no one else has died here uh are you on the roof no one's on the roof all father give me sight might be something good this thing yeah don't don't fly the angle that's horrendous the area get the hindgrade on him although i think it's horizon path 85's not bad the team maybe coming oh nice job teammate i'm glad there was only two of them but either one died he was here or gold helmet some bats i have three bats let me know if you need one spotted i'm gonna need a bit of heavy they didn't have any did they i need heavy ammo where's come on we could just take this rope i feel like we take this rope let's go that's huge thank you thank you i mean this cover up if we need it we just sit on this corner i'm chilling there's no one here i'm fine we're chilling no need to play aggro here i'm gonna chill where they going taking a moment to recharge my shields i don't mind farming damage over here because i need it for my uh i need for my next evolution of this this skin i'm going to go to my heavy i'm going to keep poking oh they're getting peppered they'll get peppers oh he stole my kill get him yeah i'm gonna i might just drop down if my tv is in here imagine maybe we should have stayed on the roof that teams is gonna they're getting three revives over there we should have just been on that side killing them we didn't need to start shooting this team yet this can't shoot through at all this is ridiculous this is this is so stupid this team just got three revives i don't think we can get back on the roof that was the stupidest game ever like i don't know what these teams are doing i really don't know what that was i really don't know that was the game that that rank said this was a stupid drop there she is that was a stupid joke gg and we went on and we won nice i mean it wasn't pretty but we did go in and win nice
