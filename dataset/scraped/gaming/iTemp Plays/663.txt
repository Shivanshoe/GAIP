hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and today we are playing some ranked with jenks and i've run the double smg setup of the vault and the newly buffed burst fire prower now in season six respawn made these changes to the traveler they reduced the vertical recoil in burst mode and they increased the horizontal recoil in automatic fire mode and it's quite clear that they knew that many players only like to pick the product once they'd found the select fire hopper so they've made a move to change that but honestly the burst fire mode was always underrated it was shredding before this buff now we're putting it to the test today and i hope you enjoy the game thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds miss amigos it's a new area no there's a good amount of people landing in a new area i'll add skyhook and then we'll just rotate yeah yeah but yeah i was wondering i was wondering if you could get contacts with that blue i bet you could are you a contact kind of guy uh well i got really messed up eyes i'm supposed to wear glasses and i that makes it worse right yeah definitely now that i'm older i kind of want to elaborate to start wearing them yeah yeah yeah stop looking after yourself yeah that's not what you wonder if i can get like those those tinted glasses as contacts you know i just think it would be kind of nice okay it would i don't know if that's the thing that i can do i don't know that's a thing or not though being scanned for like that way i think oh yeah in there i mean someone is in here chilling knee through the top window i hear a guy reloading oh that's not you that blue is like kind of close to purple i don't know if you can bother to live there's a path somewhere over here bro 100 i'm hearing a pathfinder walking around keep eyes on the new kill leader that way i think contact with hostile not here here nice job there's a 110 there's a pathfinder somewhere i heard him creeping around do you want to take some of those bullets take them yeah yeah i got 100. is there is there enough no no there was zero i was switching out my my ultimate actually i'm going to craft some ammo first the guy on the animal crafter to the left of it on that wall to your left watch out for the new kill leader friend nice job bro yeah they're they're tuning behind that weird fence thing placing an independent variable more on me close facts none of those were a pathfinder yeah that's so strange there's there's a there's a pathfinder somewhere i'm uh i'm gone i'm telling you i know it's china arranged somewhere he's having a good time he's having a good time like did i tell you might not come out that entire time just surviving over there oh our little closer guy yeah yeah he's just hanging out wait i hear more they're all being dropped this could be the pathfinder team just popping one syringe nice different team obviously so once you get the trap in there [Applause] he's on the roof he's looking at me hey yeah he was yeah did he he said go knock down two let's go uh people fighting in the new place or safety sorry it's like a gold bag from you but that's okay let's go head on over yeah i thought gold bags like it benefits you if that makes sense i thought you know oh wait they're down low they're right here oh nice job dude that's nice nice i just threw all my grenades in that little hole i thought he was gonna be down yeah i saw him a little bit but i didn't know that was him does that make sense makes no sense it made perfect sense don't put me up i think i'm gonna drop my volts i don't have enough bullets i'm dropping my bolts here so i have attachments and i'm dropping some ammo 60 bullets oh thank you yeah go on med kits few throw balls six bats i need some shield cells i guess i'll take those more cells here they're good you know you know they were shooting at somebody when we were coming up yeah i think killed them yeah i don't know what's going on there could be more they were shooting in this direction with a charge rifle to me it looked like they were losing the fight yeah one was down the classic was healing something was going on why would they be winning the fight and then they would just run off whoever whatever it was it's a weird one it's a mystery i've saved my ultimate because i've come to train yard and it could come useful i like that it's a good idea purple flowers everywhere beautiful it reminds me it goes to tsushima ah by the way you should probably go do that i haven't i get comments all the time from that video that's right where we talked about it and people like ghost of tsunami smh wow he said gosu tsunami he's like what do you think he doesn't know ghost of salami yeah ghost of salami [Laughter] i got those two man i had a i had a million of them i was talking to say i was playing i played a game with stay where i said that too and it was like

grabbed a respawn beacon i think i have one as well yeah i have one as well that's good there we go it's real good just in case that's awesome precision it's been a fun lobby this is how the game literally used to be yeah this is sort of crazy but then we'll come across a pred but that's also how it used to be you know you just play against a lot of casual and then there'll be one guy in there that's like the world's greatest dude it's so much fun i remember playing and then you would just randomly run into like touch or johnny you're just like it was like the battle of the ages you know it was so fun but that's the thing too when nobody took it that serious yeah it was just like you just kept running around like we're doing right now we're just running around just playing oh you've been having a good time yeah and so was the other people everybody was and then just out of nowhere it's like oh god yeah end of season two that's what became rough end of season two in the season three when this match came out oh no you want to know when it was when it really cranked up was uh after duos the first time they released duos it was right after that i remember it's clear was that did that happen to me sort of october because i remember taking a break in october november oh my god oh my gosh oh he's so far oh i'm coming uh he's way over there he's not even in zone dude i'm waiting
