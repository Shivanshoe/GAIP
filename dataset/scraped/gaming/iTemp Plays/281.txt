hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some octane who was testing out after his nerf last week now he's obviously still really good but it just feels a little bit less fun to play i don't think they need to change his passive health regeneration personally so today's video is a little bit late in the day and that is because i was playing for hours and didn't really get anything so i went to the shop got some food i came home and i recorded just by myself and unfortunately due to a windows update i didn't actually have any game audio for a really good game that i got when i came home so i've edited that really good game down to about seven minutes and i think it was 22 minutes long i put some chill music in the background until the game audio comes back but if you find it too weird to watch it without game audio then you can skip to about eight minutes in today's video and that's when the second game play starts which is perfectly normal so thanks for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm told the two to four is really good on the flatline but i don't trust myself i mean he's fine at that range with a vault you should be good big scrap gonna launch this careful i went the long way around and i sort of sold my teammates out there it's kind of kind of a bad mistake really i don't have anybody for this i need to kill him within nice teammate you demon careful with that i can't get up top because they just destroyed what are they what are they destroying i forgot the name of the miss little league drum things you know what are you doing nice nice i don't know where the original wraith went but she may have fled the scene to respawn her teammate which i think was the octane i hear people please armor switch please armor switch arm switch tv oh god i hit them for more than they hit me now i got red so they're shook i got no amc's through this i don't even know if it's worth me peaking this angle but oh my word my poor teammate oh my word my paw me i'm going to risk it all i don't care i'm actually going to turn back here because my plan failed forget it oh my god you're still alive i'm not gonna risk it here where the heck did i told you the octane race teammate duo of the aegis uh i don't think my teammate has learned the importance of armor switching because if someone is third partying us there you go they're just gonna die there they are just dead hop down come this way teammate oh my god and they left we knew people around here though i mean that level 28. i knew that was gonna happen i'll see ya i wish i had the charge rifle in this instance i'm trying to find some damage that's all his octane started running over to this side he's getting real mad at me i need to be careful if they crack me this guy's an octane i think it is a lock thing looks like one then they could just pat on my head so i need to be careful about that i just realized you guys have had no game audio 30 seconds till this match gets a whole lot smaller oh my god that's so annoying windows update changes to your like audio settings for no reason so you guys have had no game audio this entire time and it's like 11 p.m and i'm probably gonna have to play another one after this because of that that sucks now i'm tilted now i'm tilted ten minutes and i'm gonna die you're gonna jump down on me here this is gonna suck uh chosen she's got a spitfire man what am i supposed to do here she's got a spitfire all i'm supposed to do she's gonna speed fire decent game three and a half thousand damage didn't have game audio for most of it ggs this guy's just the quickest ever he's just the quickest ever i'll leave her eight oh my god i have it this place is actually stacked it's crazy how good broken is i am going to streamer what do you think is over here i have an either eight with a purple bolt first sorry guys that was the last of that squad good kill friend you're the kill leader congratulations my teammates are struggling i just picked up everything i just dropped in now i absolutely did myself i think if anyone's going to get 30 to us so we need to make a move we just get under them we should be okay i think he's watching me there we go that was the last one took some concentration i was going to pop this because i can't be bothered to full shield cells even though i have dry and as fancy there are definitely people yeah yeah east i don't really have the bullets do too much poke damage [Music] messed up because i didn't realize i was grenading myself i i'll be honest with you i needed to through the entire game but i had trust in my teammate i knew he could get the job done and indeed he didn't need something and i don't need these oh thank you thank you i think they're here i don't know perhaps not it might just be my team i could hear i've had a long day i've had a very long day okay my day just got a little bit longer but we gotta go i think we might click cap my apologies no they just pushed up a recharge just as i said i think we cleared cap it's all getting shot unbelievable that's the beauty of capture you finish one you finish one fight there's another fight waiting for you i'm hoping there's more people around here too because my teammate and i are the ultimate duo would appear all right where do we go now there's a care pack landing in the choke point do we just gonna have a little little cheeky peek the answer might be yes it's actually nice when you're playing as octane and you have an sorry a pathfinder as a teammate because they don't really struggle to keep up especially now that i can't really just spam my um my ability because i don't regen as quick as i used to which is real sad i mean he's almost certainly just going to be purple armor but there's nothing else to do and i'm hoping that someone else wanted this and gets real angry at us i mean there we go purple armor shotgun level three i could use that lava and this area looks unlooted so here we go people are fighting lava what's my this banner like like is this guy demon or what he hasn't got any badges on display but that doesn't mean anything playing like a demon i'm hoping he's got rope again i assume he does where is this fight it's that way yeah yeah it's right here things that's huge so that's an instance i don't want to use a uh a phoenix kit because it's just too long i need to have pad grenade well played teammate you're an absolute demon all of him well played i didn't see that i didn't see the god of beaming i guess he was at this angle which i wasn't expecting because they will find like here sorry be slow i was too fast let me know if you need any bats got the flu that's sad that's not a good time mate i need any zero there you go oh look someone wandered into our safe space he said she he's english we have bonded what about those euros huh we're all sad we lost to italy ah it's making a new friend you know actually nom nom speaking to myself did you guys hear an explosion just to change the topic there was an explosion around these parts hmm i guess we just turn around and get safe check out that care package enemy over there jump head out literally exactly where we just were honestly if you just sit still you'll find fights i'm not on the roof amigo oh yes i think that was the team that was in the window before that my e3 was not here then i'll be honest with you on my word but do you have any of this stuff too no he does okay well i kill people beneath us and this guy so there's one solo definitely because this guy he's down here is he down there it's like here i think yeah he's moving his feet that's sad rings right there so close sorry guys come on come on that's fine no there we go i don't like the vault with the uh did you i don't know why it just feels weird i do not need this many energy bullets at least i can spray though uh i'm gonna take this to the roof and then i'm gonna take this because there is a joe somewhere and our teammate here seems to think there was someone over this way before we left so maybe they're still camping over you somewhere i feel like i've been stealing kills a little bit here like 11 kills there's a little bit of a too complimentary of my uh my gameplay especially compared to my teammates i hope he's got a decent amount because he definitely deserves it okay nice i thought they'd just sort of chilling somewhere like peeking how did you know must have seen him through the glass all right i'm ready to send hopefully they're distracted by this care package he got a hit mark with results oh won a game of apex and i've actually recorded the audio for it what's the time what's the time it's quarter to midnight i've been playing all day gg gg amigo you are the greatest yes we did it you are the apex champions that took a blooming long time big team effort nice the kill distribution was really even as well which is great because i felt like i was stealing but it actually worked out
