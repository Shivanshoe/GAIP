hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and season nine has been out for almost two weeks now and we've had a chance to try everything new in this season i wanted to reflect on how this season is and explain why i think it's actually one of the best ones that apex has ever had i will be saying a lot of positive things just keep in mind that this video is not sponsored by ea in any way these are just my opinions on season nine so let's start with the biggest update arenas this was in the works from respawn for a long time and it shows the economy system is well thought out although i would like a few tweaks i don't think the spitfire should be less expensive than the r301 i don't think the charge rifle should come with a six time scope attached i think some of the upgrades are a bit questionable the gold bag is stupidly cheap which is buffing good lifelines wound rates a lot but overall it's amazing and it's a lot of fun when ranked mode comes out for arena that is when you'll probably see a bit more content from me i think the only game that i've lost on arenas is when so far thought that the game was over when he died in the second round and he left and then our random teammate left and then the duck clap killed me in a 3v1 like three rounds in a row i was i was furious with him to be honest overall though it is a great time and a fantastic addition to apex in my opinion uh the new weapon the bojek bow came out a little hot let's say it was ridiculously good three body shots to purple armor would kill you it was essentially a sentinel with faster fire rate and infinite mag and it's near enough silence so it's a struggle to know where the arrows were coming from especially if they were the third party you didn't even have time to turn around you were just dead respawn did address this and it now deals less damage to the body and you can't carry quite as many arrows uh this weapon is is so satisfying to use though and i quite like that it came out the gate that hot you want new additions to the game to be usable i think the last weapon that was this effective from the get-go was probably the vault which is i think it's good i think it's overall been a good addition now valkyrie's the new legend and i think that she has a good place in the meta she's not overpowered she's not underpowered and her kit is really fun though there really isn't too much to ask for in a new legend release than that because they can always make tweaks the flying mechanics are really well balanced they're responsive but also leaves you vulnerable her ability has potential and it's fun but i rarely do too much work with it if i'm honest and her ultimate has great potential in ranked modes as well i think the other legend changes were great loba is usable low profile is gone which really helps watson lifeline a lot i think horizon was over nerfed if i'm honest and i feel sorry for the horizon uh mains out there but she's probably a little bit too slow on the old gravity lift but hopefully they'll change that in some upcoming patches the map changes to olympus were a little bit underwhelming but we still got a new point of interest and judging from the theme of this season it looks like the infestation is going to grow more and more and we'll see more locations change as the legacy update continues now overall i would give this season a nine out of ten i'm looking forward to ranked mode in arena i'm looking forward to playing more ranked mode on world's edge and i am having a blast with a new weapon and the new legend i'm really interested to see what you guys think about this so leave your comments in the comment section thank you for watching and i'll see you
