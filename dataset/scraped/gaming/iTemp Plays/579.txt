hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and on olympus there is one spot that i've really really wanted to try and take caustic to it sounds like i'm trying to date coursey i just mean i want to play course you can go to this spot and it's a very busy area of the map it's the tight corridors and tunnels underneath hammond labs and it was all going so well it was going to plan right up until i tried to use the wingman properly and then it turned into a disaster if i ever try and use this gun again i want you guys to remind me of this video and i shall promptly leave it on the ground it was not pretty but anyway thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends so that wasn't the team that we were in i think it was it was the same lifeline skin was it oh okay yeah wait no but there wasn't there wasn't a pathfinder oh you're right oh god there they're all on you apparently mate they all landed on me i killed one thank you they're all dead they're all dead mirage hold on oh they all landed on me trying to shoot me in the head mate that was or trying to punch me even that's why i don't i do i just don't land on the uh on the in the middle portion because i feel like it's just so it's so congested i landed there first twice in a row now which is good but i left behind a vault by accident so she picked one up and started shooting me working i've got both guns that have been way easier i heard people hammond by the way did you though or did you just hear a turtle oh they just know they're actually here fighting i think they're in the tunnels that's gonna love a corset trap up top just because i'm i'm a masochist you know i know what that means i've took a risk with that word what does that mean do you know what i mean oh you're asking the wrong person i don't know no clue i took a risk it's a word though it's definitely a word i could i i'll tell you that i'll tell you that much yeah he's awarded his wife yeah it is that's what i told him i'm the worst gamer of all time i'm so bad i'm honestly the worst thing i think they're gonna appear from here they are 19 on a lifeline i think it was they're both broken i think i think uh they're trying to thirst me yes okay wait excuse me use me are you kidding me oh i'm going to try i think i got a scan from somewhere though all right resume isn't raising raising grace coming in i think garcia is leaving you i'm just playing don't die uh he's almost he's making his way to his box he's one by one making his way to his box if you i swear to god easy type of title dude maybe there's so much loot there i have 19 rows i probably should have waited some they're on top they're up top oh

what else i have guess what i have that's what else i have uh oh two longbows i just have a mozam but i got purple armor um i got guns now i'm just trying to find ammo what am i trying to find i don't know what's going on get out of here i'm coming back i've had the call i'll be there sooner or later that's that team i got up top he's going crazy you're going crazy he's not going crazy he hasn't i don't think anyone's up there anymore nope he's going crazy hopefully they drop in his head yeah i'm gonna drop him a couple down here real quick purple i do that all the time for you you know you just just just a little pick me up you know i appreciate that sometimes i need that you know especially after that wingman play in fact i don't want to be here i'm getting flashbacks are you about to leave again i might be i need energy ammo i mean that's the player i have zero shield cells but one batch so that's all you need in life i have six cells i'll drop you a couple do you have any bats though you don't have any bats then no i don't oh yeah yeah i hear a car but it's probably a turbine so yeah i most definitely is wait oh yeah i don't really have much ammo so we gotta kill this team fast i have i have 44 energy and 200 likes you need any light uh he's like 40 light i have 66 extra 16. thank you oh scratched in time far off i got my ultimate huge humongous big plays i'm just showing stuff i know what are you even saying i don't know i'm trying to hide the teamer can you see anything i can't see no i'm blind uh lifeline or race just away nice oh oh my god laser beams oh god oh what is this angle this man's holding that is kind of crazy wait one below turn left it's almost broken max i'm just going up watching it all damn it's going to pop on coming up oh god come on over there friends oh i kind of shot this horizontal oh give me that one clip was there a guy on the right i thought i saw a movement oh there was an octane somewhere but i don't know where he went is having all night oh energy i took the vault and energy let me know if you need it i have 200 energy i didn't i didn't want to take your red for obvious reasons i heard a few shots this way wait wait wait wait wait wait yes please i thought i had all the energy it was you yeah i was gonna say i was like i don't think you got any of that uh there's a mag right there too and then um my new york pink i just got a kill hey is that probably the right left of something i heard i heard shots that way that might be the octane yeah i thought i saw a movement this way too zero light rounds hold on hold on oh my gosh i think i'll play nice the telstar is kind of crazy honestly if it's one of those guns but i don't like to use it but whenever i commit to it it's like okay i should do this i'm stupid there's like those there's those situations where you just beam somebody that you would never beam like last season okay if you can feather the trigger as well that's the buffs we'll focus on feathering the trigger yeah make it easier to cool down do you need anything um maybe some cells just like i probably had some f12 i just wasn't looking i didn't know what i was looking for it's catching my accuracy there thank you i was trying to scratch you nah there was a well i've noted you're appreciating the horizon and she was like going upwards my aim is like you know when you're sensitive it's just too slow and you're always like a little bit behind them i only feel like that on uh on pc whenever i run into those people who just got like the demon straight and whoa do you want that one that's crazy yeah i agree and you're just trying to like move your aim really slow if it was like okay right here oh my goodness he's broken he broken one more oh in fact i think it's a bangalore there's nothing more satisfying than the third party coming in and then they just like have to turn around and run away just absolutely rolling them so satisfying oh you were in serious i thought you were going to commit to it again no why would i do that because it's content you were popping off last game i was doing all right and then that happened he was probably so confused he's like okay he's talking bruh i'm so sad dude i didn't care about the loot but when he res me in the middle of like just that door where there's 45 nades and 14 people have losses i was just like wow when i literally altered the pipe the safety he's actually like amazing he all did the inside and then he's like nope i'm out here you probably thought i'm invisible yeah like maraud i feel like there's always those mirage players who think his is rez is good when it's just it's just not good it's not a good dress i'm not good i already think that wait look at that look at the mini map we have we are we are the trifecta we've said we need a triangle we're the most confident players in the game until i die oh i found him oh no you're alone if you didn't already know stand there please i think she does i'm here with you though that's all i noticed yeah mate what's this it's this is so i literally thought there was a glitch i thought i saw two people down this way he almost you almost lasted didn't you yeah i was gonna find a complaint literally in mid game yeah i mean you you got you just got so bamboozled what are you stealing so many kills for what is the real what is the real reason what is the only reason behind you stealing so many kills taking all of my glory and my hard work what is the real um well i am playing caustic so i thought i'd be extra toxic and wait for you to reload and quickly start shooting that makes perfect sense it's just on he cosplay
