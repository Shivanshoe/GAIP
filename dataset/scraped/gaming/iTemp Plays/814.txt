hey what's up guys its rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today was the first time I had the conundrum which one is better the red shields the evil shields are new to the game all the gold shields which have been the best item in the game since the start of season 3 now both have their benefits of course the fat cells in my opinion is probably a little bit too fast they could just increase it by like even 20% would be a really good buff like a good reason to try and seek out gold armor but on the other hand you have the red Evo shields when you fully upgrade them which I do fairly quickly when I when I pick them up in the game that you're about to watch and in a pure 1v1 well you don't have time to fall back and heal obviously the Evo shields have the edge so it's a difficult one in my opinion I reckon the Evo shields have totally better on someone like lifeline who already has some sort of fast heal and also she doesn't have an easy escape route out of fights to even hear that to begin with but I do love the new item it rewards you for aggressive play and he just turned you into a little bit at a mini tent let me know what your thoughts are in the comment section down below but thank you for watching I do appreciate it in RC war in five and a half seconds my friends these readies my friends and this should be it a fairly hot drop here add a jar lift it in the first place you can lunch and I've been rewarded we all right - sure batteries not bad any of the weapons in here please have a pointed be good no not a single half decent weapons no armor in that building what team have got two level twos though an are we 45 alright the loop right this is why Noah's landing geezer okay mystery solved my friends another mystery solved here on the channel I'll do g7 I got double tap as well as orbits Happy's of course they're endless at the moment but it's know something at least still trying to make a mental note out of everything in fact here we go hemlock single fire you know what what am i doing I've been re fortified I use the hemlock I saw like media range and the havoc is extremely good I like close to medium ranges well somewhat any terrains somewhat any trains here as well hello friend all right let's looking it's all right to be fair it's not too bad hemlock havoc I've got a double barrel stabilizer only level 1 shields I know there's a fair few places now I know a fair few were purple shield spawns you know on walls edge I tell you what though I'm really enjoying the loot mechanic at the moment I can know where things are going to spawn so that's why I cook about that proud of the pipe cannot be bothered I've made two videos recently one each about the hemlock and the havoc so it's time to put my money where my mouth is I've gotta have to stick to this loadout name not a soul has landed a gator and you can probably see why shields are lacking and my team has a fairly far away but the good news is we can reunite pretty quick I would assume they have to come this way more towards scrapped or city anyway and if I bump into any issues I need to stop trying to unlike this small list of objects the old wall jump if it's too small I've got a stop trying because it just looks awful if you fail it that's the only problem actually send it for so uh she's coming over this way that's good what's all got spooked little bit there my teammates have got decent armor it's just me that's struggling unfortunately it's looking like this is mainly looted scrap it's all the purple arm spawn cost aways looted or invoice in these Telstar alternator no shields probably not worth landing here though yeah that's what I was aiming at cheers now you face my attachments all over the place I'm getting involved here there's still thought on people just to get involved name will be improve the time shield there still no level don't was struggling friends that's a big scrap by distance over use it to prop smart going down in everything obtains a lovely far right with the rice here that's up a little bit carefully level one shields and sort of solar at the moments okay I've got this investment you didn't even know don't shields actually know what they spawn don't shield man there we go God shields immediately I mean and I try to land where the gold shields actually spawn would these here before did i scroll past the modes they just not load in I feel like they weren't that alright D snow scrap teammates good job Oh what I landed where the gold shields are there's just so many people there it was it was just messy I got punched yeah it wasn't pretty it was like that it's like a Rocky movie I've got a bit of PTSD for me buddy field here post-traumatic scrap disorder that's what it was oh there we go you sweet teammates I've buy him loads but he's probably gonna heal up by the time you get there unfortunately so if you get over there he's full health then that's that's the explanation I did him that alas with all my bullets I don't carry on this is a top tier weapon I'm a huge hemlock fan why 16 men that's the question we need to be asking ourselves is that teammates come up there as well he's gotta support tonight's fine in yeah that's fine I made the executive decision I knew I was gonna take the bad end of that trade but I knew my team I was flanking so I just wants to do as much damage like hurt and then just use a shield battery sorry team I'm reloading reloading there we go dog end up going down because I'd really like to like a full longer Manta stop spinning up the chamber again we've got shields okay he's taken it's pretty for the best if you know I saw the fall shield here it's one teammate you speaks me out should I my tailor drop those Evo shells look he's got purple those Evo shields won't be too pleased like that I'm tempted some gratis how many game is up with the gold shield herb I had loads hundreds not hundreds a fair few how many games are the Evo heels of a hat like one Matson wait not that rooftop this box guy someone better have Evo shields I'm telling you the Box disappeared my teammates down come on I think I just fell down third party done as long as the race stays alive we should be okay unfortunately my evo shields are the same as the level 1 shield at the moment that's not good at all it survives one well I don't think we've had enough time to revive - where are my shots then I really miss that many hey chase it's always scary that I think of it's always scary it's a Pathfinder because you know that if they get a decent grapple they're right on your tail and they make no noise when they're flying through the area that I have known heavy rains hey friend I gotcha they decided to revive instead of from chasing parties are they not getting fur parted I got my pan off see hear them beneath me that's the cost eek I swear I heard someone shooting them from behind package being delivered this would be okay unfortunately our team banner disappeared I mean if we have that scrap before I drop my god shields and run away I had loads of maybe rains beautiful I don't I don't think we lose that because I nearly 1 V 1 V 3 done so if I was there my teammates were there we would have been okay unfortunately I had to I was looking for the TiVo shields for half now all right it's the first time however I've ever had or read eos 225 half I've got hopefully these guys have already heard me might be smites try and avoid them six squads 13 so that's 5 squads 12 so sort of at least matter people missing here they go why if they got the tank east guys in the world this is too unlucky I don't think I can challenge that it's a it's a core stick and a Gibraltar the only two characters that I can think of they are the only two characters right but take 15% reduce damage then Travolta's got his 50 damage 80s shields with this fast heal fast revive bubble no I was gonna use that pre spawn beacon there's still one left I think if that was any other members of a team even if he switched out to core stick for someone I think I'm I think I can at least this one of them here we go she's trying to port on it there breeze spawning team back to their loot about five kalsa main five kills of three hundred days I'm thirsty skill I'm getting the kill 95 I can't go inside for two reasons one they'll project off me and to this of course you can scrap their boyfriend you get out of that brings close near 15 and against that party [Music] my shields charge surviving rings closing I'm not interested in trying to they should die in this storm I think I forgot to get kill credit here see my next to me it's got Evo seals as well I can't even hit me too much otherwise I mean he's gonna get a revive anyway we hurry those shields fine then I'll trace this caustic Dame gonna have to I don't want to I need your ends are so scarce at the end of the game there I mean I've got two single-shot weapons now another hemlocks are burst but I don't really fancy using in burst mode oh hey friend he's drawn up for some loot bless him and he's run off play some plays any traps name what I've was clearly here must have been the one that was respawned I don't the L star yeah it's probably worth it I'm it's fine I've got my ulti as well something get there quicker and then get back quicker I mean if I get caught and saw me and I am a female it's not too far right though right it's just a sublime and I think I drop to that IO release people are scrapping pac-man one for to go himself kill pretty sure I don't Pat man twice already half man half Pat of course I names people with any drones already what a fool watch someone else's nickname there we go beautiful sixty spare that's fine three of his squads left I might have to pick up like an eye 99 or something they have Russian someone a few minutes someone okay they've turned around when it's not for me for some reason please don't rush me I'm sir a lone ranger just let me stay on the outskirts that's all on one darn it can't help myself you have to shoot the bass that I've shown you I don't even know why I'm trying that they've rushing someone else now finally through the air but I think I must have an octane write that was I can obtain jump pad I think one needs a 999 there we go live in XNA max it's a good job I picked up that level too then as you have no extended mag at this stage I'd say that looks safe you finger D shows up on the radar and you can sort of tell where it is I don't need these two teams to fight and I'm gonna look I'm gonna come out I'm gonna come out of the shadows it's my best bet I can't take on this team of three they just revive so fast is it just gonna close or is it gonna force my party for summer for they'll be I shouldn't push I mean they're scrapping a little bit kind of someone's sending up the caustic traps me and eliminated ice we got this team and then the team I think the issue is the team top because they're a team of three and they have the advantage at the moment where you rush me oh yeah well I don't think they know I'm here I'd even push off the building for that I mean I think I think uh files on their team I think how many people drop down try to get more involved its back may come in useful all right they've down one surely gonna push that they're still not pushing that the limit team on topics of educational dictaphone is actually safe fine eternally extra quiet okay they've just finished to kill one of them Oh it's ultimate at everything who killed me don't tell me that's the team that flanked us the team that I downed about four times but I just could not push level 268 Gibraltar is the same team one for two I just couldn't push them with the Corsicana Gibraltar on the same team the fast revives the fast heals underneath the the dome and everything and the 15% damage reduction on both them good grief we tried we tried we were 69 damaged away from 4,000 as well which would have been nice to get it doesn't matter too much not gain 4,000 cuz everybody got the badge so sunny it would've only been a nice thing it's not completely necessary I'll have such a good game though the red shields I mean having the gold shields that would have been worse at the end because I didn't have enough time to heal I just have to try and tank that is where the red shields come in clutch thank you for watching though I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
