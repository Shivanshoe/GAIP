while ago uh they brought it back last week but they had to disable the mode as it was glitched somehow and now it's back once more but it's actually one of my favorite modes and i think that they will bring this mod back in the future to test out up-and-coming abilities we saw mirage's new ultimate in this mode first i'm also playing my friend benny whose link will be in the description of course uh and also this video doesn't have a facecam i am trying to make it more of a norm on the channel but it doesn't because when i record on pc it just messes up for some reason technical difficulties my friends i will figure it out okay but thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds miss amigos all right here we go you're gonna find a gold uh a gold vault right off the rip honestly i think i prefer the gold either i'm running down you get the gold divo uh i found it like the other day around here oh no i missed i've got our 301 is

you have them is that one then you keep it uh yeah just pick just ping it and then oh in that building yeah yeah sorry i'm here all right i was like looking in this little building things are a bit astray i was like i'm going crazy just losing your mind looking for this blue armor oh i'm behind this guy if you can put a few shots into this right yeah i'll just kind of where was he was he up top he's right on me okay he's looking at me mate you got that i'm going to make but there we go there's a yellow guy coming in as well uh i'm coming over i'm just gonna have to come over in melee though okay the worst not having an extended mag i'm just there reloading people's faces nice job there we go let's go rich this guy's got fresh blue oh mate this guy's got a vault as well i'll take that thank you very much take all of oh my god this guy had the dream i'm gonna go massive uh ben i picked you a level three extended energy what where where where oh wait i'll drop it for you hold on

cracked him let's jump in let's go put fireball down they're reloading it should be okay cool gray well rich let's go after mate you're racking up the kills right here we go what we're gonna get some heavy ammo it's not exciting i have six med kits so if you need any they're in here yeah let's be honest i could use a medkit syringes right now there's a load in there yeah i have seven kills whoa okay yeah you're racking up somebody said you're good yeah you're gonna get the 20 bomb with the uh dummy with the dummy you're gonna get the 20 bomb dummy badge that's actually going to be so depressing if it's true i need a shotgun ball if you find on me i feel like i've walked past a few but i don't know where i got i've got loads of health meds oh i am when are we going to use all right the big question we've got to ask ourselves is when are we going to use our um what do we want ultimate yeah it's literally a panic station button so i'm going to use it what are the three what are the three it's the all right the mirage ultimate where you spawn a load of decoys so try and escape and confuse your opponents then you've got the big area of effect here um right and then which effects enemies too and the final one is the pinata loot you just want to lowly loot on you i kind of want to just do it and get a pinata let's see which one you get guys you're going to get a decoy you ready yeah he's going to be doing it i knew why i don't want a dance party now you just looking for all sand at each other i feel like oh triple take up on the roof yeah yeah don't worry i've got dan's fighting me oh nice job got another one that should be one of them that's so difficult after everyone's going to decide the weapons for the uh to counter that i made it to them nice i'm gonna push with you i need a shotgun ball it's the mastiff is actually depressing with that shotgun bolt yeah it's so slow without it i think he's down though i think he might have fallen down i i might i might be going for the rest i haven't i'm missing i've only got one kill he might have jumped down and gone for the res i think i heard him this way my audio is so low if i was him i would go there and go for the reds yes look the guy's flying up over there i think he ran off honestly he might try and wrap around him yeah i'll get him charge rifle in the back oh yeah right there maybe there he is is he has he got trouble taking a charge rifle or is this a different guy i don't know it must be a different guy oh my god oh any shotgun pinata what's that oh there's a respawn beacon any shotgun falls for the boys wait they're big scrapping that's not us no i like that oh should we get involved in the mixer yes let me get a ah oh they're right below us directly below i thought i heard him around here somewhere he's losing that body correct he's throwing a nice job i knocked him i might half yeah i'm going to hop off because there's a cup there's quite a few things down here we could probably find something good his teammates pulling nearby one more stream oh turbo charger let's go that's what i wanted nice yeah guys i'm mate i currently i got an extended mag oh yeah it's time to try for me the storm's coming in we can just leave it i don't want got a shotgun bolt so i'm going free hey he didn't have a shotgun ball what an absolute scam the journey for the shotgun honestly he's all i need rock and bolt ah level two stock sport do you a little spawny thingy i'm going to give you a loot pinata and i'm going to give you a level three shotgun bolt you ready if this happens i'll be the most grateful dummy on this man my friend okay this is going to be the great the gray dummy of grade armies here we go i'll take a level one in three blue pinata oh loot pinata ah it's the most disappointing thing oh that would have been sick in a gunfight though they're fighting you would have healed them as well wouldn't we so yeah which way should we go should we go i'm going to go training there's fights down the tre train yeah all right county that's in there at least two themes aren't down there should we head that uh we can just wait we've got two minutes yeah let's do it let's do it if it was like a minute i'd say let's wrap around and go say yeah two minutes all right we might one thing we might want to just go into the tunnel and hold them force them to run at us no they they can go down the stairs they can go down the oh why don't you mean you can't just yeah yeah i think it will work because then their bottle their bottleneck towards us i do like that they added these um this they're kind of like uh trains in there uh yeah like more cover like he's just here standing still all right he's all yours unfortunately i don't have anything any names he's got here for 70 at the back all that emergency heal actually just gonna it's gonna save them too though unfortunately i just got destroyed have their teammate can hold oh i think i wasn't really with us there's two on me told me a red and a blue sort of having a little pink here so actually you've got this i feel like i should do like a country right last guys here it's coming behind you rich nice yes you don't need a shotgun bolt rich oh still a shotgun bowler's mastiff only one squad left hopefully they're not gay keeping us because i'll be very sad wait who got the shotgun here was like it was it him there was a load of shotgun people around here no way no one's got a shotgun ball i'm actually raging ben world's rare scream someone must have won surely i must have passed one i'm gonna get screamed in the comments double like how how have you not seen the picked up the shotgun bolt here i must have missed one i think i missed one early in the game too but that's when i didn't have a shotgun i i honestly think we might get a gap kick down download the storm so we need to be right should we go what do you want to do do you want to wrap right or go through the hole level three shotgun bolts oh honestly right let's let's wrap right yeah we gotta go now our teammate's splitting up oh god to be fair i don't think you can actually work though it could work it could end up going there we could pull it in and then he's going to come in from behind yeah maybe oh my god i'm only just going to make this yeah it's a bit it's a bit sketchy it's looking sketchy are you good on them are you good on sure i've got most stuff i got i've not got shield batteries but i've got um actually no i think i'm pretty good on most things i dropped your shield back it's because it's so so grab it now i can i've got my uh alt as well so oh nice oh i got mine too i got a gold helmet all right where is that team i was fine so it's a bit of a pointless detour from your boys but okay here we go should we cross the area nice supply drops coming in how many hills you want i'm on 12. oh no game little game right loot pinata oh for god's sake we don't even need luke to be honest you should have saved that mate what luke could we get i don't know you may as i just want a loot pinata i've had a decoy and i've had a peel i've just not had my pinata i'm going to say mine if it's going really bad i'll just try it and then it's going to be the loop and you're guaranteed all right we've got a bit of high ground here and we've got we've got map position oh no i don't think so they have um they have three people yeah i'm gonna rough around left right i'll rotate with you stick on numbers confuse them with the grayness oh yeah i think we're two teams i think they may have they're looking they're looking up here they do have high ground on us at the moment so hopefully they don't see us i'm gonna hire you to say you might have missed us we are great i'm just hiding because i'll hear our footsteps i think they may have already heard right there oh god ben i'm ready let's come around nice job blue hit flew of hitler oh god it's his close wall close wall close walk down two yeah let's go nice job benjamin that was perfect we were just lurking there going like way the decoys were scaring me i'll be honest the decoys were scaring me i can't believe they get two decoys the perfect ones and we just get dance parties when we don't need it in healing circles i think they had two decoys and then i decoyed i think there was 18 dummies involved in that fight that's not bad you know 19 kills mate you did five kills for 1400 damage i know i was i was involved in the mixer i just wasn't getting the kills if there was an assist it would have been right up there i'd be competing with ali for the best yeah you might have been actually that's a fun game
