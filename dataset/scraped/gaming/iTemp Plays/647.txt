hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i am back on a playstation i haven't played a single game of season six on console so these are my first games on and i feel like i adapted to the game pretty quick because if you don't know uh consoles have like a higher amc setting than controller on pc and this is because on pc you get better performance like a lower input lag you get higher frames so to compensate for that to make it fair for amazon keyboard players they've reduced the aims it's on there a little bit in there and i think it's actually pretty fair to be honest and one of the main reasons i'm back on console is uh i'm i miss my air loops i have every heirloom on console but i do not have every alum on pc i've only got octane on pc but go forward you can expect some pc some console gameplay from here on out probably depending on who i'm playing with and one last thing before i let you get into the video i use the facecam in this video but unfortunately my camera ran out of battery for the final few minutes but if you want me to continue using a face cam just let me know your thoughts in the comment section but yes thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh there's at least like two three teams here yeah it's kind of popping off today teammate get off me please i managed to land in the same place you guys i'm sorry i've got two shield batteries and no gun of course i don't have a shield this dude has a blue armor though don't worry about me oh this one's got purple so that i'll do one better mate i'll see yeah i've been grappled oh you're better enemies oh i didn't make it that's embarrassing i think there's a bangalore yeah the bangalore's got purple she's probably reviving right that audio is so weird give me my grapple if i had it i'd have been up there straight away that's right nerd are they down low i have no clue i have 20 shots that looks like 16 health got one enemy taken down no heavy no shield right in the opening yeah i did it all the time that's literally me oh you did i i literally changed the bind from my crouch because of that oh yeah i i um i still managed to panic punch mine's my punches on circle wait if i revive you now you can get like wait how do you panic punch if you're if you're when i'm it happens when i'm in a box so i try and punch to get out of the box and then i think i punched twice or i don't know but i'm always like yeah playmakers left right and center yeah that happens to me all the time that's kind of fun i nearly set myself on fire but apart from that it was good yeah the thought with that because it really matters take forever the um the crowd is just such a ludicrous weapon you don't need anything do you have anything on it at all oh naked no oh my god nike i control death she does not control me makes sense first time i play caustic i'd die off spawn it's the uh the trial by fire uh these guys were kind of stacking yeah they had everything like i had an l star that was literally it yeah i mean that guy on you i just wait there's a g7 here recharging i think i left the loot trying to get you back in time for it then he just hovered it all the way he did you can't blame him for it but let me know if you need some heavy oil i have 200 heavy a lot of light um i'm chilling i'm actually yeah yeah there's actually nice thank you thank you you need to ping the knockdown i wasn't texting to me we should do the the old macro scan oh nice yeah there we go uh market in the cage water market cage everyone else like there's a pub there's a bunch of people north east as well there's two full teams just chilling at cave yeah yeah because there's four arrows there here if we go mark it we should get a bunch of a bunch of people fighting yeah oh yeah i am i'm following you ready to go still got nothing on my power though i don't care literally all of this is unloaded but i'm going in i don't know how i feel about playing cowstick uh your mind will change once we get into an engagement in a building you'll be loving life he's actually so fun that's the thing with him like people think he's boring because he's like defensive but he's fun i mean well i can only play him offensive so it's it's fun even one game yeah even the one game that i i think that i got the 20 in the 4k with him i was i think i had like 23 kills and like 5 000 damage and i was just running at everybody lobbing traps to their feet seeing in like an aggressive caster is probably one of the scariest things you're camping in a building all of a sudden he's also comes through the window you see him sly jumping and screaming it's terrifying a wall jump corsic trap placement where do all the teams go that's the problem with that map room scan it's like okay oh the team's about me oh where are you okay come on come on wait here i go yeah there is i was trying to zip line on the old stalactites but i'm messed up i have no shield so i'm not gonna push i'm just gonna i have a triple pick i'm just gonna be a little i have four chilled cells and that's it i reckon i see that's got a bunch of stuff i need an extended heavy neck might be something good this cancel that i found each of that there oh there's a lot going on over here breathe it in i'll see this is where cause it's fun if they're in that building that you're in now like you're having a good time oh yeah one's down low where is everyone everyone just ran away as soon as they heard me oh my climbing or something yeah i messed up i missed every shot there don't worry i'll say him that's where the priority in burst mode is kind of tough at that sort of range like up close like shotgun range it's so good definitely there's a lot of people over here there's like four teams yeah there's a bunch oh go ow ow oh no well make it fired they see me in this corner i'm scared that guys too stop pushing i don't know where he is he's across the other side but i don't know i don't know where oh i really want to loot that but he's just waiting for me to loot him i i might just do it anyway am i baiting him with it see if he challenges i will i'll dive on his head he's up top he's up top he's up i've seen him i've seen him i have no shield bats but i have no shields whatsoever oh yeah he's hiding behind a bunch of rampers shields oh there's two of them i'll just loop back here what am i doing i'm gonna literally just need i have no shield cells or anything i'm coming over uh all right i can drop some in here why are you still kidding me are you yeah crazy inside because there's a lot of people yeah i might quickly i reckon i can probably get that loot name all right can you can you get to me no i'm gonna i'll just this guy is flat over a here these guys are literally he's just camping his little shield i'm coming over i'll be i've got good stuff are there two teams there um i don't know but i am definitely dead no no i got you i got you back to him i actually can't see bats because i was useless oh that was such a weird fight because they were just holding they literally were not doing anything else they had fully embraced the rampart style of play yeah 100 i mean i'm glad you were cool because you got them off that roof i almost i was like one hp at one point my spine still must fight uh purple gold massive i should probably take a longer range gun rather than a massive i don't care this is working out for me wait i have five shots there you go 21. i'm good i'm good uh shotgun i'm gonna oh yeah i have a zero do you need some i don't know alternator yeah i've alternated probably oh i see i think the only shotgun that i'll actually use um is the ua i don't know how you don't like the domestic thing it's so fun i just care i never used to like the pc i still don't like the peacekeeper that much i think i honestly think i'd prefer this mastic to the care i didn't like the pk even when the pk was out i like the pk i'd always die to it but i could never get kills yeah it was just i don't know i just don't like the way the shotguns and snipers feeling uh in this game yeah i mean the snipers i get definitely but i'm alright up top target over there yep nope do you have a uh dude against on the back though we don't have to say this fight we don't want to go is that's nice that was that was an insane ending there was like four teams three four teams all there that was a fun game in general every i think they had like three main fights but every fight had like three or four teams in it [Music] i mean caustic is i feel like whenever you play caustic you just farm damage and you don't get much kills i think that's just the caustic life and i think when you use two close range guns that are massive and proudly they're not poke weapons if you're in a gunfight and you kill them like you you've done 200 damage yeah and that's yeah they're going down 100 rows like a g7 you know they can shield that back up that was a fun game mate i enjoyed that one yes that was that was that's that was are you those are you i did like 200 more damage than you you're like you were the only guy on the team
