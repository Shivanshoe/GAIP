hey wassup guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and Jenks is wrong about this let's fire havoc okay I'm just gonna go ahead and say don't watch these videos he'll leave it on the ground like it's earth like a level 1 stock now again that I have for you today isn't some select fire playful carry I don't get 25 kills with the Select Bible it does show a little bit of why I do enjoy using this service hop up it's a low risk high reward strategy it's great for engaging in a fight to do some poke damage it's great for sniping people at long range without having to actually carry a sniper round and once you hit them a few times you've grabbed them their heads turn to full auto again and that day is completely ruined now I need to see jank USENIX sometime soon are you guys know that my G fuel code is 30% off until Monday here are three people who tweeted me pics of them using my code if you tweet me a pic of the actual code being used I haven't missed it by doing maximum of three shout outs at a start video link to use this is in the description if you're interested so thank you for watching I do appreciate and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends Hey sorry I thought I was gonna be quicker but I had about four cups of tea so hey a whole team landed over there near me / oh my god a Bangalore - I'm the scrappin in here and - there's another team that way he just left you kill that guy that's funny when you're a bomb friend [Laughter] oh let's go right in front of me I just have no shields but I'm still coming nice words I just on three people think about it all right well I've got a selects fire on my house there is like a dozen white armors where we landed okay thank you cuz you boys do be struggling okay there we go those three in the same supply be like Plains wine it's not around there's a good bed all you just must have picked a blue on it right I did yeah ask okay so you just came back handled the business and we're on to the next I'm on to the next nothing even happened oh there in front of me bloomer caused a friend credit bonds traded this gun is not fair in any sort capacity she's lacking nice she opened the door and I thought I took down before she was even on my screen I think I didn't see it kind of the door she disappeared PK 9 PK 9 I like my head is still not in the game got a quick question for you yes sir you know how some guns are good to be like the one time sage conferred like that ring yeah for example I would like the on the PK I like I'm your 99 do you like it under the habit or do you just use the iron sights I don't mind I don't mind the hollow on anything alright what the universe or but like the circular one yeah yeah cuz I can't use on some guns me crazy horrendous on the wing man for example one times like holographic okay okay the way that ends the exception yeah you go yeah yeah the wing man is the exception it's the only one that I won't put it on but I don't mind yeah I don't mind putting it on any other gun but the wing man but I don't know most of time I don't put her on anything though cuz I don't mind the iron sight the only kid there's only one Gunners game that I can't stand the iron sight on it and the Cisco escape what about this we fire these social things out I don't really use this before anymore to be honest is not real plus what I pick it up I ever I have a tendency of just hipfiring it over there hold on I got your sink oh yeah nice nice no you're a second I love him slow on shields and he 446 nice let me down someone's on me I think he's got a peacekeeper he's come and see I think he just took like an octane jump pad really did he did he come to or did he go away I don't know I don't hear if you don't hear him mr. pike or someone got responded scrapping and Here I am okay nice and every fight he had a 900 PK to my man he knows he's stuff I've got a spectator I'm gonna tree him here I'm gonna do the wall jump the wall bounce okay nice do it do it do it and he saw the failure it was a risk and you were willing to take it I liked all lights I was like yeah he doesn't know that yeah I was like I was like in shame and defeat so I'm pretending to be IFK I felt like someone came in the room hopefully he bored I don't know that don't you stop bastards I'm too short yes thank you I don't know where these guys when I saw the portal and they came over here now they're gone my hair ever disappeared yeah yeah sometimes you know you're gonna hit a huge bat ball and you have to make some sort of sound effect oh yeah right here yeah dude give it it dude yeah if it's not a little floppy guy the bigger ups are so satisfying okay him twice 422 singer won't be one okay nevermind their beach shot by smells oh mighty Sun x5 pyrovile time that's my all right here we go now we got more I think I'll stop them from coming not that one one shot yeah they got a righty mother chaining the bush chillin in the bush yeah I remember did I tell you did I say this already join me when that the bush came out in four nights begin with I literally thought this is game breaking if this is like the grace I'm on the game it was so fun I loved it I came with something else to saut I still like for tonight like if I could go back in the day and play the original it would be amazing yeah this new for tonight I don't know I like the game but I feel like the playerbase took it oh they're in front of me they're too good now yeah that weights a good night the kids are waiting to go to the game ballads which we saw that robot that's good smart man do I have 6 your batteries and 8 shield cells I can't help but feel that the cells are a bit useless we did get him out of there I'm on 7 bats myself yeah stuck isn't even enough to shield me up fully it's not worth it isn't it it's not ooh more hold on I'm mostly quiet they're gonna be to our right as we take the probe somewhere over here I saw one crossing the street in here did he make it in maybe he made it in over there oh yeah I saw one I saw one crossing the street he might have made it across I don't know I think so there's no way this is a slight way there is slight way it could have had these little rooms when they empty I'm gonna go to the fighting there the fighting like cage okay okay could you say there is a scrap in the distance there is a scrap in the distance you got I can't roll my arms like you do though so it's not quite the same no no I had the same effect guess the message across they are screaming they're really going in least stuff to nighlok's what is that maybes French nice less stuff it's worse than mining already when I was down and it's under the course see on the right slide name is its flesh like right here okay he's got your man maestro Mikey's goal I am kind of bad you baby top baby I'm still around the corner uh yeah I'm super good it was uh that was a near-death experience though I'm getting scouted by a QB which isn't my favorite combo to fight okay well here you're gonna get weird with it Oh constantly there's a team on the bottom as a team there was a team inside and there was a team on the bottom where y'all at what's going on here are they still on the bottom they must be oh no rear on it there's a guy underneath me to keep okay for you I'm grabbin all this guy's head sure that's pretty much I just got to person oh my god is he a pilot they weren't even on the same team yeah so Bangalore a few around semester right they were all on different teams we'd won oh yeah you've got my thinking you got gold yeah two squats left I think I think I just saw Krypto yeah I see them oh here we go drinks here we go hold on Oh what's happening are you buddy what are you doing I'm at three cents at one with the Select Fort Halleck you were actually that close I gave Mike went really quiet it was muffled talking into a wall there was so far I saw like this nice to be a crypto drone and then was scanning around like that area huh maybe one definitely felons nice local produce nyeeehhh they're gone did a storm head junk I swear I did this had to be this had to be the guys that I saw at market now maybe add that you can churn that it's all timing it has to be talking at all times yeah I'm going to do a bit of looting yes sir I'm just gonna keep running around I'm gonna recon this I'm gonna go ping the go ping the beacon maybe a crate variable does oh they're on it they're on it all right nice come on out level one Evo this time oh thanks Oh No okay if you aren't fighting you don't think of the Evo shields is my advice I agree because you've hit on Gary which is fair enough but you've got level 1 self
