hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the video that i have for you today is a little different okay i was at the start of the game me and the teammates we weren't getting on we were ready to fight we're ready to scrap it out right there on olympus then just a few minutes into the game we'd already bonded and a great friendship had formed between all three members of the squad and we went on to have a beautiful game i hope you guys enjoy this one thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all five and a half seconds me amigos oh my god we're here oh my god okay i'm back and then he did everything all right i've looted everything i looted one bean you had two what are you talking about what do you look like looted everything i lifted one bin stop being afk for three seconds chill out i'm so cracked chill out i watch you i love you dude he just totally red jeez god you guys got me heated up here i was ready for a fist fight i love your videos i was ready to kick off not so fast i got him just about enemy on me just about me i need this i need this choice i get all the stuff i needed i got scared i thought there was another team i got him recharging shields i don't really have that much damage here i need to thirst more than enemies shield we routed that squad as well i think seth the south african accent is one that i'm really bad at identifying i know a lot of south african i think a lot of south africans playing the london servers because uh there isn't one in africa which kind of sucks just there are they foreign i'll go for the big boy play yes i can think of many ways to put this trident to use we will be quiet so close i didn't get the 24 okay we're good we're good good good i have 7 kills and six hundred damage they're coming down time they're gonna they're all gone again they're gonna get stunned are they not where'd they go bad guys ready for a fight it's 7 p.m and i've had all of that today's a smoothie so i'm listening i'm on edge here reloading there's a guy here too nice my shots enemy down oh that's what it's for using the phoenix is that slither of health i need i need that one health fair taking a moment necessary i'll cut him off okay that was 12 people left this game like it ends so quick now again we can probably drop the teddy i have 10.5 charging up this time i'm gonna finish animation good shots my teammates actual just do demons where is this oh god we're just too good cut down an enemy shields are depleted this is ridiculous but it's okay uh oh predicted he was going way faster than he actually was he's still gonna have to back though i think good job he said that oh just using a phoenix kit again that same middle's not looking so we should be okay recharging what the heck is happening here no they can't can't see me this is ridiculous i think there's a trap around here everyone's just everyone's just focusing on us it feels like oh you got hype i kind of left my shoes to wrap around oh god no at least i'm finding some damage so it's not as embarrassing now that's the good news here they're dropping back to each other you're gonna need more you're gonna need more bats let's put you in a bind this is the team i don't think he's uh no i don't i just need heavy heavy ammo i don't think is too good my life's not worth these that's for sure there we go uh recharging one oh god thank you thank you thank you thanks very much you are the apex champions and now i've got some nice japanese food sweet oh this is the life you know enjoyed it man all right we almost got to 30. so close ggs guys that was that was a lot of fun thank you dude what a couple of great south african guys that was a that was so much fun i would have got i think the 4k if um i mean i've already got on ash right i do i would have i would have got the 4k there but obviously i had to go get food
