it's all cities my friends okay now at least five apex predator trails landing here may as well be paying rent in fact ammonium platinum of the moments you again chased helpless back your friends get back here French what did I tell ya is the champion Scott I think see yo shoe anyway is incredibly weak she's like one shot beyond one shot please no I think I've got about 300 - then try and use this out the hemlock the higher 99 I could have taken that wingman for the true League season zero season one setup I need everything here good grief used pretty much all my bullets then wait at the Crypt a lofty another care too much anyway today I had a white box mighty nice kinda like that I've got enough bullets and stuff this there's more places to live here a lot of problem friends denied a me amigo I've got some good news I've started it's actually strapped isn't it like a scrap really good are you okay friend oh no use that here no no no no no eye contact no I just took everything from the loot boxes well I can't be taking you off purple shields what we're all I fix predators here you'd be more useful with the purple I can at least you know grapple to safety well there is a scrapping the distance and because this is scrapped or City I think the the Rallye Caesar if you're visiting this area then you have to get the hair can freak him out if you need by that may be the worst rapper of all time it was salvageable you get caught across by that it's salvageable if I'd actually landed on even that low side place it would be fine shields which I've taken those other Purple's name now the purple shields just a pathfinder hanging out near just be nothing to see here oh please get back here don't drop at the doorway she even did the doorway technique she knows what she's doing it's scary going through the portal and looking down at your gun in the bottom right and saying that you have no bullets loaded into it go to grief you actually get a shield battery off somehow it's fight a venal little price my teammates can do all that stuff I pretty much taken all I need I mean I need some heavy rains but I should be good maybe I could switch out for a women if I see you one just because I don't have many heavy but it's on the way back my friends I should have realized we made so much noise and we're in scrapped us to see that people would have turned up where's the fight I wanna see anyway with us papal shields glued this one reaching shield I'm a party in there I'm not gonna take the risk if they're not in there they'll have to wait even longer to use a shield battery actually help my friends you know let you better jump off the yard let you better jump off the building there that is that that is the power of the hemlock if you land your burst it does incredible damage close range incredible damage I'm scared because yeah again we've made a long noise half my teammates Heil obscene footsteps good times come in clutch with the scan our nice 3d to name formats two down one left your asset different aim we got both parties that may have even been the fifth party no don't do it stop it hang on in shortlist name um I break that to switch to level on shields it's absolute struggle tone over here Bazin of the team good grief she survived his line there's another yeah there is another squad I can play says jutsu yeah that makes sense which this time with team we wish the standard team I'd say nothing at the usual scorer rapid Oct days and I'm not sure if I've said this before but if I have I'm gonna repeat myself this is the best building this is the best spots alumna of all time potentially these three to five inch I mean look at this blue shield Spitfire online tonight unbelievable scenes you drop down you guys suffered that's a Mozambique thought it was a we've met we're still pretty good and a purple extended line make I'm honest I'm set for the game par from the fact I'm now gonna get gold shields from these now swear her footsteps I'll Drive I'm meant to miss the cargo but I remember that blue soybean therefore an armored suit you've necessary I meant to Missy because I heard footsteps you know and I didn't want to take my loot where's he gone teammate I hear he's he's running away it's man he's panicking Anakin Skywalker you can see why now I am NOT that man is absolutely fuming absolutely raging look at my teammates health I'm coming there's a drone also coming that means there's a third party somewhere hopefully out you brought a recognized vixen tries to defend us do I get the pup I didn't get the pup now a good place it's alright you guys late I'll protect you I'll miss the drone on purpose it's nothing it was - no this way I mean something because then the [ __ ] then it's a to v3 you know because the crypto is piloting where did you go they chased by creep time he's looking furious is under the Mirage is that everyone there's two separate teams because there were two mirages right honestly got a row vibe and actually given that two times it was that Phoebe one plays my scenes alright now we can get back to taking our gold I've missed again I can't even see what could have ace I've been embarrassed once more there we go scrap that's why I'd have been way too far away for my teammates to get the loot so I shot it again to speed it up so you can come back a bit later on makeshift approximate where one team has detected cross at Bridge friends I had him on the ropes these guys were tackling out I mean they didn't know that before they know I mean they've seen me try and shoot a cargo box three times and the crypto drove and fell four out of four times then I'll be in the fridge I know there's a fridge around here somewhere where you can literally just hide inside to the fridge that's fleeing the scene he's terrified let's go Gibby let's get him octane is always coming over he's coming over he's still preemie watch out give me oh I got such a thing of beauty about that fine underneath the Gibby IDs shield have some good teamwork then we're absolutely peppered him there's a level three helmet that I deserve from earlier on I have a lot of what it's good grief all right five kills I mean if this is Kings Canyon I think it'll be the final scrap right now I think the bongo drums would have kicked in and yet would have been the one big one the final squads over the amount of time this this games gone that's easier than I actually thought he was gonna be I will see people climbing these what I never I mean as PadFone you don't need to the only reason I couldn't Adaeze good look it's blocked off but it's good to know if you're like a wraith or something and you can't just grapple to the top that's an extremely useful skill to know around this building I've known a lot of stuff recently I probably I've never actually tried that before are you sure are you sassing copy that he's right there's a scrap I'm gonna run around for 15 minutes it feels like probably not 15 minutes probably about three usually people come to scraps or city today something good this way no I would just go this way and not their faces off prints I recognize the plan here Ralph you could have came in same from the screen three minutes ago when nothing was going on but no this is when you've chosen so I can see over it we can get keep the storm Ralphie's literary sat in front of my mate I can see my voice maybe muffled I love you too Ralph Ralph is my pet rock pile of course you've to bomb me have you other storms here safe sound hey hey stop it we're down the Mirage that's good have you got your bubble shawl friend I'm once again asking for a revival that peace give each I'll write down you're on your own for a second here when you've got the octane but he's doing some single fire nonsense it's quite a tomb someone on machine it's not nonsense did you down two of them you'd ever gone knock down some I saw yeah I think it's there what so me as soon as I change weapon sorry friend oh I think I should be okay get me out the storm Oh check out the Gibraltar I'll take one kill in that situation I've got two bombs by a peacekeeper good grief now I need purple [ __ ] do they have purple shields I've still got blue blue blue fantastic there are three squads left and I've got blue shields and I'm the kill leader if this happens the game should be like you know what you're doing pretty you doing pretty decent you know their use of purple shields you know everyone else got purple shields you're the kill leader only 30 seconds left on the clock the Rings blows that ease the final two teams fighting might miss an amide slide a lot of robot legs on the stone was party later he might want to get involved loot the Blue Shield bandy that's what they call me I was wrong their way okay that you will take in each of that spans changing the wheel on his part okay okay you always need an escape route I wonder all the way down the stairs because I wouldn't been out to get out best eMac you get involved there is another Squatch plankton was revising give me a pepper you didn't have purple okay then you were screwed as soon as I pulled out this bit by my friendship I was never gonna let go of that trigger what's the game for the Blue Shield bad guys didn't see that you didn't see that grapple and I'm you also didn't see me miss the car goes off three times and the crypto drone and you also I think my screen went blurry on the on the recording when I got to gone by that peacekeeper that didn't happen either but apart from that the Blue Shield bandit and his amigos the band of merry men here have absolutely dominated that Lobby good good game my friends oh it's a shame because we had such a law in the middle of that game we could have got you know pushing 13 14 15 kills perhaps but no one came to describe sort CC not a single person thank you for watching though I do appreciate it I'm looking forward to resting my voice here I feel a bit bit raspy but yeah thanks for watching I see you on the next one bye [Music]
