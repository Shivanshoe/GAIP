hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so you guys know that i've been playing on pc with the controller for a few weeks now and there are a few reasons for this uh first of all my ps4 pro is quite old and it just doesn't run that well anymore the frames that i get on that system at the moment are just so horrendous that i may as well just close my eyes when i'm shooting someone and pray that aim assist drags me on target it's that bad another reason is that in my spare time i play a decent amount of warzone on pc with the controller so i was switching between the high refresh rate quick response times on pc to the higher input lag and the lower frames of the ps4 and it's actually really difficult to keep switching between them when the next gen consoles drop there's a good chance i'll be back on the playstation because the ps5 will be out all of my heirlooms are on my ps4 account all my stats my skins uh but in the meantime i am having a blast on pc the wingman hits different on this system it's way easier to control the hip registration is better i'm usually so bad with this gun but in the game that i've got for you today i was actually connecting with some bullets and it's only my third game on in like three days so i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right we good we good i didn't go on headshot my goodness he's one he's one on this door though nice teammate otherwise lifeline started oh my goodness bro i gotta back up here thank you time you got 30 seconds we're good we're live yeah we're fine [Applause] that fight was going on for like three minutes you'd come in with one massive shot that's amazing oh that's depressing for that team though don't see anyone push in level three you're landing on purple on a wingman thank you oh team here oh god there are me i'm just gonna try and survive read this one shot i got you don't worry okay reloading pathfinder went up on the bridge charge rifle guy is still in construction yep i'm gonna fall back just on the drone thanks they're really not pushing at all no they're not completely backed up considering i got raised there too is that a different team at market that's me firing a wingman oh wait what no one's behind i think it's me finding my wingman mate okay okay i'm tempted to fall back a little bit pushing these guys i mean yeah yeah okay never mind yeah i'm just leaving them there's no rush there's 43 people left yeah we're good we're good we're chilling i'm playing paycheck man oh yeah it's a man's game yes it is i'm gonna switch off this wingman soon i should think this heavy ammo here that's heavy my bad still is light oh team on me i'm getting some high ground revenant for revenant for 150. nice shots stand zero hostiles not big scan hey we're going bad guys over there revenant ceiling down here revenant is in this building bottom floor and then there's two in the right building but he's still in the top window [Music] oh kept seeing everyone for 13. because i like you know when you're too it's my fault though because it the shot wasn't yeah it wasn't it wasn't central i mean like only one of them would have here like when you slow down i bet i bet you can tell that i was missing really yeah it's you know that was like the same thing with the peacekeeper it's it's harder with the massive that's why less people like the massive because rather than like with the peacekeeper the shot the bolt pattern is like a star right yeah with the peacekeeper or with the massive it's a straight line yeah do you really have to hit center mass you do yeah yeah it's like a yeah horizontal line exactly ooh this team has devos you hear somebody fall in the lava um yeah behind for some reason add lifeline needs to heal up if she can oh man i don't know what that started again i think i painted more shields up top i dropped it there's no way she doesn't have any there's there were so many boxes there okay she she doesn't dude there's there were so many shields over there and i dropped more yeah i had four batteries obviously i have that we can just third party this i'm gonna pop out have you got jump pad i do i don't they revolted somewhere mate i knocked one yeah i see the knock guy i fell a little bit all locked down now i think i don't know why the lifeline is that far back good shot dude thank you oh good wait they get stuck from i do not know i'm shielding but i'm in your red i just got fried i'm gonna say i don't know because he might come in here yeah yeah he's trying to nade us there's a few of them they're just staying far away they're not even pushing one sword pushing yeah we should try and get the lifeline right then if we can make it over there just yet i don't know if again this guy's one okay someone's coming behind another one nice goal rich good job yeah it was good that was really good i'll tell you what i'm actually landing shots with a wingman on basically with less aimlessness let's go it makes a massive difference when you can actually see what you're shooting oh god what is my inventory i don't know what's going on here janks forget it oh i can respawn there what am i doing should i just try to sit here uh through train because then we can like revive a new stage and i guess that good idea yeah i don't know the zones mate there's only so fast we're gonna have to be quick i might have to alternate should we just go down let's just go let's go the easy way the second zone is like ridiculous man yeah true it is yeah we got we're going to make it but we don't want to get caught in it no it's it's real bad moves so quick oh my god do it rich oh god no did you not make it not quite the same level of success i'm so sorry no that's not your fault i cannot believe you even made that i did the climbing animation before so i didn't have the same momentum oh my god what a leap oh god i messed up the pad so bad but i saw it land down there i'm like winnable just go for it i'm just keeping them off we're good i don't know how i'm missing so much i'm just doing damage i'm just poking them up poke them up it was a revenant team so they're probably going to try to rep push yeah revis ride got him nice job bloodhounds nearly crashed oh yeah i don't have a slice of my wingman i haven't been able to find it one time oh dude i feel bad i literally dropped one for it two times back there so good you know what i think i think we back up here yeah this isn't worth it especially with the lifeline that she's just going to keep raising mate she's just gonna keep raising let me see if what these boxes had okay i'm looking for a portable like a respawn beacon yeah is there one in the crafting let me double check no they're not the bag oh nice oh god just him just him but let's see i'm gonna set this down right here headshot nice shots dude good job so behind they should be healing a little bit i think they're fighting yeah yeah sounds like first one shot oh my god was that the blue tang you got scanning yeah yeah come on come around to the right nice job please don't kill me nice job mate i hit 313's in a row again good in a second okay let's end this craft know what he's doing thanks friendo good job dude nice work second game on in three days despite what third game actually made me i don't know start with getting head shot by a sentinel the first stop the first couple really count no we went for it i think i nice good game mate massive game
