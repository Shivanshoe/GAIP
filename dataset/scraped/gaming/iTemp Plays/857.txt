how is a cottage rich welcome back to another video today we are playing small apex veterans of course and the game that I've got for you today I actually got a good lobby on apex legends this is the lobby that I would love to plane every game it wasn't because I was stopping people there was definitely some decent plays in there one of the last people that I killed I checked their stats there in diamond - it wasn't full of just like bronze level ten players however it follow up those are really good balance of plays in there and they follow cars playing in Kings Canyon again thank you for watching I'll see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends by sorting factor it is I'm not the biggest fan of this place it seems like the loot is always spread out between your teammates get spread out someone goes down you can't get them and all of a sudden your team screwed Magruder this is a decent start on 99 g7 Scouts also had someone refine him with this his bar service was good to keep your eyes out here he comes Blue Shield on there what's going on here I guess my wraith mr. show him in the back as well I would my gosh oh my god okay ah the poor guy had everything he needed apart from a decent gun hit a Mozambique not on fleek I wasted it on someone that only had a Mozambique yes I do the extremes the online I just eat a No I say it every time but I don't feel comfortable unless I have four hundred bullets well we got here select fire choke I'll keep open just in case I find a peacekeeper or my new favorite gun which is of course the Prowler no there are nine tonight for the boys if they indeed what way okay what do I got to select face I'm gonna get handy for carrying these but I tell you if it makes a gun good oh maybe just cuz the wattage drops Banksy's if it makes it good good it's definitely worth carry if you've got an extra slot why not you know it's harder to find a select-fire than it is a prowler so if you find one carry until you like until you find a practice that makes sense I know I always get hounded for it so I thought people don't work the same way I do what people have been here look at that absolutely endless absolutely under horrendous surviving right there body filled here three level one knockdown shields and a frag grenade unbelievable things here we go scrapping the not-so-distant distance that's going fifteen teensy I think my name is because the hosted gas party to that mozzies oh I just couldn't see I couldn't see because the room was off island one time sight for this thing that's terrible of mixtape that purple chill Disney writers on with the kilrathi you go you landed the haymaker punch I did about 15 damage but about 15 damage that entire sequence I think we're just look at too late to fight hey that wasn't for you of course it is a rolled up and took it it's all okay's who can main writer got level 2 anyway it's not I could rockin no shields or level 1 shield you know level 2 still pretty good oh how do I have 1 kill is kill leads got 5 kills that should be me if I rocked up a lil bit sooner or if I landed just a few shots honestly I think if we get there a little bit sooner we walk away with so many kills there does shame he happens though or say they're not worth picking up turbocharger is a havoc appear to that have been tremendous I could have dropped all the attachments now I'm keeping mr. su must have a prowler around here now to drop it sink I'll take that sounds weird get excited about level 1 extend on max but with the g7 Scouts 50% efficiency unbelievable scenes I walk straight past you too alright let's got a rotation going I feel like I never visit the side of the map on I'm always a scraps or CC and I was gonna learn there again this game but the amout of Tom's upstairs scraps or CC over the last few weeks is frankly astonishing to say the least I thought we'd go something different but this is what happens when you don't learn there now you end up going through different areas no one to be singing this isn't even looted it drops a little good stuff here I throw a tiny $1.99 that makes it even better I'm terrible the owner tonight unless have at one times what's going on so many things been pinged at and let's have a one time stage clock cuz the muzzle flash just kills me I can't see it gosh Shawn thing bonafide that gun called shields police I'm three knockdown men Turkey oh there we go purple shields so that's a good a karma there for being a good a good guy well I'm afraid I did try and avoid scraps or City it but it looks as though we are gonna have to go that way for a fight for a scrap suppressor con he won't going on at the moment let's go this way and the wind there's a scrap of scrap sauce it's a you gotta say goodbye to the select-fire the Prowler dream is over my friends unless there's one in here as a wingman DiPaolo havoc that's the one thing I'll say about the Prowler I mean it's all it's all right in burst mode is still pretty good but if you can't find the select-fire it's just not on the same level you might be in so I don't like guns that you need to find like a hop-up to make decent because if you're running around either with the hop-up or with the gun that has nothing on it it is struggling I'm not in Survey beacon friend as a humongous scrap going on mmm totally far away this looks like a full team have to play the sidelines I think way for mistake may be busy cover don't shoot me the back oh come on doesn't be loaded if they can down that Watson I think we're okay nice that's the guy that damn mate so the Watson point ended appealing if you can escape this call stick if you can bunk it down with some gas I messed up ours unfortunate I got too greedy I was fuming that I wasn't very loaded on the o99 too greedy chasing careful teammate it's my turns out now I guess have a decent amount of shield batteries that's definitely worthwhile trade just so don't have to worry about the burner the worst thing about going to pick up banners is the fact that you have to do the animation and you can't shoot you can't fight people always peak when you are in the animation and you just die it's the worst oh there's the 13 but they're fighting a 14 yeah thank you please don't shoot me all right let's calm down everyone everyone chill there's one reason we can let anyone she was aiming this way she using hammer play baby what are you doing let's get out of here now right got the banner up the lifeline and that's the only reason we from this left so I need to stop being greedy and get my teammates back there's gonna be a race unfortunately for you boy I am a pathfinder so that race should be won by me but not to heal up a little bit but so do the race unless she's just gonna speed it over tell her to be patient that's real good they've just seen me kill the race as well so I hope for the hop down to take the lived I need some light ammunition I have to take some I won't take it all if she has a light weapon I want to take all the ammo but I definitely top up it's engine 96 not bad 136 left in there still sounds pretty good hopefully no one's wish my team a so I don't want taking the rest this stuff if it's like look great you know if it's sucker if I if I drop like a level one extended line mag to upgrade to a level 3 at least they still have an extremely proud that I've been looking for the entire game I don't know select-fire though that's okay friends this won't get involved here lifetime supply of syringes over that my hell here we go this is sort of scrap going on I wish I had a three times site and she's not saving that's good it's understand why kill to ask odds remain unfortunate my teammates can't get that lease I've no idea where they got cha from there's a lot of action are happening other decide the map it could have just been up top I might go up top I'm gonna risk it I've gone knockdown yes you do please no fill up on his team he's indeed come get this dog knocked down I was so tempted to hunt back down when I missed all the online tonight rice that we do hate that tactic the old spam Crouch tactic I need to try more often and them as defining across it the old spam Crouch tactic you can't I can't hear shot I landed like 309 shots that's pull out the the g-seven for the do the business sounds close nice one more what's like ain't shot by the Pathfinder and no big Hills bless him he's shielding up with level-one shields the shield sells even like mid and late game that leaks because the early game is bad the only game was so bad that I almost hoped that we didn't win that so people didn't see but listen I think we made it free we may have made it free in the end shouts at the team the Wraith as soon as I went down the wraith instantly tried to help me revive me Gobber you know me back up and they were really patient when I to be honest probably took too long to respawn but it's alright because we've won the game in the end anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it no seawall in [Music]
