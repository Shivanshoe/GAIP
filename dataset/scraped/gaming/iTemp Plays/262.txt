i have absolutely no idea what this place is called but i realized i was the drum master late so these things happen you know sometimes you've got to land in a shed and this happens to be one of those occasions but it's okay because we've got a bigger shed here and it's got a lot of good stuff apparently not my brain was lagging hold on let's get my head in the game this isn't this isn't good enough recharging myself my brain's on a three second delay at the moment don't go down teammate don't change my g7 ultimate i have to ping it for him energy i'm not here wait did i not take that sniper stuff but it's all mine i swear i picked up that sniper stock okay well the good news is he's still down i was worried this guy managed to sneak around and get a revive or something wait timothy did you not heal do you have any healer okay that did not have to be um as hard work as it turned out to be this guy's got a 20 bomb badge and i do not and every time i see someone with a 21 badge i get incredibly jealous they are big scrapping down i always call this place capacitor but it's not it's containment the names are fairly similar energy i'm not here you can't blame the man for getting the name wrong you can only get the name wrong for blame the man you know listen listen it's one of those situations we've got ourselves here i'm good to fight these guys are still scrapping don't let them see you i have no syringes i really can't be able to use a med kit on this got another lobe another psychopath robot go to the left that guy's one shot on my word i got this guy on the ropes the teammate i've run in circles for fun reloading i've been for like 120 or something as well i've got my ultimate i said let's just reconvene for a second there's a team on diving board that's annoying everyone there's at least one god that may have run off into his teammate's arms because i him for 120 you can use this to get some shields amigo oh here you go i have to shield up these four guys are stuck in the middle i'm a little bit scared of this guy running back with his teammate and it's almost like he's went to go and get his dad like he was getting bullied by us 2v1 and then he went to get his dad who's he's like a professional apex player or something okay this is this is ludicrous teammate i'm taking the bad i mean i've got aim assist and i'm trying to shoot people with the one times at a range where you get very little if any aims whatsoever i'm not really playing to my advantages here now these guys got high ground on us i can probably get there anyway i'm hoping they don't see me from the side because it got absolutely zero in terms of in terms of cover they've seen me oh my word it's gone re45 okay he's the greatest calm down mr re45 guy we're gonna get pinched by the diving board team or the guy with his dad or maybe both teams at the same time i don't know this is taking far too long but they're actually running away once again come with me over oh here word i could have dropped shields but i was in no man's land an army switch plus the damage is nice there you go oh nice teammate i'll be honest i didn't really play that that great but i did secure high ground for the boys you know that was my strategy all along unfortunately the other teams didn't come over to uh shoot in the back as well i have two kills and 700 damage i think it's because i'm taking way too long to get into the gunfights i've never seen anything like it never seen anything like it there's someone here as well oh my word over here this could be the diving board team try and jump up on this guy if these guys don't shoot me in the back it keeps shooting him thank you ah hey how are you gonna land what that was that a head shot as well the guy's on a rope you might as well be no scoping these guys getting third parted up top as well i need shields let's go here i've got 20 cells amigo i need some big hills these guys might have some i have eyes on the enemy oh hello okay why is it all kicking off all of a sudden on this hill does anyone know another one there you go i helped i can third part of this as well this is beautiful my teammate won't be here for a little bit he's got a he's gonna loot up they're in here all right target down bad another guy okay another guy with an rs45 there's some kind of challenge going on some some sort of re-45 movement i don't know about i'm gonna so i'm gonna stick with to my season zero set up here of the wingman r99 a lot of death boxes okay well forget it i actually didn't even need anything i can't bother to use it i've got four bats i've got all that ammunition i need okay not bad teammate has been a bit of a demon this game i'm not gonna say i'm getting carried per se i've had my moments but i've definitely in certain situations i've left him to his own devices and he's come up clutch here we go what was that i'm gonna revive respawn corner beacon something green was going on that narrows it down at all i don't know oops oh hello i was trying to go for a slide maneuver but i remember the guy had white shields why wouldn't you be chilling up there just standing there hit me up like his boy's friend that also loves us to stand on this platform there's a couple of guys standing on a platform how'd that feel i think he must have done decent damage there he keeps them busy and they go up top which they have another little climb up little god spot we need to go this way anyway so it's a good 30 seconds it's a good thing for us to uh get on this side map okay do i have to go on this side hang on teammate they dropped okay it's a disaster package i'm gonna go and scream i'm gonna go to screen
