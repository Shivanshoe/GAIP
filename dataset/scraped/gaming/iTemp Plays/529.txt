hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have a game for you today on wraith where so far's banner times out so it's just me left in a trio's game and he coaches me on the best place to make now i think one of the weakest parts of my own game on any first person shooter is keeping calm under pressure even in public games if i'm alone or if i have to clutch up i often make dumb choices because i feel overwhelmed i'll try and force a play that just won't work because my brain is just so it's just muddled but this is something that so far is really good at knowing how to win these engagements it was a good time i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm landing down low stabbed up oh god i'm dead i'm good are you gonna yeah use your bracelet enemy down i must get you right hold on i'm coming is i would like to know why you're not rezzing me uh because i had a corsican made with purple armor so is that good enemy down oh you're better why would they ever challenge me why would they do that to themselves mate terrible decision awful decision i had to get through his gun shield too oh my god i oh boy i'll hear him somewhere popping the phoenix i have to reload the ball nice octane was not flesh reloading i think i broke somebody else i think you did i broke i think i'm pretty sure i brought two of them um that's my purple please drop it back right i'll probably absolutely not pop into phoenix and i'm giving it back

gonna i'm gonna keep calling me come on i still need you thank you either phoenix third party okay only works in our favor they're definitely just looting and there's probably at least three of them yeah are you trying to get your purple back i'm coming yeah i got it nice recharging my shield i'll hop off this yes it's not good right on your head okay if you can make that i die here oh my god there's still eight teams here hello just leave me this is your game this is your game don't just play yourself there's no way this guy's just triple taking me hey i have never been shot from so many different there angles to be a lifeline making this just so much more difficult as well how long have i gone in your banner i don't have any healer to me yeah i mean this is this is your game don't worry about me just play yourself i have three syringes but i started my portal at the board when i could have ran to you first but it was an ultimate the guy's right above me i think i could have made it to you though no i mean that was unlucky i mean with lobo i could literally just do nothing yeah it's not good you got this i don't have a bolt still you know that's rough right this guy died or what i don't know that bolt that's mental that [ __ ] bolt oh my god nice just a minute until the ring closes huh good ready for this ready for this one oh not too shabby not too shabby about like a nine that was decent yeah rings not that far all right getting ready to get shot by the full team with a long bow and two kills between them the landing solar array watch this for a tactic i'm in this guy's head okay he's got banners he's either going to go here but the storm's coming in this way next one he's going to come here or to be honest with you if he did wrap around he might be there let's explore this way oh man or you're just going to get creepered in the head no no it's not going to happen they can't see them i'm literally a bush attention yeah 100 100 literally i can't you don't i'm rife i don't have a head what's that oh my god you guys how long have you been in there for [Music] oh they're safe there are you kidding me see a full team of three are you kidding they just emerged what oh my god i think they're gonna like bubble push you in full sun yeah i need to wait for the full i don't need to wait for the team are you kidding me do you see him just open the door like hello the pc lobbies are great i think he had red shield that right that's for the same octane yeah octane dude i think it was a path and a giveaway i think oh there's no way this is happening to me right now this is not a trick please inside they pushed up come on fight got a replicator coming in the only way have you gone need to recharge perfect oh that's actually perfect i'm gonna chill for a sec because they're not gonna down people i need to wait i need to wait five more time i have a minute i have a minute i need to play this perfectly the airport yeah you could port through them just save it and then if you need to just pour it right through that point someone's down there are they big scrappy let's wait for the peak of the scrap you just finish a kill oh god too far too far too far too far resetting resetting what's he doing up there need to recharge my shields i think one team is just winning though i think the close team is in shambles i need to help them don't worry guys i'm here look this guy's down he's going to bloom over i need to get out of here can i wrap around uh i you you can i think you can use this there's a hole in the thing here right yeah you'll be fine you have time she's going to say the balloon i think he's a 1v3 v1 only 10 seconds left the wrong team started winning i needed the close team to win yeah that was unfortunate i need to team up with the solo i need him not to shoot me they're fighting this is going to be 1v3 maybe this could of gone worse i don't think i mean you can get high ground only one more squad left you've got a decent position right right there yeah right there you can get a decent position and you got range i saw him i saw him i could i could maybe fight on these care packages and just switch yeah 100 if i have to i can fall back let's take this out double tap double taps really throw me off okay nice it's slow no rig was it yeah yeah get high oh i think you need a problem would you reckon prowler prior to the massive fall over the wind double brawler for the win oh there's the missiles i'm going pronounce if i'm fine close range all right yeah player just play those buildings got it ah oh dude chill under attack they're not even helping you the missiles are against you too that's a wreath she sounds like on grass yeah i didn't hear her at all i need to recharge my shoes they're all going to push yeah [Music] now i'm at the worst spot what are you guys doing hello marvin i need to sort of delay for this come back anyway i could probably heal up a bit need to recharge my shield yeah you can play that glass right there behind you so you can actually have cover play i saved yes oh no it might just be two i think it's three i need them to split up though one's other building and one's above you okay kind of our split but we're just playing high ground do you [ __ ] make it a bit what do i do um i think you play low ground for a few more seconds maybe you can get a peek i'll wait for the rocket to take one out right i'm in cover rock is going to kill him i mean this zone doesn't change much so who knows the guy above oh yeah i know yeah i think so maybe play the other side he's not consuming i'm scared that he's gonna be on here listen to that okay yeah here we go this guy's gonna drop down hopefully recharging my shield the heck's going on up there is he tap dancing can you hear this guy oh dude you got this you got this whoa i was even making these noises he's not going like this this is this is hard i i think if anything maybe push the other side but you're not this dude can dive on your head it's all on you all on you i don't want to give you a decision and you go run i've never played a game like it oh my god he looks so stressed out oh dude all day enemy taken out frankie where is he the applause one minute until ring wait oh he's in the room oh there's no he's not hop about just in case he's just in case he has gold that's easy kill easy kill you still got crawler all day ring's not that far nice dude oh my god what was that game john while you kept me calm you kept me calm i think if i was in that alone you were there i'd have forced to play i'd have i would try honestly that was a really really hard fight to play so like i was even confused a little bit about what to do i was like oh dude this is rough good job though that was awesome oh thank you very much a live coaching session for the win nice dude i'm your boy hey let's go solo too because i didn't do really anything i mean i i mean yeah well i left you for dead so it's pretty much my fault
