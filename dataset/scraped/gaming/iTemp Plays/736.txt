hey Wisconsin rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some bloodhound here in ranked it is the ultimate redemption story from rags to riches from respawn sheep it's a victory screen and shows how the team for gaming back in its long because the rest of the game we've had was so much fun at the moment we are still climbing through the ranks and we are making our way through gold again and I think the goal to be the last division well I'll be able to just pull only run up people so I'm doing as much of that as possible in the meantime so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see Walt in five and a half seconds my friends y'all relate to this but nukes causalities me me goes to people do the door do grenades for you boy absolutely zero effort okay got a havoc essentially the Gold's good from the for this tiny space me nothing then you've run away let me get a gun okay then we can have a look a little scrap law a long tussle you know that right oh that's an idiot move right there I'm just gonna I'd neither beanbags I hate the 74 i inferred via on Zbyszek and these guys still chases me you better hope that you kill my team because if I'll come back I'm using a finishing move our new crypto I will not forget because everyone not well no one place crypto I mean the crew toes moved on because I don't seem that's havoc havoc boy back and again with the havoc the gamma banner just run away just leave this guy alone I think that might have to kill this guy he's a bad teammate careful nice well I didn't get to use my finishing move on him um but I should got to get a respawn here at least hey look this going back it's your boy back at it again I'm back to chew gum and shoot gnomes and I'm all out of milk as that goes I believe we got our if we fine with some heavy rains beautiful oh no hit em like this on all right well I'm armless I don't really have many attachments whatsoever so we need to try and loot up a little bit here or am i gay me starting with 39 people that you know are you actually seeing someone attempting to leave the obligatory level once types done just for old time sake I I do believe I've gotta bury with an inventory management I used to just not care whatsoever what was in my pocket you hold the mouthwash I'll look for some armor please shield the since the acid at the moment there we go they made inside you because there's a lot of pink in and there's not much actual gunfire going on now I hear them talking as well it's just of course this is a course equipped with purple armor nothing to see here amuse your friends turn around we need to kill this guy quick isn't the team here means to make sure that this guy was dead so we can focus on this team together hold on my friend I'm coming furthermore feet off but it was worth it absolutely demolished his team good job teammate but that first knock that was huge 1v3 in you get a knockdown yeah we need it we might need to run we might need to relook MIT myself this is struggle time right now are they not pushing they really get that scared from my blue tones again I didn't kill him then you felt that terrify no no no no turn around and walk is actually stupid it's gonna stupid info content with the option take my back pocket I'll be honest I've already clicked on the level 3 helmet is a yen of the team coming over anyone else coming over I think they just saw us in the feed absolute immersion everyone only 12 people have died since I've got respawned and I think we must have killed what's that three separate teams there I think there's three separate teams obviously nine people so no one it no-one else is fighting on the map apart from us we were the only people actually actually shooting our weapons I think everyone is terrified good not a problem I think we actually benefited a little bit there because a market is just near to the safe zone look so we got all the people coming over slowly from the west of the map and it took them a while to get to us if they all came once it would have been an absolute mess and absolutely that's we back are you sure something or is there actually something here like no hostiles friend awesome on Isis craft me distance spin too long since I've shot someone there's only one solution to that problem I used to run a 30% extra speed this may be stupid moved this looks like it's gonna be Brian the edge of the safe zone I could even be in the zone cause Pathfinder I could all just fry up there right to the high Grange lowdown people I'm only just turning up third parties here honey come on land a shot you cannot land a bullet least he's got calm run away I'm scared you know shield are you guys keep fighting I'm looting are all uniform five hostiles tremendous where are you going I love this email it's the absolute greatest that bangles are sprinted at me with about 12 health and a dream I appreciate it one Phoenix get Phoenix kids are pretty good with Brody but big heels when you have ready volleys the one when you've got gold shields you probably want to drop your shield batteries through your teammates foot big heels for the most part make fighting so much easier right somehow there are only three of the squadron's okay no one was dying and then all of a sudden everyone must have converged on the same area and apparently was grown earth we were just fighting I would sure what's call back River Center I think he was like a top River Center perhaps AB C's popping off with it you will take I don't have my ultimate to close the gap so and it's gonna take a legend least roll over there opening doesn't pop off too much and leave some people and make your shoe in the back so scrappin who is over there for a second one hostile detected alone in the hostile world good this really isn't good fortune airfryer is someone else I wish using axe hey that's not fair the gold held in their ancestors have one of these nice they're all stood behind behind one rock and my team is going absolutely with a clean cut longtime friend they're a second straight speed on the re 40 pipes actually Ludacris so the last guy to sprint in on one shot I don't care nice job I don't know who y'all just got killed credit for he was that was that the caustic because the Corsican the Gibraltar are on the same team that's the only the person I've tamed recently right chinning there's a star logo somewhere then I think they finished the actual gone off I reckon this is the big DB and the caustic but he might not even be the caustic because I think the caustic just died and there's no way they got the balance means of pastures recently he goes just one person I reckon this is the Gibraltar there is big boy go take a lot to take him down how many friends gasoline no zoom each with this gun flame hissing good grief against they have to stop to heal if they don't stop to heal they're walking around with 165 health perhaps let's go to optics here that's embarrassing how did she manage to get shields off that I mean if I didn't see a slowdown I thought it's going to drop down and shoot we like to shot max it's melted me from 225 thousand hey alright once got left and unfortunately we are at the bottom of a ravine here there's my bracket or do that scan anyone because when you're on your old you can't can't see how many people it's can't change that yes you are still challenging still still deciding they're in the doorway and Biggles hit the Lifeline didn't get the lifeline I got the triple headshot first there at the end but it wasn't enough for the kill cream that was the game that we died in new school team we got resurrected back from the dead was cooler had come with absolute demolished the rest of the lobby go to grief that was fun a bloodhound is so much fun to play Oh 3,000 damage just under fairly certain I already have my 3000 damage batch I'm not too bothered about that 15 kills I was dead for like two minutes at the start which is where you usually get you know you could easily get 5 kills the starts easily and a thousand damage if you have a good style at school team new school team I could have got my bad Jews down blue-toned if I paid that property to start if I landed on a gun perhaps and the crypto Dean chased me down still good game though shakes out the team for winning the the resulting fight to respawn in me and also save me at the end because I'd die it's that race I'm a don't know how she got shield off wasn't expecting all right I'm Sharpie did we get from that's how she gained gold again syndrome one ranked up once more ranked up to gold 3 thanks for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music] you
