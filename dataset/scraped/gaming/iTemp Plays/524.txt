the uh the rest of the lobby get them out of here i'll see ya you are the apex champions very nice i'll take it me too every day [Music] why are too shabby pretty even or 25 extra damage or 25 extra not too shabby i mean you were using a g7 if you hadn't moved your head or just like shifted it all right into my line of fire oh yeah yeah i mean you're using the g7 rich you should have like 10 times my damage it wasn't fair because i had about four energy bullets the entire game so
