hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in season 12 on my channel you've seen a lot of me playing with other people with janks and so far and the wins often come fairly easily when you're playing with people of that caliber what you haven't seen much on my channel is me playing solo struggling to get a win dying to masters three stacks and that is exactly what you are getting today now playing lifeline and we had a ton of good games up until we got the win and the win that we ended up getting happened to be my second most amount of damage i've ever got on apex it was so good so thank you for watching i really do appreciate it if you're new here be sure to subscribe to not miss any of my daily apex legends videos and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean this isn't gonna help to be honest it's not gonna help even if you've just punched someone what's he gonna achieve it's not gonna achieve anything i did miss a lot of shots there on people that were down and not even looking at me i'm gonna be honest with you oh my god i just have to be alive i'm happy to be live that guy just got a lifelong race in front of me i know i trusted my teammates i didn't know what was happening uh i don't even kill i have i entered damage it's okay though it's okay wait did i not get the kill on the wraith back there get those arm switches in i don't like this by the way i can't land a shot with a wingman with a digi on it enemies [Music] funny i think it's definitely right that that goes to ash maybe uh i don't know you can make a case for either one i guess oh i'm i dead as much as i could bring me alone leave me alone love is cracked in that corner on her ultimate they're okay i'm just gonna finish this i'm gonna finish it i just want to get up just in case there's another team here how often do you get to use the gold knockdowns it's not often i need a better way is that eat backpack here level one i'll do oh my god there's a purple in there too but whatever let's go kill these guys how are you still looting ash there is a giant fight if you need loot these guys will have it all for you setting up a respawn begun this guy's got hammers i think this is this guy's teammates you know the regular just killed him my teammates recharging my just giving my shields a recharge let's go this way oh my god enemy down i'm spotted taking fire recharging my shields okay who first of my teammate don't worry i got a squad mates banner oh okay uh this one's used i need to go this way but if i go this way they're just going to kill me man this is a this is a rough choice this is a very rough choice i don't know how i say live there listen okay i'm gonna have to go go it's a shame we can't be involved in this fight because i could easily drop a 4k here if we were a little bit closer and alive but i was just impossible that was such a difficult spot to be how do i survive there's a guy on the top shooting me and the guy thank god the guy that swung on me had white armor because i head shine then double body shine the only reason i'm still alive got that myself i need light rains that's all i'm here for rampage here they try to destroy me but i keep coming back we might just want to get back involved to be honest with you i think this is the play they're down here we might have high ground on them if thirsty the kill maybe can hoover up a box there's not gonna be much loot around it's not in these boxes you know most places are looted you just gotta risk it where'd they die lining up properly that's a terrible maid oh that is unfortunate he's very very very unfortunate hello attention he said sorry but it's not his fault just 10 seconds wasn't your fault i'm a gunner oh my god i can't buy a winner i can't we do have another team here uh charge rifle alternator i'll take it i'm gone i've got your teammate there's someone here oh gotcha you need any help i've got myself three kills here which i'll take let's get involved let's get over there this way this is such a good combination early game don't need attachments really it conserves ammo exceptionally well you steal everyone's kills like this let me get in the box got your back what is this game right now oh my god it's so stressful they're reviving they're reviving no teammate left are you joking me are you kidding me teammates ladies and gentlemen decoy escape deployed okay wait how do i know that i'm not the deep chord alright oh my god the that first thing that i dropped the kind of room but it was my drone my mind is scrambled ah teammate left i'm devastated this could have been a free win if he was still here barrel stabilizer here level two no thanks needed did you take bribes though oh can't get up there all right what the heck what's going on here what is happening here then come up then come up did they see me yes yes they did just giving my shields a recharge let's see my stuff down low reloading calling in a lifeline package and bam goes the boozer shots fired and they're hitting me broken enemies i'm scared get him scared get him scared [Music] my teammate there what a demon oh my god i'm getting scared i'll be honest there's a rock up on a car i think he's using the boosted loader sorry you're gonna understand that's a little bit concerning right this could be the end i'll be honest with you need a bat get out there me that's so sad teammate dan juan i messed up tremendously no nice try man i messed up my bad i picked both of them at the same time i ended up getting fried unknowingly oh my god no an re45 for dropping with all right well for some reason no one dropped it which i'm actually pretty happy about because i don't think this place is that good i just know where else to go it's giving me armor and two good weapons oh is it hammer points i have to run havoc and then no havoc doesn't really make sense with hammer points because it's the charge up time and once you're already going with the havoc you can pretty much one clip anyone a turbo havoc yeah i'm not going to use hammers i've got a turbo i haven't stand in here i need a shotgun bolt and also we should all turn around after lobby just before we dropped less than one minute making contact with enemy who we firing at 30 seconds rings close frog out frog oh that guy's killed over there too i'm just trying to buy time for my teammates to get over here one of the biggest you'll ever see rings just ahead get him get him get him let's get down to my teammates well we've got a fight behind us and then this random wraith here we should honestly just go for the third party we should just go this way this race can just carry on running nice huge get in there oh is this two of them exciting half the squad recharging shields i came over eventually i didn't do anything else where on earth are the shotgun bolts this has to drop me a shopping mall you have one did you no extended heather mag here who gave the oh well they're fighting over this way it sounds like a charge rifle i'm gonna be honest with you i've got a havoc and a mastiff at this particular range i'm not going to be that good especially because my mastiff does not have a bolt i don't know i don't know if i've mentioned this but i'm currently boltless and if we go this way we are going to be the center of attention it would appear oh one heart get started it's going to go here for a second maybe try and shoot one of these guys in the back i'm okay this guy's gonna hop down to try and save his teammate he saw me go this way he thinks i'm gonna go first and i might be who knows wow recharging right here oh god switch this way on your feet [Music] what the heck is going on this is every team up a bit i'm gonna have to sit here for a second i'm sorry contact g7 scout here oops they land on a gun i thought there's going to be one there all right well we are back at it again is he looking for a wingman did he say i don't mind either to be honest with you i'll find blue along let you know mantis does it all it just does it all we're all inside the ring sorry what gun what gun you're looking for oh man what did you say come on come on i have six shield cells is it worth charging my sentinel i think it is it's worth my time i mean i've got a respawn on the go too someone just left off the top i mean everyone's just down why is everyone just down these guys are down low are we not are you guys not coming this way thank you all right so another thing is we got here about three hours looking out here yes indeed oh god i'm coming that messed up that messed up too somehow opening fire oh my god you're gonna have to back up team i'm here now charging that so i thought you were running out here what is that what is that slide animation someone please tell me what that is i need help i already dropped it it only takes one uh shelter now which is nice boogie spotted out there oh my word here we go she's going to straight back in there energy i'm actually pretty cool i'll admit well we can't take this oh god i think okay nothing good this guy's missing these graphs i'm coming maybe shouldn't focus on that guy so much because he wasn't really a threat getting shot reloading i have a charge and i have charge rifle now charge rifle i think is underrated extended heavy mag here i'd love to say that as well but listen listen guys i can't looking for sniper optics where's the heavy mag i don't remember there it is thank you hey you my friend let's is going to be popping off like we could just sit we could sit in hydra and lose or we could third party people in the states and take everything you know take everything leave them with nothing i left i left the car there so they could catch up because i knew i was running off a little bit come on come on huge scratch over there one of the biggest scraps you've ever seen over here guys how many kind of points at that range i'm gonna risk it all i'm risking it all reloaded [Music] glitch this is a nasty gun bad guy over there a lot of respect for the attempt oh that's my team thank goodness oh god there's another guy here hello i think he's really weak oh my god this is the craziest game ever what the heck is happening i have i have six kills oh god there's more i meant to drop this down right as well he's the last guy mess him up mess him up lifeland's got your back hold on using a phoenix key oh my word this is ridiculous this is ridiculous thank you now you can see why i wanted to turn up here late can't you give him a shield to recharge just for whatever is happening here you know this is peacekeeping one of the craziest games i've ever played in my entire life i need heavy because even though i'm using a rampage oh there we go get stuck up on these i'm going to go onto these two because it's so useful going into the later parts of the game i've got a gold bag too wait what did you put this down i can't even oh no i can anyone i mean that's one of the worst lifeline factors i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of lifeline packages why is there a green thing down low there oh there's a full team on there what are they doing my shot nice shot nice shot fall back not worth we're just gonna be in the open let's explore this way let them push guys why didn't we just come up here something good this way listen up i'm getting kid 10 seconds the ring's basically knocking on the door please cover for me oh my god i survived okay we should have just stayed on top of the hill we need to go across this way zones come in follow me follow me follow me okay you hear that we can throw these guys up here easy it's coming down shield battery here yeah i could use that recharging shield if that went to plan we could have just sat up there sat up here you know we could have fought this time off easily oh my god scammed heads up got one here i want to cancel that out nice job losing for the last three hours is this why got one here nah this isn't a this isn't a real game what level are you you're level 47 there's a valve going off i've been losing the last three hours and the game's finally like you know what he's been struggling this guy needs a win we need to get over there i need to get my 4k this way let's start this follow me mid-range loud and clear brings near closing in 60 please say what though it has been a lot of fun even if i am shooting four-year-olds doesn't matter doesn't matter i don't care i need to win i don't care uh i'm hoping both these teams are down low but i don't think so i think they're both at the top which kind of sucks for us this might actually be a terrible idea i haven't decided yet damage a little bit here who's showing you teammate and run i need to give a presence appear otherwise they're going to rush us bad guy over there just take it from him so they can't take it i got one 45 seconds ring's not too far i'm okay with that it's the last two teams let's go ahead this way all right i'm gonna use this guy mirage is slightly annoying we're gonna have to force these guys out of here deployed thank goodness all right four point four thousand damage this is this is ludicrous that kind of hurts no it doesn't no it doesn't hurt nice drop teammate do we just push or do it just carry on follow me oh my god that game was ridiculous that game was ridiculous no hey don't do that cut the camera all right got 16 kills and like what i think it was like 4.8 000 damage or something another 4k badger chief though not bad 4700 damage that was that was such a ridiculous game
