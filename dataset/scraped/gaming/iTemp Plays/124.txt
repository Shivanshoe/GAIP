hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using the legend the most popular legend even in all of apex and this hasn't even changed with the release of mad maggie usually at the service season the most popular legend for the first week or so is the new legend it makes sense you want to try them out you want to see if you like their kids even for variety's sake but for this season octane has been the most popular legend and he's kept his top spot there for a good while i mean i can understand why his pad is incredibly fun and it can rotate you around the map it can be used aggressively and defensively and a lot of the time you don't even have to character reduce because of the passive health regeneration i have two great games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh no team on me oh god shooting he just ran it's an octane with white armor oh is oh good you know i got havoc massive i think i'm just gonna uh because then i can drop in my energy dude i've got lots if you've got energy i am like swimming i had 100 but it might come down to where you need some more you know uh there should be people by command center but they died like a long time ago what is this a lifeline pack the company's already in the next ring officer watson jen no it is a lifeline back that's me i'm lost that was the last of that squad good kill you're training i'll take crap too why you're octane yeah i was like kind of confused uh after this i'll have four basically i'm good i crafted a crafted battery nice i was gonna pat off the roof but that just seems incredibly unfair on you position revealed by uh go back to cascades yeah oh they're on teammate the enemies are shooting oh my god what are the odds wait what what are the odds this always happens recharging shield we it's at the top of this left rope one's on the roof you have ashore right yeah one dropped contact with target i have been down [Music] charging shields over here come on come on come on oh that's why you said sushi at the start shields are depleted hey oh my god i'm coming jacks i'm just drowning they're going to see this revive i guess and there's a pad between me and i'm just riding do you hear how many are you here reloading enemy down reloading it's got time oh she's going to see me and kill me not if i have anything to say about it flying on the road [Music] she's that's why she's so good on this map there's a lot of buildings where it's so difficult to get on the roof on on the stone point extended energy back here i'll take that i don't have a meg that's caught upgrade thank you i guess now we go antenna i don't have a single assist so i'd like to apologize to the team what i said i don't have a single assist so i am sorry oh it's okay i literally i haven't even like shot anybody except for that team i haven't done anything i have nine kills they're still firing this way yeah someone had it this way right in the middle oh yeah throw an ark star this guy's got red 45 on him yeah he walked i thought he was gonna go around the other side it's a little deceiving because it was far away like i couldn't gauge the distance i thought he was gonna go around the other side and then he just like stemmed and took a hard left who would they phone up before as well they were fine i'm so confused thank god because i didn't do anything to that maybe what are you doing crouching up there crouching tiger hidden dragon be terrified of you you should watch this i should do i what am i doing i need to get out of the water no problem no you're going to draw attention to me i'm going to die twice that's decent no amy's isn't that range that's decent i died i hear them throw me ipad i'm under fire let's put you in a bind is i got confused by your call a little bit and then by the time i by the time i realized that that team was firing me in the back only now they jump well that was a good attempt ryder ryden brian's following me okay shouldn't take any damage should just be invincible yeah his gas heals all right so are they they're probably on the bottom kind of but no at the same time i'm just grabbing [Music] nice see one team masters trail atlantean there's another team on the side of them that landed far there's another team okay i didn't get a gun from three bins i got another three bins i'm gonna go third party yep drop the triple take you fancy i have one nice nice job there's more on me it's my nade i

didn't why i have a phoenix there's no way there's no way i took you right i don't think so yeah yeah that's a different one though right i don't know i thought i thought it was on the ground i the purple was in the box and i left that on the ground so if you didn't pick it up on the ground beside your purple got a feeling that i didn't because i didn't want to because i knew you dropped it for him but i might have been autopilot would like one yeah i am currently on the bats if you see a nine please let me know yeah up i almost died and then it was a wraith up there i'm i don't know what happened yeah so i sort of aschalted up top and then the ray followed me and the crazy part is i didn't even see a rate the whole time so i don't know where the wraith came from yeah i'm i'm also confused death box here see someone out there you got eyes yeah yeah yeah he's come back to me look at the wiggle looking man's wiggling nice job this steven was rising he wasn't ready reloading that
