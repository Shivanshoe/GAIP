maybe some Gaza to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course this is our first look at season 4 we get to use the new character revenant we're get to land up one of the new places called the planet Harvester we visit some of the new areas such as scraps or city and we use the new gun all in this video I'm playing on PC because you can update it a lot quicker than PlayStation before by the time I play three games on PC my PlayStation 4 update had just finished so stick around cuz I've got two games for you in this video and I hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends we are going to sort in factory I and that plane on PC because PC gets the update so much faster than ps4 baseball is always so far behind so I'm just sat there waiting I think someone's born that way well my sensitivity and everything is a little bit different on PC so I'm gonna be a little bit confused these these are my first game so I've seen that the sniper hammer which is different now which I don't really want to take I'll be honest I haven't really seen the patch notes as extended have you mag people are scrapping it the harvester but we are playing revenants what's this it's a neat sniper Mac ok let's call them so it's a completely separate thing now you take some of this it's one of these I'm gonna take this just cuz I can extend it heavy so if I find a weapon that I want I'll use that Matthew I have more ammo no didn't wait so if anyone fancy ok my sensitivities are definitely different I don't think I'm getting 144 hurts but that's fine I'm used to not getting it that's one of the main attractions of playing on PC though yeah my sense is a little bit different ok teammates coming up behind them think I'll be trapped but I should be okay I just come up behind maybe team I stand at least one of them it was to him no what are you the one go okay that was the race I did a lot of damage tre oh my god my my looting sensitivity is way higher on be seen at you Falls kinda nice I'll use these alts and everything oh my god this one up top there up top on us there up top I mean it so useful to be able to talk to teammates but it definitely takes away from commentating a little bit it's just a little more difficult I saw on console I can't have push-to-talk here Peter I'm so far away with these guys see you scrap I can do is that all I can do is now I'm getting sniped a fight I'm starting with it it's gonna lose this he's gonna come back in a second I'm getting starts out from sort of top got to protect this because he may come back through this may be a stupid idea and with the bloodhound yes someone just chin up top oh my god is my damage it said the new sniper he's showing it pretty quick let's get used to this guy's ability sir I should definitely be crouching more because I assume that Crouch strafe is way better as well he says respond his teammate I'm pretty far away though I'm not actually gonna hear him tonight at this time all the way up this name is Netflix then you see just above meal what I thought I thought I was gonna have to get all they'll appear oh my god I might be able to okay no he fell down anyway my sense duty Soviet fruit I got him listen is so much easier with this entire sensitivity I tell you what it isn't just a sensitive to this different for me I'm PC to so much smoother I think I am gain 144 hurts mine use that can't use that either what the heck c6h5 Mac I already knew that I just love that the vibe this guy gives everyone knew that care package she's ever trying to ping the arm right right took it do you guys need some you look guys he'll up I got some syringes for you I'm scared to go in this think it's it's ginormous there's a scrap over that way scraps will city odd I forgot scrapped or sixties been reduced to absolute rubble I'm getting a call they're saying rich of you have you seen the new season I have I'm playing in my name that I thought that the enemy so what is the climbing thing with sky you can climb walls higher it's just not it's not really high you know can i straight quick is that faster than usual so like it should be not sure they are gonna push because they're the ones with in a better position I think it's all find out tonight sniping in there I need to conserve my light ammunition if I can they're just there is in sight I'll do these budgeting I haven't really played much on PC so I'm probably benefiting a lot from I'm probably benefit a lot from school based matchmaking let's be honest here just cuz I don't play on PC that often but that's not why I'm on here even though just feel nice I'll be honest feels real nice one here as I said before because the updates so much faster on PC where am I going that's people scrapping down this way lobbies it so they can't use anything I'm dead I'll be dead I'm dead don't come back like how much house do I have now okay that's unlucky I went I'm too close to that I went to close the race dead - I don't know if she's got her ability good game team we tried I think we should have moved beforehand that's my fault and it kill that I get I wait seven by seven kills I realized seven kills okay Scott's got the new sniper I like it what we're going to another game I guess all right so this is the harvester I'm just gonna land on top I guess someone's landed way before me so it's a good job I do I need a pair if I make the right play there give me a gun got a hemlock with a two full times Oh God that's not good weak L star Kenny's gonna see me now you can I've absolutely murdered a lot of people out here I see dirt BC dying no not quite want a few I want a bit of kill crepe I can know if I should go down there with it's my teammates get shot at I need any drones my guy on Knox is definitely getting healed I need to heal all i doing on the new Kelly I have three kills this is harvester we're absolutely popping off doesn't me right oh god please help me please I'm begging it's usually a finishing move you didn't get here I was just so confused that game I mean I have server transfer Binet honey oh I thought I was season three wins then they're like that it's balloon my body if you can manage to get there don't worry fa FPS Gramlich go on die pate he's shredded if you use this is the new sniper I think please revive me please revive me I don't I don't to annoy him I don't know annoy him I don't at least four people there so I think that guy down mums got a revived in fact that may have even been the guy that maybe the Pathfinder I can't remember nice job good kills not night I like what I see diaper hate be hate respawn when you can please friends thanks very much I should have I should have insta killed the Pathfinder and stole his blue armor but I think the right took it and she needed armor anyways so it's one of those things that she might not been able to survive shooting happy she might've had to run away further so I've got myself three kills at harvester shocking mo but a triple take I'll take the Shaka none of it I'm not sure what it's worth thank you very much oh what's this place maybe I'm oh I don't have a heavy mo gun French appreciate the gesture yeah that's name I guess I'm gonna try not to I try and beat these guys to simulate immediate the triple take was using sniper ammo obviously once seeing as it's a sniper so I had a hammer point range the families are actually really good on the on the blue 20/20 sauce fight if I can get up top it sounds like the new sensor now I want to know how the charge mechanic works I don't mind too much if I don't get to use it this game because I can just upload into the video how can we using it I'm gonna get up top on these guys here we go not let you on top on them but maybe down Tina what a shot I can climb higher so I might just go for this I'll be killed it okay climb me unnecessary Sentinel loose knife but it's one of these one of those bit about Babu I need some of that I want really wants it's what I've seen the balls Oh hurts okay I'm not doing like this again not in the storm not two games in a row run pathfinder sniper on pcs a little bit easier just feel smoother not taking that not falling for that one they're not realize that we were in the storm a lobby there are these guys having to move they would have been up top why do you seem in here I guess I'm not one of them see I'm talking I'm I'm getting hit okay okay not much I can do here we've really don't have that many good armors I mean we've got one level two and that's see my tears rushing up I guess I can try now let's try this shall we just wrap my teammate I mean I saw a week over there run teammate yeah I don't have an extended on anything I I'm in on level one shield it out of my mind that might be a little bit too far for the sniper in my opinion let me get this back my mind he's got my other good oh come on can we just rage by anyway oh no okay for you friend team honest I can't friend I'm so sorry I know you got me back but that's just that's a death wish over there I'm so sorry not much I can do I mean I armed it just wasn't good that's all this apply means name I had no hold on Judi I had no he levels hold left to charge okay wait no that's not true are you just happy okay Oh do you charge up like these I'm gonna have to play on the outskirts of these fights there's mafia one difference you know it seems different these one of these one of those if I hadn't oh god that's not good you please don't I didn't get kill credit on that path mine died down before I mean this guy's a pathfinder too so it's pretty gonna be hot on my heels here as I'll charge you - that's fair friends thanks thanks very much for that I'll guard this - tomorrow dolly please don't shoot you boy I'm just here on a three kill game my defense I did shoot more people and my sensitivities little bit weird on PC so the difficult part of the matter - were to cross is a good chance besides best shields is not I've got a gold helmet so I'll get my ability and my ultimate back faster problemis not sure how much I can actually do with it scraps of cities completely destroyed though at least the middle part is thank you what an absolute godsend Maddie's these guys have got across this way kind of they just killed him Lucy looting Lucas man what my I'll charge it up this is a bad shot I genuinely feel like getting my mouse and keyboard the snipe here it's not in the back oh my god what an water need from that man I have no Phoenix pop that trying to rotate here it's a bunch of people scrapping though who's here top or bottom I'm sugar French short I'm sure that there's a chill battery in that supply and that supply bin Rossi I'll consider cry for too long two squats remaining one of homes over this way one of them would be escaping the storm I believe it was like right here yep [Music] ah I didn't know he had a sight line on me I didn't know at a sight line no did he sent oh no that was my sensor now and I got sense now by this revenue if he was so low I'm livid in myself I didn't know he would have had a sign line on me man oh I could have done that I could have done that however I'm extremely happy we got to try the new gun we went to we went to the harvester we landed there but killed a bunch of people we went to scrap source it see what else if we did we use revenant as well a few times and we finished second on PC these are my first reactions to the new champion tune the new legend on a different system and I could have clutched that man like I got greedy I really really wanted like a phoenix kid and then i could have backed up and killed this guy 100% I could have but thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you on the next one mmm oh not for the battle past ladies outrageous
