hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing mirage who is the best 1v1 legend in the game he's ultimately just too good and too deceptive in those types of engagements also something i wanted to touch upon here is the fact that you don't see too much storm points in my videos at the moment i do try and get games on that map i just find it so much more difficult compared to buzz edge i don't like the way it plays in public games what i think i could do is play ranked on there but i haven't played ranked in ages i'm like silver two or something so it might take me a little while for me to rank up to a respectable level first and then i'll post some storm point but it will be coming soon don't worry thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends do not allow that to compromise us targets right in front of me sending out another nice job i might as well get my shield back there's only one guy left in my teammate he's standing i shoot between me and then so worth you know i might keep this re-45 for a little bit oh yeah talking about storm points man like that map because there's no rotations i think everyone just wants to land at the first poi that the ship goes over so 20 to 30 people will land there but the pois i know people say that about capital city but capital city is huge it can support the loop for like eight different teams they'll be able to fight it out and dip into different pieces of cover and stuff that one it's like it's i don't know the pois are so not small they just can't support 20 people but people love to land at the first poi everyone dies no loot but if you don't landed the first poi with everyone else you won't find anyone for the entire map and you'll get out with a thousand damage happens every time look this is kind of sketchy someone's in there okay i guess no one really died in capital and i better hope there's none behind me because this is looking raw sketchy i have two guns with no attachments kind of no big heels they've got a black market you're going to want to run over there right making contact with enemy hit me up nice drop teammates i have no attachments man stop it ladies and gentlemen do you need to heal over here team i can't use the i can't use the r uh the r9 i just can't i think my my last video i used in both games like flatline and g9 so i'm trying my best to you guys i've got an re45 we got two shield bats every day of the week and i'm actually pretty good on attachments now maybe some make i've already got med kits maybe big hill you know i've done thermite okay i'm very surprised i survived that that was very sketchy but we did indeed survive and i've got some great attachments now two level three because any mags i don't know where we're firing here we're looking the wrong way okay that's making contact here help me out a little bit trying to find them need to be careful is i actually love sometimes like i know i could finish the kill and maybe just buy enough time with my ulti to get away i forgot i didn't get any more syringes look at you did i get that kill the wraith it didn't come up that i got the kill i'm pretty sure i did oh my god well if i'm going to do this sometimes i'll go and get my old purple back i'm going to pop a phoenix kit so give me this back i don't care if you hit me i'm popping in phoenix doesn't matter you can farm some damage someone's got an alternator oh my word yeah we need to defend ourselves here i'm going to try and get him with our teammate using a phoenix kite who shot me like are they there right in front of me i can't see these dogs this is such a mess i can't really seem to get a line of sight on anyone and i'm scared to push in because it's a caustic guy where's she going oh my god she dodging recharging shields so i'm pretty sure there's still two teams because it's an alternate team coming along now is that an enemy was that an enemy there's no way that was an enemy there's no way i looked at valkyrie in the face and thought i was a teammate right i'm pretty sure that's what just happened i'm just watching this back and look how perfectly the valkyrie lines up with my teammates name tag who's in the building behind her scammed yeah i looked that valkyrie in the face and thought hey friend my shots giving my shield to recharge side are they reloading it's on the roof it's down low another squad need it finished there are two i don't know if that's thirsty if there are two teams like i don't know what to do here oh the two times that range just wasn't moving there were two teams here all right we'll end it at the library but i'm not landing at the library i'm landing on the building next to the library i'm not really sure this one's got a name is the mic even close enough to my face here i don't know i actually don't know devotion here i hope it was because i recorded the entirety of an earlier game with the mic in that very position so i mean we'll see i got this bad boy charged up reloading can be taken down oh my word these guys were just hand in hand that loot sucks this is what happens when you all land at the same tiny little building guys like come on what's gonna happen every day of the week i mean i don't know maybe they'll end a bit separate tiny little buildings but they were struggling thankfully the guys were here because these guys were i think joined at the hip without they were playing well i do appreciate it still i do want the longbow do i take longbow havoc answer is yes longbow havoc in capital this may prove to be a bit of a mistake sniper mag in the crafter i got level one here we go i think this place needs a little more yeah oh my god please contact someone up there somehow must be a separate team right yeah it is i can't make this jump i did all that just for them to jump down i'm running out of ideas modern day tragedy there we go bad guy over there train tracks here we go i told you i don't know why someone's bullets too much i've set i have seven oh god let's try and get high ground on him here we rotated faster so god they're already here taking them out with a decoy get back here so much i need both i think that gibby had a sniper i think he was longbowing here we go if i switch that as well i get extra bullets don't have to reload this is tremendous i do need some energy i need energy ammo energy ammo here thanks amigo don't tell me who's in the box i was looking at it wasn't was it energy ammo here nah nah he wasn't he wasn't there before actually i actually don't think this guy had this i think he had an r9 there's no way bad guy over there got one here i really need some of those to land is the pressure my teammates here i'm missing a lot of shots that's rushing in careful teammate there's like 18 of them i'm nowhere near you i can't even get up there honey you can't stand on this why can't i stand still what what is this roof i got such a better position than we do i mean just for now anyway this roof is horrendous look at that yeah i don't think we can get too much banner he just he went way too far we can't follow that up one more minute we were sort of holding those guys there but the the roof was just too horrendous to try and hold it was the worst i bet you can stand on this one yeah no problem at all look at this it out care package coming in this is going to be an interesting end game we could rotate around south we have a full minute to decide what to do here but i have no big heels you want to go that way i guess we go this way we actually are pinching these guys one minute keep in the middle i never found my turbo charger makes me so sad like i can't climb anything on this game at the moment oh yeah yeah can't respond to that ledge impossible what there's something good there need to recharge my shields i'm taking that shots have been the last one because no one's revenging or whatever only one squad left i need heavy ammo shots decoy escape deployed it's gonna be a very very very difficult push i'd have my what do they push that i'm gonna get positioning i'm gonna get positioning i don't know why they pushed that and they're just giving us the win this is the the sketchiest end game ever i got no idea what's going on oh my god how did i get there i could have just walked but it could have been actual i don't know time don't die all right so [Music] that was so sketchy i feel like i've played that entire thing terribly i feel like i've played that awfully and somehow we have come out victorious i ain't got my teammate's banner listen i'm about to run off and revive him right now oh my god that was so sketchy that last team they were pretty good they were pretty good they always had better positioning they did throw the game away though when i was down that ledge and they both rushed me i'm really not sure why they didn't just hold us out of the zone they could have just gate kept us the entire time there you go got out of some sticky situations because of mirage things always a fun time playing mirage thank you for watching i'll see you the next one bye
