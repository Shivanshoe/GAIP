hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't know about you guys but i feel like apex legends is getting harder and harder every few weeks there is a new movement mechanic to deal with now this talks of a hyper jump off a rope instead of just the super jump which was a move mechanic that took you higher than the regular jump before that it was tap strafing and now half the people i'm shooting at go full speed 180 degrees from their original angle of momentum and i'm frankly i'm too old for this you guys know that i'm a boomer what else can i say this is the exact same thing that happened to me in four nights as soon as the 11 year olds jumped on fortnite i was done my career was over they just have a learning capacity far beyond what i am capable of and every time i shot they would create the eiffel tower right in front of me and have the ultimate high ground and i do stand a chance the only way to give myself a fair chance here on apex is to run the ultimate meta combo of the r301 and the either h shotgun i'm playing with janks today i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alright well gabagoo is taking us over here michael scott thinks he's like meeting with like a member of the mob so he's trying to act all like tough in a restaurant and he goes i'll have the gabba ghoul bro i don't really watch the office i only watch like the the funny clips and the highlights and stuff i don't know this is great is so good people like say it's not because it's popular but it's popular because it's good i mean yeah but people just like to people just like to dislike things that are like things yeah and rightfully so no not rightfully so that's not how that should work there's not enough in the world if you ask me somebody just so we're both on the same page here i've got a i got a bow check and a sentinel okay expect the bare minimum out of me he just grappled onto my nades huge oh i slipped no oh good job team close oh really have been you know 158 that i'm on battery he kind of he kind of smoked me it's a mirage larger if you swan everybody's running at ebay anyways so like we'll just kill them so you sure i think that but i miss a lot of these right shots so i need a lot more than one would usually give me okay mate i was going to ask why he was playing like that but that makes sense when you said 150. i thought he was challenging with about three health but no you'd have seen for 150. yeah i hit him in the head dude i hit all three of them here though oh i got one i hit bangalore for 160. i think that was the bangalore i just killed up top i was a little bit too far away what am i aiming at he's gonna get the she's gonna get the res over there oh wait i have zero here the balls what am i doing uh the pathfinder is on the right he's gonna get an angle on you guys i didn't hit him i think he might have had shot me he's really weak behind there okay i reckon that's going to be i'll just do all my names hopefully it keeps them back for a second applicator incoming friends all right i'm going to get a full reset here it's reloading get this puppy charged up oh they are pushing me right really weak dude i don't know what i was doing for us to even die i've missed so many shots they didn't have a mobile did they uh they might have could be one in here he chilled nope he didn't have anything can't craft one well that was kind of that's kind of clean uh what oh yeah there's a guy in the back wait that's a different team that's a different team richard that's two teams there's a guy right here oh yeah that's a team of three that's yeah chasing him huge angle on that bubble at least hey i haven't healed i saw there was a thing on twitter i saw it was really cool the voice actors it was bloodhound and uh fuse and they were like going over a car oh i died i died they're here on your head mate oh bro that's so annoying the enemies are shooting at me incoming care package oh good luck recharging shields oh man that's my fault dude i was literally an auto pilot sorry no

rampart on the roof three teams basically i want to kill this rampart team this fight's over anyway so no no yeah because there's so many people here nice job back oh [Music] mate they just both they

he's one yes oh my god what was that it's ludicrous um my voice edge games are usually land capsule and like only leave when there's three spots there but they're all sort of the same yeah and there's no it's like fight cap land cat fight cap ending cap yeah in round two like we got four squads left here first first round is just closing olympus is so much worse in my opinion is it oh yeah yeah you're right it totally is so much worse hammond labs yeah oh god i died they all turned around and shot at me that was unfortunate exactly what just happened in that last one i got ready armor i mean i was standing in the open with bloodhound you know yeah it happens recharging shields oh come on on the back yeah i think i think it might be yeah because there was uh yes i'm pretty sure three teams good luck we're gonna get involved we need to get involved now less than one minute [Music] your wingman has gotten like a million times better thanks man it's not amazing right now but it used to be rudy rudy hot trash sir the ring's closed do you think i could get uh you might be able to these guys don't look the best there's a portal oh god yeah where was my box uh like yeah let's go this way that was such a mess oh that's not here or something i have no big hills left you know either i'm just walking up i'm not with you just yet i think they're just running why commit to the fight to the point where they're just gonna wait at the end of storm and try to get probably why i have no shields left at all okay wait they're getting capped i think they are how does it feel maybe i die i need shields no shields mate i don't know if you do i got cells how are they not fighting each other what just happened how did they not fight each other this always happens every time i don't no this
