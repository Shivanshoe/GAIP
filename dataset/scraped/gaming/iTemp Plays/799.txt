eggwin supplies each for each welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and they gain that I've got for you it's actually a pretty funny one because at the end of the game were you run into a bit of difficulty in terms of a 14 and my teammate didn't take me not reviving him too lightly let's put it that way but I've also please not send the person in this video any messages he didn't really say anything bad at all he was just a funny reaction and there's no hard feelings okay so hopefully you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the AI template and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends swamp it ease my friends I know be honest with you I can't really remember the open air a few times and I can't really remember the Luke distribution because I've come at different angles sweetly enough even though the ship comes down at the same angle every game I've had to backtrack I've had to wrap around but that was the building I thought it was the of j7 party 45 build in put no shields in fact I think this one might have one level two there we go level two new it's noon and all along it's always good to land here because as I said in a previous win here oh the race portal area is absolutely popping off and it's it's a deathtrap the moments but you can't just Rock a play a little bit I'm going to try and kill the people that won the race water way around especially because I'm gonna go up on teammate going there my victory risky I've already got so many sure batteries that's a good thing about London in the swamp here Oh God bag in here too I don't even know that the thing we're landing here is that is the show batteries the bad part is I suppose the young extended line max I'm yet to find on here and the Scout definitely benefits a level three okay but are you a tease me Olly are you bringing out up I can tell maybe you needed the ending realize I don't know but I'm going to the Wraith force we've taken too long already people are still scrapping there I'll hand you the gladden to Thompson the other mr. Lane friend as long as issue new is not healing only thought I only saw two of them it's not a reviving either either not reviving either either I just said doubled up on there okay I can't even panel tumor that apparently I did reload either this is horrendous AG sense - why - good oh here's the kill leader I feel sort of bad because I had at least five girls I think oh my word have the attachments - he attachments to stroke fruit as well give her three times at all go tear this works sake we can just go through the race portal itself and it'll cook us in the air and we can find our next scrap teammate all right get back London maybe wife's just going over there still twenty nine people it's not the worst I mean we've got our first kills and they're about 35 people so slow down a little bit a of course alright because I feel the kill leader all my words we go always one shot I tickled him that him nice she raced away as well she was leave their ability to get away we both use our abilities to get away from that I smile to v1 because someone was popping shots from high ground appear which came in with the haymaker I hate you all - I hate dropping down on people and then if you drop from a decent height the game sauce shakes your screen a little bit and you can't aim in properly you can you can't you can't shoot anyone when it's like that it was a risky drop I know I mean I wasn't the riskiest I knew that I knew they were Sheila's yeah that's what the octane buying I think all right forecast name build our kill panes a narc star yes it is there wasn't the right through three because she'd have had a voice line shortly so someone he's a narc stars throw away do you AC with me I might go investigate this friend they're only 14 people left all of a sudden twelve other people the safe zones closing in on this location - there we go back up because his friend the climber was on the change there you go I hope that's the caustic ultimate it's wisely see my trying to flank - I don't if it's two of them or three of them as long as we don't get flanked on the left here from this Pathfinder okay so we scare Oni so Pathfinder one shop nice I'm nice team a tremendous work friendly yeah take the purple wasn't my kill or anything doesn't matter I should have probably looted that one first really and there's some game respawn to here as well okay well there are 11 other people left now and also got blue shield annoying me should have linked it the purple one first I'm a gosh-darn for my gosh I'll fall with seven that shield batteries let's explore it this way such a pretty bad idea I'm more tempted to go towards this this fight so his base a third party like what we did what would be doing the other fight we just have to take the zipline over bring their faces where is he you say pop shots this isn't going all the way through Texas months later huh doesn't even look like someone what am i doing you purple yeah good hand out smooth used master run away from now on a little bit until they were a separate team so the blue team is gonna have a gold knock down or something there because the race came from a completely different angle all right nice - it's like that a ton of action let's just take in place I've just please don't take all of it okay okay yeah yeah this is the time to get the hair can freak out of it that is not what at that time especially when there are only two of the squads we don't need to take that fight no one is gonna sneak up and take our killer and if they do if they do engage one point then that's our time to get involved and then we've win the game this is where you try and play a little bit more patiently I guess I think it must be a different team there's no way they would get there that quick I'd remove the Choptank took any of your aims good times shield us to sell my I don't think he's actually I think is off three she left we're it's pretty much Childress yeah it's pretty much shield the sincerity Neely it's got a wingman if he lends a decent headshot with that we can mainly fine rush cells Oliver if you bomb the French that shot it's not let me also you've notjust deed where's my gun that is where's my weapon there why do you shelters Oliver just a fitted me I'll go steal batteries but like one shield sire I can't see them I actually can't see them lassen okay I even realized they were Russian either you know but there's two squads right there and this team of top I don't know how many people they have but it's at least two home off footsteps there's two of them at least two of them maybe even three they have the high ground I don't know what I'm gonna do now get there it is so loud it's so light even run over there let alone doing an entire revive I need this team to get involved here no friends where was that with the team another get involved a bit like bun a nice one right what'd you just say on the back thank you how am I supposed to do with three people standing over there Oliver stuck in a pole stuff in a bowl so it was a team of three that had the high ground here as well so that I didn't stand a chance again your banner Oliver or sorry even reviving you there so the team the team that was afk the entire time this sort of rates one beacon left I can actually bring you back I might steal some of your stuff if you had my brains and shield cells leaving me son of course and always thought himself dominant I needed some stuff too that's it what K that was it that was not a positive training experience then so the gun then occupied self yeah why was that second team not get involved that long um oh my daddy fell hitting me oh my god he fell off the map an IED history spawn beacons being used so you can't even come back Oliver I'm gonna love you Mike sounds like you're trying to do children I'm not sure if that's what's happening but that's a big way I think it might just be one guy I'm not sure we want to rush here because this guy has death crates in his in his building and he could ease the Armus Armus which wait we should we should get a top we should get a tough way I've been here before which we make 45 minutes ago and this building was the best one to be in because that buildings pushed out sooner always challenging then again how's the gold shield man this guy was trying to know I know where it ends Oliver just trust me know what we need to do is wait for this storm to put your mouth there it won't take long I don't have full shields and he could we could getting weak but he could arm the switch by the time we get over there that's the only Sri try to poke I guess farming damage hey Oliver's a lunatic go read it if there is one guy okay that works too now let's do Oliver well played my friend listen I forgive you I think give you the same up my shot subscribe or whatever you said I'm pretty - actually he said and I hope that oh my god afford this 5,000 damage that's the brace with the God shield if there was bullying me there at the end I think your boss or was it Watson I had the God shows before I don't know but they chased me to v1 Nitin nearly 4000 damage and we had a fairly quiet mid game because people just expired off the map this music kicking him because I fell from that and then he thinks I've just wood that's happened a few times now it 11 kills for for Mali and a victory on Kings Canyon all this forgiven we've won now listen sometimes teammates kill it gets they'll be heated on the battlefield it happens it's all good thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see what in the next one [Music]
