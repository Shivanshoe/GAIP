hey we sirkazhi to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are in there armed and dangerous' of play Lisa's one of my favorite limited timers that they've done is of course snipers and shotguns and you're limited to only finding to shield cells the entire game I don't know why it's like that does anyone know why they don't let you find many healer balls like it's Eddie's like gold dust earlier on I literally grenaded myself so that my teammate who had a god bad could revive me because we were on we were we were honestly it was strong team but apart from the shield situation it is an incredibly fun and game modes of play so thank you for watching I do appreciate it if I see you all in five and a half seconds my friends britta centuries my friendliness Reapers ten charities we have got that absolute dream squadron here if alone in bunker it sounds like Watson own life on in this game mode you can get shields and you can get health just by it on what word is that hey one more person left wanting a shield back hey the shield's as castas not absolutely beamed I don't fine with the finisher I think I'll be there up top Khan can't you barely even see him yeah here we go so I think by playing an emo ball character it's again high ground especially on these like massive walls and stuff is just troublesome to say the least trouble so he's plenty nice the I would say give him the chimney you don't want to carry three times and I mean using it gonna have missing this he's still thinking I'm insulted oh you've nailed that straight in the window you steal he's trying to help him too I wish you had no idea how these new thinking there we go that one did nice new yachting absolutely screw mag route straight off his equine boat them over here that Octane's on his last legs but literally the headshot I believe is a low birth from 123 ii 123 Richard diba means hit the often ain't smart out that way that's good lookin fine the end the 123 good brief satisfying oyster here you've got to get to the hair can freak out of it find if I had two shots no they're continuing on my work other people on my way um but I think we find different teams here on a hill where where's the killcam go in here where am i up to what's happening did we win I think we want you guys got a possible respawn beacon there call Dean beautiful good job team or freedom just brush me like that I'm real just came across her family as a family of three just chilling in the woods if I could so close huddled around his campfire which was their walks and Ultima as well a strange sight very strange [Music] I wasn't even scrap that I originally heard who came across these people thinking might be at that compound I $2 did these guys live on budget just a real question Frances I done paid the cheating takes in your fingers team with great bunch of guys pre-show that evening don't need that thanks team the door Pete cave was an enemy PK least now they con la beneath anything notice now I'm a sniper team you know yeah okay you just humor me from the top as well to separate teams - hey we go they found each other 1,400 and each with six girls well yeah the pizza DS my friends will back out again an armed and dangerous because I'm fairly soon very wet why is the Luke looking so sad I think because the loop-the-loop Poland on and dangerous is so small because there's no armor very Sun type of gun you can pick up so yeah off yeah and in the middle that's usually where the armed spawn so it was just looking real sad don't mind if I do there we go I think I saw ourselves a chocolate named Phoenix kit gold dust in this game mode females those two of them all of me very rare that must be the reference to when it was a care package weapon or dream big scrap in the distance of all my friends I came over because this is it is not a rare good anymore not all everywhere big scrap he died ejecta see you need to get out there when it's a level parry your shield scrapping that 58 health it's gonna provide the lifeline revive down low as well boss sake is the track that is not a trap that's the actual Korsak warehouses have shields that makes no sense and people tell me that crypto tanks is costing the man can just have three more ready to face down with a big city was just a impede oh no that's not way that great said he was going your fault call stick safe I miss her down him annoyingly I'm still confused I had the caustic even had even had shields on he was impede blue Evo shield that's fifty shield right there let's see perfectly time to shield cell or something which could be the case they're here on the right are not worthy so difficult push I didn't get around in time nice we spied him I missed why fine so I'll be now let's our stuff the revise at least you I hope people would I'll invite octane gonna nice teammate hike in here on this game mode she'll Salzer just so difficult to find so it's gone in a portable respawn beacon [Music] it's a beefy noisy shot they so difficult to miss the chill tape as well obviously it fires three shots horizontally how would you even miss a guy let me get the classic respawn his friend on earth shot Ellis very good chances the cage think of a I'm bored weeds they want burr but listen this game murder victim which always gonna have a sniper in your back pocket so at least you can fire back at these guys because I don't usually do this I've got no shield McKinley rating in raw feisty with this as well they're three now and to me basically that absolutely struggling well my evo still what have you been updating these 13 people left unless gettin there in Jamaican see I think we're good it's gonna brush this team because they're on the ropes here and doors actually briefing character for this game mode because your ultimate in clear high ground which is really annoying when everyone's got snipers you know and is it I cleared the high ground but unfortunately I just went inside now barricaded in there's some real sample I was here but you come from it's a coffee house anymore trap same my shields of recharge so one guy running around right this guy didn't have gold not to him and he was an incident there was two fled the scene clean a spawn here I suppose look the crater in stuff would push for those grounded anyways area team fighting this way how close is the area is this the area let's find someone that's not good I need to get over there good news is I think this is just one guy I assume mr. solo back to God please obviously I was lacking I couldn't say no you go teammate got you back that was non point shooters I was the opposite of on point - that was off point shooters these are three times for this fire but it's someone close that's not good that is not the whatsoever that long bar headshot this post could easily just wrap around in reels this was safe if they're still fighting we're fine but as you need to be care for the flank ear con can be too far down the I mean there starts crap and I'm getting involved forgetting it's the last two teams these on his last legs teammate there's a team at our minds I don't think he was let's go take the beef paper nice one guy left that's my Watson's self reviving to recharge so we just get safe up in Japan confused by one squad nearby how close is nearby well there's my wast and kill private double-tapping then what's that be right from that distance ooh got some ambition not keep you damaged there we go it's a nice Norway bit of a lull in the mid-game you are the apex champion just on the end of Ruffin 13 squad kills are a night octane party deserved more than three-day creeps have gone now I mean that's not even fair one kill three chip damage we wouldn't even have to kill as many people if it wasn't for the drug because we wouldn't be able to track people Dame and the EMPs made it easier to push through the caustic traps and stuff real good team cohesion a fun game as well I lived on a dangerous
