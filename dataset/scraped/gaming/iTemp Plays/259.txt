hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some solo bangalore in trios and i honestly felt like i was shiv if you guys have seen chief stream you will know what i mean and i didn't intend for that to rhyme as much as it did but when you do watch his stream it's like he's always in a situation with the odds stacked so heavily against him he's always having to smoke and reposition he's always trying to save his teammates and he makes it work it's great and that is exactly how i felt in today's video or at least for the first game the second game not so much so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's reposition here this is the busiest i've ever seen in this place and these two guys aren't in there these guys going inside i've got no guns teammates though double timing if they're getting cocky they're getting sloppy okay we'll sand the doorway but i'll give it a go as well good grief give me a sec recharging shield i got the banner let's bring him home healing watch my back giving my shields a recharge this is ludicrous giving my shields of recharge it's a shame you had no no shotgun shells i might be able to play a little bit more aggressive but it's okay respawn beacon right behind us they did i don't know what's wrong with the um respawns but that beacon's gone all right so it's a full reset a complete reset however i think this guy is uh a lot less looted than i am he had to drop his purple instead of people flying down okay never mind we've been pinched by under the squadron why wouldn't we be pinched by another squadron i mean this may be the saddest day of all time i mean i don't know about you guys but i can't even see this guy good news is this team isn't pushing the one that got respawned the bad news is they're probably gonna push in a second once they've looted up a little bit died in the lava oh yeah he got shot on the rope here they come yeah yeah yeah we find them for 35 minutes this is just they're getting shot by the team at least let me reload i can't see oscar mike responded if i knock that guy and i still have my either eight i'll be tempted to push but that's a lot of ifs give my shields a recharge i need shields there's no way for my teammate to crawl here annoyingly like he's just lava oh look at this guy he can he can move whilst looting what's that what's that feel like if that's me on controller i'm getting absolutely beamed i'll probably die there becomes the greatest mobility legend of all time when i'm getting chased across the map i don't know if i can get there in time teammate 13 seconds maybe that is so sad i am sad oh it's looking fairly busy and i absolutely hate this building and this is why nevermind i've got any right i'll stop complaining i'm hearing a lot of things but i'm seeing absolutely nothing i don't have a gosh darn bolt on my e-race i think he was trying to i think he was actually hearing himself that's so sad i think in that situation me smoking that actually makes it more obvious where i am i'm gonna need one of those i'll just listen just if anyone sees one i'm gonna be big struggling otherwise the the smoke actually helped out a little bit though because he just went down there to heal so maybe not maybe my hypothesis has been proven wrong careful teammate oh i need to reload i don't really have any shotgun i can give you amigo i am hello is it feeling okay comfortable headshot the double head shot's absolutely brutal any did i pick up some of the bullets no it's not just one big scrap there are many scraps dotted around the central scrap zone the c s zed as it's more commonly known and then when you finish one scrap you just third party other one but you gotta be quick enemy in sight i think we're doing okay here yes i got you i'm gonna repay the favor i'll drop my either right by accident and still zero shotgun ammo and not a single bolt in sight it's a modern day tragedy because they probably get the idea name but listen it's so important if i had one i i would have um i would have pushed the horizon probably would have killed it and maybe would have been able to escape but instead that is not what happens there we go free kill these guys are big struggling up there can someone tell me how i took 76 damage from a fuse ultimate but when i use it it's like it's like poking someone with with a gummy bear can someone explain that to me because it makes no sense that's just something unless i walked over something else but i'm pretty sure that's just done 76 damage to me okay it is far more fun to third-party streamer building than it is to land in streaming building and fight over scraps i will say that oh yeah this jump pad here might be useful i knew they'd repeat that but i know they always suck receiving damage give my shields a recharge where the gifts to go hello gibster where's the wraith she hiding he's gonna keep shooting so he starts screaming at the rates come over cause she's not even hiding here i've just wasted all my shocking ammo that race he's still getting kills in the feed oh hello and i think he might be the double predator champion who's solo queuing so we've got to hold hands until we get that right out of here it wasn't you it was a streaming mode race that's sad though i mean no it wasn't that was a fair 3v3 it's just that it was elongated and into a 3v1 all right there are two teams left okay i think one of the teams might be the solo wraith i am miles away oh how did that shot not killer thank you that must have been maximum three three damage absolute maximum i should went for the army switch i went for the quick scope what has happened i think you just arms switch on that red and i got three bass i don't mind i think it might be the solo wraith if this could be a 3v1 however if the champion screen is not lying they would appear to be an exceptionally good player so what i'm going to do here or at least try to do is do what people do to me when i'm left by myself and that is hook my teammates who's got the paintball gun oh i assume it was that team and i assume my teammates picked it up as long as we've got it we should be good everybody hold hands okay a few of them hey they've got high ground for this next zone as well so that'll be annoying of difficult to hit them there we go i need my teammates to push because i'm i'm on a suicide mission here i'm pretty sure that's all too all three right unless there's one more i think he's got a gold knock down and i think he's gonna finish him moved there okay beautiful teammates tremendous efforts this guy's absolutely popping off nymphs this is tough you are the apex i am using aim you see obviously you don't get on your teammates that's what i meant at the end there okay i'll take i'll take a little victory it was a 3v3 would you mean you wanted to play without teammates pathfinder we're a good solid unit there we're a great trio
