hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apologies if you can hear my cat in the background a little raphael here is playing with a piece of plastic which is always good today i have a game for you with one of the scariest scenes in apex legends history it is the last thing that you want to see when you're playing and there is very little that you can do against it also we get a trailer early tomorrow so expect a reaction video from me on this channel so be sure to subscribe if you're new to not miss any season eight apex legends content and finally i just wanted to give a little shout out to my second channel where i'm posting more card videos from time to time if you are in need of more item content then check out the link in the description anyway thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i am down i'm over those packages i mean i i like the guns and stuff and the ammo but getting a uh one or two time on everything is just not fun phone it was a one times h cog they follow me misunderstood yeah yeah that is unfortunate on the way this one's this way too right here already inside saw me one down here need help should be okay should be reloading i got a full team on me i'm okay i got one hit marvin 44 marvin's cracked points nice job jesus come on teammate oh yeah he did go down like two or three times for straight now i think he'd meet somebody he's probably got angry at us because he misunderstood that my thing but he thought we were all going to land packages we're dropping your drone to say i mean i feel like at this point everyone should just know that the packages are just it's just there's no guarantee that you're getting out of there very true this is the team that i killed look at them i'm actually maybe one of them is that courtesy but i'm very proud of my achievement all right oh you fought a full team down there oh yeah i bought them guys got more very nice one at a time um i almost started uh yeah horizon tactical is just scary yeah even with the nerf you just don't know what's gonna happen especially if you're cause like i was kind of i was kind of high ground above them and then you see the horizon tactical to go down and you're just like oh okay yeah we're just gonna all through and we're just gonna take it and dive in your head playstation isn't even looted or wait maybe it is oh yeah that's the sound official call out for now i know i think a lot of people just call it that i think so it looks just like it perfect timing too yeah i'm not kill either i have four kills what's going on here um oh team on me not entirely with you trying to get there if you can stay up right sponge is running off nice job recharging my shield i got this phone i got to kill that wait i don't have any big heels at all i have two cells yeah i have two cells i i have a naked flat line still yeah i got a uh right here and then there's heavy ammo on there this is this is great thank you with you in a sec ah i didn't get the sight come on stay outside uh they did flying outside [Applause] but no way i faced yeah i'm below oh my god mate let's stand the right obtains it back nice job i've never seen people just land on my forehead like that before dude i turn the corner off jesus i had a nade in my hand so i couldn't shoot but i saw all three of them just like on your head that was actually ridiculous i can't believe i took the race with me that was good that was huge oh my god i cannot believe that they just dove on you like that um an extra back there i already have one sorry f2 we're alive i hear a car i mean i'm sorry how many kills you're on five um yeah i'm killing it or not oh okay that's fine are they going for the care packages oh god they're gonna have like 40 armors i got a rampant two cracked cracked like a ramp at the back but as you said alright i'm switching oh my god i got destroyed by that i tracked him up there so nice job nice job nice tremendous absolutely roll smart moves champions out reloading oh man this game has been stressed after stress but in a good way i got bars as well i have three phoenix kids is that enough um no i'm looking for a couple more if you can find anything some don't worry um did you drop one you dropped two live yeah i don't even know what i wanted what's that three stacks of ammonia adventure doesn't look like a lot but then you realize it's 180. yeah it's not bad i mean i i like having a lot of ammo though i feel like it run out really fast four squads left and the first zone hasn't finished usual just the usual classic experience kind have expected another team to rock up after that yeah me too right in the center of the zone oh oh oh oh hostile spot i'd love to see that you see the rest um no what where are we running what are we doing what are we doing okay what's going on here like teammates died and then brought them back to a beacon ah there you go you see him hopping out so now he's got nothing he's got no shields no ammo no good luck oh my god this guy was trying to kill someone that came back from the drop ship what a fiend that could have been their teammate honestly yeah honestly now that i think about it that was probably one of their teammates wait is there someone in here oh there's someone in here you know you know if you're if the back of your head was a player how much damage would you do demolished they would have it's just it's actually crazy the only way for me to make it so i do more damage than you is to tank the bullets myself here you go your whole head in front of me okay so i'm totally down to let that make the resin push this team the snipers dude i have a i can't even pick evan i've got a 12-time sight i fight bats now they just drop back scared terrified they are indeed yeah they definitely don't want to fight close range i just did 53 damage i'm running out of shields is that my shield right there uh i have five bats and i've got um eight cells what do you need i have a three thousand one back oh hold on thank you hi one of these guys has blue shields then you know you're charging my shield we didn't really loot the horizon either did we um no there was a lot of loot in here too uh there are two time anyway i don't know if i saw one of those guys near the respawn beacon like those are the ones we killed this way care package over two miles away i want this team to push but i doubt they ever will yeah they're not gonna one's got blue shield and they have snipers they're probably at the very worst they're trying to rank up shields in that there's four cells here i don't see them anymore but they're not safe zones coming in no way they challenge us they're going to run like here let's explore this way yeah there's no they're not going to push i'm just going to play the long range there's always a couple of those teams in uh pc lobbies they just refuse to push it went all the way around that's crazy for me i'm a really good mate um oh yeah you're insane yeah they rotated all the way through the tunnels now another team on me i'm gonna face back i'm gonna try and get through the tunnel i'm honestly this may be the best play like this way i don't know if it's two teams or not we might be able to flank them still they're gonna try and hold them they're all doing me uh referees do you wanna try [Music] so that's small they're going to cut us off but i don't think they're that smart i mean we have amuses so we win this fight oh they're scrapping someone else they they hard rotated and just come up behind us they so unfortunate i'm not in full health but i'm going in so back here yes they are fighting breasts one nice job 45 seconds oh they're shooting from the top too uh we might be able to just go right yeah i agree i agree the other end half a minute syringe oh great this is like dude what is this ending at least these are the last two teams and they're fighting and one of them's down to two i hear him 10 seconds to the ring it's close at least should we rotate around yeah hot sauce i know i mean no one's gone down yet because they're probably fighting each other from about 300 meters so that's the good news oh one went down sammy with his devo pretty gold devo that's scary i hear a long bow one bar one's on top of a ps5 okay care package coming in oh larry yeah they must hop down right they're all down though oh this didn't work out no it did not um i think one may have pushed it one was further back of the longbow we're backing up oh my god great our lifeline's really low okay i'm just playing i'm not with you nice job we're going to train i don't know how many throwballs i'm getting there i'm hearing something for what am i here week she's behind the rock i can sell fresh nice i heard a rocket come down i swear i heard a rocket come down did you really i don't know what happened i was just trying to not die there oh my god i'd say well dude you can tell we're in the pc lobbies you know yeah 100 because they just don't want to play close range i was shooting something for like grey damage i thought what the heck's that and then she just hopped on the turret it's time blasting dude that was so scary nice dude i'll take it and finally i'm finally filling these new settings now nice
