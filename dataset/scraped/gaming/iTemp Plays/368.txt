hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apex has its problems the matchmaking is a bit of a mess we get a teammate won in maybe 10 games when we duo in trios the higher ranks have a massive ddos and hacker problem but at its core apex is by far the best battle royale on the market it's got the best gunplay it's got the best movement the biggest outplay potential and it's not paid to win i do wish we had more frequent updates and there are definitely things that i would change about apex but know the vr comes close and this game proves it it starts off pretty depressing but believe me you will want to stick this one out because it was such an amazing game by the end and this is one of those games that you want to see both perspectives of so make sure you are checking out sofa's channel at the top of the description for his point of view now seems like a good time to let you guys know that my g fuel code item is currently 30 off there are a few tubs at a time that already discounted and my code will give you 30 off on top of that which sounds like deal of the century to me to take advantage of this you can click the link in the description or just use code item on checkout so thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wait is this a full team landing market probably um now they all went to the back actually said i can't use a sniper intros against trios you just can't nope they get destroyed if they rush you just screw magrude i've got a long bow hollow hollow i'll use it one time i'm literally anything yeah me too do you mind dropping like 20 light rains if you could i don't know if you did thanks i can't see anything i don't understand how they're not on fire dude like i can't see back there give me this v5 behind his teammate just keeps reloading how does he have that again maybe just chilling back there he has a show back uh again like within a second he's gonna have bubbles in yeah 11ish i do the one as well i only have a g7 mate i should probably get this either okay yeah i only have 60 rounds of light i don't really have much i have 77 i'll give you some some mine's only a scope looking for a bolts they're padding i'm dropping some lights drop 240. i'm here guess we just try and get top before they try oh i'm not gonna let these guys kill me that's yeah you could clean left when you go through this choke point just go down to that unnamed village place no friendly fire is kind of broken i feel like the algs are that friendly player yeah you can just run in and just do whatever you want no repercussions exactly like this guy archived me so i couldn't stand and fight to shoot this guy back and i think thinking i could strafe out the ark side but i didn't quite make it but broken uh thank you for this i don't see anyone there's a master below you a 99 i took all the ammo but i can probably drop you soon i got shot from like 210 oh wait they're rezzing right here uh did you drop down that uh oh hold on one second uh here's somewhere okay one of the biggest things yeah they're inching up as well maybe the valve cracks crack cracks on that night shield that was the race she went oh she phased back she's back here i'm pushing the team inside this building let me see six six cracks on the ground on top break this below shocking my door looks like someone's like knockdown's getting shot by someone across the map what is that noise she's shooting one bullet at a time let's do that like a purple knock down this thing's pushing that this is one right here let's get this guy's stuff on come on sometime behind behind octane 16 116. there's zamasu i have zero i have two cells i fourteen look at you going around that's not what crack then reloading other ones back here he's low purple broken i played oh my god zero bats on this guy i i have been struggling with loot for so long i have 17 cells you need something uh hold on i have six i have five cells oh my god what a title of survival that's the honorary on no clue how we're still alive these teams that like when they come one by one it's just so much easier that was the same thing the octane rice valk theme i hear it octane yeah we just stay right one's low ground tends to shoot that but he's running he's running towards us all right if i i'm going to take the opening for electricity they have to move his harness because i knocked out him yeah they're just showing up here recharging shield oh he caught by a bit hold on well they're fine with the re45 so i'm a little bit intimidated they are just a psychopath one of my video titles uh i mean i'm not scared of these guys at all i kind of want to send them i'm dancing let's go we have no big hills so we just need everything a bit of poke like 50. yeah i'm yeah i'm already running out of shoes so i'm lucky you got i-14 thank you i want their bats i i would pour it over there but i don't think my part will make it that far they have to move i mean it's got a minute got a minute we'll just try and crack one and then send it i mean i don't think we're gonna be able to get that i i won't definitely so i gotta use my 99 now uh jenny's heavy um i mean i have 56 at spare 45 seconds rings close i'm using the wingman i've got 60 spare now nice thank you yeah i think they're i'm pretty sure they're rotating already i think so yeah i see people just took that thing it's probably there i haven't seen him in pay ages gang not far from the ring we got 30 seconds left we're grinding ranked yesterday and we've grown your ranks again renee yeah but direct no no benefits from it none other than mental deterioration and a lot of pride someone's in here point one on gold on this right side we want to do the guys cracks cracks one for 120 but someone's inside point one red i need to back up a little bit i did hit every single she's gonna making contact here i don't think i'm gonna play this i'm gonna play outside you got bamboozled yeah because this box might make it difficult for us make sure no one can see us like with their angles team over here yeah i've probably gonna shoot in the back they're beneath me they're on this door where we were yeah with five nights on him i hit him flat like 30 flies oh my god i knew this is going to happen man i think we just go this way take the rope across yeah yeah i'm gonna go left i they're taking all the loot too oh my god this whole game has just been me struggling with loot i haven't popped a single bat this game i don't think anybody have that one how much damage you want uh 2500 okay nothing too crazy that team's fine someone who's trying third because that's those two in this team one minute until close uh yeah or we can just try and take this fight while they're fighting that's not me oh i think you mean like this team of three yeah they're gonna have to push to us um we can hold them out i don't have all the light in the world we can win this yeah we can hold this i'ma hold this head glitch right here yeah i don't know we're here they keep scanning above they still think we're there so we just catch one which catch on the train tracks okay they saw me they saw me go for a big nade on that i'm engineering you know trying to get this uh broken [Music]
