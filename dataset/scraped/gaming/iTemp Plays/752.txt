he was a guide to twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now in season 5 came out I've read through all the patch notes to make sure I knew everything about the weapons the characters for the new season comes a load of changes and I wanted to know what was going on but one thing that respawn missed there on the patch notes at least on the subreddit was that they updated and upgraded even their Sentinel sniper if you remember these gun came out and had a different mechanic to any of the weapon on the game you could use a shield battery to charge it with disruptor amps disruptor rounds of course doing more damage to shielded targets now the update that they forgot to put in the patch notes was that because that the Sentinel no longer needs s your battery to charge this up but instead only use these to shield cells this means that you can run around and you can keep you charged at all times it doesn't feel like a massive commitment using one of your short batteries and you can have these disruptive rounds pretty much whenever you want them it's just time to do the animation every now and again so I found a sense now right at the start of this game I was trying to snipe as much as I could and I've got a good amount of decent shots in this game place I hope you enjoy thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends new school town at least my friends there is still a school involved in this area it's best school turn used to be its school time to return after school double longbow set of e to the weed one easy son of great I've guessed so kind of two separate kind of weapons right this is definitely an upgrade needed so is this because the Sentinel she got a level four Bower stabilizer taken off your hands but it's got a little bit of a buff recently nine tons of live damage numbers or anything the drone beheading is not to charge it up with the shield batteries and no would ever want to do that because your batteries are so good our son climbed one all the way don't know why and there's money have a net only takes yourselves a lot better a lot more accessible I wrote you could go so far as Lobo she literally Swedes she's fleeing the scene hey stuff but as soon as I get some more shield cells I ball puts one this I'm gonna need one of the in fact I can trade you you go I'll sure you'll have one one XMP blind I feel it all definite healthy people's armor isn't too good start again it's not that trans name hopefully want it but wants to know is trailing behind I mean cut them off with a bit of a bit of high ground here and knowingly disrupt around still have that timer on them I think that maybe the timer shouldn't even be there maybe that's a buffer that they could use because when you use your shell cells on your body shield it's not like you'll punish your deteriorates into nothing why is there a planter way around like why is there time Leon disrupt around 16 jail bus after again 300 hey you give me Oh ie more than anything there is this - please Lee that was for Sentinel shots in a row that I've connected and that actually may be my personal record because typically on this game I'm not the greatest sniper I used face be good on cut nice to be wrong just not on this game he's got some shield self-edit sniper did they have that they did have the am avoid all right there we go 36 shots isn't too bad well 7 shield cells I've got a little bit more I feel like I'm the CEO of shield cells so maybe there's the Sentinel is something I should be using and it would give reason for me to carry 34 shelves as a match and you guys wouldn't start hating on me I'm not using that sniper cycle got a digital threat - all right friends you've got the good stuff over there oh sweet it's might empty - French actors probably bored my offensive body I would think no trying to counter the pink already got one the worst thing about using the sniper at the moment on this game is that the stacks of sniper ammo so small if you get into a decent of engagements you you're elect by the end of the game and no one usually snipers on this game so it's very difficult to even find it on bodies against of to show you'll miss that shot because having a sniper it's actually kind of fun for starting the fights you take one shot with a sniper then it's just your spray weapon who doesn't go upstairs my situation this is one of the reasons I missed Kings Canyon when it when it went away in what was it like season 3 I missed these buildings because you just save time and keeps real life ferg apps in the woods and people just didn't I was going on they didn't have a clue is going on it's quite lows I mean look friend big scrap going on humongous crap some may say and it's in the not-so-distant distance to in the distance they're just trying to get safe I'm not entirely sure it's worth pushing down low here because we would be the ones we'd beat the bomb at the health trying to push up to the safe zone it's way better if we wrap around here it might be worth if it wasn't uphill but they would have zone advantage and they'd also have wide advantage and I can deal we wanted them not to not work not when you can just run around the mountain you know hopefully a scrap should still be going on no one's fine but no one's died either we have so many levels it's unreal if we're on hold for us Sheila's take a 140 if you see us with one hand behind us online shoppers ever seen receiving your teammate just be careful here if this is his teammate it's ok if you can let another team and worry you talk be less risky guess we're chasing this but ages on might disrupt our aims 26 headshot she's got them he's got the 1550 he loved all shield cells with the the gold armor no one's sure is tanking every single shot just abstract leak on the last month really i rosie was this long why do you worthless charging yourself wait we can get past this way could you ever get past this way I flipped this as this mountain being closed off or something what's going on or maybe not I don't think so I felt like I'm just a bit of a fall here the Rio this spots remaining and with two of them were down here right honest the that's the fights over there you go that's my answer are they losing this to my shield disrupter ohms such a good way to start fight off is risky but maybe I was wrong hence the animation as well which is frustrating this is such a good book that I am because it makes it so when I'm charging this up I don't mind too much if I if I were a nap time to shield tells isn't that much and I carry so many anyway it really isn't much of a scooping air conditioning box or whatever that is it really isn't much of a commitment you know a shield battery especially back then I flirt I mean I've got eight of MoMA's so maybe my point is not a void um just because apparently she'll batteries you find in recent times I don't know if they buff deep they must have honestly you may have she'll batteries you find in Alice over in that sort of three or four weeks or something is outrageous so you can save the shield batteries without shooting you save this your batteries for your your Gila boss and then just carry the shield cells for your sniper because they seizing afraid to be fun I think I've ever language somebody spiked the shots what are they doing never enough there's no where they're camped in there they won't sit in there and not shoot us they've already choice once so what's the plan I think that just fleeing the scene as it's commonly known the herd might disrupt arounds and they've got a severe speech and they decided to run off its fight it being a 2v2 that's the entire way I have no librarians whatsoever or nothing look how they did run off I would have been able to kill him thank you it's rather two times I feel like diving I feel like they've improved the high magnification sensitivities on controller I've been using the two times in the three times and I can actually move them fairly quickly at longer ranges I'll ever try to fix a lobby which is always nice I leave off me I don't even know I'm hoping for here you put this thinking it can't like be set up to be honest and walk a mile for me where where are these team where'd they go you over there oh my god subtitles Pro Skater down this fetus brain you fer after movement good grief you're looking silly no French you lookin real silly you told that my descriptor ends though annoyingly I still crack these shields how am I supposed to get on me how do they do this alright furious that you've been running away from you're wasting my time and now your punishment is that I'm not gonna miss a shot watch Pete me I don't even know I'm here pick me Hey okay perhaps maybe it's going doing Taj wasn't gonna miss I tried to tell him this persuade a hundred twelve uh that's the shadow arm leases I think that's their ultimate shadow cat shield he just had the revenant halt how do I then must use the balloon they're absolutely shot at chop punch misters they're like three houses evening how did that punch apiece if I was the last one in this got out it would absolutely fumée new sound imma kill then [Music] you came to me feel like we were a solid team I love this reference key it's in the bottle pass not sponsored it's just a good skin it's been in the legendary ones all right six kill each you mean seven let's be honest it should have been seven I was kind of playing with the Mirage a little bit I tell you what though if you see a sense at all definitely worth picking up as a long-range option a great way to third party and engage a fight and then you've run in with your on i-29 and your know you're after your one of your prowl or something a lot of strange action because you know there happened to pull their shields back on that you read fun I'm gonna try and pick this weapon at more thank you for watching though that's my little review on the NewsCenter so yeah thanks for watching I'll see you on the next one [Music]
