hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are back using the rv45 two games with the re45 with hammer points and i am still so certain that this is the best close range gun in the game this season the only problem is is that you can't consistently get the hammer points to make the gun good and re-45 falls off before the mid game and no one wants to run around with like three different hop ups in their inventory however when you find this early on and you use it for the rest of the game it is just so good so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh i am okay if you want to share loot my spare p2020s again with no ammo already taking your your leftovers wait i might be dead i'm pk taking damage friends are they in there i love donating they not they're not in here i'm gluten i'll put the dough for you both of my doors i
