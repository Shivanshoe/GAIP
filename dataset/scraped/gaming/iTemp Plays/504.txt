so we hit one million subs today after all these years originally this item plays channel was my second channel i had a main channel there was exclusively call of duty content back in 2009 and then in 2014 i made this channel to post some other games i purchased some indie games here and there and then it turned into my battlefield one a rotomax ranked channel a series that was 188 episodes long and still one of my favorite series that i've ever done and then fortnite came out i had around 18 000 subs at the time here and my channel blew up thanks largely to the help of ali a my good friend uh that i've known for a long time now and that changed my life i just graduated university and before going out to start my career i decided to see if i could give youtube my full attention for the first time and fortunately it worked after fortnight i moved over to apex and here we are today but i do have a few clips from my earliest videos that i wanted to share with you from 2009 i was 15 at the time and this first one here is from before modern warfare 2 even came out there were probably under 10 people uploading this sort of content back then but yeah here you go what's up guys got a game uh war on cliffside it's grand war so there's nine people each team it's pretty interesting really because this this game i'm playing with i'm not he's on my team but i haven't like invited him in he's not we're not together like but i'm playing with like uh for whatever [ __ ] how you say his name um he's eighth in the world i'm kills at the moment quickscope that guy kind of that guy nearly kills me if this guy kills me if this guy would have killed me would have changed the game so much but he didn't and then this next one is from my first ever modern warfare 2 video what's up guys this is my first modern warfare video modern warfare two days and i've got my barito with fmj um because uh i don't i hate it when my teammates capture all three flags you ain't got a clue with a respawning and it's very possible for you to die from a random angle so i know that by because i already and i'll just shoot that guy off and climb back up the ladders because these ladders this roof is a very very good spot you can see c you can see b and you can see where they spawn eye so you can practically see the whole map so it's been a long journey to get here and i wanted to say thank you to you guys for your support whether you subbed in 2009 or whether you subbed yesterday thank you for allowing me to turn my passion into a career i do appreciate it a lot so i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends in order to live i literally just landed nowhere were you indecisive here three pills and i still have a mozambique huge spots one's rudy wake up all right i completely i'm gonna do double spitfire ari this puffy one all right i'm going to the map room here you go i think they're here at repulsor should be at least one or two teams i'm not checking my map room just yet i've got a loot what's it looking like yeah one team once again also one north of that and then another i just need zone too already yeah loads of people actually oh right on me you can survive i'm on the way yeah i seem a little sweaty but it should be fine once to the right recharging oh gold extended light i just got a gold extender light too i wanted to use double spitfire but i just can't happen anymore you got two of those i'm sad they took the balloon out of here i don't know i don't know what it was doomed to anyone i don't know what was wrong with it but they got rid of it and it makes me sad uh i agree this is all i'm losing down here but i heard people find cage they're still scrapping yep i hear a triple take from 45 miles out yeah yeah you know the vibes is this it's gold i want to see what it is uh energy mag i do lobos like i like lobo but then i don't because i see so many good items and i just have to check oh yeah i mean can't help it extend it too oh my god there's three of them that's the third one i've seen the gold mags are actually fairly common which is great yeah i don't understand the rarity like the spawn rate of the gold items because like uh gold turbochargers crazy great oh believe me right but that bags really aren't enough mate this is a really new idea coming up i'm gonna dive i'm doing it i'm almost there i'm like 20 seconds behind you oh yeah oh it's going uh there's another team coming from left okay they might jump down on the damage one of the names it's all kicking off i'm going in on the way oh [Music] okay absolutely so yeah uh thanks for playing oh i wish i could do that i'm stuck down here why would you look at me i'm literally it didn't even work what didn't it got canceled it's the best tactical ever what's the cool name uh 30 seconds off oh my god oh my god [Music] whoa i think she double edged on me she's one shot though horizon's won i must want to die to see what you did to me there come on i still need you um they were a little sweaty though those last two were a little sweaty so i think she was hearing me really night in the head yeah i think controller any any phoenixes um no but i put a two to four time on my 301 for some reason okay nice nice that's the og um oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's actually not too bad not terrible not ideal but not terrible ah nice job not the worst thing i've seen more jobs i feel like there's somebody on the left side so i'm gonna go left okay there you go yep thank you my decoy for a walk i like doing that just trying to like keep them with you alright i'm just gonna wait for them to come out only one of only room for one mirage here in this town that was the end of that squad giving my shields a recharge i think i've had red armor like 10 times oh the goal 301 oh my check out that god coming in um so uh when i was streaming the other day someone asked me is the goal is the barrel gold that was a great question um i mean who knows not me i haven't got a clue but it doesn't do anything if it is you know maybe it is but didn't didn't it get rid of like muzzle flash or something yeah but they changed muzzle flash didn't they um did they get rid of it or did they just reduce it no they what they did was they instead of the muzzle flash appearing at the barrel of your gun it appears like it appears beneath your gun so you still got the effect of it but you can't see it's not on your it's not if you shoot now you can't see it but if i watch you shoot i can still see the muzzle flash and still see like the lights and stuff so it just didn't i mean i don't understand the purpose behind having muzzle flash in this game yeah it's realistic is it really yeah you can send out decoys of yourself and um yeah but then it's like well why is there any recoil and stuff it's just a mechanic i guess not a mechanic but this makes it look prettier yeah i guess um i have way too many kills for my damage how many of you talking um yeah you know you got 10 kills and you got 2 000 damage no no no it's worse 1500 damage well i have 12 i have nearly 3 1300 damage and i have six kills give me a second oh this is just i just deserve this game that's all it really is okay what's yours i'll be talking i have i have 12 kills in 1600 okay you know rich when you're just an absolute unit people just die instantly that's just that's just how it is i mean people just uh just are just obliterated i look at them and they're dead i mean i mean i've lost a few uh fights too you know if i didn't lose the gunfight you wouldn't get the kill so that's true just you just gotta win your ones exactly um i heard you heard those shots right yeah yeah go around some way they have to come this way all they could have went all the way around that's what's up oh yeah i'm sure ah they i know that many heavy bullets do you have many heavy bullets um i think so 16 one of them dropped one's right below me okay solo he's just trying to push her up there's one in the back he's running out she's right on me by the way i haven't even really cracked on me i know i do want to use thank you oh my god that's just so broken it's really good really not oh change guns what is this cracked [Music] very nice cg i went for a 360 play at the end look i don't know what it is right i can't play if my cat is on my desk she's not in the way she's you know what i think i think you put your cat up there on purpose and then you if you have a bad game you use that as an excuse well she's just vibing she just sleeping that was embarrassing because i tried a 360 at the end and then i didn't hit a shot so i don't know if i can use that or just like lag the video a bit is that not going on the ground uh not that one not that one yeah okay okay understandable we'll see
