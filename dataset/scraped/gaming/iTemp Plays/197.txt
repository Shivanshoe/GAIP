hey what's up guys it's fridge welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i get to use the g7 scout once again and it reminded me how sad i am that this weapon is now in the care package especially with the release of storm point i would be so much better on that map with a long range option like the scout and i know i could snipe but i'm nowhere near as good with the snipers as i am with the g7 and i don't know why that is but it's true thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh my favorite one is that uh is that uh that halo the halo car oh my god turns into a microwave it turns into a solar beam i've got bag makes sense for me to keep this there you go mate oh yeah yeah i should probably pick that up level two it's fine i flip my involved so i don't need that uh i need what the uh level two line mag uh yeah i don't have a light gun actually i'll pick this up i'm not path i thought it was path who are you wasn't my path that's path that's game right you were before yeah i don't remember it wasn't me i couldn't find an exciting light mag i found like three of them can i find it i need to have your engine no i just spent like five minutes trying to climb up that building there's one right there oh my god well this big scrap over here market too try not to die i'm trying not to die doing my best oh my god don't go that way don't go that way i broke it watson over there oh yeah they did tweak nice half the squads are gone good more treasure for me broken near the top oh they're all second to top floor all of them team of three just hiding corners careful i think they're healing though yeah they're healing recharging my shield and drop down a sec just hanging up i almost broke out one of them yeah he went for like 50. back to valk one's top floor yeah one's gonna fly there actually you're like 80 hp thanks awake ish i don't want to yeah yeah i think so that's really weird nice where did everyone else where did the fuse go there was a fuse all right i swear there was yeah there was i don't know where he is though he could have been miles away you can you can launch that bad boy in the lava no cabbage no cabbage no cabbage is involved this heal up a little bit i didn't even use my low brow ah there was nothing in there was the knot's pretty battle it was pretty bad he's got white uh one's on bridge and the other ones are over there trouble right yeah obtains one [Applause] yeah they make an appearance it's over this way i knew i should have stood there i have phoenix i'm fine but the extended mag situation is diabolical oh there we go two level twos my favorite kind of look the kind that's all mine cover me i'm using a phoenix kit i'm gonna get some energy then i'm gonna run over with you hey yeah yeah i have a i have extra energy kind of sort of not really if you need something 400 in here mate that's thank you though they want they do not want to move from this building no it's theirs okay that was a bold play another fuse ultimate that's number two he's got purple got so many fuses oh on you know what i don't have a med kit that's a good call do you need a med kit kevin yeah no yep nope nope split it with me okay what's up 60 energy i need some stocks uh do you remember where the sheep came from no i was tapped out i was looking at the uh yeah it was a funny tweet though it's pretty good i'm going for the uh the care package of doom oh did you uh i don't know i don't know if this was in the passion or not i may just be dumb but there's gold guns everywhere now oh really oh nice i've not seen that i've been landing on them like a lot ah okay at least since the uh the update she'll bat purple armor i'm sad oh that purple armor no mine's better pop that purple armor real quick what do you mean pop it what does that mean oh that purple iron pop it real quick i don't know how to achieve that think i may have heard the remnants of a scrap all the way west i hear them south they're like harvester they're gonna have to come through the tunnels but uh what are the kills looking like because they're not killing damage seven and thirteen hundred i'm well uh will i throw your game if i play on mouse and keyboard no give it a go i definitely will no you should not just keep the controller yeah yeah yeah yeah if they crack your shields hey missus i am your system i hear him scrapping that makes me think of that meme where it's just like uh uh call an ambulance but not for me you get cracked looking the controller oh now they start scrapping when i get here okay they wait for me i see someone over there throwing an ark star a minute is even worth me being here um i don't know probably not i mean wouldn't it's less worse or less worth it for us recharging shields let's stop fighting there we go that's pretty cool i'm gonna give it a go man i'll they kill them 45 seconds until the ring closes it's got a rumbagio be careful they don't do any damage anymore i got stuck earlier like i got cracked and that was recharged i have to pop a phoenix because i don't have any bats okay man we should just get out of here he's gonna hop on me nice job dude he might drop on these red armor going from inside okay zones closing careful taking too much damage i don't i don't want nice i think it's just him check he's got a gold yeah it's just give me it's just give me i'm running away give me these only one oh there was a there was a i've one medkit this is going to hurt me i need to go oh yeah we're dead we might be dead i don't have any uh yeah i don't have any uh things either oh god i've got a low bro he jumps no papa i should have taken the gold armor then i could have just dropped you the arms stupid i'm gonna get the gold you can't it's inside the vault only i could have got it but then he would have destroyed the but there's nothing else in it oh god i'm dropping you med kit is this shoe behind me i have two i'm taking this back okay i think we're all right then yeah i think we're fine i think you're panicking for nothing no i think you're making
