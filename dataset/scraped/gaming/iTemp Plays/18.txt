hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now prior to the game that i have for you today i had been mixing it up trying other legends and it wasn't it wasn't working to say the least i don't know if you guys ever do this you try and mix it up and then you have to go back to your main and like as soon as you go back to your main it starts to pick up again you remember how to play the game properly and you actually get a win and this is why i'm a pathfinder mate like he's just so good at controlling the fight and taking different angles like i just love playing it i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what do you say that for this isn't good squadron please don't make me heal this up the energy rambling i don't die i have to pop syringos nice uh we have to run like this way immediately but otherwise we're not going to find anyone this entire game graveling here i go there's another squad i got him there's another team above us though yes indeed oh that was close this team didn't move what are they doing uh i think we've got some throwables yeah it's just me come on come on oh my god why'd they decide to fight he's too tiny these guys could afford us when we were fighting the team and they would have had the high ground on us they could have held us at the rope anything but they hesitated or something i don't know so the team has to come across now no light your guy probably had some convert to look yeah i'll come back to it if i need to do this other team come across the ones that are sniping us almost certainly not give me a second fixing up something good this way what you guys doing doesn't get rid of that you revive that guy and now he has to leave careful around that corner oh my god i need some more shotgun i mean who the heck is firing just him the ring is nearby little solo guy okay i need those bats that's huge what played well played i mean i got four kills but as i said ten whatever the ring is save yourself i've crafted an off-road one i mean or i could get it down that'll work too fine the way they push when they've got a teammate then and i'm so far away by the time they get here anyway we do need to try and take advantage of this where'd he go oh no the heat shields i mean we meant to just sit safe you're down the zone no that's the other team's killing each other is there still a guy back there you guys are firing or something i mean i don't know i'm fine just fixing up r301 is a laser beam if you guys didn't know if you guys haven't heard of this gun before it's called what the author i want shooting properly it's the worst angle of all time darn it i actually could have got a kill that would've been nice well i don't know what these guys are doing carrying in a corner this way these guys could be gate keeping us and i don't have um i don't have grapple so i'm just gonna take it easy on the on the entry here oh treasure back the treasure back angle i could use optics for a marksman [Music] a that is a huge crypto there you go nice they're huge that crypto was ginormous i love pathfinder i haven't won in about three hours i'll play pathfinder once and i'll win just because you can get the positioning that you can get as pathfinder apex champions took different angles i cracked the watson or near enough and i just started launching nades from a different angle they were confused they were they were scared they were lost but the pathfinder was a dominant peak i don't care about the kill credit it's fine i need to blow damage i've got two fewer kills but it's okay team effort gg
