hey what's up guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back on apex I took a few days break because a warzone update came out yesterday and when I went on to the apex legends subreddit loads of things were kicking off okay the biggest one is the opening of the bunkers this one and neither cages opened up and inside you can get yourself at guaranteed gold prowler which is easily one of the best guns in the game for the auto prior left with a level 3 extended mag you can't go wrong personally I've always been terrible with a digital threat on the Prowler I am adamant there are some anuses issues with this gun loaded but he still strikes and having off the spawn is unbelievable now if you play these in armed and dangerous the two guns that I've got from is smart with the called Sentinel and the gold either eight shotgun although you can also get a gold Mastiff in that game mode too so if you're lucky you might find that way to tweet there as far the best thing is I didn't get contested once on this spot you just stroll right on in you claim your free gold prowler and you climb out it's as easy as that so hopefully you enjoy today's video if you do be sure seva like rating subscribe to join the light empire and i'll see you all in 25.5 seconds my friends okay the new kind of secret bunker tease my friends it has been open for pretty much 24 hours then not once if I have been contested over display it is a parlor once more I'm pretty sure - guaranteed Prowler but people already were saying that they've got of the goblins here with me so far 16 golf pro after golf hour my teammate taught me this trick a few games back you can actually where's the rope my stuck oh no it just takes a while there we go you can evacuate through this little secret hidden evacuation pod thing otherwise you have to go the way you came which isn't completely ideal or the people are they're challenging you and stuff Milo day is actually looking quite a tasty I'm just gonna need a few more heavy rains who are you firing it who on earth and landed here doing that I keep homely to turn into auto mode [Applause] sanic so much closer it's going on who are these people who Lance a Enric team I feel like a bit of a lunatic because when my teammates I don't want to use the rs45 I need a decent lie ammunition gun so I'm running kind of low on heavy rains and I can't use two of them they'll be one somewhere if some migraines there you go sit around all kicking off at the cage almost to my left as well it'll be careful in ziplines name they've been nerfed I want to see your friend we can get an easy kill if they don't realize have fell all the way up the top on that purple by himself don't buy something camping at the top of the cage I'm sorry fringe well I've been there myself it sucks I'm coming don't worry I know there's another team I'm not gonna over loot when people here shoe my teammate oops our sorry fringe I mind you doing one show as well you know I tell it's a decent old once I saved you I probably came in at just the right time I just need heavy there's a lot of boxes here I assumed someone there we go heavy I disguise gone i tonight that's fine as well too close range guns you know what that party works at Pathfinder people scrap in the distance here you go I mean going scrap these people over there and I know check out over there there's a team over this way and they're not scrap anymore which leads me to believe they may be looting which is the perfect though use the perfect IRA for this arc starts no nevermind he's definitely seen these well I'm not sure we had a nice bit closer doesn't last as long as you think it does Oh twisting time if this hits any of them I'm rushing in not ammonia there you go see both but only for a total of 24 teammate but their sugars guaranteed to give me carsick doer crazy maneuvers make the plane this is one of the most fun gonna load let's use the online snow Prowler it's like you just dominate close-range the only issue is you just need to get close range let me poke in from up top isn't really gonna cut it and one the guys you all need to know there have any heavy am i well the good news II I didn't you're sending in these boxes 16 I'll do thanks it's kinda taste well perfect okay contact with target let's look at far place safe ami CC stuck between two of them recharging shields a slitting has nailed he's just chill taking us game sure took a throw name our once point add that this is an entirely different team and they're not showing each other I've been a little bit suspicious that's our friends band they might be teaming it's a bait I finally found each other I killed the whole squad she'll sell off all right I'm not gonna lose don't panic I'm just gonna switch armor Bessie can pick up a few of these bullets all right you'll gain the VIP treatment here because there is a ton of loot in here good eye I'm gonna click my ultimate to get you back real quick Anto Reviver as they say in Italy we've taken of Italian lessons as well and will be looma gritty scrap find a far-away that produce royalty to get on top of the cage I would assume another yeah looks like a cage this is this is way to gate cake yes because you don't really have too much we don't have a point of advantage like at all and I missed and he's got a havoc I'm scared Ethel in this full health but now they take no one downed each other when they were finally should I listen to the team come in helping hands what can you do I knew there's another team I just took too long I took too long healing if I'm up top I think we probably win that I'm seeing a team like laces for the team gone okay 15 under damage absolutely alright back again at the vault arm hidden loot but apparently no one knows about even though it's been open for a full day and it's got a guaranteed gold gun spawn another game here uncontested which is beautiful please be a shotgun it's a sentinel once more I can't use this gold Sentinel it's got her range of sight unless you like firing at people from three kilometers away which I'm not really that good at so I'm just gonna use the longbow here it's a bit of a shame but it's okay unfortunately on walls edges there Mathis on rotation two moments so the only way I can play Kings Canyon is actually here I mean dangerous but I've got a bit of a strategy yeah you play a lifeline you land on there because it's also a charge station and you come up here you drop it and by the time you finish learning needs means building attachments you loot up a little bit you get off luma groot eat hold on a second not screw name care package I'm just gonna give you all you're gonna need so you go see up sells bag and you're good to go we're scrapping fake school team big scrap and buy big scrap I mean they're throwing one grenade and it exploded and it's more than enough for me there we go French yelling that up again shielding a puff hundred fifty damage I always forget how fast the longbow can shoot window it's a separate team I had no idea bottom teammate there we go nice we're gonna need a shield for you good grief and knock down shell and use your tanks one of the shots okay don't sprint Jim explode it's me this isn't worth it this isn't worth it they're too close to Paul so they can just get away just get there we need to let them get further away from the poor salt because when the rifles not there all she had to do is hold her shield and then back up we should have been able to be sure to get one of those guys at least you've played a little bit more stealthy but it's okay I don't mind the aggression professors of fresh air actually have an aggressive T me here we go sorry I'm not used to playing lifeline there you go sexy shells as well these guys I don't think of coming back yeah sure that's is the undeniable noise of a Gibraltar ultimate otherwise known in the trade as a Gibraltar US of course basic of all if you rained out of gibraltars presents no no no a big scrap down here and we've got a spy pounced on this [Music] thank you for providing Ryan the corner someone's here as well I assume this one master slaps oh that's yours oh okay it's if it's overkill with the arc star this team must be brushless now surely oh he's run another one from the child station teammate he's blocked me out mate your pinking low-tom getting absolutely but it's all good should have been there I went down but I think you realized the urgency of the situation widening 400 I'm gonna stick with my purple engine 14 damage on Eid are u triple 10 men on see you haven't got a prayer I'll level this one up as well my great Nora in agreements I got Pushpa our best bet here is to try and wrap around unnoticed although we are flying through the air and it does make a lot of noise when you go through the Wraith portal this might happen pushed off a scrap and each other though this is good news learn anoint I did enough know they're showing one teammate that's not good literally docked as soon as I shot would have been headshot grass what you can do about that good news is my teammates turned around she was going down the stairs there for second I think both spots a heinous turn a mess sending it to really hood the same screen third party you guys do it you're literally throwing the game for everyone apart near the team you're throwing it for us you thrown it for yourselves okay rid of them quick they're not push I've got a proper third parties there we go I could hear someone charging something up how's that not a head shot so I can see salsa for the armas which again the octane rings gloss 86 on this on a done well to most well get a few more she'll sell some this hopefully you've just topped up I think this is three people to be three what do you got a 15 times sizing as well well I find quite a fast heal anymore it's just so sad I'm I'm just bored of healing already I'm just gonna stumps goes back I mean when this that's got a go-bag teammate I'm telling you this is the play I'm life flying up and I can a of care of I've you you should have to pinged on their name so go slow give me that gone back I complete the other jobs at Bob back from life I like this will hand fair enough it's still a little bit annoying to get a revised but an afk revive I can just bring you back for free and you'll be like the half health its Opie these teams run off probably to the safe zone I assume I've been depressing gold banks therefore the pre-rotate it already it yeah I mean I mean it won't be too and then I go inside instead the last guys there I done has happened a decent attempt and it makes sense that he wants it to keep them to the golf bag so that sell to buy it but this make sense it's a good lord combo but compared to a lifeline afk reform you can even hold the same amount of things oh it's unfortunate I feel like I just damage to everyone that that game thousands and thousands of damage considering its this game mode and people can't really heal up that much and we did learns in a place where no one else was I mean to 9000 down for six kills doesn't tell the whole story does it to kill : ah the bunkers fun though a guaranteed gold gun it's a gun gun gun roulette
