hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some horizon here on world's edge and when horizon came out everyone was thinking about the combos of ultimates that you could put together with horizon like you could throw your horizon ultimate down and you could put a corset coordinate on top of it or you could do the same with it with a gibraltar ultimate but i think the deadliest combo here is actually horizon with a gold helmet which is reducing the cooldown on her ability which gives her and her team their maximum mobility it just works so well especially on world's edge before we get into today's video though i have a short message from our sponsors the holidays are the most difficult time of the year in terms of staying on top of your workload visiting family difficult schedules and travel or all problems that you have to work around and this is where the lenovo legion 7i laptop with an intel core i7 processor comes in i've been absolutely loving this machine playing recording editing and rendering are an absolute breeze on the lenovo legion 7i laptop this is my new reliable mobile workstation that ticks all of the boxes you can play at the highest level with an rtx 2080 super pumping out frames to the one millisecond response time 144 hertz refresh rate inbuilt display you can record whilst playing thanks to the outrageous intel core i7 processor and with these specs combined you can edit and render your videos in no time at all i found that with the battery life all i need to take with me is the laptop itself and my controller and i can create videos all day no matter where i'm going and with the return of gaming events recording sessions and travel in general in 2021 being able to stay on top of my workload whilst being away from home is a complete necessity and the attention to detail by lenovo legion on the 7i laptop here is outstanding one of my favorite features for example is a small detail that's crucial for my line of work the display is 100 adobe srgb calibrated for perfect color accuracy now i need this when i'm creating my thumbnails because it gives me the peace of mind that i'm not going overboard on color correction or saturation and i know that it's going to look great in everyone's sub boxes to find out more about the lenovo legion 7i laptop and to get your hands on your own be sure to check out the link in the description thank you once more to lenovo legion and intel for sponsoring today's video all right well staging it is me amigos we're back here again i say again i'm not entirely sure are there any guns here are there any weapons available at stage you know what what's the deal is this like an ammo and throwball only location or oh no there are guns here we go first i guess this is a blessing of playing solo sometimes i don't remember the worst part of that playing horizon is that she's got something to say about everything i mean yeah even landing even just landed on the floor sometimes we get it horizon it was a soft landing heavy mag your ankles are intact we understand which is good just because you can do this back to the legs i don't have a back do i no i do not uh i don't have a side to my g7 either which may but uh i i think we've cleared staging there's still 51 people left iron and physi zig gonna mess that one up but those crazy germaniacs would stay like that hey watch my backpacks there's a new kill leader out there i was waiting for the voice line to come in it couldn't have been bangalore it couldn't have been revenant it was always going to be horizon in fact that's pretty how they've balanced this character oh people have been here fancy a stroll this way enemy rather close they're ready for a scrap they could indeed be wrong in fact they are they're crafty put their armor in there so they don't i don't really have a chance to shoot them when they didn't have their armor on friends going for a little flanking mover it's always nice always nice to stay in the lifeline first uh revise our horrendous video is that a different another reason to play horizon but the same reason but it applies to every location on the map i got your friends oh i missed it are the revenant lefty though the revlon lefty uh for the bandwagon most damage that's nice you know here thank you friend look at these cohesive units i'm gonna have to craft some stuff though some batteries some ammunition i mean this is what led us to know that these guys were here there's a decent chance that someone just i have my ultimate right here don't look like awake you need to heal it's okay shotgun level three shields recharging thank you it's even got the pinks for me as well i mean i don't know if people don't run energy because they run into this problem where like ammo's no energy energy i mean it's a struggle it puts me off as well but the vault is like the best gun in the game so i'm not using it just because you can't find a few bullets you know i mean i know they're a prerequisite for firing at someone but i mean you can always craft or maybe there's a lower ultimate you can use i don't know i like to use the vault and then and then it gives me something to complain about it's going to be like a ring in the old dinner belt friends i realized oh my word i'm missing i'm really missing not with the vault as much but with the with the g7 i'm gonna go find yes i should not be using this many bullets energy i've never fought so many people harvested that guy had any energy rounds [Music] it's all right this may this may be a world record this is the most amount of people that have ever been a harvester at one point and you know what it is it's the crafter we only realized that people were here because of the crafter i might take this mastiff he's got a decent shopping vault we only realized people were here because of the crafter and then as soon as we crafted both times people just rocked up late it's great as well because you can set it to craft but then you can just run off so it looks like you're vulnerable but really you're just saying a trap down beautiful here but i kill some hey eight kills from three teams eight from the possible nine and eighty eight point eight recurring percent return rate here on the old investments okay package in the distance we've got people flying in the distance the question becomes was he the leader of his team there's gonna be two people following him it's not like anyone was following them i knew i couldn't down him i'll be honest i just don't want him to leave spotted are we hooligan i can get a decent sacrifice different science that's not true i threw before the mp was coming in but it's still good to know where's an emp when you need it oh i've done absolutely nothing here friends you didn't see that you didn't see that what do you mean no no it wasn't it wasn't a gold helmet don't worry no it was um it was a level three slider stock that i took there do i take my vault back i mean this guy was holding onto the wall supply of energy rounds the level three extended energy as well i don't like his skin this is the one you need it's the crocodile it's the crocodile vault that's what gives it such a a bite you know it's what gives it its actual power all right two squads left eight kills i'm a horizon with a gold helmet this is the combo of dreams by the way what's the cooldown four seconds twelve second call name a free high ground for your entire squad and it lasts like five seconds it's like a seven second call game unfortunately now we just um while genuine question have you guys ever crafted anything at this stage in the game when the circle is this small we've seen the effects of crafting and how people just rock up late i just i just can't see myself standing still when someone could have a crater or a longbow with a skull piece on it i think they should just get rid of the replicators at endgame look like drop me i honestly don't know what the use is unless i've only got a few seconds talk about this unless you could craft like the you know the heirloom guns like the crabber and stuff and the prowler unless you could craft more ammo for those then they're not risky i'll play gb oh friends we're here we've turned up for the scrap yet another fouled ultimate indeed i thought it was down okay well it's the octane octane or not and then he just offers machines this is why you first saw your kills i'm not entirely sure how we are supposed to chase this guy name when he gets a steam every two seconds no idea where he even went i guess we could get safe maybe go for a care package or two get a crater i'm not sure if he's got his teammates banners i don't i don't know who his teammates were gg i tell you what that's a nice change of scenery that game a lot of scrap a lot of scrapping a harvester you are the apex champions some scrapping that came down absolutely zero scrapping at uh at staging where we where we landed oh no oh a nice little 10 kill nearly 2 000 damage game i mean you can round it up if i first had a few more kills it would have been 2 000 you know not like not like i need it or anything but it would have been nice still a great game thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
