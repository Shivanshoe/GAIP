halfway through the season since he's nurse at the start of this season i've been reluctant to try him out it's turned out to be a huge mistake because he's still a really good and fun legend to play

flatline you haven't played an aegis so sound you've been playing every day no no no no no no that's not true i haven't played an agent not like me i'm always doing crazy stuff i'm just partying all the time yeah loads of police i respect it yeah now we're talking let's do this that was awful i was going to run a hail was a good job i didn't reloading yeah that was yeah come on no you were using a boat that's the thing with the bug when you're that close i know but like sometimes they hit sometimes they don't i was just going for one of those times where they hit and yeah yeah exactly oh look at my health man oh it's not coming back i have a turbo by the way fancy i never mind uh take it back i don't really know what i'm doing well someone was in the ring oh i'm just naughty with this big comms mate huge bombs [Music] i mean i'm probably gonna be going down tomorrow oh you're purple nice to recharge i was kind of hopping out on y one it's always depressing that happens you see that bag dropped to the floor now it's like giving that back uh where'd you want to go i got my pad ah oh okay well that's a big useful pad let's catch you up somehow uh i'm getting closer and closer to dame ultra you're still grinding i've got i did a gold pistol yesterday and i did one of the most annoying challenges which was destroy 50 ground-based score streaks with this launcher but it's like who uses ground based score streaks just takes forever to do oh that sounds like that doesn't have to be honest that does not sound like fun but you know the secrets you go into combined arms where people have like the jet skis and their little boats and then you do there so oh is that kind of squashy yeah i've seen all the shots crazy but now i have to get 25 air score streaks like air streaks destroyed with an rpg what is the end game of this again ultra so i'll look really cold okay and people like me he was fine what's the worst that could happen oh this is not going how i would like it to it's not what's the writing stuff on the so far gameplay i'll let you know i'll get a little bit closer you know also i have seven bats i dropped one i have one okay let me come back i'll drop some more shield battery here i'm coming over here is they're actually fighting over there because i heard i thought so i'll come up to you now okay you see you're just you're just trolling small ear canals you can't trust me trying to get all numbed no i'm sending you a pad i've never been more alive in my life oh he's going back to you no oh my god easy easiest game i've ever played in my life this game is so easy everybody honestly in my life new kill leader well deserved imo do you still need that am i even here no i'm gonna go run to my death i've i've once bear energy it's making me i'm so stressed i was about to say i wish there was a bat for your health but med kits exist so i don't know what i was going for there i mean i'm glad you did i'm glad you followed through with that thought because that's a good one i thought i'd share that with you so they know what goes on inside my head how about you not stim to your death just to get to this care package how about you not i'm in the game my life here give me this purple armor yes oh what a package that's the worst package ever other than a purple armor is pretty pretty and honestly i love seeing gold helmets because i'm a path yeah but i feel like it really doesn't make that much of a difference why is it 20 that's a big difference that's seven seconds if it's a 35 second call then on the grapple uh huge uh huge i'll die 10 times in that amount of time i just help existential you do have to be careful with the steam now like i don't want to stim again i was i wasn't like 40 health there for a second oh you're about to die that's what i mean like release faster and die faster yeah release i mean a bat for health this is why i need it can't get behind that no no call it a health battery the med kits suck though they take aeg's man they do they really take forever syringes i i hate that syringe just takes a long time and med keeps like eight seconds like are you kidding me how long's the bat it's like five enemies it looks small i have my pad by the way i'm gonna jump down no wow look at this guy in my damage this guy any energy no i him a lot they drop they must have dropped unless they're behind that box are you saying sarcastically because i've been talking about it for the last five minutes or no no no i'm genuinely curious do you need energy sometimes i no you are no you're being sarcastic what do you mean it's because i've pinged about 12 times that's why have you really yes wow no you know you're lying mate you're a big liar i'm leaving you goodbye team carries out here kill leader he's off the scene good luck by yourself well i'm not the understanding we're just doing you not doing any wonders right now huh first damage that's one kill leader yeah that's why i got the most kills yeah well if your teammate wasn't the worst gamer of all time you wouldn't be that's what i've been saying though that's what this argument's about who's worse when did that become the argument uh i'm going in and i'm stimming and there's two people near a car so please help me i'm gonna die please help oh i've just made them both way for this other squadron no power i've got no energy you've got any energy yeah all the energy in the world over here but you've got like i dropped it over there but you actually yeah yeah i'm telling you three years wait all the way up there legit on my penis i really need to heal i need this problem is it and why i use my phoenix i miss a lot of shots i don't deserve no we're off saved anything oh oh oh well that was not one for the books for me it was i had a great game where's the energy up here yeah you are the apex champions oh this dude's got the new sounds on tablet you see that i didn't see that actually no well imagine only uh damaging me by 200. when i first it's on maybe six kills
