hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i do not remember apex ever being like this public games at the moment are a complete mess in almost every game half the server drops at the first point of interest and it's an absolute bloodbath if you don't land there you don't see anyone until there are three teams left and if you do land there then you are contesting 18 other teams for the same p 2020 on one stack of light ammunition it is a classic lose lose situation and this is the same reason i focus more on ranked last split and i think i'm about to start doing the same again here because i want some real apex gameplay and it feels like when i play ranks you get that experience the survivability the more serious outlook on the game we need an ltm or something until then i think i'm gonna play a lot more rant thank you for watching guys i do appreciate i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's probably about 800 people here as expected i've been playing apex for about five hours straight kind of exhausted can't lie to you we are going to try our best oh my god i found a vault i found such such a few volts today is that you say that sentence i don't know i don't care at this point to be honest with you i think my teammates are together unless they both happen to just be from norway no where did he go there's a path here somewhere i know the reese spotted well at least i definitely know there are people in the middle i'm going over here to shoot some people that's the plan that's what i'm sticking to sorry friend that's unlucky for everyone involved we have expired the champion here we go they're scrapping is this going to push my trap around but you didn't have a shield where'd it go who drops their shield shields are recharging i've died i spawn literally for the last like two hours i'm telling you maybe the game's like okay i need some help this guy needs to get into an easy lobby or something because he's having the worst time of his life i think f4 spotted in the lava what's he doing that's why you can't stand on that [Music] please rings right there oh
