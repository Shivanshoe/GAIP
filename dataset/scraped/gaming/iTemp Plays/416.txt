hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are testing out the new season nine lobo buff which finally addresses her translocation ability which not only was completely broken beforehand and get killed every single game but even when it did work it was a bad ability i'd say it was like a probably like a hot trash out of 10. that's my official uh rating of the pre-buff logo bracelets but respawn kept buffing global's ultimate as if it was the problem like don't worry guys now she's playable you're spawning with 50 on your ultimate cooldown which is great but she didn't have an ability it was worthless now however loba feels so much better to play she doesn't suffer from the slowdown when you throw her bracelet and also when you land the slowdown always made her feel so clunky and you're vulnerable at all times during this ability now i'm throwing over people's heads and landing on high ground behind them i'm throwing it whilst i'm in the open to get to cover because i can still dodge and weave whilst the bracelet is in uh he's in the air while he's traveling loba is a certified mobility legend now and because her ultimate was buffed so much her entire kit is actually really good i have a great game here for you today 3700 damage which puts the average damage in the last two games on this channel at over 4 000 which is kind of nice thank you guys for watching i do appreciate it make sure you're subscribed to more season 9 apex legends gameplay and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends dropped another one my god i was scary i was there whenever you hear devo in a building that you're also in it's already fully loaded up [Music] i'm running out that is all you because i am a healer she drop down she's uh oh he's in the open now let's see what they left us all right all right they're fighting that uh what is that depot deep deep muscle give me a second i'll be with you give him my shield to recharge shield back one of don't mind if i do i'm in the way i have four bats if you want some um i have four as well i'm nice did you do small hair with full baths you have the patience i oh wait don't do that yeah maybe i did yeah i am patient like i'm all right you're right you're not just a position sounds waiting for you here we go nearby now supply been here come on really drop too much free i knew i didn't need it but i still wanted to open it and the next double check that's one of them trying to cover you don't know where they went don't even rest over here are you able to push this she's broken this guy's got the rays i'm going to sit there for a sec i'm just going to heal because that was the team i've combined yep oh i have no meds medkit oh phoenix yeah oh some good stuff well played we balanced that really well not too bad there's a lot of people too yeah still uh still that same team i think they ended up fighting somebody else they definitely did is that down low yeah i think they're in the tunnel right here i just ate that pk for like 100. okay great because right i don't have the phoenix for you but of course well they're low brought in here nice jeez guys i think this is the team from before i think so they've just been chilling in here this is oh yeah yeah maybe it was a different tune there we go one sec healing up get the bamboos sloppy stay alive a lot more than the other ones at least yep hit or miss they went to the left a little bit here oh it's not made in the face [Music] that's fine uh is that back where we came from probably probably the best way to get there uh i think i was going to say if i survived with one health it's all thanks to this one serene gonna happen it's gonna happen actually gonna go down one hp yeah i'll never know that's that's why that's why it's so hard such a conflict probably up top right um i don't know it didn't sound like it was up top did it no i get to be honest it sounded like this sort of angle so it's probably a state's all around here or something yeah on the other side yeah your company i don't have an angle he's going like at all no it was a little crab but oh i'm putting this gun down i'm dropping it i can't see this guy wait i got an angle ministry i'm in the tree wait what's this guy's head glitch oh whoa i've never seen anything like it like reloading yeah that was actually crazy i can't see him don't know him it's broken knight is through window i forgot about that cause that would be opening self-rest dude nice nice okay i'm gonna be honest it was a low light i couldn't i couldn't shoot her either who's she standing on hold on i want to i need to see this angle because i need to use that against the base she's standing on a planet oh there's like a little shield oh that's actually a crazy angle right here look i didn't even realize that was the pain i'm learning i'm learning on the job uh oh that's nice like this is a good angle but i actually couldn't see when she was peeking no i couldn't either here yeah i'm pretty sure it does no no shots all right well let me burn a third self-respect might as well be ammo here it's 1400 heavy ammo in there if you need an a hold on i need to throw balls before no i can have no throwables i bet that care package has some sweet gear for us one night so i'm still talking to him uh am i here i thought i heard him pushing right side of my table yes an arc star trying to get an angle i can just make it to you jump drive in position hello hey 105. oh huge hey don't the one you hit for one of it for 20 as well so oh yeah i missed my last shot on him [Applause] still one of the squad too yeah we're the most likely ones to be shot in the back yeah we can we can just leave at the top if you want quick here we can i'm on my way until the ring closes we've got time but not much they're shooting at me and if i had a mate if i die i'm gonna be furious that is just such a stupid gun i can sell phrase if necessary yeah i'm gonna sell for this down here i'm trying to dodge but it's impossible yeah it's ridiculous ah thank you we're good we're good i'm using a phoenix kid another cribber in there if you're interested in fact i'm gonna go grab it i'll keep myself yeah they're at the bottom of the wrap i can hold them here though okay now they're going to rope right bro i don't see him i don't see him i'm just getting bowed by every angle same charging shield i'd be better off with the bow it has aim assist and the drop off and i can spam it yeah i'm throwing with the signal i don't know why this other team was because they're both silent over here somewhere i honestly have no clue so the team's right here right here dude i am so annoyed i'm about to use like all my shields oh that means love is 115. everything's 200 meters behind us i have i have an ultimate in here okay reload it is there three time in there i need it three times probably there's not i just can't compete with this weapon i mean i know i'm not good with the crater but if i had a boat like i'd get aim assist at least no there's nothing we can do it's so broken even though we have crater satellites just doesn't i'm taking this either for this you are coming home with me tonight shots fired dude oh my god he's shooting me in my feet right until the ring closes and everything here is gone for good place to stop they're getting bowed by someone i don't know where from this is mental i'm in an archery game here i'll send out a decoy don't know i don't have it yet any show better than i have one shield back three characters i think there's one uh one bad in there pay attention it's gone i'll just take it at once you know what is this game we're gonna have to move we gotta move now honestly i'm coming recharging shields we need to get close to any one of these teams it's under the lifeline doing any damage to that bow the lobe is not really yeah i uh i can't even peek against that bow because he shoots four shots by the time i shoot one sentinel shot yeah i think i hear him yeah i'm here with the decoy can we just rush him in the water in the water he's already awake tonight i don't see any sign of anyone else over here uh my side somewhere he's below he's below he's underground it's a solo i can worry about the other time yeah yeah they're probably gonna be coming up the same way uh we came up yeah i think they might have gone left i'm probably just going to take whatever this guy had with this to be honest six bats in here they're pushing here 70 on a lifeline just a solo let's go oh my god i'm so bad 90 of my shots right there what just happened oh my god the stripy bow it's too good i don't know i know i should have landed some crater shots i understand it's hard though when someone has a bow and you're trying to like you're in that fight because you know you're gonna get shot like four times by the time you shoot it makes me rush my craver shot way more oh nice breakdancing though so holy that was kind of crazy nice you're a fragging i missed all my shots so you were going in i'm glad you were hitting them
