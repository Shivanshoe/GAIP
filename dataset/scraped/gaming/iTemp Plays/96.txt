hey what's up guys twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and apex has a bit of a problem with the amount of legends that they are releasing who are not medics because look at this this is every legend in the game at the moment in the last row alone i think the uh the little bullet thing is like a suppressive kind of offensive kind of legend there's three of those in the bottom line alone there's one of them in every single row and then look at lifeline she's the lone medic there is only one medic in the entire game and his lifeline which is kind of bad because if lifeline falls out of the meta that means that every medic in the game is no longer better and that's kind of weird when it's more variety in terms of the legends being released into the game and i'm very hopeful that we will see some more medic soon because it's a problem it's an issue i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoyed them thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm not down there with you i'm down here send in a decoy okay wait how do i know that i'm not the deep chord i'm good with the dream stuff cracked oh i don't think so people were there no there is people there there's no way it was that we could hear bullets further than that right you know what game oh yeah get he's over here oh yeah they're getting tough oh i actually almost one clipped through that little part oh i'm so sad she all at the top she's like 30 hp up there yeah she found purple in inaudible she dropped enemies okay the lover is called tt visa smelly and i their teammate is called ttv someone so what's happening there so are they are they together or not i don't know maybe it's like an ironic sort of joke kind of thing i thought i saw a scam coming from this way i'm lying you might be lying it's fine happens to the best of us patching myself up it does don't lie i does it is close range i have actually blocked this off this is such a good strategy just tell these tell us about the shield here level four no no you know you literally can't get past it though try it try and get past i mean that was easier oh my god there it's like that name it's like when they build the cage for the baby rhino she just walks around it's like it's extremely dangerous even the babies are extremely dangerous reloading all right enemies i need to recharge my shields oh they are peg units and i can't blame them big stick big stick oh you're wasting practice time shooting my decoys i don't know i don't know either down yes rocking the double light edge so my brain is not picking up anything i made a poor choice i hear him i hear multiple footsteps no down below below me there's one right here broken enemy shield reloading almost one clip blow down delete two one's like sword come up this way i think oh he's already up is he hi [Music] let's go reggie on the red guy lift down another one we're sort of split because the bang oh she fell for it oh my gun is not reloaded are you serious after all this time i'm down uh an enemy i hear a bloodhound not fighting someone's surviving they're reviving i think they fell down another squad somebody who shot oh my god sorry thank you recharging shield okay now we are down in the worst part of all time really cringe really cringe i thought i finished him i think i did like 90 damage on him when he was down are they down here somewhere i'm please don't do this to me no no no no this is the worst ending ever oh my god i was done 14 times what are you saying opening fire on the enemy the easy kill this is killing my wife there's one up there yeah i jumped out the window oh that's why you're never lying here fast life baby yeah honestly okay this gun doesn't work from here good work why not just give her a big shield to block people when she rezzes them has anybody ever thought of that no i think i have i like her ifk revive what if i do this and then i take it you can probably bounce across [Music] oh my god who is this the demon with the bows where's it though what kind of why did they do that that was the worst thing to do that was so worth it though i need heavy heavy thank you i mean yeah thank you that love this box is probably on the other side boba wasn't in bangalore yes the lobe went this way sorry for the confusion oh please you hear that there's a care package coming down we gone fetch when we're done this is looted who looted this recharging machines you know pubs i've gotten so sweaty that uh people are just landing like they're in rank now they just loot the tiniest little places just to just to get a gun off spawn without it you know we've always said that like our pubs are harder than most people's rankings and it's actually a fact now it is i'll god kill for that from what someone fell oh hey did you kill her she must have fallen down trying to get that she probably doing that two rope thing and she messed up the lifeline package is so bad i remember once i had a shotgun without a shotgun bolt and i didn't i've got an attachment for my teammate instead of getting a shotgun come on you're a support legend rich yeah i'm going to support myself first i bet you will i can't if i can't stay alive i can't revive i absolutely beat absolutely beamed i'm nowhere near you neither is teammate teammate's kind of close you all know in there oh we are right next to each other no no we're near i'll see you guys that's a very broad statement thank you on the back we can try the back yes don't shoot i'm cooking up i'm cooking that look at that though i can't i can't get up there hold on switch [Laughter] oh they just they just dropped the most audacious revive of all time he's he's got no shields burst i was getting triple took in the back oh my god just giving my shield the reach out okay the hip finally sucks i know you don't need it i'm dropping it anyway i need it thank
