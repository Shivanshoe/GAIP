don't know if you guys have been experiencing this lately but the skill base has been a little bit cranked and so i've decided to play wraith in these lobbies because i mean there's a reason the good players player right she's incredibly hard to hit she's elusive her portal is incredibly useful and she's so close to the ground you feel like you can't get shot at all i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah it's it's actually tough i like playing uh valkyrie these two poise yeah get on the roof
