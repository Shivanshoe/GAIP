hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here using the diva for the first time in a good while and if you find an early turbo charger the devo is definitely still better than the spitfire which is running rampant on apex legends at the moment and it's even better if you have more than 500 energy bullets in your back pocket as well this used to be my favorite gun in the game early on and there was a good reason for it also keep watching because at one point raphael jumps in front of my monitor and i have proof on facecam that he does this now so if you ever see bad shooting from me it is 100 definitely because i can't see past my cat and that is the only possibility because i am not bad ever so thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends landing at this door should we okay we got nobody with us i forgot to tell you the secret oh you did i all right well what happened jax i don't want to talk about it well there's a respawn right here don't worry how on earth did you manage that i was looking around for bad guys i was uh looking around for bad guys did you find a name [Music] yeah like three teams rift i was trying to debate where they were i'm pretty sure one team landed behind us too they they swerved from rift which is the team that caught me off guard why i was uh while you weren't looking they're uh i'm pretty sure they landed at these back buildings they're probably gonna rotate towards us oh yeah level three extending energy as well you know rich i don't condone this behavior but if you must i'd rather die to a diva than a spitfire really right now just because of how many you see absolutely okay true you do see a lot of spitfires you don't really see devos no not very often ah ah too far i'm gonna hit this i'm gonna hit this that's it oh team ahead of me oh god look at the momentum you're rich on me where are they just down here somewhere i can't think of so much they're just down low on me i got you i got you i got you i'm stuck in here should be okay now they went to the right one went this way edgy one is nearly cracked nice another another team's popping up no energy i can drop you energy if i get this crater oh to peek i drop you all my energy don't okay thank you they're just looking at me this way that's not a person i was lying stop i'm trying to try to regen my armor here come on come barely see he was looking at that was a person i thought he was a bush wasn't moving stop charge rifling me once again let's have a pad dude once i get my cue back 12 seconds he's he's retreating hi i had 177 energy here yeah it's gonna load up divide us oh god just one guy we're good these guys are on the way back no they're going back again oh my god i'm going to get this guy let's go get him i like him he's coming back he's coming back it's on the rope cracks 120 136 yeah it's pretty good whoa look at this pad okay this guy was trying to pretend to be a marvin guaranteed genius he'd already pretended to be a bush so a little empty one do you need more energy ammo i have 265 spare but yeah i could always stock up energy ammo here thank you with a divo i'd be carrying some for you don't worry oh yeah thank you oh my god oh my word jenks that entire gunfight was airborne i i was a mess for me i might take that that's quiet what is going on here yeah i think i think there was one around here around yeah yeah ahead edit i think we could all use a picnic they were going around the side oh i mean oh i went this way hold on did i mess up your red he's got to demolish me with that triple tape yeah dude you're good i protect yes i'm back guys uh psychopath i can't believe he challenged that he just ran away my mic is in the way of my screen i can't be bothered to move it but i can't see bottom left there we go it's back i'll forget this you're getting jumped on dude you're getting jumped on he's off yeah as a turbo devo i mean i respect anyone that uses the trouble take i never used to but you don't see that often i get care package i got another stack of energy for you it's tremendous i 428 for the last three teams one inventory is just an entire row of energy and then six bats of phoenix and an ark star any time i see a stack on the ground i'm just picking it up i'm appreciating it any throwables let me know because uh i could use a few i didn't give you both my arcstars thank you i swear man cravers are so rare for me it's ridiculous yeah i really don't get to use it that often we could craft someone piece by piece yeah imagine a thousand crafting mats i would i would do it every game just seem right behind us oh he's got so many nades he has 180 i have 526 spare energy is that enough for this last team thank you wanna do uh uh devotion trick shots you're using the rampart kills are you here for 16. i'm no scoping with the divo full auto good calm keep going i got more energy for you don't worry i'm stopping for 16. i think it's the shield you see my bullets mate [Laughter] 16 16. they're gonna have to jump off keep the pressure out of rich they can't just they can't they must not oh here i actually hit them for 16. i'm getting i'm getting beam though i'm not going to play too aggressive again guys i'm on the way i didn't hit they're not even using the shield anymore it's actually baffling actually it's a mirage the burn on the left cracked on the left and uh oh i don't have a pad to do the thing tool no punch onto this one [Music] i'll under these little buildings like in the middle i've never landed these buildings before my entire life don't know what to expect okay do not land at these little buildings that's my review oh i got a divo now my turn there we go i have loads of energy for you no i dropped it okay i'll go with me triple take now i'm gonna get involved i have a blue mag alternator oh i'm playing horizon i need some

do i have a yes dude oh change of plans i'm going back to alternator r9 r301 that would be nice arthur won in a been over that way might be something good uh you know i can't be bothered let's go crazy soft you're rich i got more energy for you thank you hold on i jump down like a lunatic some other way okay i'm trying to cook the angle a little bit so you can make use of this it's not the
