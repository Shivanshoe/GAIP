hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the day is finally coming octane is getting a nerf which is probably deserved but i'm still a little bit sad about it and the reason i'm a bit sad about it is that octane is a really fun character to play whose abilities aren't damage dealing well his stim is but it's only self-inflicted damage if we're going to get technical about it so they're increasing the health cost of his stim from 12 to 20 but they're also reducing the cooldown of it to one second so you can spam this if you wanted to you could almost always be the quickest man on the battlefield however if you choose to do that you will also have about six health the entire time so to me this sounds like respawner trying to add a little bit of a skill gap to his speed you need to pick and choose the moments where you want to be fast because if you choose the wrong time you are really vulnerable with almost an entire shield tears worth of health being lost in the process it is a shame because octane for so long was seen as a troll pick he was releasing season one and it's taken us to get to season seven season eighteen to be viable he just wasn't good and now he is and he hasn't been good for that long but he's probably a bit too good does that make sense what do you guys think about this change uh the two games that i have here today on octane are the first and the third games that i've played in four days and they were actually really good it just took me a little while to get back into it so please cut me some slack for the first like 90 seconds but then it's good i promise so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends so it's just it was a whole thing oh god mate i'm dead i'm dead no but i actually i have a bandage i have a bandage don't worry don't worry hey i've got a p20 no no i have a bandage okay okay i need
