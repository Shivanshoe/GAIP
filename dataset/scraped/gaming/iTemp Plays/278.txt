hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going back to basics i haven't been playing my main legend recently and i'm pretty not sure why i haven't been getting the best games i think it's because i was mixing things up a little bit too much so today we are back on pathfinder the smiley robot himself i've got two solo games here for you today and i hope you enjoyed both of them so thanks for watching i really do appreciate it as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the hemlock and blue i'll take it i mean i don't know the choice i have to be honest you get what you're given oh here we go i do like the hemlock but the vault has just been oh i mean oh my word i sort of wish that was gold armor at the start of the game but it's okay with blended here alone i reckon she should definitely get on this charge tower get her mobile sheila turret and get zooming over to race labs because they are kicking off in here i knew they would be with the ring that we got given oh she's dawdling she's been in the same room the whole time there's no room for dawdling here i got a shield i'm so scared termites these guys but look at their loops like that's why i don't land down here making contact lock base recharging shield got back i thought i played that a little bit better i don't think i needed to throw the um the thermite but i wanted to cut off their escape route if they did get that revive off you know that was the plan anyway i don't think it was necessary though with the clutch shields okay so much better lander capacitor i definitely remember the name of that place and third-party people here i mean did you see the guy's loot it was like a gibby and a path down there both had white boxes with like one gun no attachments it is a very sad time contesting looting here uh oh now she's going crazy she was a slow loot to begin with but then she's got a taste of blood i think uh i'm in desperate need please let me know absolute desperation oh god it's the worst i hate some plunker teammate that's absolutely ginormous teammate you're a demon look at their health not even close level four attempts to take that all throughout one instead of his fault i've got an extending mcfory uh i mean i just pinged a level four for the team i could have had a level four for it but ow we hit that shot oh it's so broken i thought i heard someone but i was just changing my shoes i was talking all over the footsteps how did you have i don't mind too much about missing out on the um on the gold mag because now i've got a purple and it's basically the same thing let's be honest i need some light rains i didn't realize i was so low sorry teammate i've got a loot i wasn't looking at the loot properly 31 200 there we go teammate teammate is turning to a bit of a aggressive demon here he's just going crazy now i gotta try and keep up with him to be fair he has got mobile shield you know forget that wait wait wait other man's absolutely fine let's be honest i can't track you like that with a three-time site i'll be honest with you not you is zooming through the sky i hate tv11s that's my fault though i just missed next crap oh these guys are playing aggro there's more red there's a team here too be careful might be looking too late for that honestly we might want to back up just a little bit because both teams could chew us if we peek that team we can get shot on the side and get absolutely blown up i've given them a way to rush us but i honestly i hope they take it that team over there they might just run away honestly took three attempts keep running teammates which is nice i think this team got wrapped around on both the team that was actually closed beforehand yeah they didn't have gold before there's two teams this is every team there's a team here and there's two teams over this way i'm on a third be so bad did me to do that these guys all have to move that's just not fair they died in the ring at least one of them did so that teams are solo and this team is just holding us wherever they may be i mean games end so quick late games uh like ring doesn't hurt that much because it's actually only the third ring you know you think it was worse so it's moving up i can get to him with a grapple pretty easy though there we go that's the solo because he had the true no maybe the team got a triple take hmm the mystery continues i think we go this way we just get ahead of them they have to move in like the next minute i just want to sit back and snipe that's on our ninth full auto it's r9 for auto from this range someone just landed on them you see i gave it a go i've just proven my own hypothesis they might not have the most amount of shields ever though there you go two triple takes we want to go this way teammates 30 seconds remain the ring is nearby still there okay so there isn't actually solo there's two of that way to here let's go this way why did he stay there oh my god giving my shields a recharge i don't know why he stayed that way i thought he was going to chase with me like we were just between two teams there why would we ever stay who's the worst spot ever i need to get involved in this let's take this off as well only one more squad and me recharging shields i mean what can i do oh we've got two teams here that's not bad hello robot theme two to help us on our way we got from the robot thing it's not bad these are vault attachments there we go the two teams are scrapping i want to get involved i've got an op loadout here at the side of the game i just need a little bit better armor but i can always make that get me over there i thought i could get up top from that never mind i killed this guy that guy was the kill leader so he had at least three kills and i've just walked in and shot him in the back of the head that's kind of sad we've all been there we've all been there they were watson and i've gotta watch on my team i don't think i i don't remember the last time i saw two watsons in the same place these guys are scrapping at markets i've missed playing pathfinder i haven't played him for a while i've been venturing out i swear that sign never used to exist i what's it called the mandela effect they were fighting here right that's unlimited so i don't think it was scrap cave looks like i went back and i saw that that sign was there in season zero right here i just predicted that last shot didn't even see him i just thought he'd repeat i mean i hit him both for a little bit i don't think they're gonna push i'm gonna save my one battery grenade so i threw the nade further away to try and isolate whoever was at the back because i knew someone was pushing so i've been in that situation where someone's throwing an aide at me and i haven't been able to help my teammate and it just sucks so it all sucks i've been absolutely zero one of the biggest i've ever heard it's like a 10 on the on the scrap scale it's not it just sounds like two people shooting each other no multiple members he's too fast i don't think his teammate's over there with him oh sir where's your teammate i saw you running with someone he didn't have a god knock down yeah his teammates around here somewhere i think they might have just ran the other way or or maybe they didn't leave someone just got killed maybe they got peacekeepers either way there's a at least one guy over this way i got loads of heroes i think we can just over in this storm though i think we should be fined i'll tell you this game so far has definitely been a game where i've wanted a charge rifle i don't know what it is but recently i've really wanted to use the charge rifle but i keep the game i'm going to dismantle shots but imagine if i had a three times in the charge rifle right now these guys became peppered much like i am in this very moment that's another thing these guys can still see me i'm pretty sure i've just jumped over a bullet you okay teammate careful he's throwing hands i see a lot of hands being thrown he's still with me we're tack teaming wow when it's carrying going through the tunnel i think we've actually done really well to fight through that team he's one where'd he go i actually lost him i had absolutely no idea where this guy went it's so dark in this gosh darn tunnel in scrap cave i've been betrayed are they fighting over the care package i missed contact this is our main concern here we're getting flanked been painted maneuvered more friends he's reviving enemy taken down in the past ran off that's what i would do i'd reposition two squads left so a team that won the fight near the care package and this solo pathfinder there's no way he's up there i mean there's no way he's there we'd have heard the second grapple hello friend let's go this way i mean i've got let's move this way oh my word i hope you've got some offensive teammate did well stand alive i'm kind of beaming with the digi on the on the vault excuse me small these guys are screwing grooves just punch him no don't punch him not worth the risk i'll show you there you go he was definitely punchable oh my little thing went angry you sit on my chest okay it wasn't him oh my word i think i literally got every single kill i'm pretty sure i did you are the apex champions i mean i'll take that it's a gg
