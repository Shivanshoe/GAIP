hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have two games here for you on storm point i've actually been getting a little bit better at this map recently but one thing about it that i just find to be the worst is fighting anywhere near the prowler dance they don't care who's aggressive who is shooting the people who shot their den or even who's closest to them at that moment they will lock eyes with you from across the enclosure and they will jump 100 meters to bite your face off it's terrifying i've learned just to try and avoid these areas entirely anyway thank you for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean there's not like one tablet to get all your all your vitamins and minerals right you have to take one pill for for like a b of vitamin b12 and then one for you know uh like flavor one for community you know i'm gonna let you in a little secret mate you don't need that stuff yeah well when you are dying by the time you're 45 i'm literally right from now that's maybe like a year from now hey i don't want to shout did i did ping this way yeah sorry sorry all right i'm using this car the car for the last time ever i suck with the car i'm looking for an upgrade it doesn't work for me this game i'm never using again no no no mine all right

every shot from now on and then i don't want to post it so what sentinel um what are you putting on as a site i've literally it's naked right now that's oh yeah oh you got to keep it that way that's the problem as soon as you start putting on sites and scopes and stuff it's worse for about three times nine now oh iron sight on okay i'll give it a go i have to look like that if you want it back

the lightweight versatile dyson vacuum in the feed he's actually a bit on a bit of a rampage i swim earlier as well i uh want to dice them back in they look really nice yeah i've got one they're pretty good yeah yeah [Laughter] doesn't even surprise me at this point like i got to everything everything that you never use i vacuum at least once a month there's no way you actually vacuum i've

god this is so annoying go for some shots before yeah they come across the rope a bunch of uh oh my god i'm still running these miles they're kind of close they took a rope i have to slow hill back here i have a bat i got here here he goes nice job oh my god i'm there's so many problems coming for us down here oh my god she's so laggy oh my god why am i looking this way different team i think yeah a different team taken down oh i got a problem go ahead cracked blaze i have nothing ah oh these guys helped thanks guys wait one of them moves up a little bit over there oh yeah i'm not making these way i could drop you on there to the right i was gonna die it's going to keep going i have a heat shield but i got something no i've got a mobile reason we can oh i got jesus yeah you know my secret strategy of like climbing my saluting i was losing whilst on the ropes um oh that's basically that's the next level yeah but i just did it i did it too soon so i just zoomed off into the sunset by accident um i only have heavy by the way uh i have light do you need light i have some yes 140 i'll just try and use my sentinel they're fine like this one what do you think it's almost a little bit i have a car drop six six i have one bat as well um i have some i can talk to him wait how many did you did i dropped i picked up two but they might have disappeared into the ocean because i can't really see but i've got three bats i'm good okay full cell do you have any cells i'd like to charge up oh yes thank you just turned around so fast actually right dude why did i buy this casket why do i do it mate look at it nice trail thanks mate i got a pred one you see it yeah yeah yeah i like that it's just a little it's just it's the new one it's a little brighter i see i don't have any guns i didn't get a gun from that i only got a longbow but i'm okay car vault nice oh there must be more people right oh my god yeah it's an odd now a number of people here don't coincide mate it's too scary is there a couple fences i mean it's more the formation oh god i've told you not to come inside it's not pretty that's what it looks like when i played watson you are coming home with me tonight is it just me like i suck so bad with the uh with the car i'm i'm so bad really yeah have you tried just hit firing it no try i might have to give that a go you might surprise yourself just hit fire the car and it's actually pretty easy some damage ridiculous yeah so i'm real bad with that bad boy oh there we go oh ye nice don't have to double jump on these look let's go how come you're higher it's cheating oh it's because i jumped oh i know that yeah you also do you know how to do you know how to do the the crazy momentum thingy you land you have to land on that thing right the side of it yeah you know how to nail it every time no you got more dwight do you start more to the left or right yourself in the corner yeah yeah yeah and it happens every time it's crazy ah i never thought of that until you asked me how i would do it why did i never ask myself that question i hate these prayers mate i do really yeah they beat me up all the time have you died to one now uh no not yet you stay undefeated oh yeah absolutely i mean they're trying to change that i can tell this isn't revealed by ash well we know where they are now i'm going to go up towards there i'm going to go towards casket falls that's where they're going to be they're going to go to work okay vampina level up the purple why are they like what are they doing they're trying to send a message or what charging shield wait to run giants ah whoa whoa public i haven't even got to hit your level yet i need to hit it no please you get my back i'll get yours there's way more coming i feel like there's an excessive amount of problems coming out right now he's ludicrous man oh jenks we need to leave i got no shields recharging my shields they scanned every single box at stormcatcher what is this there isn't even any extra batteries in here yeah it's horrendous i see more prouders as well i am out of there i had way too many shield cells before we came here and now i'm lacking rampage you know you can kill every problem with about three bullets i love this whole side of the map so much i don't like cascade that much i feel like i'll get lost in the building somehow jump drive in position really yeah somebody's batted they're reviving i hit the right a little bit just popping a shield okay uh some too fast in this one mate if you need him replicators coming in shots behind us too i'll try and distract for you then he cracks one on blue i'm good i'm on a battery that's a separate team she puts it off the back there's two different teams here no it's the same team same team 17 okay i'm oh my god what am i doing who am i aiming at who am i aiming at no one knows we're at the team behind us i think they might have gone to uh respawn i think i just heard a respawn but it might have been lightning rod nice a respawn ship 100 like this way mate or something yeah there's the respawn on our head let's go here is it gone it is gone yeah there's a portal oh yeah must have pulled this a long time ago though no i i heard it i heard it unless it was we heard i unless i heard one that was further away which way would they have gone well i i would assume they probably would have taken the point oh i think they went back down to their loot little weasels and they escaped us like that another kirk watson valkyrie's flesh what's inside my hero another one i'm sorry okay i need to find a make it i dropped one thank you one last one but it's miles away sorry that's good thank you and the heat shield guys you're too kind look at that i've got some more too oh i may or may not even hear her i guess i was talking never 50. nice job come on come on good job i'm and always not even close nah i wasn't i want to know how that team got past us i guess they slid down the hill or something had we not realized uh i am going to need some energy but i've got a liberal so i'll use it later i can drive you some i got 70 there's only one team left yeah i have an r301 that's my main gun uh so as long as i've got enough of my fault maybe honestly like 20 if you're good i've i have two heat shields so do i drive in position oh my god oh my no they hate you even more for me i'm sorry ah rich i hug the pad at you it's in the water thank you that was actually kind of sick you almost landed right i know it's close wasn't it right there wait there's a phoenix in here that's actually so worth it energy there in a second what [Music] they're gonna take a different angle here oh it's a whole gang horizon is queuing up in your roof only the horizon two two are on your roof now oh that's the wrong way whoa let's go we won nice yeah i thought it was three but i guess it's because there was a mirage so i thought it was the whole gang there's only two of the gang i want to watch that back i want to see how that guy elizabeth you got absolutely destroyed somehow dude yeah i played safe too i slid down the hill and i had like probably 130 health left yeah yeah i thought you were fine and then he lasered me through the grass big clutch though let's go man i'm surprised i ran out of uh energy bullets so i had a three times an r301 that was it
