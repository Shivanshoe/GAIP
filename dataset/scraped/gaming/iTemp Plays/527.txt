hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we got the season 8 launch trailer for apex legends earlier on today i'm going to be talking about the trailer but if you would rather watch it without me speaking all over it there'll be a link in the description be sure to come back though because i've got some interesting points so season 8 is called mayhem and this trailer tells us why it starts off with fuse arriving for the apex games until his introduction is interrupted skip ahead a little bit and thanks to some planted explosives in the mountains of king's canyon huge explosions erupts destroying so much of the map and if you pause the trailer here you can see that this is going to be taking place at artillery just near the northern diving board i personally am praying that at least one diving board is destroyed i cannot stand them please respawn if i run into one more diving board dweeb i'm going to lose it this is our chance to get rid of at least one of them not even two i'll take one anyway we get a few sneak peeks from the trailer itself of how the new king's canyon will look here plenty of destroyed buildings mangled metal rubble everywhere there are fire still going on the explosion looks huge so i'm expecting much of the map to be different to the previous king's canyon iteration that we had we do get a first look at one of fuse's abilities here which could turn out to be a cluster grenade of swords which comes from his wrist now i love abilities that do damage we don't have too many of them in apex because they're kind of difficult to balance but this would appear to be one now of course fuse is also holding the new 30 30 repeat of rifle which is the new weapon coming to season eight you don't get to see too much of it but they had to have him holding it now this is something that you guys might have missed if you're watching the trailer on desktop i missed it until i downloaded the file because there is a youtube card at the end covering it but we actually get to see a sneak peek at the new area of the map now at first glance it appears as though slums has been destroyed and it's been replaced but i'm not so sure runoff looks kind of far away on the right hand side of this screenshot and i think it could be possible that they wanted to expand king's canyon and this was actually part of the mountainscape that was destroyed by those explosions now it's hard to tell from so far away it was just a small section of the screen that you could see and i definitely could be wrong and maybe it was just slums being replaced with this more built up modern area either way this is our first look at one of the new obliterated kings canyon locations we are still two weeks away from season eight but usually respawn will reveal the full map changes and their locations on the ea website as soon as that goes live i'll be updating you guys here on the channel so we all know what to expect come update day so make sure you sub to the channel to make sure you don't miss any of the news and i will see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends i missed i
