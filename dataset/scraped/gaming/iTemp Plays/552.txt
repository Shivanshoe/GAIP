hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have some more solo queue action for you here the two games that i have for you pretty much show off the solo queue experience on apex hacking minutes in their own different ways but honestly i had fun playing i had a great time i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you do be sure to subscribe we are slowly making our way to one million subs i really really want that one million plan one day my friends but yeah i will see you all in five and a half seconds mimi goes all right me amigos we are back at it again that is not my teammate if you're landing in the wrong place my friend it's mine in gibby's house one floor each you know you just split the front then it's far cheaper thanks i think she ran this way enemy being here i was trying to bounce my grenade off the top so these the revenant and the wraith all in the same thing is the horizon on the race on the same team or what attention someone's definitely as well the rings are neighbor pals and we've got a minute to find here i'm coming teammates good grief i can never tell which floor people are on someone's gonna respawn or something seen absolutely destroyed those two and that's his teammate foreigners as well because he didn't say another squad mind you i don't think they actually only needs to actually hit me hello french there's no amy oh there's no i'm assist on that thing stop shooting here this is crazy i need people to start fighting each right other see ya i flattened the whole squad shield's finally other people started fighting each other actually kind of kicking off over there why would you turn around that makes absolutely no sense i missed the now you're now you're fighting now you found each other how much damage was that two 2000 damage and seven kills we won't talk about the rest oh looks like the big blue ship is getting a bunch of passengers there's a bunch of people i've got nothing i still kind of had nothing teammates i'm struggling i mean it's absolutely kicking off over there but i've got nothing i may as well i may just go i mean who cares you're running you die you've restarted a friend my fingers are exceptionally i mean that's the christmas miracle you know that's the magic of christmas right there going in with a mozambique and a dream i'm coming out i need to recharge my shield with a bunch of stuff and purple armor apparently thank you what a guy i have to charge that's okay too no problem heavy ammo here making contact i think there's there's someone that way too oh good grief and he's got a trouble take i didn't mean to port oh god that's a good job i did how many teams are here i don't know if the guy shooting me in the back is he still around is he still a thing what happened to him and i found each other i can eat explosives unless they're aimed at us i mean i don't have that many either so if you've got a surplus of shield cells then that's just great news there's no scrapping so maybe it was just one team then the triple take team thank you they're over there just let me load this guy timeout everyone i'm i'm back i'm coming oh my word in that side room i have six bullets i need heavy ammo pull off the map oh he must have thought there we go maybe lean forward his box doesn't even it's not even at the edge you can use your wingman which takes precision accuracy and skill but what are you going to do when you run into someone who has a devotion and who doesn't have to aim in thanks to famously all the bats in the world my friends what it's two batteries it's not exactly the world supply but it's a fair few i need a heavy amp i mean if you've got if you've got a few bullets you could trade for it do something like a a barter here i could drop you maybe another shield oh that's you oh the ring's coming i guess we should go too there's a jump tower here thanks yeah i could use that our teammate is just running off into the sunset there's a scrapper at rift that's got me covered well the good news is we're actually split up but they don't know it as long as verizon's safe they're actually scrapping someone else that was the last one nice words that didn't need to be so difficult my fingers are just they're freezing cold if you've ever played with cold hands you'll know that it's a bit of a struggle i don't need all of these actually took one back i mean i've got this many i'm sure my teammates have a fair few as well the flatlines out of here i've been begging for the heavy ammo the entire game but apparently and there's no heavy ammo on the entire map no one's running it it's the blessing on the curse because there's one guy i've reacted a little bit it's better than the curse because that means that no one's running the hemlock so i'm not going to get two bursts uh all right i have 540 ammo if anyone needs any i mean there's no heavy ammo my word if you're looking for light ammunition i got you covered there's one squad left i don't know how we've made it this far i've not been confident in any of these gunfights i mean this isn't safe if they're gonna come this way they'll be funneled through this anyway right so do we just go back it's got time i mean 360 still quite a lot i wonder if these guys had any throwables anything to chuck anything i can love at my opponents nope no imagine if the oh you know what would be great on this game target over there a throwing knife it's gonna leave an idea there don't worry nice teammate i only got here once that's the treat he's looking suspicious sometimes just going to make sure i don't have a portal my horizon doesn't need it for my uptake being downhill like that against a sniper against a longbow when i've got a one times on my r301 it's just not good it's just not ideal you know sometimes you've got to realize when you've got a mover aimed when you've got a reposition and this is certainly one of those times i am confident that if we can get close to these guys especially because they've got a crypto hopefully we can get him stuck in his drone we've got a car back and shoot vessel camping there going a little crater from this would be nice probably you want to get a crater at this stage okay what's the crater it's been behind them okay i'm still getting shot at hey i'm still getting shot oh no i'm on fire oh nice job teammates good grief i mean the fingers are freezing cold ggt my friends that stands for good game teammates as you guys well know i can't believe we've done that i've i mean every gunfight i feel like we looked our way through 11 kills 1400 damage for 11 kills did i join some of those um potentially you're looking at the damage numbers but listen it's a team game don't look at my kill look at the squad kills we've got 16. we've got 5.3 each on average there you go i'll take that a win is a win especially so solo queuing in this game nowadays
