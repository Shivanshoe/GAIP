us to only have one weapon and when you get a kill with that one weapon you've got to drop it and pick up a different one let's give it a go another two minute here with us i'm in the middle man in the middle one drop seconds g7 yeah i'm dropping fire he's for the foosa i wasn't sure oh they topped off this one i don't have an angle on him he's on the first floor i am taking fire oh broken just rotate it around uh team on the bridge and then team on that one grow tower okay but they both just recharging shields don't like me which bridge do you mean oh this left one yeah and then one's coming up the hill where we came up firing rings close one more team this week a damn team i don't have a gun to switch to that i think it's over when you get the kill now probably yeah i appreciate that fine with it i've gone off right now 30 seconds remember the ring is nearby you don't hit these hop nah yeah he doesn't see these mate he does eat these seconds should we hear those yeah he's one of them that's any damage octanes wait no wonder this guy was running a white death box 15 minutes into the game is this you trolling me or what yeah they're coming they're coming one hp i'm not it's very anti-climactic okay i'm not that useful let me know if you see a bolt i'll find one i'm good i have six shots that's enough right it's fine i'm in mate don't worry i mean right i'm healing i have no ammo ah who's this why am i looking around i'm crypto are they she's not going she's gonna hop in the way nearly cracked i think any attachment to my nine it's getting on the left too oh this is a mess the car's bouncing there's a flying car dude mate it by yourself hold on i'm just going to get some stuff i don't know what this other team is right here i have uh basically no attachment i broke your kk yeah but no attachment uh 30 30. let's do them i mean i technically didn't get a kill but i've already used this i'm going to use the sentinel like if you saw what what happened to me like i'm in the same room as a rape and i've got like 30 health and i'm behind laptops then she just ran off she's got annoyed that was i was struggling i was getting shot by everyone who was even breathing oh my god i was huh [Music] this is a fun challenge they're kind of running yeah i'd say i'm one of them to recharge oh come on oh my god come on man oh my god yes as well nice hit this one i take cracked yes oh one of them's going to rest by the time we get there man i don't know what it is i don't know if you've played pathfinder recently are you failing to jump in your grapple every now and again because i am like loads of he's back oh he's right here let's go yeah but i don't think that has anything to do with the game i think i'm just i'm not bad yeah but i'm doing it so much now yes we are already i want to use the r3 this guy's uh either i'm using the either eight check out that package oh here we go yeah yeah oh yeah the one that the ray throws would you get a drip tank too nah nah let me start i think the right thing is to carry because the radio is decent i don't remember wait the wraith that i was hiding behind wait it was that guy yeah yeah nah nah just find a laptop and hide behind i'm telling you it ultimately counts that right or in front of me i'm going to miss so many shots oh no there you go nah sensitivity's all messed up mate you got this nah don't mate i'm so bad with this good i'm glitchy about to mess and keyboard i'm getting punched mater what check it out they're cracked off [Music] so our second challenge comes in from tony havoc 1490 and they said think you should do a no attachments video let's give it a go it's actually like 3 14's coming here oh really okay yeah should be fun pkg7 man yes oh i don't know why i thought it was just attachments going there just can't take anything it's massive no more no more than that yeah i've got a peak i need to find something else make gold harmony here everything level four honestly behind i'm coming team over here i'm i'm good for a second path is down drop the jump oh my god of course i don't reload i think it's that shot one i've never seen a glitch like it this week myself at the top of every attachment it's got some good ones in there too really weak one shot against that when like i was further away sliding way more damage i'm i'm okay 27. okay one's really low over there uh dimitano behind us two okay ah there's one there's a random team behind them reloading within like two seconds i think the wraith is the um the bad player here yeah she's got red too oh my god whoa man that's crazy oh he's so laggy oh my god oh my god she's keep saying german you say that huh you sound german when you say that one moment i am german that's true my wingman is not great at the moment we'll admit we'll admit which way was that ah this way i think i'm not thinking about it in the yeah the one on the other side that backline back left one uh like 40 hp this isn't a right it's an octane okay good eyes detectives that package is unopened might be something good this way i think we can't even use any guns from there right because they have attachments yeah sad day we can't remove them though so oh wait where the heck i was in the middle hold on uh i have 11 cells and six bats what you need um where is this guy hello i can't even see him hold on all right wait does the creeper have attachments though i guess it's got science hasn't i guess i mean does it though you can't look it's got no attachments bomb left i mean it's a crater it's a suck it's a stock that's stuck out the gate yeah in this window let's go this way this glass behind me oh yeah behind me a bit over here oh she's so low on this i don't know she's really i think it's a valkyrie right batman looking somewhere over here she probably healed already i think she's beneath me yeah it's a crypto script as well yeah they're here i'm gonna how's that miss save me i'm trying oh my god wow mate the good news is we don't have to worry about if the crab has an attachment or not because i literally didn't find a shot so it doesn't matter would you put you at a disadvantage yes let me bear with wait wait watch out this body oh my god nice oh and zero for three with the crater there was no i was on her head though 100 you there i know we're kind of crazy with the hit fire 30 30. you absolutely bossed that game oh it's better than when i have all the attachments in the world you did 3 000 damage with that what i don't know how our third and final challenge comes in from genie and he asks us to do an agent 47 slash hitman challenge which is basically pistols only can we compete this last challenge let's see how it goes all right peaceful please please that's a pistol that's a pistol i've got a mozam nah got an ari is that a pistol though yeah of course it is it's a shotgun pistol oh this guy's got a pk and another weapon in my building this is this is impossible i've gotten dropping a mouse man those arms are shotgun though no no shotgun pistol though yeah yeah reloading [Music] [Applause] so much better than mine one at the door harder to promise now i don't want it why can't you get a mirage dude oh no i'm going in i'm going in yes he went this way nearly cracked wait it's actually so much better that we don't have to drop guns now oh yeah i think that's stressful it was stressful you're die yeah in england we have our doors on the other side so i didn't know where the handle was uh okay it's like when you know when you're driving pretty girl i'm wondering is that half the squads remain let's keep winning reloading i just picked up his teammates so confused there's another there's more over here forget this path it's annoying crack toss 50 health that's cracked oh my god i left them both i don't know how i didn't kill that guy more oh you know i need to get cells hold on i'm not burning them apparently  on the side let's go got this easy game easy life i'm in the face this time you're a fight i'm still over there oh poor guy there's two of them there's one behind the rock too oh my god okay i'm the worst ever with the wingman life i don't know when this happened to me i've been using ages because that's what i was using oh no i just i i clicked switch mate nothing happened now let's see what they left us oh are you good rich no i'm having a disaster of a time mate oh my god i'm so calm right now and i'm getting really stressed out it's um you just told me to be careful but i think you forgot that i do have a mozambique and a b20 because my loadout so yeah i think oh yeah i think you forgot about that oh boy found that close guy is the best oh he's just throwing everything back then oh i got an i got a no wreck you're looking oh you're
