hey what's the garage rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have two games of horizon here for you i haven't actually played much horizon since the uh since the launch in season seven but i ended up playing her for two hours straight last night because of how fun her kit is and how high the play making abilities as well you can completely out maneuver people with her grab to lift and then you can destroy a full team with her ultimate it's such a fun kid to use and i'll definitely be playing her a little bit more in future so as i mentioned there are two games here the first of which isn't edited down that much because most of you guys said that you preferred less editing but the second game is edited down a little bit more because the video would have just been way too long also one more thing i am extremely tempted to start streaming on twitch youtube streaming is great but it messes up with notifications it's complicated i always seem to mess it up and all the content is in one place so switching games uh it can be difficult can be troubling twitch could be just a fun place just to hang out and talk to you guys and just play whatever as well as apex so if you are interested just let me know i'm sure the little encouragement will probably just end up with me live on twitch at some point so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends especially if you have a lot of animals you just you just need it oh god mate obviously it's not good oh whoa i just bounced off this dude's head that's unreal he stole my gun how i was are we really yeah we're in new york i still lose ping battles like what's that still your thing's still trash 100 i'm on 90 right now i'm a knight yes oh my god how are you you're not even on the same continent this guy walks over to my bin that i opened and then robbed it from me i'd have had a flatline i bounced off an octane's head and
