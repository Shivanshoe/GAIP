hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some more relief i live and i love this mode mainly because if someone first do you just have to wait for the ring to close in and you can get yourself back there and get yourself some revenge i know you can do this anyway but the usual respawning process is so telegraphed and usually what happens is a full squad is ready for you to fly on in out of the respawn sheep when you've got absolutely nothing to your name and they'll shoot you and then first you again and it's actually even more depressing to make this even more toxic i am playing some caused it a fan favorite and i hope you guys enjoy the gameplay thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wait because i thought we were gonna get content today so i was kind of like oh you know we'll get content i'll make a video on it but oh sorry i've had an absolute disaster class i got too close to diving board and then it slowed me down and then i managed to fall off diving board i'm running over me and supreme breeze running the water why are you lying just say that you want to go to diving board as caustic as well what have i become is embracing your caustic diving board mean i'm going to say that one gold triple t i don't think it's a coincidence that they put the chore take near the diving board by the way i just i don't know it's a bit too weird for me is there really one by the time yeah like there's a bunker like the other side of diving board and it has a gold triple take spawn there oh does it really oh like do you remember um what did they used to call it that mountain in world's edge and they used to call it like a sniper sniper thing yeah because wasn't there wasn't there like all the crates there just had snipers yeah it's just a troll they're just trolling us at this point where are the people yeah this game is just uh dude is acknowledged it's a hard reset this is the 4k game manager last game so this is the game that i'll get the 4k if anything i i have to go back and look at the game i like maybe i was killing people too fast i don't know big scan yeah he's up top there it's fine at the left oh this dude right here where did you come from though guy mike stop shooting me these guys land in every shot oh my god oh i gotta drop back and pop up phoenix okay i hide okay so there's nobody in all those i don't know there's everybody i'm just big chilling yeah it's always the way you know i'm taking it did you thanks teammate like a wingman or something climb please still this way on my way back to him oh he's got top i need to chill okay on top is flash you bring me more hammer points i'm a point harry i think he probably oh he pointed away i got it i'm safe uh our team's getting flanked okay there's a lot of people here let's let's see this is kind of wild okay i say we just hold this down real quick yeah yeah there's so many people loving if you need to retreat i got traps in this oh here our teammate just ran free i'm gonna switch this one i'm gonna pour it and see if i can i'm coming back always up top ah they're everywhere red no i didn't even get my naughty off i tried to lobby at the floor there's so many people we've respawned soon if these guys finished i tried to lock my old seat finish i'm just trying to run this guy takes me so hard we didn't find anyone in that cave that's what it's called i i feel like this is just every time we play it's either we don't find anybody or we find no one and then we run into 45 people yeah pretty much all right i survived yes nice we're coming back nice dude i gotta find this guy who's chasing me i'm gonna land with you yeah if you land right here i'll just we'll walk so there's some boxes right there we could probably go you should at least spawn in with like maybe a pistol i think so look a little mozam yeah there's some boxes in here ah they're still fighting i got high ground i think they're inside yeah too oh wait what oh there's another one in the corner nice no there's one more i'm still cooking it there let's go dude let's go let's go oh my god i i don't know what happened i got a straight complaint they were training that corner my nades are putting some work though just cooking i got destroyed by a devo oh yeah that'll do me with like all headshots that will indeed i killed the guy that killed me that's like a good feeling all the revenge you should get like you should get like a badge for that that'd be great on this mode like yeah they should definitely have like uh ltm badges and stuff do they i don't think they do do they do drink with the train game mode oh my god i've got to take that there's so many i feel like every single time we we play a game there's somebody with a gold dibbler i think because it's like there's a permanent spawn i think so oh is there really i don't know yeah like near if it's still the same it's near the fake school team all right the fake school town yes so it's like uh oh the one that's back in like the uh maybe um find something yeah i think i i think i know what you're talking about oh my god i might be dead i was looking at the map i'm not even lying to you i have okay i have healer balls i'm good can you get to me this portal will disappear but if you can take it yes i'm just standing still i can't move okay because it'll disappear yeah okay all right i should be able to make it yeah i'm good supreme breeze i will not make these no problem i was looking at the match trying to think where the gold divo spawns and this the zone is so quick the second zone is crazy i didn't even get to love my ultimate again oh no are you safe you're not a teammate maybe with the big smoke oh no i'm in the worst spot imaginable in life i'm going to race i have my ultimate as well so if they push there's someone on me they're all just split sorry is my smoke not here they got choking on my stomach the guy behind here in the in the water oh my god you guys are all absolutely popped did you how did they not nurse you oh my god i threw uh bangalore smoked and i threw my aldi down there nice work nice dude that's perfect oh my god hold on we should not have won that at all nice dude that's to be fair that's what's good about this mode you guys survive long as you survive you have a chance yeah do the squads left i'm getting some throwballs i'll go i'm gonna get caught in the storm again oh my god no i'm good i have 240 spades you need some uh let me see oh no i'm good there's something here the ring moves do we go through bunker i think so i think we have of course i'll go first don't worry i got this i think we i think we die if we don't oh god teammate i don't know again a little 360. it was a little 360 wardrobe because i had a spectator and now he stopped spectating he's like yeah i have this guy he's like these guys i'm gonna do it now too those maneuvers all mine was miners mine was clean mine was super clean and he just switched off he just switched off me he's like yeah these guys are here these guys are next games these guys are full of themselves you always have to put a shower on i love it you got to as long as you're not doing like there's always those people that uh i don't spectate people much anymore but i remember every once in a while when i'd spectate people they they start like uh to be really toxic to just start um using like their voice lines oh yeah yeah you start i mean voice lines it's so toxic i have to stop yeah i'm like yes you don't punch my monitor i've done it i'll do it again oh wait on me oh i'm gonna show on the back should be okay he doesn't land a single shot i got one i think that must be a separate team although it hasn't given us the voice line suck that down i think they might be just really separated i'm a corsic and he landed one hemlock charming yeah that's just you know he's having a bad day just on this on the charge this guy's going to write something about my pace i'm with you now i'm trying to wrap around because i don't have any aim assistant you know through my own [Music] health i don't know uh what is happening how many is this has to be both teams are just all separated yeah i can look at who's on whose team someone's self-residing over here i was the caustic oh really okay just one team now wait i've just dropped my gold diva what that's crazy what's happening i think it's just one i think it's just a wraith whose name is jesus yeah i i don't know what even happened in that whole last fight it was an absolute mess every single player on both teams was just scattered why weren't they yeah i just got dropped in at a random fight so i don't know what to do nice um nearly half your damage same kills the classic life uh yeah i did down a few people with with my gas that's that's all that matters
