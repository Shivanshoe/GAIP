hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing the legend who i think is one of the best at managing third parties there are the obvious ones like corsic whose whole kit dissuades people from pushing an area watson is another one as you can bunker down but both of these legends often need a little bit of time to set up their defenses bangalore on the other hand has an amazing zoning ultimate which cuts off a huge part of the nearby area her smoke can cut whichever sidelines you want cut off and even her passive is designed to run away from a bad situation and that's why i tend to play bangalore if i've had a few rough games in a row because i find her so consistent thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's go this way ideal okay well guess we're going capital i was gonna land elsewhere but i guess this is where we'll land it let's fight havoc that's a nice gun to drop on last two games i've played have been p20s so already i'm in a superior position and i'm feeling good about it 30 30 and havoc i had to hop up too but i just can't i can't it's a flat line at the start of the game it's the ultimate gun to have and i would like to get into the scrap good work we're inside the next ring it's not through one though one that's tricking my passive there that's a big scan that's a humongous scan don't mind me just got sniped nice i think she said she was out of heavy i have 100 i could donate some but there's a load of boxes around here so i'm hoping we'll be okay there you go find some more i might take a look i look up top give me a second there was a purple around here somewhere if we killed the uh if we did kill the mirage unless he arm switched somewhere drops off the end she hasn't said that she needs heavy let's check out this area is this the guy that died yes in case she still does now she she's she's zooming she's zooming give me a sec i've got squats he's crazy okay we'll just land here and the scrap will continue far into the night too because as people kill each other in scraps while everyone else makes their way to scrappy toe fossil danger close she got ultimate dragon apparently that has to be a sick joke right that's i mean is that a sick joke or is it a sick joke that's huge and i have no big shields but nice teammate big glitch annoyingly i think the watsons that put those fences down he's already dead because i got the kill credit for that which doesn't make any sense nice job i need shields i guess i can go and loop but that fitness kit would have been huge beforehand then tremendous he's got very little projection i've just decided that i'm looking for a vault so if there's one in any of those boxes i wasn't looking and i cannot be able to look through the entire loop pile that's over there so many boxes just call me bothered way too much effort there you go what's hand is so good don't tell me they're leaving don't tell me they were leaving no i went through the whole climbing maneuver just for nothing i know they've just bumped into someone else might as well just stay in the building could be just a solo guy getting rushed by by a team of three though between two people here she's in the lava no she's going into her own ultimate i'm gonna watch from here how she's alive of course it works out like that another havoc there's just they're everywhere of course it works out that way honestly i feel like we should turn around but if you want to go this way i'm down she survived a lot longer than i was expecting this looks all unloaded i don't know i don't know if it's even worth going that way seems kind of pointless that was it recharging unfortunately they all had blue so we would definitely add an advantage there and a lot of stuff i'll take this just to pop it nice little squad wipe goodness knows where these guys came from look at this everywhere it's just unlooted he lost that we're going to get pinched here i think definitely three of them i don't know if it's worth doing that we're gonna get shot in the back so bad i just know it there comes the snipes i need to try and help but i need to make sure that i don't get focused because they could easily just triple focus me here i got triple focused i mean i i don't know how i killed the only one that was inside i thought that was gonna push off you need to be quick this is gonna happen i'm stuck i knew this is going to happen both teams are still alive though this is an absolute war out here bring them charge oh my god she's in the lava bullets hello i thought i was destroying it there i might just try maybe i can't there's gonna be full health when i get around this corner though there you go teammate nice i can't believe we won that i knew i was gonna get triple focused but that's why i took out the valkyrie first before because she was so low inside the building right so i took her out so my teammates could push up but i think what must have happened is they were getting shot in the back by the other third party so they couldn't reconvene it was just a mess it was a mess but we won we dealt with it and we came out victorious gg well played team did you well played
