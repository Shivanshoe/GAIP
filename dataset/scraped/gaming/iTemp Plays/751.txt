hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i'm glad that i finally got a game here with the mastiff it is now flawless of course it used to be in the care packages before season five now whenever i'd find this weapon in a care package i'd to be honest i'd leave it but i'd feel bad and a lot of you guys were telling me to try it out again and can i just say that you guys were completely right the mastiff is unbelievable even as grand loot and it's been nerfed in so many different ways so just looking at the patch notes here they've reduced the damage per pellet they've reduced the headshot multiplier they've increased the blast pattern distance they've increased the blast pattern scale ads multiplayer they reduced the fire rate and they reduced the projectile size as well i mean they did buffet a little bit they increased the shell count from 46 and increase the projectile speed a little bit as well but across the board pretty much this has been a nerfed weapon and i absolutely love it i cannot believe how much fun i'm having with this weapon at the moment i'm actually furious in myself than i never used to pick this gun up and i'll tell you why i never used to shotguns on this game or any game ever in fact i just sell all or nothing you land your shot and it does 100 damage or you can land your shot and it is eight or you miss altogether it just gets sprayed down by an i-99 or something but i can promise you i'm going to be using this so much more in season five so thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right whatever on earth this place is called i was gonna call it new school town but there is already a new school town on the map and that's where schooltown used to be people actually still enjoy landing there which is good news um but for some reason people don't enjoy landing here as much as they well as much as i thought they would well hey what happened to my two times four reloading sort of picked up a variable scope so we've done like landing here and there are two teams scrapping right from me and that's what happens when you get too excited no breakfast going inside to the face and then the lifeline ran over to the pathfinder so then the pathfinder took a lot of damage and was stunned i think they would have killed me otherwise there we go that's all uh two kills to start the game off i've got a nice little cell here too a g7 with a perfect ended the mastiff as well the massive by the way i am having so much fun with this gun i am so much better with the massive than i ever have been with the peacekeeper i never used to pick the peacekeeper up but we are going to get a bunch of massive costs here guaranteed not guaranteed likely i would say unfortunately that's all she wrote for this north east side of the map if we need to we can always take the jump tower to get to the next scrapper that's the good news i'm trying to play a bit more low but i'm not that good with her bracelet honestly my bracing abilities are okay we don't need to take the drum time even close drive and why my bracelets are on fleek lovely idea someone's behind two enemies nice and literally him in the leg but i think for 42 it's because his pathfinder and his limb shots take as much damage as uh regular body shots we have 45 seconds and the next ring's right there don't leave anything good behind whatever i said there were people this way and i definitely heard them i could have run up top i guess i'll join friend we've got 30 seconds someone's getting a hot respawn on either side of this inside of this place as well oh maybe that's what happened okay i reckon this might be the team yeah it has to be no one's here maybe they've ran away and respawned their team at the nearest uh respawn beacon that's a sight we can go and chase them only shoe is i'm not entirely sure what the reason beacon is is it like in the middle somewhere kind of something good here we're already inside the next ring it's gonna be a one of these goose trains as they say this could be a completely pointless endeavor it looks looted i think i'm taking us the wrong way here friends i'm gonna be honest with you i'm not sure how much we're actually gonna we're actually gonna find but there is a separate scrap in the distance they're going kind of wild down here what containment okay never mind i reckon this is the team i reckon i flew right over their foreheads oh i feel good about this care package shall we that close don't drive out oops okay this gun fires slower than i thought when he doesn't have a shotgun bolton congratulations thank you kill leader if you find one please let me know because uh that completely messed me up there i shot about half a second after i zoomed out i was expecting to uh i was expecting to fire but there you go i mean they weren't looking at me and they were fair obviously pretty easy shots but i choked those with the peacekeeper let me tell you if you've ever if you've ever seen me use the peacekeeper you know that i've probably somehow managed to die there even though the guy wasn't even looking at me i'd still fall over miss all my shots scrape my knee i have to put a bandage on and then i'd get shot in the head but not with the mastiff what are these things by the way let's go here when you ping them it doesn't give like a custom voice line or anything but i know what they are there's a lot over there do we chase what are you feeling teammate okay i was hoping he has his ultimate but this is fine too that rudy is the most visible thing on the map isn't it good grief the lower ability like a massive arc in the sky i'm not sure if they can oh did they carry on they must have people are following the balloon too it's their teammate we can chase these guys i don't think there's anyone else around here unless this of toffees making themselves available to scrap is anyone up there no that's scrap it's all hill as well no one's up there for the first time since uh 1995 it feels like you should be getting shot at the sky like a clay pigeon at the moment okay my issue is i don't have any idea where that team went okay let's see what we have over here was that because of the care package if we were closer i could have set my ultimate uh in range of the care package and installed whatever was in there from the safety of one of these a little bit too houses away that's scrapping all right hey friends can shop under the team we need to kill this guy nice job okay the good news is they're not going to rush us anymore i just need to get a few you need in this situation you need to turn around and fire at them so they know that you're not weak or you're not afraid to uh to turn and fight otherwise i'll just rush you throw grenades turn up outside your window and shoot in the back of the head and look what's happened to them now once they're playing then good teammate i think he's okay that was two three mastiff kills this isn't the time to go shopping okay i'm rushing her i'm mad i could have said two three massive kills nice oh 104 104 damage this is what i'm saying i don't think i've ever done that much damage with the with the peacekeeper in my entire life got a purple bolt for it now as well although to be fair i won't need a purple bolt if i keep landing 100 force it doesn't really matter at that point we've got a minute until the ring closes i don't think this is your threat i'm not that good this is the team that i knocked before i must have got a revive how dare you 45 recharging i see an enemy over there tossing thermite oh that's a global shop we need to move i thought it was a wraith box i was waiting for them to go down low to use it that's a short battery we've got 30 seconds to be somewhere else if we don't have to get cooked let's try and cut these guys off so it's gone absolutely wild on this rope that's not good see if we didn't move preemptively these guys would have had the high ground on us completely that'd be where we are right now we're out of cover anyone's pretty healing right now so i might as well do the same oh i absolutely love this gun you're going to see me use the mastiff so much this season guaranteed unless they i don't think they're nerfed is this how good the peacekeepers always been but i've just been bad with amy or something because i feel like i've been playing better in season five than i have done in the past so i can't tell if it's me being a bit more comfortable with these single shot weapons like the mastiff and the wingman or if it's just because it's here wait i have [ __ ] no never mind i have one shield battery thank you preparing uh i have five med kits then thanks man [Music] did you see him yes okay uh yeah i'm not sure if it's the master or if it's me i never remember being capable of uh at least with the beef keeper that's a clear package someone's gonna respawn as well drop ship here let's give them a warm welcome the nice thing about using a shotgun secondary instead of an r99 as well is i can stock up on throw balls because usually if i run an r9 i want at least like 300 my rounds you can't go sideways on these things right there scraper here she's top of the line thanks i'll do he's got the scrapping only the best for my friend back here level three oh i do need that but i'm not turning around i'm afraid i'm too far gone me amigo oh god that's taking me down right that is a bit of a mistake never mind i bet we'll find something to do with you is amy do you see someone hey ralph hey careful it's always ralph it comes say hello ralph there's a big scrap going on i want to get involved he's got red shields nice teammate wow looks like that still did 28 though she's running off she knew she's gonna get wall starred she couldn't face it she had to flee the scene i love this gun it's tremendous it's a tremendous out of ten that's my rating on the mastiff i think i'm way better with this gun than i am the online tonight the r99 recently i don't know what it is but that gun seems real difficult to nine shots over there just wishing to be opened my lowest has been 13 this game and that's only because the bangalore was moving out about real quick in her passive most of the shots have been like 70. okay is that the lifeline exactly the team we can judge you by how many t how many people are going to shoot at us here just one but looks of it unless it is the other team and it's just one person you've got a dire tip with a craver i'm on the way i would assume so as soon as we killed your teammate not too long ago unless you're a different lifeline there you go i think this is two triple tap men you've heard of triple tape man this is triple ten men the ultimate final boss teammates absolutely shredded insulting what are you doing i can't push this i angle sneak in my bracelet i need to try and use it more no it pushed me off the hill people that's not my fault it pushed me off nice sorry i'm messing about over here on my with my jewellery it's going crazy hey well your teammates down because the gas i'm choking his teammates up oh my word nice job team mate oh good grief i nearly messed it up entirely [Music] winter can be fun [Music] i guess their team i had a gold knockdown i'm pretty sure they were a mirage does that mean when they're self present they're invisible is that how that works 13 kills 2 600 damage all right do not go off the final fight there because i was i saw my life flash before my eyes i thought i was a gunner i was spraying and praying i didn't know what's going on but before that the mastiff was putting in some work this my friends is what the mastiff used to be a care package weapon even though they nerfed it when they took it out of the care package he still feels real good real good thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you on the next one bye
