hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and when i think of hard characters to play in apex my mind always goes to gibby he's a unit so he gets hit by every shot his bubble can actually be a hindrance to his team if you place it wrong and his ultimate has a big cooldown so you get punished for misusing it it takes skill to be a good gibby now for some reason i never think about how hard fuse is to play you think it'd be fairly easy you just spam his ability and his needs at every opportunity but if you do that you get punished because half the time you should just be shooting your gun and even then it's hard to aim the nades and the knuckle cluster to be effective it is time fused mains got some respect at least from me anyway because i am so bad with this guy i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends what do you say we moved here i don't have a gun i still don't have a gun mate i got a gun nice [Music] yeah i'll see you next game no no no no no there's a oh there's a bat down here that helps i know you would use that here comes the old knuckle cluster faster purple there we go here thank you it's not picking up my attachments man come on i'm down to drop if you want i can put another okay i'll just drop it already close to that door [Music] always if you need me i'm good i got arms yeah yeah you're fine recharging the shield jack knock on that way right here there's no way they're going to talk [Music] knuckle cluster it's terrified unless there's another team here doing oh my god [Music] you said you're not playing well enough no i thought at 30 30 no i just shoot it i could try i can try you just shoot i'm actually driving playing first you're thinking too much don't think just shoot over here yeah yeah recharging shields damn he's good looking huge mother lode they didn't expect the mother lode to be that league can you blame him no that was a big one and i've got a golf helmet so the next milo is coming already a third of the way to my next mother lode recharging shields pick that also back up absolutely not pick it back up i saw you drop it in the death box i don't think so maybe i don't think so nice can't just be him left right that was one team yes that was the last one other teams in here with a lot of fences oh it is a watson jan no what the heck am i looking at rings closed there's no way they can be here right where are you taking oh okay nevermind i'm sorry

us through the entire thing that's a good night amigo that's a very good night i don't have any med kits i have four syringes why the odds of me win in this this is this is gonna be wanting 2000 chance me winning this this is a rough one but i believe brings close got ten seconds reagan she'll be right healing give me a sec oh they've got a horizon there's gonna they're just gonna queue over the top man oh if i trapped her in there though that would have been good might get 1v1 around this corner of your guy you guys are terrified imagine enemy oh man they're here please the hold on i need to heal firing i cracked shooting at me love the three times three times he's so good man it's too good it's busted i got jealous of all the massive keyboard players using it so i tried it myself

you're a good guy man thank you ready let's give that pretend 100 walk straight through moyalty might have what if you have speed beats do you still get slowed if you got speed boost yeah yeah yeah have you ever like been slower than when to went into race phase she can't move still reloading oh enemy squad's dead 220 why am i getting fps lag knuckles she's there horizon's on my head i thought they were going to back up further than that that was close oh she was right on your head replicator incoming that's i'll show you i'll show you it's okay [Music] near me this is a giveaway to my head as well mate separate team separate team i'm coming back nearly cracked two separate teams remember i can throw my attack in five seconds okay you're fine these are the things running i'm skipping all over the place do the teams appear to be an enemy fellas the other team drops she'll be right yeah i can't tell why these guys are shooting another squad so i can see him over here he's running away stockton i think he's a solo oh come on i'm skipping everywhere i yeah keeps getting absolutely destroyed from my finger but he's bubbling and he's got gold he's fine no every time we have to go down this hill a dead knight juice jump drive in position box mini craft it could be a little bit okay almost work one note with you coming up right here over here about 100 lights how long until that gibby bubble goes dropped i dropped something thank you another and that's the worst gun he could have had here we go i'm this team's not going to drop though unless you can shoot the gibby the gibby's in the open i can't i'm going to move up then ring will be closing in 30. but she ain't far i don't have a i don't have any ammo i don't have nades yeah i'm with you yeah i got no ammo i think we need to we need to try and get to this side so i could throw it on my alt okay i don't know airstrike okay nice hole i'm gonna put my uh miles in here he killed him that's crazy died from that that is actually unreal no dude they just took the bats at the last second i have two if you need some i have zero i can drop it oh they they're not like low brandon are they i was gonna say i'll drop me three two one are you going man i'll drop you one oh we have to go too so we just go yeah i agree at least these top things safe some of it is and i don't want to sit up there so i'm like okay you're not dead oh my god boys good you're on your head shell just an absolute depth of darkness even if i didn't know where it went i could tell from your voice what happened i was terrifying all right okay
