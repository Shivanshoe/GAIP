hey what's up guys it's ritch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in apex since our last update the best strategy on ward's edge has been to try and get your hands on rampant gold weapons from big moored now the easiest way to do this is of course to play lober because you can steal the guns with your ultimate well you can steal one of them per ultimate but you can take this strategy to the next level by ensuring that an enemy lober lands a big moored steals one of the guns for you you steal the other one kill that lober and then you have both guns two minutes into the game it's a genius strategy and once you have the two weapons it's actually impossible to lose many don't realize this but it's impossible everyone else may as well leave the game now today i got the rampart super tough r301 and prowler it was outrageous so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends a little lava city drop for the squad we are here in the city of lava as it's more commonly known at least that's what it says on the uh the travel website they're trying to spruce it up a little bit they are a big scrap in a big mood i see absolutely nothing of worth through these walls rampage probably will be a little bit easier for me to use as soon as i've been playing so much battlefields i have played my shotgun uh i have played so much battlefield i'm absolutely loving the beta i wish they would give us some more maps but you know it just makes me more excited for the full release of the game um oh then you might even see that through the champion does that even these guys have been fighting since 1983 it's been a long time i've got no shield bats all right team before we go in it's very important here all right what gold guns we talked about uh i reckon it's gonna be longbow on 99. it's r301 let me get no need to be impatient no need to get the purple mag either okay someone has stolen the r301 that means there's another lobe here and she's got a gold gun and i want it was multiple bracelets i just want you good just drop you good i'll let you leave okay listen i gave the option target such an awkward angle and then try and bring it back out when i'm running around the corner it takes too long that's what people get wrong you know she was tanked the entire knuckle sandwich there was a knuckle sandwich on the ground and she decided to eat it thinking it was a real sandwich it's not a real sandwich it's made of grenades a cluster grenade at that and she tanked into to be fair if she ran out of the corner we'd just shoot her i don't really know what options she had we've got a hike she didn't really have any options did she uh all right this is a little bit scary because if i die whoever loots me is going to have the greatest okay this isn't this doesn't bode well whoever loots me is going to start screaming enjoy i did leave my two times in here the back to back a gold arthur a one and a gold prowler i'm actually a little bit scared they won't need this i've got no use for anymore level four oh why am i even looking at attachments that was the one that was on the ground i have two it's fine it's early game time's up and we're not in the ring move now i need to warm up and i need to warm up fast because i'm telling you if i die with this i'm gonna start i'm just gonna go i think i might just go and play battlefield if i die with this setup that's like illegal there isn't a single gunfight i should be losing here oh my word i've lost a gunfight to a cargobot there's nothing we're wasting time let's just get to scrappy top and once more i'm ability a mobility legend even lopez probably had the most amount of problems at any legend with her with her cue i'm surprised they didn't just try and rework it it was so broken i wanted to test something but i saw this already if you like approach it from there yeah you hit your head off the top and it doesn't leave you as like vulnerable because if it ends here and ranked and everyone can see you um sometimes it's going up that you just get lasered i don't know if you played ranked and it ends at giza but there's someone in every single building my teammates are so far away extended there'll be one capsule my friend we'll just kill someone we'll take days it'll be the best it'll be purple you know it'll extend your magazine tremendously we just need to get a capital and shoot someone [Music] i'm trying to almost forgot my daily treasure back there that would have been i see an enemy over there absolute disaster i haven't seen anyone by the way i'm creating a false sense of urgency so we can run over to the capitol but i'm a bit scared by myself so if you can hear my cat ralph he's brushing his face up against my hands which are on the controller so if i accidentally shoot or throw hands you know why i've got an excuse i need i need a cat cam i honestly i need i need a cat can that's what i need that's all my videos are missing a live action feed of my cats get ready there's an enemy close by sure oh i was hoping he's gonna run down to me there's a fight in the distance he might be trying a third party i should probably destroy the ultimate i'm just really lazy team i think there are two teams in the big building we come into this on the red armor i did a lot more to her than she did to me i think we should go to uh but it's like five story are there five stories in that corner building there's a there are a lot of stories oopsies loader get out of here a lifelong enemy over here this is a replicator okay didn't expect to kill you quick here and you've left the game i spy an enemy i carried on i thought there was a chance they were hiding in a corner or something no they're big scrappy yep could be solo i only saw two of them that guy left but they've clearly been to a separate team it might get them off the roof i hate taking the rope all the way up that might be a lifeline pack or it might be a mobile respawn i can hear so many of them slipped started looking at the sky sorry team i got a gold prowler recharging my seat ultimately so broken and we killed the lifeline first too they can't get any free revives we're already in the next ring good i've no idea what their solo teammate went there we though i gotcha i've got your package heavy i could use light just to spray people i didn't i don't know i don't want to give away throw balls i don't need this many light rains i i just don't i don't even know there's a trouble take here i'm not going to take up two gold guns over here it looks pretty good where did they go i'm absolutely farming this is why i was named named professional game of the year 2019 you know because of my professional sprays like that unrivalled in the gaming community hello i thought you're on the balcony this guy's an absolute tank it's actually invincible i can't even blame you for trying to revive that give me the guy was an absolute unit i couldn't even first him okay but it's a little bit anti-climactic however we did just kill a team so i'm going to pretend like the gibby lifeline was it a lifeline or was it a lobo i'm going to pretend like they were actually the last team my ultimate's ready what did they do in the storm i wish you told us i wish we had some details oh this is why i need a replay mode on apex give me the ability to go back in that game see who the last team were and what enough happened were they afk did they disconnect did they fall off the map potentially it's happened not to me definitely not to me but to other people certainly 12 kills with two gold guns and 2600 damage i will take it thank you for watching do appreciate it see you on the next one
