and my friends we are back we are here on apex we've got some sort of like a mid-season update here and we do have ourselves a new heirloom to unlock it is here what's it called the death hammer oh oh good grief that's a a good description if you ask me like it's staring it's my soul we can get a look at some of the new cosmetics here i guess i really shouldn't show them here i just want to get a little bit of a sneak peek because we are going to be opening up all of these packs and unlocking the cortex heirloom right here today how many apex coins do i have 1 300. how many do we need i built i believe it's a lot more we're back i'm not going to record this part all right we are back we just returned whoa where did these come from 11 and a half um that's exposed me bought it from the shop where did i get back to this place all right let's buy some packs with our newfound i don't think i have enough i have to put more money oh i thought i had oh hey we're back again with way more coins this time way more coinage there we go we cannot purchase any more packs and the packs that we are going to look at they're kind of fancy looking let me open them let's get this show on the road first pack got a legendary in there these packs are great because sometimes you can get like a triple legendary draft wait is it a legend oh my word i love him bobblehead marvin look at him shaking it oh how do i there should be an equip button here i hate the fact that you can't whoa okay that's pretty cool skin um so i assumed the ones in the middle are part of the pack so i should probably or part of the event i should probably start equipping them here at the start next up we have a weapon charm oh a little arthur or hyperbird i'm going to the meat and gravy of the of the packs yes mirage skin money maker i had the sea foam swindler on there which is one of my favorite skins on the entire game uh let me get a banner frame i'm not really too interested in the side ones it's mainly just the middle ones that we're focused on here it's the guaranteed drops that you get from each one of the packs as soon as i have 24 i pretty much know what i'm going to get i mean i did get a legendary skin from an alternator that's a bonus we've got a banner pose for gibraltar i'm going to throw that on got a legendary in here as well hopefully it's part of the event there we go we're getting into the good stuff now my friends look at this void prowler this has to be the best wraith skin i mean i don't even think it's that close like if this is by far the best one and anyone who disagrees with that you can take it with me because it by okay identity theft these skins by the way i mean this is this obviously isn't a sponsored video i had to buy the coins myself the skins in this event are actually outrageous out of ten that is the rating that i would give them that's the item plays official skin rating system we've got a double legendary out of this pack got ourselves a caustic skin i might as well throw him on it's so new for me and then part of the event that is looking clean it's an r301 skin i love the r301 skins that are like really they're quite slim there are some r301 skins now that are just so big and bulky it feels like you're running around within with two lmgs i need the the skinny little unobtrusive r301 skins and we get the legendary lifeline of breech and clear skin looking like she's straight out of rainbow six or tom clancy he's rainbow six tom clancy it might be tom clancy's rainbow six another legendary here and it is part of the event that is a wingman skin i just love like the the what would you call it geometric sort of um design is that the right word i'm a big fan i throw it on there it looks like a bit of a bulky wingman skin and i can't land a shot with that gun to save my life but i'm throwing it on anyway because it looks pretty cool what do you got for me little pack a skydive emo for lobo this is great because as you know i'm a big global player so when i do play low but i shall be doing that emotes don't and i mean i don't even have you unlocked but i'm gonna put i'm gonna put this on and i can put this on as well i guess if you don't like what you see put a bag over your head let me just put yeah that's good thanks all right next up we have the flatline skin still so it looks like obsidian it's so shiny again another little gun charm oh it's a little breathe it in that's great because that's like you could hang that from your car i want one of those i don't drive and i don't own a car but i still want one to hang up and i eventually do get one all right we got ourselves an insane octane skin look at this guy an outrageous skin who designed these give them a raise respawn next up what are we going to get we've got a legendary a piece keeper's skin that's what it looks like and i would still land about 13 damage if i was on the other end of this beautiful absolutely tremendous loving the woodwork great carpentry straight on equipped another legendary but that is not a shock given that you are guaranteed those 24 exclusive bits of kit we've got like a clown skin for caustic killing joke three three rares crafting materials big scam watson saw going crazy again big what's in maine so shall be throwing that on for the next timer player in 2024 i would assume more crafting materials a little epic lobe skin which isn't part of the event this is part of the event uh though it is called entry lane i'm gonna throw you on i i bought like a a reskin for longbow yesterday and i didn't even get a chance to pick it up and use it and now i've already switched it out more crafting materials i think i get more crafting materials than anyone else because i just own so many of the skins now there is watson someone said on twitter this looks like thomas the tank engine and i can't really unsee but it's still a great skin you know i'm still a big fan of the skin because i'm a big fan of thomas the tank engine but i i can't see the similarities well vault skin not part of the event but that's what lavender like you know what i'm throwing you on i don't have a volt skin here we go legendary alternating the second one of the pack opening today amped up it's beautiful more crafting materials legendary coming out of the pacquiao today let me see what i get here first little look at this look at this guy i haven't actually seen the skin until just now i'm glad i didn't spoil it look look at him intimidating i'm throwing on blazing hot these skins are next level we only have four more packs and then we get ourselves the caustic heirloom here uh a little revenant banner pose little rv skin i love the animations even though this is only an epic i know you get animations on some of the ones but not as cool as this still oh look this could easily be a legendary skin in my opinion i'm throwing you one oh rampant skin why not three more apex packs remaining a blue and two purples little i'm sorry i just got the void parallel every other wraith skin is now null and void this is the re45 triple take skin it's the exact same thing i'm going to make sure i throw the re45 skin on and this skin around christmas because i'm getting big christmas vibes from this with that that sort of green and the red together because now the troubles actually they nerfed the triple take a little bit in this update which is to be honest quite good because i'm i'm fed up with being triple ticket anyway look at this revenant skin i'm getting straight on i've got a soft spot for playing revenant i don't know why i just love crawling about the place like a like a like a crap like a crab on on speed just traversing the map one last apex pack i'm not sure if this is going to be the corsetic alien one it isn't it's after this one this is the last event item is this for who is that is that rampant oh and play rampart i don't like the skin i would throw it on but i don't think it's as good as my lambda one all right oh here we go it opens it up automatically for you don't even get to choose triple heirloom coming out there's the caustic intro quick there's the corsica melee weapon skin and here we have the banner pose as well so i look forward to getting my hands on you i need to sort out my uh my quick wheels i don't have enough grip wheels i'm going to start there with caustic do you reckon i should equip this the caustic airloom dragon yeah yeah go on then i'll throw it on there let's give it a go and here is the banner pose he's that actually that actually saw her inside no not no i love how just puts one of these oh and then and then he can the noxious gas comes out of it as well the the thing is with apex is that they always have like hidden animation there you go having a cup of tea out of my chemistry mug i literally i literally can't escape i'm gonna have to end the video here because i'm i'm trapped i'm afraid no here we go we're out anyway that's my caustic heirloom unlock i'm going to be playing some caustic today i'm going to try and whack someone over the head with his deathhammer and we're going to see how it goes thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one bye
