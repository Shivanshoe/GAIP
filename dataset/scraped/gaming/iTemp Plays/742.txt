a visa closet which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more ATX legends of course and our teammate for today's video was only level 37 but this fight was a beast he's a monster he was rushing people with his course he called he was clean up fights oh well actually solid duo because I was playing but home so it gave me a good way to still see people in my teammates noxious gas and I look playing random duo's on any game I used to do this on fortnight's when there was even like a solo sometimes I'm just going to random Joe's just to see always gonna play with you know to get all kinds of teammate some are pretty clueless it's unavoidable but every now and again you get someone like this caustic who is just a machine so thank your watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in five nights seconds my friends alright artillery T's my friends and it appears though no one is contesting this truck I don't have that's a good thing gone up I want a little bit of fighting at the start is always nice but the good news these yep I can indeed hear shots a diving board and I'll tell you what I want to go and kill him anyone ad on board I'm gonna kill I'm gonna go test the area I'm gonna wipe off the face of the game because I just can't stand it I've just constantly which has been very apparent video it's just easy why is it on the map listen don't get me started on diving board I'm feeling this I'm feeling positive positive thoughts I've got a decent man of good loo here I've got a wingman onyx no way your son here how do they get here without me seen nice teammate you're weak though I'm coming over and you are me switch well I've got a big scam not sure how much is he's gonna do hey he's down low but he's up top he's up top nice to me that's right 1 V 2 from this guy assist elimination by the way I can't believe that I didn't get kill credit for that that was all me with that my big scam I don't think we went that I think we just get I think that by closed open else is to be won but fortunately scammers there you can have killed credit it's ok because I am a guest from ready to go to diving board if you want to come with you can feel free I mean it sounds like the fighters finger finished for a little while but half of that sticking around to lose a little bit where you go this is why you live along the way alright let's go coming to us it's caustic great cigar so if that didn't work I would have just defended down low to make sure anymore enough I'm we were to descent Holocaust akin that's the one thing but about Korsak is that he's countered by Twitter Korsak is pretty weird and to be fair I'm saying just the right character so one cancer or the caustics and to complement my own caustic you know I can scan I can ulti I'm hoping at least once in this game we get to do the old caustic and listen no more bamboos us as well I'm not getting bamboozled ever ever again I'm never shooting a decoy I'm making sure told you I mean I'll shut that one behind because it was in the way get back in told you know all bamboozles that blue extended heavy let's go is looking for a wingman I need literally nearly died there just because I jump down jumping down and then your your aim just goes like a does like this long think we have to wait like a full second to actually shoot someone but when they're that week you might as well and your teammates name like how much of a risk I've got Scorpius it early on so that means I already can't drop the wingman I'm playing terribly so far today I'm so indifferent actually my sorta scary anyone here I have some life here I guess I dropped this this many I just tried use them in my lobby that's not what I want to do okay don't use well they were firing send one near bunker and even though she's really loud you got a 30% speed boost which is outrageous when you think about a 30% pretty Benham find it at reversing it map of the moans french knockout that's innate form enough I mean meeting don't get involved I'm sort of lambda coming over the hill like this over there just too distracted to whoa you got far away does this ultima increase footstep noises or something that's one way to avoid like that thing I submit no I don't one that I know we meant hold on you know one times back perfect that's one way to avoid that all I think that I was talk about when you fall down and you can't aim if you just shoot them in the air like that then you're good to go suspects on the old accuracy to be honest but it worked out I guess so yeah I need ten damaged fence give you a second team I'll get something come over like this three one sec no I've got a scan hold on make sure it's no Pisa cars trying to land a second headshot I mean I mean landing 2 headshots there is incredible with the with the obstacle piercer what was one of them like 90 down Janine was 79 I think she's fine by me Timmy you can say that because switching Evo shields now not now it's always been like this I always switch my evo chill for another purple and they're never as close to me as getting raped so I fathered please please retreat teammate there's another team here I was this infernal he's kind of rained out okay this anime had been stuck but I didn't get bamboozled who's the real winner your life easy wing nice job teammate here he went for the rain dance tactic did you see this guy I don't know I'm crazy and ran in circles you just have to listen for footsteps that's all you have to do is simple as soon as you hear them put an egg grenade they're not gonna be a manic reveille to the side you know they're the ones aiming at you you just got to think about it for a second no I told you no more bamboozles I'm not falling for another one ever on this game I refuse I'm gonna talk about that I wanna talk about it all right 9 kill but that was this happened we've absolutely dominated River Center here I'd one kill coming to this area is quite timid I hear someone firing a dying boy and I'll tell you what I'm a few minute he's turned around nice way I can wait I'm not gonna go too crazy when you don't have an escape finding to them is inadvisable there's one yes let's go friend so lemonade for head this is what this is what I do miss about path wanted to be fair you can just play like a lunatic and you have a get-out-of-jail-free card in the form of your grapple ability but 35 seconds I didn't want to think like that 35 seconds this makes me sad but this guy was running for more towards the right here and this is also where the safe zone is taking us so potentially we will cross paths potentially hopefully possibly not you know what thinking about they probably just come back the diving board and probably set up there we've I've know yeah this is use a bodyguard there oh who's this guy nice well this is my chance this is your to my ability this is the ultimate combo I'm getting there French I'm Tracy this is what I mean about dropping down on paper grief text someone test edit your shot and if you're using an island tonight we're gonna have bullets my stock - you may not sure it's worth - limits but hey you know we won our Altima son have the longest hormone of all time I think audio 2% and so extended all right tell you people are diving board ups accompli follow the footsteps are in pollutant Dalton I just think they're so much closer than they are just get used to that even still fine I want to go over there punish them for it but pushing diving board is why I'm hating is because it's horrendous I mean foreign a good game here we could just wait for them to push us I mean there are five with us quite a me go oops I don't know what's happened to me I feel like I was playing good earlier earlier in the game a place I've been playing for 40 minutes I think my murse may tell so far this game recession who's been to well now it's 10 miles playing good once being the operative word Joe I'm Tara black you know I need to I need to play in accordance to what I'm good at and what I'm not good at I am bad when people are like touching distance I don't know what I'm doing my aim goes everywhere I can't send in my shot I panic be fed I don't know let's say any closer than four meters I would say I struggle so I need to just keep them at that distance and then I can learn most my shots that's my real issue and that's when that's when things get ugly ugly too when they're too close to squads left we know one of them Bosley diving board and when it's like this one to try and stays close to one of the teams as fast walk without them knowing you're there that's the secret to the final three squats if you track them if you know they are don't engage don't make yourself known and just wait for them to get involved with the other team it's a free week if you're getting patient you can always just try and beam them but you know oh wait you can't go this way around mine I'm getting lost on this new map you have to go all the way up here it's not even this look I've never played them up before way so which way did they go 50 seconds 5351 jump down then the track stop John am I the worst track in the world and what well we know that people were here in like a minute ago but apart from that I've got no info for you I'm afraid caustic I'm just a terrible tracker I don't really play pretend too much I mean there's Sheila's unfortunately so you we can try and poke them and then kind of mind you going in I like it he's got his ulti I'm coming in I don't want to use my animation apps that have their beans my friends that last legs for jobs I'd have used my ultimate bear for the combo but I didn't want to use after not the animations or text on and when you've got a digital threat it's not always a necessity by one spot left I just noticed have a massive scribe they could be pushing this is the time will you take your children a little bit because there is a chance that they would decently far away and it will take them a long while to get here look syringe you know syringe oh you go might as well this team doesn't look like penis sometimes you just to get out of here I guess why do packs - keep falling from treason hey what's going on did you miss you gotta say it didn't mrs. crack what he did but he didn't actually connect to anything I thought he's gonna be on a 35 second call down there that's the second Pathfinder those just fallen into my into my aim they're in this game shout that the teammate that got was going crazy in a second after that means it was all meat the first half we had him in the first half and then my teammate all of a sudden with the resurgence 1,700 damage paint girls he was that level 37 or something I think well legend our team cohesion there was on points you know we're always together our ultimate gelled well together as well it's always nice having a caustic on your team because he's I won't say overpowered he's just annoying isn't it caustic he's just he's a nuisance caustic he's but he's when he's on your team you fall a little bit better about seen in the building he can just like cut it off completely anyway I'm t-shirt chattering thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
