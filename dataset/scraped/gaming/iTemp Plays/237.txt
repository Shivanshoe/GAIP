hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing ash who i have played for maybe three hours so far today and i am having so much fun playing her i love her entire kit from her passive which makes finding your next gunfight easier to your ability locking down your next kill and her ultimate which is so good for repositioning and that is what ash is so good at you'll experience it yourself when you play when you get third party buying ash they just teleport their entire team to high ground instantly and they're looking down at you they've got the best positioning and it's actually kind of difficult to win that next gun fight when they just have the high ground next to you so quickly i hope you guys are enjoying these season 11 videos i have so many more to come so make sure you subscribe to the channel so you do not miss them thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends here i'm landing at this building because all these other buildings kind of suck okay i'm detouring over to you steal all your loot drop into the 3k game someone else is land up top i'll

family at prowlers mates good there's more i'm i'm kind of occupied i'll be honest wait are you actually going to die if i don't i'm honestly queen eye to arms which against a family of prowess i've never seen anything like it there's a triple take in there too that was scary man yeah they like did you shoot them or did they did they no they shot them i think cause i didn't shoot them yeah they weren't full aggro on me they didn't even care about the yeah oh the probably dropped a purple light mag good call nice good call sees everything it's crazy yeah chat's good i would have never seen that apart from the guy that called me old you know that guy not so good but the rest of them uh what was his name ola nah he's a good guy what's his name i'm gonna i'll be up here oh no what do you think i was in about him no no no no no no oh he's getting vip and a gift of tier three have you been in here there's there's like uh there's like ten spider nests in here that's crazy um this is the boss fight going on i'm honestly i'm too scared after my no no no no running with the life on this map i've been playing a lot of pve i'm trying to practice you need it i'm coming down actually are you leaving i only want light ammo so 30 people left oh oh oh big scrap you hear it i do are you actually did you did you scan it what happened uh no living attackers ah sadly uh this guy died 13 seconds ago up here i can alt up there don't let them i'm gonna hold up there he dropped down to the right somewhere lots of people healing oh did you yeah oh yeah that's great i uh i'm doing a car thing right now okay i'll i'll take it i'm gonna wait a few of these gravity lifts i'm scared you say you're scared to take the gravity lift yep i don't want to throw a game away there's people fighting back where we were like over here yeah like literally right where we were well they have to come to us anyway i'll come to you the zone's coming in this guy right here two people i'm coming i can't navigate this thought might snow my bullets mate they were not moving they must have watched me walk and they were in this crevice like this they're just chilling vibing out are they why are they killing back there yes uh yeah they were like east they might take that oh they valcosted i see him i can't bring it east just near this location i'm gonna fly over my heads aren't they yes they are my did you shoot that target oh come on man not this again sorry straight i shot him straight he's chasing you though he's aggroing he doesn't like you there's something about you i killed all these friends earlier in the game i got about 50 prouder kills this game this way stop running i just need to hit one shot dude this recoil is going to take a while to get used to it's not the easiest it's very oh my god please you're good are you still getting attacked by these things they hate me deserved 100 dessert they're kind of zooming their movements kind of kind of sick can't lie yeah deserves are they all the way at the top yeah that's crazy they both have triple things dude yeah they don't know i'm here because i'm a slightly lower angle i'm already right here so they know i might all by the way join some alt on top of that i can go here uh come here she came up with a a noise guys this high ground is kind of crazy it's wild i didn't know i thought this would be okay so pathfinder found ash in the trash so i i discovered you in the trash that's what that's what this is all about yes correct actually kind of accurate but you're kind of accurate to how we met yeah kind of it's kind of creepy that's yeah that is weird do you reckon they're based on this like how do they know that and now we're playing in this way as well that's kind of weird yeah yeah uh hi all right i'm going down already i'm going down hopefully not okay in that way but here we go is it i don't know no one's fighting what's going on here no one landed here the first time ever i hear people though i don't i have music playing so i can't really hear anything i think they're safe i'll follow you that's a bad idea you've honestly still got more of a chance surely you can take the title from them you're lucky i'm a good guy and i didn't take that nice guy i've cracked at this angle because it's like gray i don't know i couldn't really see properly i couldn't see what i was aiming at just me oh no i don't know it sounds like some excuses it's kind of an excuse uh i have four bats okay i have two i'm fine i'm repairing myself someone's gonna respawn i hate that noise so much what is it i don't know or maybe it's the gravy's leafed maybe someone took the gravity lift there i don't know ah i thought that last game but no one was taking it when i was making the house people died over this way it was this close place they died i could probably scan them but i assume they're over here i hear nothing i'm gonna die another team i'm dead maybe inside both cracks inside though done one oh nice these guys cracked about we're close to the ring we have one i can't i'll give it to you that was smart thank you nice gotta hear someone else yes i just put that bat on come on saucy 10 seconds until the ring closes that's a take talk right there if you even knew how to use a stick just get any beacons don't worry about it charge i'm charging you know platinum painting or peanut i can't even tell you how much everybody goes wait this is two teams all right oh my god i'm so bad how is it possible there's so many uh pushes i can't see through them is it possible to be this bad trying to easy because i was focused i've got another excuse lined up if you're interested let me know if you're not interested in it oh sure it's because i was lining up i was um more focused on changing the zoomage on my uh variable scope okay yeah okay the only reason i'm letting that slide is because he said zoomage and i like that yeah thank you i like it a lot thanks mate i haven't been to the side of the map yet oh don't fall down oh mate that's actually scary oh god seriously don't even look down i'm not i'm not it's just an abyss imagine falling down there imagine okay this isn't gonna take us that far this is taking us nowhere there's it's taking us right back to where we literally just were this is the worst decision you've ever made we should have went to the right it went far further downwards why am i following you for only reason we're even in this position is because we followed you well i'm gonna die i have three syringes can you heal while you're honestly probably oh you can't that's pretty cool proper bats hop on one of these yep well there should be a double jump mechanic off there i agree i am not gonna be there with you amigo oh a lot of people died down here like four people let me think it for you it was a minute ago though okay yeah i think they're over here somewhere yeah they're here i'm gonna alter the top and then we know i'm dead they didn't see you but they see me yeah it's unfortunate can you uh yeah yeah i'm good i think they're on top now they dropped going up my all didn't work past one this is the worst movie you've ever seen guitar i traded uh with one of them nice mate that's the worst movement you've ever seen i messed my alt up to mess the paddle i can't i'm sliding so what's happening hello i was drifting away it's like drifting i'm getting better if you could tap chief what's this guy got you're actually you're using you're going to use your hole right here i just got it i just got bone arrow by the way we are already inside the ring there's a g7 i don't want it i've got one viewer do you you have a g7 yes okay he shots this way up here yeah what was that uh i don't know where the bone arrow is they're probably south there or something in the distance yeah i was right if they can hear a shot fair play i'll i'm just going to run a straight line give him a chance oh this was a big e i find some fun on this map there's so many like hills 36 yeah path one is great on this map uh probably uh flight flight i can't do it like it's wide live why am i using this gun me too what did she sell phrase oh no she got life like oh this way eliminate the enemy i don't know where i don't see him that's where he came from hundred percent they're there no i saw it now this i have limited juice oh it's the uh there's a bow and arrow team that's left this gun is the worst it's born our team and then one of the team no it's not dude it's probably just been staring at us guys it's gonna freak me out a little bit staring us down oh you just did that oh my god that's actually so mean wait i only had 20 bullets now got 17 no no what did they have in there i feel like everyone's got a care package good giving my shields yeah the only one that i'm scared of is the alternator no no i speed fire nope spitfire is not scary at all is it yes it is oh it's not yes it is the only people that use that gun are boomers i'll use it by point b okay i've got nobody's left on come on for so long all right i've got no but it's my g7 it's just a sad sad day are you doing a g17 no i've already done that okay but i just like the g7 it's good good there not really i'm gonna go get this crater please don't use with your tee slash your your ability or any of the other things that you can utilize to steal this care package from me someone said oh you actually slept around that's the wrong gun i didn't want to drop that all right you better do something with that oh yeah you know because she just literally jumped over here she jumped over it okay there's nothing i could have done i couldn't no no no no no it sounded like a vault it was a fully autocrat don't understand she jumped over it was too embarrassing i had to i had to end up that's right what a waste of a kill no no get your ass game uh no unfortunately not unfortunate we need to go again mate
