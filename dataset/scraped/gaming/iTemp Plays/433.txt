hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and so far and i split ways to fight different teams at the end of one of the games that i have for you today and it felt like i was in a kill race again also i've realized that i've been using the r99 more and more recently and i think it's because it's such a good gun when i do use it i have a higher chance of having a good game therefore there's a higher chance of it being on the channel so i have a question for you guys what is your favorite gun on apex that you don't see me using in my videos that often i use the r301 the flatline the scope the r9 the vault the wingman and the mastiff a whole lot but i feel like i should try and use snipers more often maybe i need to become the triple tape man for a while maybe that's the solution let me know what you guys think and i'll do my best to incorporate more gun variety as soon as i can because i have turned into a season zero gamer recently so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i love him i think he's like he's he i appreciate what he's like he's taken advantage of uh like his strengths and really tapped into them and just yeah he has he's doing crazy i think he's has one of the one of the if not the biggest uh war zone channels right in the world i think there's a team here maybe not i have massive online so i hope there is one yes [Music] to have a chill drop and then we land here yes any line mags that aren't in use that's the two attachments i really wanted um wait is there a shotgun in here there's an ebay no i don't want that you need a shotgun ball um no i picked up a fly line that's fine level three oh you definitely did so i was just wondering if you knew that i wanted to appear like a good guy well well well i would like him out i'm gonna drop it off my master but i probably i'll probably die so i mean that's fine with me okay if you're rocking okay you know i'm rocking it if you rocked a shotgun i'd drop it but no have you dropped it why haven't you dropped it ridge i'm hello and therefore i deserve the superior attachments hello i mean no one's even done the gold you just passed like 14 i don't want to blue i'm doing my own oh my god i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead first damage i thought you were shooting this one that was the last one i'm not taking your kills see that's 200. i appreciate that you knew you could get more damage [Music] and i knew that fight was going to be really drawn out so i was like let me just go shoot this guy on the ground i mean we're not using the knockdown shielders cover yeah it was it was a raid 2 wasn't it bangalore i think maybe i don't know maybe it was the wraith they've got so many skins now do you not like the gold through one what's the deal i have an online master's i'm fine still i know i probably should have taken it i'm probably going to get pounded you want it i mean i'll give it to you i use it so much oh okay well bye don't tell us oh there's someone on me seriously [Music] that's right you did so are you having a giggle this dude's a maniac with a sniper they didn't even wait five seconds oh do you have any bats i've not met pretty much these guys i am i am i have a total of 100. oh what happened boys i used it in that fight for like a total of like a six-foot grapple yes i didn't see it so i was thinking i don't know where that went if i was because i grappled towards them and then when you called it they were cracked i just used my zipline to get up top you know okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah all these guys are going in i caused practice oh really that really i don't know how long you know nine house that was the last one very awesome they're on your head is that true it's it's very possible it's very impossible i have eight battery knows i think we both turned away at the same time was everywhere it wasn't my fault see well their fault all right there you go i am repairing myself i don't know where they could have gone um yes oh on me too good luck when you're one's rich this isn't even a one this is a two i just laid myself on fire i let myself on fire team is having the best time there's a team in here these are the last two teams though these guys are sat in the building yeah look at us we're actual kill grinders trying to set world records out here splitting up crazy it's like we're in a kill race on war zone you have to split the end because you're five kills down you know i mean uh if that was a kill race then i lost because i was just fought a team of two that was just hiding in corners for in a building yeah see i did that as well oh mate kind of kind of even it's so bad it's the worst map to ever exist in the history of video gaming oh that's a little overboard i'm sorry i take it back to me no no no no no no no no i don't have a shield i still don't have a shoe that's crazy there are so many vaults up here i've there are so many energy bullets now i don't know what changed i'm just trying to vote what are these is distant okay they're gone oh no one's flash i don't want this team why did they fly away from this team that was true they're struggling tomorrow they yeah i mean that's the only possibility extended heavy bag here um there's a mobile race oh you got bamboos on me on purpose on purpose once they know we're here and then i'm gonna have to run as far yeah it's smart actually yep where could you possibly been i don't know i'm controlling a decoy from like a mile away oh yeah i see them over here they look small eyes of an eagle i eyes are more rat oh this dude's on my head this octane's above me no he's foul he's  not broken side of opie bridge someone traveled through here i mean you know that's where it always comes and so it always starts gravitate towards other places i'm zooming i wish there was an energy mag there two people in here on my way that's one [Music] so fast last person ever exists i think there's a team on me i'm coming back i ran kind of far i saw shots up top i don't know if they were decorative yeah the smoke here you can shot no there's a smoke here and i saw shots over here before they smoked the care package took it and run i mean you're the trucker girl oh i'm going i'm stuck in the water this is horrendous i'm so slow i'm almost there oh i don't know what i need thanks for the help no problem i was struggling one's in here nice good ears oh my god no oh they're all here oh that's another team diving on your head there it's almost down the hill yeah yeah i'm not trying to make him your hands need cracks almost there she's cracked shots fired not with you oh they're resting on the other side of this oh who's the host on here oh they're on me you just wipe it out not with you [Applause] oh just warming up oh gold energy thank you i've had to make the whole game i scanned like southwest and it said hostile detected but they were north east i have no idea how that caught them maybe maybe they were like all the way down low and they count the rope i don't know we're getting buffed a little invitation i think wait there's someone on me there's something okay wait how do i know that i've got this dream within a dream i think this place needs a little more [Laughter] they it's happening again eyebrow punch oh no no dude dude you can punch as well i'm just gonna i'm just gonna do uh mirage stuff okay no don't tell me good there's no way it's a bangler oh she's a running over here she's still running she's inside i'm gonna try and get her up oh there's two of them nice yes i was about to go down nice that's fun grape is so fun i can't believe i never speak it up i feel like i missed out on two years worth of credibility i just i feel like it doesn't fit my settings very well so i just kind of stay away from it yeah well i may have taken a few of those kills
