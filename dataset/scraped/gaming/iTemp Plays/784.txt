I was the guys eat which welcome back to new the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back on revelant I wasn't lying when I said that I was really and joined playing the new buffed revenant character here on apex legends and I made a mistake in yesterday's video I said that his silence wasn't incredibly useful against people that weren't Pathfinder Wraith or Gibraltar because you have to start firing to use it turns out that's completely not true and you can use your gun you can even a VX whilst using the ability I'd absolutely no idea but today we drop into score time which is all my favorite areas to use revenant as I said in yesterday's video and I've been having a ton of fun so hopefully enjoy today's video if you do be sure to leave a like rating RC war is five more seconds my friends school town Indies my friends it's been a little while since I landed here and actually won a game but since they've been crazy them loose on Kings Canyon it hasn't really been much of an issue to find a gun please find a weapon there we go having said that I did struggle last game too and there's people over this way it's got my flatline I messed up so once it the four hands flatline on i-29 and I could put the bloob extended on mile 99 but unfortunately I left the year spent a fortune I left behind it's a flatline and I got beaten up inside kidding me when my own gonna do Buffy he's but nice he's definitely but good work friend all right but it's actually looking pretty good the only thing I'm struggling on body shields but I'm also struggling on I'm always well a little bit see myself come this way French I'll chop with some syringes good grief I've got a lot of throw balls here almost too many you could target my spikes for the links hello friends you couldn't it couldn't even get out of that cuz he was honest oh my way destroyed I thought you were gonna be up top for her the grapple no point taking this after my tip cuz my tail is a topical party come over this way why some Hill this one's free spawning in score 10 - that's the team out with a shame I don't think they'd want to fight the Romans before I kill you myself yep you're wonderful thank you some syringes for you we can eat them Blue Shield's too nice I scrappy let's go over there never mind up top this is terrible me shield top only put false info here sorry feint accidentally used you as bait bear apologize big birthday we've got them off the high ground for med kits I'll give some to my teammate I'm AIDS I'll give him two because I'll have to use one that one's very strong any ammo for you boy HB 0 I'm stroking on light as well this is this is the opposite of tremendous her own horrendous is that why they rhyme because they're opposites potentially sure could be the case no so I'll start here at score 10 no although I'm gonna be struggling and please have some decent alright 40 bullet isn't too bad I can work with this yeah it's not that Lisa my buddy to have ever seen I should be able to take a team out and if I take a teammate so I'll be able to get more ammo look someone's walking on metal metal so far away I don't actually know if it would have been this far above the guaranteed at least one of these people haven't absolutely nothing from spawn I have 19 shield cells it sounded like someone open the door this way I chose right I chose the guy that got respawned I don't know why I use my alter not one person definitely could have just overpowered in their shield cells are literally half my venturing moments way too many especially now I've got a few shield batteries it is annoying that you can't heal in the alternative because if we were getting third party there I won't be able to heal up in time for them to come over or before they come over how do I have seven kills I feel like I haven't really done too much here I've got loads friends thank you go why can we get the hair can forget it [Music] should have checked there for a bit of purple armor I think I was too late anyway I've been up I've been stomped on like that before it's not worthy if you're not there as soon as he's picking his left foot up what I say little it's absolutely gianormous then it's not worthy just I remember once a game ended because someone got stomped on like that all right charge rifleman big machine man will run shots they travel so slowly nothing just try and bait the mink to try and push us a little bit cuz going across there against the Tweed machine is I mean oh they're scrappy hopefully it's an ongoing kind of scrap when we can get there in time if they just merge this team then we may as well turn it back around that's the kidney belongs to me know that it's already here can I just say that team cross the way oh I have a doing machine and a triple tape it's like they're trying to get in my head it's like that they purposely orchestrated this this lot of combination chopper ten man do eet Machine Man there's no way I'm pushing that I'm just scared that this guy's teammates gonna I think I began shot at surely take that idiot this is pointless this is so pointless and we could easily get third party and gate kept at the edge of this storm how much should go we came back for a kill it wasn't the worst we've got a little bit of a reward but these guys will have to push us eventually well just go and find other people six squads and twelve people left so every duo still has two people that's in the sky I was trying to see where the edge of the I wanted to know if there to get the low ground there or they could stay across the log Canyon and still fios they might have to push I have no idea I just don't have to sit and wait for it alright scouting mission soon as there are absolutely zero solar players the moments I reckon we should try and stuff I see someone or don't get this get a picture of the added benefit here of mainly bringing some other people over I've no clothes gonna be inside don't shield perhaps a mastiff or take a mastiff I mean use money forever Oh evil shields no I said up do it I said I'll do it it's a bit of a risk at this part of the game because everyone's gonna have at least Blue Shield's most people I would expect to have purple I know whether need 12 people left not not me my teammate we're struggling but most people definitely would always have to trumpet down some like cook damage I guess are you office labor I would it makes sense but I'm terrible Craver that's the only issue sometimes you've got to know your own limitations it will be good with Eva she'll burn a hum terrible with a crater I'm not doing it it's too much of a risk friends it's too much right God shield I would who level level one Evo shields I can't even I missed I've seen ice cut off because the approximate there you go beautiful purple shields name that works hey 240 damage intolerant I mean Iran shields are the new standards if I don't find any those shields of a start the game I'm gonna song kind of set name because they are it's too good way too easy to get the purple shirt in my opinion I have so many bullets it's unbelievable people are firing this way well just trying get involved again how do I have 10 kills I feel like this game has been filled to the love nothing is that it's that not been like on mind you we did started Scotty I don't know what the gunfights haven't gone for too long then he's put a bit of Health on here there you go take the jab time to heal because with third party I'll just chill up top we got away there would start screaming this guy's go right don't that's essentially red I didn't have a look at how much how much damage I need to do family troubles no throw balls I have so many the balls so much ammo no throw balls I can't even bother to go down there throw balls no okay yeah I literally think it must be about 30 damage on those purple astern ain't a red I've done that hang what two gunfights one of them wasn't even a gunfight I find it some armorless people in a third party oh yeah yes you what are we hoping for here don't shields won't be amiss you know I definitely still think gold is bendin right it's just it's so much more consistent range but you can't even hold it to give I have to drop my yeah just take it I can drive it are you good thank you friend you should still be able to hold square to switch them because Gold's been and then red in my opinion all right I say we just chill here we go do this have you said your goodbyes here we go chill French doll him don't let him know we got the low ground teammates that it's like you there we go my bullets I'm the worst player on this game let me solve it one bullet then and I miss my science too Oh one sec I think it's literally one person good news is Martina has got chill so I've got a Phoenix keyboard the gun free charge no one's on the house sorry kind of saw anything before I do anything else Oh a little dip to read at the end I mean we would've bucked him anyway that does make any sense the exact end of the game does it because I'm literally just killed everyone I don't I don't think I think that was 16 kills right I don't think I did more than 3000 there's no way 16 look to 9,000 damage I tell you it was because it's Joe's people don't get revived as often the gunfights are often a lot shorter you just have to down one of them and then it's a 2v1 it's like whoever downed someone first wins the gunfight I think that's why the damage numbers are a bit lower but the kill no mr. Dabney up there plus it looks like I got very much assisted by my teammate who definitely deserved more than two kills for Nene 900 damage that pretty explains it'll be more - I'm looking revenant over yeah the silence is tremendous especially since she can do whilst firing at people that pathfinder in school tone couldn't do anything you could go no way thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one mmm
