hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing with kobe whose link will be in the description if you are looking for some more apex legends season 6 content i highly recommend his channel go and check him out we have a few things to go over in this intro so first of all we found the r99 we did it it is now a care package weapon after being one of the strongest guns in the game since day one and because it's now a care package weapon it's also been buffed the r99 buffed an increase of power it's unbelievable the damage has been increased from 11 to 12 which doesn't sound like a huge change but that's actually a 9 damage increase on one of the strongest guns in the game and you've also got to remember that this weapon is strong because of its fire rate so every single one of those bullets that is pumping out per second is dealing 9 more damage and it also now has a 32 round magazine size which allows you to be firing those increased damage shots for longer bit of a disclaimer here i only get two kills the r99 but we almost used up all of the ammo and it's very difficult to find this gun as it seems to be in the late game care packages because it is so strong but we do get a sneak peek into how good this gun actually is and the second thing i need to address here is that uh my mic sometimes makes me sound like a demon which may sound random but let me explain in the game they're about to watch for the entire thing i sounded like an aforementioned demon and kobe somehow didn't realize this i'm pretty sure he was just trying to be polite by not picking me up on my on my weird microphone settings but i was cracking up listening to it back so this intros of course with my normal microphone settings and this is how i sounded in the gameplay you're about to watch at least enough to hear that often because a half the time it's silent so so yeah i hope you don't mind too much i hope you find it funny and hopefully my microphone doesn't do that again to me anytime soon so yes thank you for watching i do appreciate it if you uh would like to subscribe i would appreciate it as well because we are getting extremely close to one million subs which is ludicrous but yeah thanks for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wanna play like algs and stuff yeah for themselves definitely yeah because you don't see like when you think of like a casual gamer on the console you think of like going to your friend's house and like you guys are just taking turns playing apex on you know his tv in his living room yeah or something there is none of that on pc oh no absolutely not you're not gonna sit on your friend's lap and be like all right let's take turns brother uh i just killed someone because i'm landing on beaver turbo okay the okay i think i met good for you maybe we'll [Music] a sticky situation thank you yes sir i see the landing on a turbo charger diva i know and the fact that two people two of the teams that pulled up on us also had also a diva on a crazy bloodhound got pooped on over here he just instantly turned on me okay yeah i should have been at that bloodhound yeah yeah okay yeah gonna fight often i want to help and they'll just like like i that's what that's how the rampart just ended up dying she was trying to bat unfortunately i caught her uh caught her trying to bat i just didn't work for give me the volt give me the volt i'm just gonna go here yeah it's it's a scary gun a very very scary gun i'm saying no more people are coming i don't know i think they're coming from uh west oh yeah oh one crack okay basically cracked oh he's getting hit from to the right as well big guard crack the other one all right this next team's coming up yes it is nice got him another team could be coming nice i'm gonna take this dude's energy oh yeah none of this dude did okay where did this team go to oh they set a port to get out oh jane for you oh both of them are healing okay i'm gonna make a little little bit of a play here getting eight on the door i'm gonna go under and then come from the top what's going on this entire game i've just used um i have six and two bats if you're interested uh i have one bat so you can keep that just just any shield cells does this guy have that cute yeah yeah i do as well i have the fully kitted fowler select and then the the volt oh my word wait did i say two smg's or energies you did all right i have 10 mgs diva speak fire select fire that's nice thank you um got a purple energy mag i'm sure you already have one but i'm roping over that me too i don't know how i'm here for you but oh he's right here okay let's see if i can calm mid-air i missed every bullet how are you doing me too i'm trying to run who's flying was hard it was hard okay they're in this building here i go outside that way almost cracked pathfinder these guys are fleeing oh yeah they want nothing to do they heard the volt and they're like i'm off yeah they didn't buy one yet they're running into oh are weak one dead i'm popping her back well she's weak you can change if you need to i'm gonna challenge guys i'm gonna pop a battery [Music] oh hey this is good that was another one of those situations where i did not push your back up and a little bit i wasn't waiting it was just such an awkward angle i was in the same boat as you but once i hit that damage i was like okay we kind of gotta get in there he's gonna move um i'm fighting over by a harvest over here okay i spent three hours losing my confidence you're good um okay we got two three people over here i believe you sweated one of them i love the wall hats coming in hot okay yeah they're actually in the storm next to you a week oh yes absolutely no place in one of that good fight against pathfinder oh yeah he was bright on that rock and i had no energy for that i i was so far behind in the fight anything exceeds it what's your uh your energy ammo looking like right i have 164 it's pretty good if i could take like 30 from you 20 yeah thank you we just gotta adapt to the vault now that's just the life we live in oh the diva that too but i i don't know i've had some uh some ptsd from the devo in the in the past five seasons so yeah you don't even want to hear it i don't know i don't pick it up in care packs i don't touch it i don't look at it i don't even wanna i don't even wanna imagine it at least enough to hear that often because half the time is silent so that is true that issue i heard it comes with a suppressor attachment yeah i mean i have seven i'm not kill later so it's been a pretty good game i got nine so we're pretty we're pretty even it's not a bad game it's an okay game i really want to start using that hemlock though i need to start finding one and picking it up yeah okay all right let's see here i feel like we might have a challenger over in this little area oh you're all able to do something yeah they do like to sit in those new locations i don't know if you saw a game at the end of my stream yesterday i know it's halfway i don't think you might have missed it we went in there and they had two turrets and they had so many show thingies from rampart and they also had watson fences and they just kept running off and setting up again it was actually kind of funny i ran into one of those last night and i i lost my mind when you're streaming i think it's different because the content is still there like it's it's funny content but anyway trying to record it's slightly different because you've got to think how do you make this into content that people so like it's a different kind of vibe yeah if i've learned anything from streaming is like you go in like before you hit start or go live or whatever you have a couple ideas so like as of right now like i'm taking a hemlock uh i want to get 110 for the battle pass for the 110 skin yeah you have those ideas and then like they naturally just come into the stream like you you'll land on a hemlock one game and pop off with it and then you're like okay well that's the video yeah yeah i know you mean you got a focus yep i get distracted a lot let's see if young rich gets the r9 ooh coming down anyone say we've got a watercolor good the last team it's time brother rich it's time that one crank cue music turn on the drums turn it on it's over hold on by yourself for a sec i don't know if i can make it through this so i think we'll speak for a second they ran they heard the turbo charger they didn't want it they're like back up back up they went to the right now hey buddy i was just unlucky for him where was his friend with the bank she ran ran right out man nice can you put down the little hollow do a finisher my friends pop wait what oh this noise buddy i'm oh you actually picked it up from the care pack oh yeah oh that's beautiful let's go what a combo the annoying turbocharged devotional what is this pre-season oh man three more months yes sir i mean i was a lifeline maine you know what i'm saying we get those lifeline residents
