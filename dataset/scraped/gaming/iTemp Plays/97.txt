okay we are here today to take a look at my first ever solo game on apex when i say solo here i don't mean when you solo queue with the no fill option on i mean back when apex had a solos only mode available for a short amount of time and this is my first ever game from the 13th of august 2019 two and a half years ago all right no prizes for getting my which shut the best teammates forgot to do these reacting videos i can't speak over myself look how many legends there are in this game there's there's like there's like three legends available to choose from and of course i went for pathfinder i was a pathfinder man at this time so that's me works that's my selection i didn't have the 4k badge yet but i did get the 20 bomb in my first ever game on pathfinder and if you don't remember it actually put me at number one in the world for pathfinder kills per game because i had one game i think it was 21 or 22 kills i was number one until the hackers came it was unbelievable look at king's canyon i forgot it had those big diplodocuses on them what they're called i don't know they've got the guys are the big hey be quiet it had those big dipper ducklesses and this is actually one of my favorite drops still to this day 60 players in the first game we've landed at conroy what this place is called containments i believe the longbow is a heavy weapon and you don't spawn in with armor that was one of the best changes that apex ever had is when they dropped you into the game with armor already equipped and one of the other best updates is when they made it evo armor so you get rewarded for killing people at the start you kill one person you get blue armor it's it's a fair trade but this beautiful have a bow basking as well spawning with the turbo havoc i mean that guy's just absolutely good to shoot someone and have them die you know i'd rather just go down on the ground i know what you mean you just get that instant kill critic alternated disruptive alternator with disrupter rounds here turbo hat okay i've got a turbo havoc i got two turbos i got multiple turbos and i've got a disrupt around alternator no wonder i won this game like these guys may as well have just quit from the from the get-go you know absolutely pointless even plain i don't i want to scrap them right now i'm gonna be honest with you select fire absolutely not who do you think i am is the response going to give you to that one do i look like some kind of dweeb is uh it's my [Music] the ring responses all right 40 people i don't do i i don't think so maybe maybe okay slum legs if this poi was right here instead near this big diplodocus it would have been the most popular poi of all time i actually do miss the layout of slim lakes it's just so far in the corner that no one wants to land there because you clear up you get a kill or two and there's nothing nearby wait containment looks so far north because this this area is where like the new pois it goes further north so this is more central nowadays there's gonna be a lot of people uh alternator or r99 that's just so tricky that's not a tricky choice you've got disrupt around you absolutely want to kill this guy while he's looting this is what's nice about solos you can you can become tom clancy oh guys got absolutely zero zero i literally just killed communism don't worry guys it's over tell that karl marx you idiot during when they took out the extended energy mags for seemingly no reason they took out the extended energy mags and they buffed the default amount of bullets you got in the havoc and for a while if you found a havoc it was pretty much like finding a gold gun because you can't put a barrel stabilizer on it you don't need to find any extended mags and it was just that was the havoc meta for quite some months it was ridiculous what kind of decision was that why are you shooting that's a that's one sharp rock i've never noticed it's that sharp shot you don't want to headbutt that one there you go there's someone in the distance with a g7 and just hearing that gun has just instantly some decent loon here made me do i care it's made me pretty sad i miss the g7 i don't think it's even going to be the next gun that comes out the care package i think it's the spitfire and then it's going to be the g7 so we're going to wait at least another like three years until i get a grand luke g7 back here we go here we go here we go there we go scott should be somewhat weak all right yeah he's weak not the guy tougher guy down low i reckon probably more weak oh forgot that wasn't what's going on here nice good shots all right i missed a few buttons there oh forgot about the gold barrel stabilizer it reduced oh that was a big update too when they they removed like the muzzle flash because it was hard to track people and then the gold barrel stabilizer which reduced the muzzle flash became an obsolete attachment i think it should be a suppressor i think that would be incredibly cool to try and find suppressors maybe it could do less damage at range you know like most suppressors do on most fps games but i think that'd be a great update who is the best solo legend especially now because since this video was released there are obviously so many more legends i'm trying to think he'll be who's like new that would be such a good legend would valkyrie be good solo legend she could always have the high ground she could just solo all to to get better positioning and to go and get more kills she'd be pretty good mad maggie i should be average i think pathfinder is pretty good i think wraith is obviously a good option lifeline absolutely useless oh this is gonna happen who's this guy he's got white armor shoot him not like that i need to reload before before he sends me flying there we go where you going chase this guy down he's got white armor yeah pop the emote this guy is still gonna be shook yeah you can land there oh god okay this is why it's turbo havoc this is why i guess he did not land up top turbo havoc is just not fair whatsoever the uh the boxes have way more the yellow tint to them look they look yellow i'm not gold this guy's got digi that's why it's like this yellow color he's one of those yes okay this is back when i use a play on steady response curve if you know anything about the response curves you'll know that steady is an absolute disaster so if you see any bad shooting it's not my fps talent it's it's the steady response curve i've changed it on day one still to this day don't know why i did it i i stayed on steady for a good two years and i was horrendous only one minute closes look at that grapple call down this is before they find it's like 15 second cooldown on every grappler it doesn't matter if you went one foot or 300 feet it was a 15 second grapple this guy was opie oh this is mental but i love it that give me the kill credit oh this guy just turning in the zone okay there's another guy that's off with a longbow this guy gave me a free bubble that i could have used the gold bag was fast tales it's so busted i've got the most op loadout of all time i'm playing a broken legend in pathfinder with the 15 second grapple call down i've got the gold bag for the fast tales i've got a turbo havoc and a disrupter around alternator i mean if if i lost this game it would have been an absolute embarrassment let's be honest this guy's running to the pit this is a bit of a risk on my end though because if i don't win this gunfight and i've forced backwards i have to go through the zone this guy's terrified though you can tell just grab on his forehead he's got a long bow for one of his guns do you pop a bat because you got the gold bag or do you just grapple on him off the bat this guy's struggling he's scared he literally picked one up halfway through the fight that's cheating what did he pick up oh nelly you didn't treat that guy though did you no don't rush me when you consider that because everyone's a solo people are more spread out there'll be people everywhere you get you'd be getting third non-stop if this was uh around nowadays okay that guy i don't know i don't think he's doing anything oh never mind it must be a different one look how small the knockdowns are the knockdown shields oh we're getting further to get armor switch armor switch take the armor yeah i'm smart look at that why are you amy if that's not the most broken item you've ever seen i don't know what is and this to be honest with you i'm the reason why the fast sales changed to the armor for a while and then they got rid of it all together i i tweeted out saying that the fast hill shouldn't be on the gold bag it should be on the gold armor so i don't know if you want to thank me for that okay this guy's gotta have it so never again and he's top like six with white armor bless him he's got all the energy in the energy range what a great god listen thank you no thank you cheers for that one thank you very much i do appreciate it i'm just gonna use it i got five of them five people left my first game here of solos this has been absolutely sensational manic manic shield sells for a themes kit when i've got a gold bag that's probably not the not the one i mean only six only six cells is kind of cutting it close but phoenix came in five seconds can't complain about that we die to a caustics there's gonna be a course exciting one of these rooms another one of the reasons like corsic would be a good solar legend but if you became meta then everyone would just counter each other like he would actually have no abilities whatsoever because his gas wouldn't affect anyone sort of a stranger on that okay that's the worst grapple i've ever seen i'm skipping ahead what's going on i actually picked up a mastiff i never used to pick up this gun because it only had 24 rounds or 24 shells and i always got scared i was going to run out of ammo and plus i kind of sucked with me oh the vanguard drums the bango drums are coming in look how small that final circle is oh i'm getting nervous with drums i miss this battle pass with the with the havoc i miss it a lot 76 47 this map and it fires so fast this map this massive busted again grief leave me alone okay nice using the doors she called grapple spot thank you like i thought first of my kill for me oh my knock down stop it everyone had disrupted rounds everything must have been so common you you really did feel like spider-man back back uh in this era of apex legends when you play path look i've got six seconds left on the ground i've got the ultimate high ground with a massive shotgun that i haven't reloaded don't leave a comment i don't what was that damage wow 182 didn't need to reload that's that's insane this gun was busted that sounds horrible 13 kill why does this look so weird 13 what is he down here 13 kills 2200 damage how happy was it jeez my heart is racing what's going on there thank you for watching no problem absolutely no problem okay so this was the 26th of august this was the solo watson to another what am i doing gameplay solo watson i i don't know and we are continuing oh flew autumn all right where are we landing where are we dropping boys all right i actually like this little building it has a decent amount of loot most of the time this little building on the hill there we go that's what we needed the g7 skateboard in this game anymore these g7 scans i've told you g7 square after g7 scopes one you'll complain is this before i realized how much i loved the g7 scope literally three g7 scouts in here perhaps no don't mean three times don't like it that much even the two times is a little bit of a push i'll be honest with you you see times have changed this is this is back when i played on steady and the response cover is really difficult i know we already talked about this but it felt even worse with the higher magnification scopes this is why i only ever used to use one-time scopes because they felt horrible any like two times or three times felt disgusting at this time for me anyway i may as well use that on that and then throw the ball yeah that's what i do now this is such a good setup you know this is such a good seller that's the fourth g7 scale i told you i mean times have changed common gun on the game i think i wish it was i just put my flat line into single i wonder if i know that guy's lagging a little bit i mean i made a mistake from my flatlining single okay at least i realized oh god what's he doing running there as a pathfinder as well just grappled up top he's putting shield batteries on makes the right and you could sort of tell someone was a good player back then when they like did you see when this guy healed he's peaking like for info you see that nowadays everyone does this because it's like three and a half years in but back then most players weren't that good you could sort of tell that someone sort of knew what they were doing when they would peak while shielding maybe he picks it a bit too far but you need to get information and that was such a good way of doing it especially if you're popping a shield bat and you've got a little bit of shield you can sacrifice that a little bit of shield you can get shot once or twice because the shield that's going to pop anyway at least you know you're not getting pushed come on light rain extended beautiful please take the helmet some things never change do they i might leave a comment after i don't like that 320 you left the helmet by the way that's the thing i've seen you left it again that's why i get to check i mean if you're trying to win a solo game you kind of you're trying to win a solo game okay the safe zone is a lot closer i've jumped off good job this way i don't left a dislike if you if i started camping up there although this hey no shields allowed his guns busted i jumped at the end there so he wouldn't hear me sliding on in still a good tactic there's a lot they were lost you left probably too much you'd have to help me help me trade it out for some throwables someone headshots me at this point they're doing a minimum of like 60 damage no like nowadays you're spawning with a level 1 that offers decent protection i don't have a helmet at all like my head is actually so exposed at the moment it's crazy it's a pretty bad idea for me to do this but i'd rather try and get some sunglasses as high up as possible here this hill why is this song so i'm more comfortable with the one times is what i'm trying to say if i do have to switch this gc i've already explained it don't worry i've already explained it no now i'm gonna get hounded in the comments for not using the two times there we go we saved it 78 damage you can't argue that you can't argue with that this guy's got hammers everyone's got crazy half pups back here hammers disruptive rounds turbo chargers everywhere hold on hold on a sec dude this guy okay he doesn't have to swipe around yet we're absolutely fine i don't know what cover is we're chilling i don't mind looting this guy because i know he's got  he can tell me take his army it's just let's come in again and now this happens now maybe take the helmet oh god there you go friend it's a different guy's got it see look at the hufflepuffs this guy's got a fully auto prowler i've got a gold bag so careful so i would love to go back in time and play in these lobbies i would absolutely love it get that one times g7 skating on the go i thought it was aiming at me this guy climbed you heard him climb you heard him climb okay i'm confused what am i looking at do you guys think i'm gonna use my my generator my watson generator at any point during this game because to be honest with you i don't think i am or maybe i'll get to the right at the end and now i've realized that i still have my altitude from the start of the game and i'll throw it down as a consolation so people don't really shout at me for not using it once take a selfie my friend take it tell me yes thank goodness my word i have so many lie rounds again yep i mean it's necessary at least now i don't have to worry about running out of ammo it's not it's not necessarily the most common ammo type as well you get a kill you're looting it at least another 200. take some throwables if i had to guess i'd say they went down low and they're probably camping up in this building somewhere forgot there's a tunnel system over this way you could drop down that little hole there into the tunnels beneath it wasn't me was it peg hey did i see someone go up the rope i mean the video quality isn't that great because i was only rendering in 1080p i'm telling you i wish i could go back to these lobbies i'd actually drop a 60 bucks that's not sarah okay oh this guy's got school face around i wonder what that gun noise was it's a wingman with scorpio it does like 106 damage a headshot or something there were so many busted guns back back uh in this time of apex so many broken weapons disrupt rounds uh you had like the havoc meta that i spoke about you had the skull piercer unbelievable weaponry the r301 was a complete laser beam back then as well i remember this gun why do i remember this gun fight so vividly i think you can't do this to a pathfinder i'm trying to use the storm advantage here but he's just gonna fly over your head it's not worth it if he's got his ultimate or even if he knows how to grapple properly he can grapple over my head and all of a sudden i'm the one with the storm disadvantage that's true he's not going anywhere we have to go the same way unless he wants to go all the way north smart they saw me 150 damage with the one times g7 oh such a busted weapon oh my god please don't shoot me in the back pathfinder you'd expect the pathfinder to be coming right up behind me now there he is i have gold armor what's the gold armor do again oh the gold armor gave you uh shields when you popped a finisher it wasn't an actual like default thing back then it was shield on finisher which is a weird thing to have for what you'd expect to be the best item in the entire game 124 got distracted by a care package that is absolutely beautiful i mean you can't say what you want about me only using a one times for the g7 but let's be honest i was kind of frying with this weapon okay all right he's a grapple expert apparently the storm comes in so quickly it does which is a good thing to push and also all he had to do there was um delay me long enough for his graph to come back and just grab off the safety and then he was the one gatekeeping me i think backing up he was a smart play i got such a rivalry with this pathfinder a lot of problems here yeah he is bongo drums are coming in we've got a care package down low but i think it's a good idea not to lose that i guess it might load up easily perfect certainly he's going to come with this angle i'm not even parting this anymore they're already dead 196 got four health full health there you go there we go i said the exact same pathfinder for the last two rings all right 1v1 and we know where the last gunfight was yeah the wingman i'm kind of scared i know i win obviously but i'm still kind of scared i can get on top of this building set up my notes i think you can make this jump bangalore i told you this is what was going to happen i was going to pop my ultimate juice at the end did he give you a shield back then i can't throw those smokes down friend it looks like it gives you shields they can't name me up here that's the good news yeah it's giving me shield back i think he tried to smoke me but my generator got rid of it my online show was actually pretty good considering i was a steady player here we go no gold knock down on the bangalore it looks weird seeing just one person in the in the victory screen here even if people leave you still see them cheering next to you trying to take all the credit 11 kills 2200 damage i'm glad we got a win with with watson without too much problem because i was modern because she's not what do you guys think about solos mode jerk and they should bring it back because that that looked really fun i mean it was a different era of apex but it still looks really good hopefully you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you on the next one bye
