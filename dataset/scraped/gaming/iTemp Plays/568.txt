hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are going to be playing some more apex legends of course and we are here to play some ranked it dawned on me the other day that i only have a week left to reach my goal of masters on pc and i was still sat in platinum three so i messaged chicken i asked him if he wanted to get some games and we managed to get some wins in ranked and honestly i love playing ranked because of the tactics you have to employ you have to think about what you're doing sometimes the public games on apex can be a little bit mindless but ranked feels like it just has more substance and we're still only in platinum it's going to get a lot harder here soon but i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching be sure to check out chicken's channel in the description that was not easy to say and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you're scared listen the first game of the day doesn't count it doesn't you know it definitely doesn't count besides the only games that count are the ones that you win so if you think about it we win every single game that's true that's a good point you've messed it up mm-hmm oh okay i forget that on the lifeline oh here you go i have a blue oh thank you okay i loaded all these bins i would like one backpack please i've only just had my first one oh no coach coach lynn that teammate's actually popping off yeah oh they didn't even leave the tower no they stood up there careful teammate okay are they up there or they aren't like two different sides i think okay i think on this close one i think actually just better leave going for our people friend yeah they're just spotted yeah i did i was like neo from the matrix we're getting out of here oh yeah yeah try not to bother popping so many like health heals oh yeah we know when you're out yeah octane now we've got a lifeline here yeah they pushed up a little bit this is always gonna happen level three i'm just grab i'm just grabbing the car i will eat the bullet so you guys don't have to go i mean we're going i don't have my drone thing i tell me it's literally one shot if anyone hits this car i know i see we're gonna we're getting out of here dude i'm gonna save that med kit for her i'll put my old drone out here in a second i can pop it in the car right no not the drone not the drone i swear you can i swear you can i mean you can pop it oh wait what yeah yeah yeah how crazy is that it just hops in the back i like this little drone thing whatever it is i had no idea he's cool isn't he i had no idea i thought that it would just wow okay well you learned something new every day oh that's for him like hold up my brain just like turned oh yeah i didn't even see you yeah i've got a oh my god this team's here i gotta get oh my god him i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm good you go drop down i gotta pop the pink thing oh my god you're so good you're so good last one's here go go help go help what lycan that lifeline resin okay you got it finish my kill on one bring down that guy oh my god you're so good the third part is going to be behind yeah there's no way i'm throwing a throwback pad nice okay any any shields i don't i have two sails and that's it i know i have two bats i have two bats i'm lying i want to make friends mate thank you i'll take that and there's small hills over here yeah the train is just bro these guys are like they're gamers you know they're gamers okay let's see i'll tell you it's wrapping around left it's a bit of a sketchy angle for him there yeah doesn't really have much of a cover department no he just knows okay he he is a wraith he is a rape though he that got 22 he had them flesh him that was decent to me down that guy nice dude it's our opening oh yeah they put it away away i thought you just poured it inside nice good job friends why you just say everyone no it's still a wraith around okay but we get to loot i have six bats and i just dropped one in there find the right stream the craziest take which i've ever seen not mine there we go we win all right well seven other squads left this is uh this is good looking good looking good i'm looking good i'm up a lot of rp plus 44. listen i just need to play bloodhound and just scan everything i'll just get all the assets in the world i'm going to play crypto and just do the same thing or just rely on our teammate at the front just oh he's telling us where the sun's gonna pull okay let's see if you're right coach nice he was correct i'm looking down there's a drone he's talking about drones with an arm shield oh oh that's that team from earlier oh yeah yeah no i don't i don't know we're gonna go in the zone or we could kill them i mean they have charge rifles mate keyboard charge rifle so just zero fun i'm surprised you can't even see them if you're on console i figured he would dude i know right it's so difficult i'm not i'm not sure what resolution it plays on but eventually the only the only reason i was able to see him was just because of the gibby arm shield that said i saw that orange glowy thing in the distance like oh wait a minute fluorescent glow at least you can see you know let you know what you're fighting against there if that was a race you don't have a chance you know you're just getting no it's the charge you're not gonna hit her just firing out of thin air uh i can't help it yeah it was right there they gave us a zip like we cannot deny this gift that they have graciously explode on us if this woman is usually here or not oh crypto guy no that's what i'm worried about follow me probably follow me follow me forget this third party i know the third party looks tempting we're gonna we're gonna get these people in the back yes put my headlock into burst mode there you go that's what you get you nerd leave you go give us any cracks in this light just crack creatures cracked we're going to show it by the way armor swap do what you got to do because the other team's going to be coming in we just need to get rid of this team because this was going to be the problem too yeah that was the only reason i made that call right there because those are the guys from the very beginning so the second team right now they're probably finished they're probably looting right now so let's see i think it's a horizon storm's closing behind us we have to be careful with any any stragglers you know there's not that many teams left but yeah let's uh let's rotate right because we just like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute they're fighting okay they're getting shot out from up there these guys are taking okay we got him we got him someone's like close here oh wait okay he's quick that is a real legend right there that's the ultimate third part here this guy third parties mate still playing a little bit safe i'm not there's another that's another another squad okay i don't have many heavy rains do you have many shields i can lifeline race if she just holds that shoot that i'm tuning in oh i'm taking i'm taking a night i'm gonna try and lifeline rise get rolled nerd is it give me down low there's so many people here i don't know who to view that i'm backing up they're on the roof again just back back up a little bit last time oh my god you're so good here last guys here crack some red blue time cracks on ripple times oh my god nice shots brother find a problem dude nice call out dude nice call be careful third party he knows he's aware this is an aware gamer i've already said i'm holding the edge do you watch you know what i i will i will respect his wishes i will respect his wishes is he talking can you hear him yeah he's talking yeah he's been talking this whole time oh has he my badge i've been on mute already like how do i unmute people i think someone was once like literally chewing on their microphone so i just oh yeah no ever since they implemented the whole cosplay thing like the voice system between console sure let's do it last second there's a jump tower over there yeah we'll do that near the top come down and place the other end so when you guys take it just grab the balloon at the top does that work okay okay it's worth it we'll do it okay sounds good [Laughter] oh my god he talked us oh if this is safe this is okay i'm just gonna like if i if you guys can just constantly challenge people i'll just live on race oh my god it might be necessary we found him bro imagine though the special ability for the crater if you got shot in the head okay you didn't go down you just insta that would be oh that would be great i think that would be fun oh god just cooking them up mate just cooking them up they're coming oh god i'm i'm below this team's let's go bro no time dude plus 190 everyone you're killing is gonna be a good player and that would you know the it would be like splitting hairs amongst all the good players at that point yeah so that would be okay i'll be good they didn't push i like the horizon the first thing she does instantly goes down i need to get that gold dude i appreciate that i was gonna follow below the p20 so i just thought maybe i should get a gun first these numptus i don't have i have a p20 from this entire building yeah i know they're shooting at you but why are they shooting at you am i safe to go down on this angle kind of i crack two okay i have p20 so i'll just try my best come up here to me i need his armor yeah they're coming up right now they're coming up right now thank you that actually helped you're so good that's a good date i'm trying to kill a lifeline first i honestly getting away with it though yep on 99 i'll take actually i'm going to take another one yeah 301 is the is the wave uh this will be my second back wait is she fighting oh wait she is coming teammate oh do they get if she goes down they're going to switch to her purple armor that's not good at all don't let her die okay let me i gotta heal i took damage oh yes oh my god she's trying to climb perfect perfect perfect perfect perfectly played oh she's self-raised yeah that was tough that was real tough right there i was in like a decent spot if i jumped down on at the air that was a rough spot to try and tap yeah i can't quite tell if that's in front of turbine or states oh yeah no that's turbine is it gunshots or is it just the fan there's gunshots oh okay i can just hear the distinct sounds of a hemlock oh yeah someone just dies in the fade two bursts 100 damage headshot oh my god bro i got hit the other day with a hip fire hemlock burst all three rounds in my head i was just instantly dead sick what's he saying oh he's getting a phone call he said give him a second who answers phone calls these days i just ignore it oh my god i'm so bad that yeah that wasn't a pleasant noise careful there's a lot of teams here mate here we go i just wanted that guy i just wanted to get that one girl i don't think there's anybody up here but be ready to drop this case my teammate's back here get ready to fry these nerds wait who's healing underneath down the close guy race cracked last well played good job i was like wait a minute i hear somebody healing it's not you timothy i wish i could see through this he scanned and then just talked when he saw that we ripped up like that he opted as well behind his right spot okay let's take the rope across there's another team underneath dude kevin's coming across they hope they hopped okay they're fighting inside they are this is a little bit sketchy i don't even want a third part of that because there's another team here get spotted oh miles no yeah yeah they've gone up this way they're going this way i'll be there postcards nearly cracked i gotta i think i have an angle i don't have do you have any light rains got some i hit the bloodhound twice that's right coming in airstrike miles what are you doing he's going crazy trying to help i'm trying to help as much as i can like that i was just like bruh yeah you just got to try and get there and help that's all you can do i'm dropping this little thing here thank you mate my all your light ammo i the only reason i'm getting kills here is because i'm playing it smart but my like accuracy and stuff is not good booty they might be up here we're getting scanned they're down below okay bro that rooney messed was trying not available here yeah now we go get these guys because i figured i figured that they were going to run into another team yeah yeah yeah i'm still kind of low on light ammo but i've got loads of heavy so it's not good i got 100 something lighting yeah someone up top as well they're gonna have to jump down and be careful there's like teams everywhere they're just kiddies everywhere like
