[Applause] all right planet harvester DS my friends look at this thing just ha just it's half seen with the Pollux just the hot drop - it's got the high tail linked apparently nobody say that people used to get confused I just mean it's the hotshot there's a gold item here some way no fleeing along with the gold item there is at least one weapon here we go our 301 I got no bullets though there's a paper 17 whatever is in here apologies I'm useless without without ly ammunition for months let me go Center known as well that's a triple take-home point that was the sense no give me that don't tell me that this place is dead again this wasn't the truth the hot drop I keep landing here and no one else lands here there's some energy drinks I think I saw someone pick up a habit a half a Keurig an L star is something I think's one needs that oh no that's too much that's too much of a snob scope I can't deal with anything more than like the the 2 x 4 x variable the ideal one for me would be the the three times is it the range of scope that's my favorite scopes have thrown like a sniper all right so Ashiya my teammate seven found it there is a gold item around here somewhere if the sculpt shields I'll be a happy man will helmet not quite as good there's a scrappers over fuel depo or sorting factory even is over this way teammates don't look too interested scraps or CT we entrust you to Capitol City can I get you up no nothing no they've gone the opposite way completely I tell you what plain revenant makes me stick with my teammates a little bit closer because if I was Pathfinder day I'll be honest I'm probably going over to scrapped on city because pathfinders can get in and out of fights so easily revenant I mean I know you can pop this ultimate but you still still a bit vulnerable you can't does the power of a fight if you absolutely have to all right team how about we go train yard instead hung after Luke the heats and I'll tell you why if I don't loop them my teammates I'll see them and now look them and it's gonna take us even longer to get over to the train yard this is part of the quickest way to do it that's too long again I've used the sentinel oh let me use this of course this is the t100 skin on the bypass you can't really see in this dark cave but it's worth know at least I mean this is all unloaded I am actually struggling so much to find people lately on this map I thought I thought harvester was gonna be the most popular drop on the season format but I never seen anyone here I mean the good news is that I don't think anyone else can find anyone either because there's still 41 people left and here just the odd bullets being fired scraps or CC and that means that the scrap is in the distance my friends I want to get involved if I can this always happens actually I'm about to finish that if you did actually see someone your boy can actually come in with a pinch maneuver but this always happens I run off looking for a scrap my teammates just loot stuff and they find P before I do I don't know how it works but here we are there's still a bunch of people left there's still an opportunity for me to get a bunch of girls it's an honor over yet why are you going that are you going friend that's the Gibraltar that's the one who pings so maybe they're over this way potentially no maybe not I've no idea what he's looking no kill leader I haven't seen a saw okay I'm with you I've got my ulti ready to go even though we've been looting a kind of a lot here we only have to level two shields and their lifeline still and loved one unfortunately that's the kill leader isn't it yeah for Kelsey out of he had a 20 kill bench salmon friend how is that least that's sort of post card he's like just in time it's got no health I've got no hand to eye coordination this is such a beautiful insights we're gain feb hired by a charge rider to learn unfortunately with a good news these be fine people so he kills just like that just an entire squad wipe off five spare bullets depend on and I'll find you in these boxes seventy-five not bad teammates finds them two and three much French is getting charged rifled by the dweet machine man half man half tweed machine where is he Oh so with the machine it's the ultimate tweed combo he's half man half dweeb half 80s shield man he's dropped his ulti as well good grief I climb up this drankin there we go beautiful athletic don't expect me to be a player either that's fine up top get out of the tweet machine man the revenant coming to well the half one is gonna cook top well there is my friend sweeps Tokyo 99 oh here we go he's female I can't see I can't see thing please leave a comment could you guys see any human right there because I I was firing him and then all of a sudden my screen was just red nothing nothing was going through her than the color red that was it that's enough all right skyhook is the pony where everyone is five kills that is not the right way tonight's poker have to go we do not have long 18 seconds left on the storm are they still losing come on team you're gonna get caught in a storm no the gibraltars not even healed himself this isn't looking good oh please move I didn't play says wait what did you say like that no one couldn't discern that I'm not sure they're making these because the Gibraltar lifeline stop moving she's probably fine the Gibraltar is another story now tell you what I don't like doing anymore I don't like reviving the storm I hate it I hate trying to heal up I always mess up the healing timings everything muster I can engage on these without the right timing because my team is gonna come out at this angle as well and they probably gonna be weak I won't be here for quite a while now not too far she listens yossel oh wow so Pete yeah get one kill with it suddenly it's over poet hey back it up they know I've got a legendary havoc with a select-fire option someone's good Scouts that's scary lifelines made that every storm your bolts are still stripping season here though 120 I'll take it lifelines here as well drone incoming your phone you mess it up as well be harsh on the fall but I measure escapee here we go you spiked the loose only one more squad good great what better kit up because you've got a gun from the storm we're not making the same mistake surely one of these guys had energy rounds please why do you hold level 3 that will try even close enough many drones some Paquita balls which always nice he's weak it's not honest 38 they'll do these are looking good friends brought white strip them enough after they can't hear anything sound good night whole mud white is in our vibe off that's okay keys taken a while and he's awfully gonna get up with pretty low health hopefully just two people oh we pulled it off he was a kill leader he had the 20 kill badge we go past this banner being shown only after definite the Tony kill I'm not sure if you have to 4k one as well and he was the kill I had nine kills the end and he was the killer leader still only kill so I end up with ten I mean odd and in one side it was pretty much eleven but he was it was ten I'll take it double digits he's funny I'll tell you what I I'm gonna try this Electrify havoc more often I only tried it because obviously they got rid of the turbocharger and if they're gonna give you a select-fire and your secondary is a 999 your only option is gonna be to have a quiz select fire I tried the island I was reading people they were getting shredded thank you for watching I promise I'll try out to have a come off for me select fire I'm gonna do it thank you very much for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you on the next one
