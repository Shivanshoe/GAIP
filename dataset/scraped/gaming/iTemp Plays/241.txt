hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing someone who i think will be so good in season 11 and it's valkyrie and here is why in the background you can see some of my early season 11 gameplay which i've got thanks to ea and this specifically is what it's like fighting a team with a gravity lift involved first of all the enemy team takes the lift without even knowing that we existed and it's almost impossible to follow a team on this lift because you have very little maneuverability in there so your landing location is very telegraphed and the gravity makes a load of noise too so they would have just turned around knowing where we were going to land as our watson unfortunately finds out and the next part of this game is us trying to 2v3 this team who have the ultimate high ground on us and actually went pretty well until a third team showed up now the reason i'm showing you this clip is because these gravity lifts are what replaces the balloon towers we have on the other maps on apex we get the tridents on storm point as well but they are few and far between they're kind of difficult to find i think they're mainly on the outskirts of the map so the gravity lifts are going to be the main rotational tool that we have but they are so dangerous to take this is where valkyrie comes in she has the best rotational ability in apex her ultimate which she can use to travel incredible distances especially on storm point because it has some crazy high ground and if you use her ultimate from this high ground you can cover like half a map it's kind of crazy now i heard a comment on one of my earlier season 11 videos asking if the removal of these balloon towers is a nerf to valkyrie as she can't utilize her recon passive too often and i do get the thought process but i actually think it makes her much better because she has access to rotations that other teams don't now i'm happy about this because i've really enjoyed playing valkyrie i love taking high ground every gun fight for free without fail i just need to work at getting better at utilizing her ability more because i often just forget that i have it it isn't uncommon for me to not use it in an entire game but the game that i have for you today i used it a few times i stunned a few people so i'm sure you valkyrie mains out there will be proud of me for that one now still have more early access pushes that i will be uploading to the channel including some care package double tap g7 scope gameplay coming soon so make sure to subscribe to the channel for more thank you for watching thank you once more to ea for this opportunity for the early recording and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds for some season 10 olympus a lot of people gameplay oh oh oh oh i was tapped out i'm landing in the worst spot on this boi yeah you'll get good guns that you always do got an l star did you have 20 bullets with it was my prediction correct pretty much coming to you guys i've got a flatline power give me a second oh really we're good i need shields i got you back landing on a flat line at the start of the game he's honestly the greatest feeling it's by far the best gun to land on by far oh yeah the only attachments for it to be good no attachments it's good at close range it's good at long range it's good at medium range it doesn't use that many bullets the best the best ever you have no shields i have seven drop two again oh no and then there's a low ball right here nice should be enough are you going to walk around i'm just going to fly thank you you're going to say that then you're going to fall through that'd be pretty embarrassing more people literally getting shot by both teams i destroyed it one's pushing you no one's pushing you you're fine you got time uh one's making their way in it's a watson let's help teammate he's charging shields there's no way he's there can't get to you just for your life i'm gonna try and call towards you guys now though like first in you or like tuna the time it's two teams two teams uh another other team is like where that other team have no shields they're all fighting down here i might have my alt if i can get if i can crawl in here you guys can arrest me i think teammates gonna be able to raise teammates hey nice i might have my wall oh my how did that not cancel out yeah i have no shields next i'll drop them all one sec yeah we're just chilling in here uh i'm about 700 damage and i'm going to kill i have one kill on so i'm in he's gonna fight alone that guy's awake this guy what the heck's going on nice what is happening i don't know he found another team i have no shields behind us yeah nice job there's a team right behind us yeah i think we need to try and kill this i think are pretty much broken horizon uh uh i shouldn't have gone down there but there's a beacon there so we're good yeah i didn't know that other one was going to have sufferers yeah i had like i had blue shield because i had to switch from my red and i had oh you can just insert oh my god nice oh yeah forgot about that and i like half health so it actually makes sense i died oh back baby that was ridiculous i had nothing yeah i don't know how i didn't get thirsted when i was crawling away for so long i think he's in my box oh this guy had a ton of stuff he had a flat line decked out flatline okay then there's more bodies that we didn't live over here too yeah give me a second nice i'm good i mean my red arm is somewhere oh here it's right here it's in this one oh when he got how many oh god thank you jeezy like duff he definitely lays in here though the whole teammate i can't wait for it to get nerfed it's so busted hey we are on the ropes this game very nice or i think yeah yeah my mama switched then done one time nice job i don't want to use that i'll make sure you know yeah little tap you know i looked up um the quote that's uh desktop yesterday was really funny i appreciate it oh i forgot you haven't seen that movie gotta you gotta watch that movie it was great i won't recommend a lot of movies but what's it called for the other guys oh the guys that's a great movie any movie with uh with mark wahlberg and uh and what's the name will ferrell together i think he wasn't i don't think anyone's there i think he just was really excited about the gold pk i don't know i think he's leaving he left no oh wait he needed you i mean i like his stuff though here we go some bats you know didn't even say bye didn't say boy one squad left he was out of there and he revived me like he put damage in that gunfight just then he respawned me he was a good guy he revived you teambagging i have like a hierarchy of loot in my head and it's like shield like arm switches top shield battery second ammo is like an attachment a third and then it's ammo afterwards and i no matter what i need i always look for those things in order yeah i just try to grab bats that's all i care about yeah dance who need anything else when you have a lot of bats squadron full squadron i see two people so far i see three for 52. stay okay probably not i actually stunned something with that yeah 102 i am 61. i know but i need the corsica's week okay nice guy so far then you get when you get your first damage i appreciate that how's the game i wonder what the crypto had to do no he could have just could just left his pc would have got a free win that was actually really fun it was good i think i went down like four times but i was still good game
