I can't eliminate it that was early barely even hopped out the whip and a champion is gone but we are playing the game mode where the storm or the ring start at the outside can't see yes looks like it's gonna be ending near the train yard so this isn't a terrible spawn for us to go to because we don't have to move too much at the start the game takes place I can't see oh don't do that what did I take that like I'll just have to still get on there okay this gun is ridiculous like how did you guys let me not use this with this long I've dropped it laughter you're not back see myself here I literally could have respawned the Wasson it would have taken three seconds but I mean I've died here before and left at the start because you just think you just think the teammates aren't really gonna do anything that's not much friend but it's something this guy over here it's some more blue shield for you you didn't find a good blessing what's that when that happens the problem with with this place is that people land nearby and then they just fly on in afterwards because they know that people here are going to be you know loops you know they're not gonna expect it as much and that makes it so you can't really hear anyone it's okay if I stop we destroy this no I always forget always forget another change what good that's on me I don't like it on this either honestly I don't even like the digital threat that much at all I'll have to throw it on something I just leave it behind if I come across especially because I'm Bangalore never mind I loved it too job threat right the rings enclosing as you can see it's ending just here just to the west of train yard so we will have to prepare for that might be a little bit difficult this is the Lutie friends shock era that rainfall times am i doing let's do it got some good armor we got some good weapons it's not oh yes yeah absolutely not oh okay jokes a man any size can excite I'll be honest I thought I'd turned it to automatic but apparently I did not nice teammate watch I have a triple st. man I might just smoke she would say man and then just rushing with the digital threat where is he I'll oh my god the g7 sound absolutely horrendous give me give me one second no come on come on get me out of that ah jump oh my god the symphony the symphony of g7 Scouts absolutely terrifying don't shoot me Tina I might have to yeah keep coming friend keep it coming I use my only healable eye up we have to run we have to get the hair King freak out of here nice laptop okay they're jumping down once jump down one or two people didn't we're better off just rushing this way okay I'm on automatic mode come on Ani these fields come on that subsides its launch of thermite grenade at me oh my god we need to kill someone here and take that stuff like my word this way nice job TV and he dropped me a medikit outside - did that really just bounce that far my smoke grenade bounced oh my gosh leave us alone we need these things to fight teammate be careful are we talking well we're talking I have 19 but I killed some I was pretty sure they're in there and got smoke for the wall teammate and they're definitely look overseer its g7 scope men they're back retreat I mean forget to grab all the things I wanted I just heard their footsteps and I got sugar because I need my team I was weak see like your absolute legends my friends look at this what a man a fine voyage oh what a gay this is being so far eight kills this is where it's gonna get hectic there's 18 people left in this storm is still coming in oh my gosh the heck was that music reloading so mean nice teammate I'm pretty sure he would give me that anyway two guys who think seems like a great guy [Music] bikini the ball I have two digital threats maybe I should give one to Pathfinder oh no he's got one take that friend because I can just smoke people I've got it honestly I've got two pretty much I mean this is a fully kitted out Prowler this is fully kitted out that's kill number nine this is where it's gonna get unbelievably hectic as if he wasn't already does I mean there's a scrapper that way somewhere recharge our shields friend oh my god I thought I was a goner with those g7 escapes after the close range weapons they're coming clutch because he's gonna get real close real fast not anything too close I think I might be in sight okay I can't compete that range I've got to close range comes with digital threats on them yeah okay we're in the safe zone I'm not sure it's a good strategy okay calm ready go that way what I've seen grapples storm is Wireless how can only heal up with the big-boy heels now I have no small heels left I've got I got that for you I don't know what my doing Jade you need that you can grab me stop you can grab it that still he's fine big scrap over that way did you try gay involved like only once god bless I think after this your frack no I just I just pressed up on the d-pad I just pressed up on the d-pad to use my shell battery Oh it'd have to be a full team it had to be a full team I got rushed by both of them Oh teammate you in a 153 here friends this is gonna be tough oh it's so looking he's so lucky was a faulty all right can we have more kills in them I mean if we were absolutely popping off then I wasn't sure if we should get involved or not and it turns out we wish probably should have if I knew those the last two teams fights and I did I'd have be lined it straight over there how much damage we do 2,300 I mean shouts at much nurple 700 damage only got one kill for 700 damage definitely definitely deserved more to a 10 minute game good grief these games are gonna be so fast not as fast as Watson's game which was 57 seconds but still pretty quick can already tell this is going to be a bit of carnage here I think there are five teams in total it's okay some of them may bail some of them may well yeah bail I might just run away by firing nice teammate a bit of teamwork there not the greatest gun I've ever got nice one depends on my read I'll reload just might be bit overconfident how do you get stronger back so that's something I don't worry about Patti nice banner I get this quickly respawn I'm gonna get rid of some stuff get out of here no I didn't think that that's the only problem with these places that people don't land you then they come here late just off they meets cancel that Oh mon Dieu that's pretty help nice teammate I'm doing nothing here absolutely nothing I've got to kill somehow but Shemp team there we go all right well I'm struggling here in terms of health I don't want to ping that out because it's not even fall it's not near being poor all right we should probably make a move for the rain gets juiced outside scraps or cc in fact that corner yeah the corner of that building is scrapped till he's safe that's gonna be brutal if someone's up there just firing down and everyone a team I should have kept my sniper scope this to one's a race so if they probably would get the nerve patient I don't name it anyway I've tickle them what the mangalore's oh yeah I mean I think I hit both of them and they only had level 1 shields I mean oh no I've only got level 1 shields and no health but damage I do need that friends need to use my shield tiles name over there's a fight near by and this games been a little bit weird I do want to get involved if I can with my three-times skate I say we just get better heck you freak over there my been lovely too far away even still even still we honestly may have to go this way if we get coin train yard and we have to all go through this one way that's to be honest with you know this seems to around us as well and someone's getting respawn over that way there's gonna be a bit of a mess I think because other people might be coming from that other side of the map sweet I couldn't bunnyhop like this in third person like at all I couldn't manage it who's got a daughter I mean we don't need to challenge ease they are struggling now facing up honestly I say we discard this way we're gonna get caught by the by the choke point if we spend too long fighting this team team team team team team let's get out of here yeah I know you said it that's my people be difficult promise how do I even get up there even as Pathfinder it's actually kind of difficult without your LT okay you can't grab once these I'm gonna do this look there's another squad 10 they're like good grace what can you do sometimes I'm not glad to help these guys now we should have got out of there so much sooner than we did I was trying to ping but it just wasn't happening at least I've got a bit of an angle on this if they try and get up this way I assume through the stairs there are two squads down there like unless they've gone safe I haven't now that's climb up so he's got to keep him weak they're gonna keep going for that for that jump pad so they can't get up here once dead I knew this would be the play though a new game here first and gatekeeping the storm was the play [Applause] 29 damage Fields there's gonna be such a big scrap over this way my teammates are still watching I still believe in the dream for squads I have two more kills what so must've walked in a storm I need a ping that place people say man I need to move because he's gonna shield and I don't to know where I am I'm gonna try and wait a second and a peak from this slightly wider angle and hopefully he's still looking at I thought I was being a genius I thought I thought you wouldn't have seen me it worked and in the end I mean that was my strategy all along I was trying to get control of one of the choke points and then you just looked down the choke point and you get you got free kills my friends eats just free kills 1,700 damage I mean I got two kills from shooting someone and then them dying in a storm that's how good controlling the storm is on this particular gamer there is two games for you I hope you enjoyed them if you did be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the our temper and I'll see you on the next one
