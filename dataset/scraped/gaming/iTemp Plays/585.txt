hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the solo ranked grind is back we are currently in planet four and that is not good enough so i jumped on i got me some random teammates and i've started climbing the ladder to diamond once again i would absolutely love to make masters this season it's definitely possible but i was at a disadvantage just in terms of time investment though because i started this season at bronze four i mean the lobbies were easy obviously but it's pretty time consuming just getting out of bronze and silver sometimes i wish you could just skip a division or two but it's all good we're on the road to diamond again and i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right the towers of charge it is me me goes blue shields please please let me have the blue blue shield r99 i'm sorry teammate i saw it first with my eagle eye vision i guess you should have that okay well there's a team that way i really wish i got that skate we are being incredibly inefficient here all right flatline's not bad all right an assault rifle on smg i am ready to scrap i'm not entirely sure if the bloodhound is ready to scrap though because i'll be honest i've taken half his stuff here but sometimes you've gotta take the stuff to get the job done you know it's the age old scene we can we run over here like we got two blue shields i'm not sure what their gun situations are like i think it's on the back oh these guys are absolutely struggling i don't get to the top it actually worked all right nice great plan i literally should have just shot him i should have just shot him what am i doing i need shields these guys are seriously struggling i'm limited shields though but there we go i think we should just full send it foreign there you go on your limited shields you don't want to fight for an extended amount of time you just want to full send it and i've got all the healables in the world what's going on over here oh my word thank you team that gets me every single time with the flatline i just never know if i'm in single fire automatic burst mode the burst mode existed i'd accidentally be on it definitely this guy's not wasting his ultimate at all you need to you need to heal up my friend i've only got six cells i've got two bats as well but i'm gonna have two cells after this and if you need a little small increments of health it's gonna be a bit of a waste i don't if anyone's got like 34 cells or something no no something they do that's a train well half the lobby's left which is good you dropping cells no okay when they stop in front of you like that i thought that was the moment i thought our friendship had reached uh cell dropping stage but unfortunately has not i have to go and source some of my own another bat three bats without crafting i don't need cells actually i'll just i'll just tank until i've lost everything here you go it's a little extended oh vault as well someone better be taking that it's fine of the century i should have landed there uh all right ring is really far away you better get a move on i didn't jump i'm just skateboarding as well i mean my setup is looking pretty tasty i must say uh but i have been in this situation so many times with random teammates in in ranked i think i i think i get a little bit too overconfident but i really can't help him when i'm playing pathfinder because i have a get out of jail free card in the form of my grapple so as long as i save my grapple and don't use it stupidly i should be okay and i say this because i get overconfident and i grapple into somewhere and as soon as you start scrapping people just come out of the woodwork i need to find someone let me down let's go this way target over there see me have they i think so nice haymaker on the way i'm swimming you guys in for a sec i'm struggling because they were firing someone there was a gunfight before we got here right something was going on you need to be that's okay it worked yes a purple extended my prayers have been answered i sound like energy depot and the ring is going to force these guys over this way so if we are quick about this we may be able to cut off these teams that are scrapping and getting on third party on the go because they have to come this way kind of a little bit like r99 here just in case anyone spin online i could put my skull on that [ __ ] no i want to be no what's it it's fine well the fight is over i'm not entirely sure if they were rift or energy d-pot rift sounds dead the boxes are unlooted the heck is that noise i think that's an ambient noise you know oh is it the replica this morning it just makes the most horrendous noise any gunshots rift still looks dead to me i see a car is that the thing there with pinging draken where's he going there's a fight over this way too hopefully he's coming to third party it will be the fourth party i'm a little bit far ahead of my team i just need to say my you're grappler at me destroyed on here as well if you wanted to double up level four neither trident that guy wasn't instant and there was a corset somewhere so i assume the caustic is the person we're looking for that is not good i got to jump respawn back where we just came from i think we cleared up i mean the good news is everyone's gonna have to come this way the bad news is it means we're supposed to just sit here for a little bit i don't like to sit in here but sometimes you got to do what you got to do still six squads left eventually someone will come this way that's actually pretty cool you can see right down see if anyone's just chilling out here enough hello friend let's all celebrate and have a good time oh friend number two nice job look at us happy family enemy over there we need to cut these guys off if we if we just run here we'll be able to get high ground on them if we let them push over they're going to have equal ground on us making contact with the enemy and they spotted me okay very my teammates are just the best players in the world that's funny angles and stuff these guys are just running through them get back here i have no idea how that heats i'm pretty good on everything oh little care pack i've only got my ultimate so i can just i mean there's about 18 ropes around here anyway for us to get to get back on please be proud please be proud of that i'm not using it target spotted okay you want to go this way you going back into the fight how can we do you coming back okay we need to make a decision here we sort of need to get out of here because those are the two teams are fighting and the rings closing all right all of a sudden we're in a bad spot this care package has baited us it wasn't worth it for a peacekeeper oh god they're on the big roof oh that big roof barry's we can chill we we've got some time we're fine i told you those other two teams are going to get involved good job where we did there's a rope up this way friends this is free high ground it's away from those other two squads as well i didn't really care i think they're on top of this building where you going teammate you going inside never mind it's a different guy she got red i'll be honest guys someone sent me on fire these last two teams this is the last team shots okay my friends i think i think it's challenging from that side running away it's a good job we heard gunshots from that direction because us running the opposite direction made it so that we were the ones pinching everyone rather than being the ones that were pinched you know that actually saved the game for us we could have been caught up in all of that mess uh and easily could have lost that game but there you go good positioning good high ground we regrouped it was a little bit the care package was an absolute bait the care package did its best to throw the game for us but we didn't we didn't somehow it nearly did but we survived 11 kills 2500 damage and a good game all around from the squad plus 189 there we go nearly plot three name beautiful
