hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and my favorite gun was buffed in season 9. the g7 scout used to be a sniper when the game came out then it was moved into the assault rifle category which definitely suited it better than being a sniper but now in season 9 it is classified as a marksman weapon alongside the bojek bow the 30 30 repeater and the triple take now that the g7 is classified as a marksman weapon its abs movement speed is being increased and the hip fire spread is also been increased these changes are essentially buffing what the g7 is good at and nerfing what the g7 is bad at medium to long range is going to be far better now as you'll be harder to hit but the g7 used to have decent hip fire but now you will be quite punished if you get caught out at close range you have to make sure that you're using this weapon as intended more now but if you've managed to do that you will be rewarded massively also today is the last day that you can get 30 off your g fuel order with my code item at checkout restock on your favorite flavors or get yourself a starter kit if you've not tried g fuel
