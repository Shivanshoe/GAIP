season 13 and she deserved them because no one was playing her to be honest and here are the buffs on screen sheila got a massive buff it takes a lot less to spin up trailer so you can actually start firing at people who are shooting at you and her amped cover got a big health buff from when you place it down and it also got a reduced deploy time as well so every part of her kit got a big buff i
