hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as you guys know i was fortunate enough to attend a capture event for season nine last week and i'm not allowed to share any footage with you guys just yet but it will be coming soon however i am allowed to talk about my impressions and thoughts about what i've got to play on the day so one of the legends i played during this capture event was horizon and the first ability i threw i instantly noticed a change to it the gravity lift her ability lifted you up far slower and your movement whilst you were in the lift was more difficult to control it isn't a confirmed change for season 9 just yet as this was just an early capture event they could have updated the numbers or just not even implemented this nerf for season nine uh but this nerf would make sense in my opinion one of the reasons horizon is so strong at the moment is that she can just zoom into the sky and pop a shield battery almost for free with the amount of movement that the gravity lift gives you and your entire team this nerve to the speed of the lift makes you more vulnerable whilst you're using this but it still keeps the utility of being able to get to really high places for your entire squat this is a welcome nerf on my end horizons have been giving me problems for a good wild night however she is fun to play because of the almost free shield battery that you can pop every time so it's one of those let me know what you guys think about this potential nerf to horizon again it isn't confirmed just yet but i will see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends not bad this is a champion this year this is your champion why are you gonna sound like daffy duck or something i don't even know what you sounded like i already i can't even replicate it what how's daffy duck that was incredible thank you you're so good you're so talented how did you know you had yeah oh if if anyone needs any daffy duck impressions let me know record a video definitely well i can only do that noise i can't does he speak does daffy speak i can't remember very little a little bit oh i gotta go well i'm dead no i changed i died i was a purple over here there's a full team on my roof get one of them i don't know where his teammate went is that the octane or the costume there's a classic somewhere i don't hear i have six seconds on my cue if you can make it to me i'll just bring you over this thank you look at flying squishy you know i've got nothing okay i can drop you a vault do you have light if you have light ammo light i got an r3 yeah i got an arc but no ammo so i dropped 40 oh you got it right here thank you there's a guy underneath me wait i didn't i'm just sitting right here on a head glitch not moving i'm trying to nade this door i'm in drinks i'm in thank you oh give me ammo i got ammo huge they're made someone's come on this left side in the same building the same building hello i'm assist i gotta pass that up to the middle nice i'll find her cracked up purple oh man we are in it he's trapped all the way uh bottom right and we've got a hole no how do i miss that i mean he wants everyone nice okay he's gonna kill me though with that triple take i got around he dropped down for his teammate actually i haven't switched i'm going to switch to a wingman because i don't have heavy eye either let's go let's go nice yeah i'm gonna go pick up this uh this wingman that i saw back here okay nice drinks i i think first people at the start they just got i'd have been way easier if i just actually thirsted people you know you did good get better than i did i was running on fumes it was actually catastrophic you got landed on again right uh i mean did i get landed on or did i do the landing on and get backfired i want to say yes yeah yeah like it could go really you could go both ways that's how you think about it here people mid map hammond i am down to head on over seems a bit more heavy but i'm still i've got a vault i'm okay i've got 40 heavy i can drop you 20. um thank you very much here i'll drop you i'll drop you 40. oh what i've got yeah i got a meg and then eight extra i dropped a good amount of light here if you need that uh i'm good thank you okay as soon as we find some heavy you're getting it i have two bats as well let me know if you need one of these you know what i would happily take one you go liberate thank you thank you no problem no issues this isn't lucid i guess we go under we go inside then probably yeah yeah probably gonna check these beans sometimes with energy i'll take it anybody need energy beautiful oh they are scrapping i want to get involved so bad energy ammo energy yo the tons of energy up top and a little bit more heavy for you beautiful oh i'm good i am good to go yeah me too and they're still fine which is nice how does poking each other they probably got third partied yeah probably throwing jump pad oh so low but right in front of me right oh but i thought let's just set it on fire what can go wrong you know i got a phoenix you need it i'm good no no no it's okay oh so much heavy i mean i'm good dude me too i did think i heard more phone north yeah this wasn't the fight that happened these guys are just like crossfire they were they were kind of here i can't tell if it's a real mirage there's a decoy in the corner 86 character underneath me i think he might be a decoy oh two teams two teams just two teams should take this take this and follow me headshot nice thanks [Music] another one i kind of figured i was like you know what either i go down here and risk it all for the biscuit or they potentially jump on you and i wasn't having it i appreciate that fortune on horizon so i just did the the quickest oh let me just sit up here maneuver but then you chunked them and delayed them enough in the storm that they were weak and they died they paid for their christmas they did i hear this before i just get terrified but i was near cover so i just i just stood there and they didn't let go of the trigger one day they will need to reload nicely dude ducks aren't you they don't they got two and they've both got gold extended heavies they got another one in the back pocket just for you we should try and make a video full speed fires four gold extendeds see i'm all for it all for it but i just don't feel confident in finding four that's the same old heavy metal i guess you only need one like one each would be fine actually technically yeah you only need one gold heavy meg actually that's super doable on king's canyon because if we land closet area that's guaranteed like one goal yeah and you just go into the vault things oh yeah this is doable we just need two one h because then you get three spitfire mags see under normal circumstances i wouldn't condone this behavior but seeing as season nine's right around the corner and we're struggling for uh for content i just feel like that's the play it's cracks yeah i think so oh you are you i was going to crack a cyanate on him no whoa he's he's pushing you you have this leg jenks not okay i got you oh my god are they right who's this guy made someone just crouched up on us thank you you don't need it i'm using a feeling of phoenix pretty unnecessary i'm going to go next last thing last team last team i hit one i don't know my ultimate oh that is landing right on him i didn't see me for like 190. the other guy for 190 then no he hit me i'm just gonna check goals let's go nice we'll play jenks that's a fun ending dude how many teams shot us i turn around there's a bangalore crouch right behind me she was sneaking up with a mastiff that was almost identical to the other game we played it was actually yeah the same thing happened where i turned the corner and there was a guy in the bin he's doing the binge training oh you're the classic bin strap i didn't really say 13 kills we kind of popped off nice okay good game 12 minutes
