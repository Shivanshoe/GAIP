hey wassup guys its rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are settling the age-old question since the star of season 4 with the changes that Prowler and our 99 has been a heated discussion which ones are better at the full auto Prowler the full auto on our time today we are going to find out I'm using both at the same time I've got a great game for you here today and I hope you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe if you know aren't you to join at the aight empire and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends Oh a mirage of Leah gd's is actually one of my favorite places to land as of late and this is always the same place that I lunch if I can I'll learn through the window because it's far quicker access to the loot and I was helping people actually gonna be here but apparently no one's turned up to the party no no one got their invites my teammate did he's got himself dog shields already some an outrageous well I'm styling a party it's always behind in the corner for getting this you get to these old buildings you get two chances to get purple shields each possible okay and explain this he's season 4 with the changes Theon lights on in the Prowler there's been a lot of questioning which one's better and I keep going back and forth whenever I use the online tonight I think the on i-29 and whenever I use the pilot within a select-fire section I think there's proud is better but I don't make that decision today today I want to use both I should probably take that should night just because we've got a Bangalore on our team and it's very likely that it's gonna be smoke everywhere and I am NOT going to be able to see a gosh-darn finger teammates I'm heading to the loot fault of doom I've got myself the key of destiny let's go this way I'm gonna get myself my own gold shields or at least that's the plan the only thing with this double SMG set up is that a close range I'm very dominant at least that's the plan hopefully that's how it works out god I hate looting in these sublime easy there's too much annealing liens I can't actually aim up what I want to pick up I know I keep saying but it's each true but a long range I'm gonna be screaming good so I'm gonna have to utilize my distance clothes and abilities to actually get involved in this crap you like no you can't well since no no absolutely not one of the few gold guns I will not pick up and if you saw my video backs at your party remember why my accuracy nothing is absolutely horrendous this has been a decent or looked alts I mean we don't have comic shields we've got the gold helmet got knocked down and a gob back and there's a scrap in the not-so-distant distance you can never get to train yard and not hear someone scrappy fortunate for the squad you boys path - are we getting free access to little bird cages - I'll just get involved that they've they're scrapping again [Applause] recharging come on Gibby get over here friend Bangalore's here she's getting involved she's down to one that's good oh my gosh she's weak don't die and give them your gold shields sub me in French melted when I get to a vigil altar my first instinct was to say where on earth were you but then I remembered that I am Pathfinder and I utilize my distance clothes and abilities to close the distance and trip also does not have that option of course but here we go these guys had the loot for kills not the kill leader unfortunately someone's beat me Tilly happy days now hear a train yard this is the perfect place to be for SS em jeez I mean if they're up top in the bird cages it may be a bit of a problem well what did he go where did that man go this is Russian when I guess nice this guy's got a hemlock I've been a bit too far in the old on the old grapple I could still my teammates gold armor here but I'm not gonna he took a portal I think is the last one left I'm gonna risk it if you took the portal ok sweet he was enough weak fortunately I've got two injuries but you thoughts have been off take the gold shields they hopefully just respawn because there's a respawn beacon back there he hasn't taken it just yet that's great if he if he doesn't take it and this Bangalore gets to take all the rod lutes we are laughing and I say what I feel because that's that's teammate could come on come on Maude from our Andre however you prance that word never been able to my entire life shout out your pulse of what a good guy and also me because I didn't it either you know if I say you gotta play the double SMG so you gotta get involved I'm gonna crap on their foreheads and it's a instant win on the gunfights it's gonna get my gold shields darn it hey it was blue never mind you go and get that I don't know what it's gonna be a blue stock I bet a blue stock and a level one barrel stabilizer that's not good that my friends is the power of I ground right there who's the 3v2 but as soon as I realized that like if you shoot someone and you down someone that has gold shields you want to finish the kill to quickly grab those gold shields as soon as the pattern of grappled away that's looting hard here possess some trees tank up so much ammo but as soon as the Pathfinder grapples away from the kill I know that we were in a decent opposition there that reported in I went up top we even do up I would you brought so when him for the the quick revive and all of a sudden we've won the good fight para high ground these guys are coming in they're gonna land in you the birdcage I think well this isn't good because I can t shoot them unless I'm in the bird cage I didn't wanna be up there anyway nice I'll have to jump down now to get that teammate and there are two squads here a friend are you back I opened this one guy of there he's really the wave sounds like and I've got two teammates in a good grief okay the Prowler the full-auto Prowler that may have been a burst one the first one has incredible DPS anyway I think what team wants to revive I got a gob Bank so I appreciate the the effort though the good grief I'm lucky I wasn't inside because he would have finished the kill and then my two teammates would have had to rush up there or maybe the prod is real good I mean I don't think that was as much the prowlin last massive extract with humongous craft in the top I don't think that was as much to do with the the difference in weapons as it was he probably just landed more shots have you put it - perfect thank you I landed as many policies he did I mean the pilot does more damage per shot you know I'm talking about enemy I can get a shot the gosh-darn train keeps moving fell off there you go that's frustrates me we shield this in Seattle I have no idea where he went I'm not gonna go to the web top like someone's in here I wanted to try and come top of the building if not careful gonna get pinched here but the people in the birdcage and then we've got people to another tunnel too come on in Oh painless is waiting my grapple what is wrong with me teammate salty I don't even think they're up there I think they've portal Dawei quick that means that they can take the portal back there at any time this is a separate team I don't know where the poor goes so as this type team is the right involved in this team here or what why did she go stop posting leave them there there we go we're on the same page as to be so quiet there because I I needed to hear if they were okay he's moving the same time I was the Bloodhound oh look who it is mr. I don't miss any shots they're heroes mr. one hundred percent accuracy with a prowler at close range good grief I think I need his accuracy that's just unfortunate I reckon he went back to the banners they would have explained a long time ago but maybe he was a chili now in a corner as soon as he was like a solo and everyone around here was like a part of a big team is unlucky from him all right there's no way to this team I think it's a live phone an acoustic and maybe even a race that's whether the Wraiths portal went as well there's no way they're to push the same way that we did if I were in their position I'd have just gone in there they're either in the store they followed us once in the storm we saw on that on that boat that's our boat you have to deal with these team and then go reclaim our boat from this team that's camping up there it's got a G's haven't scaring a dream stop there Oh still aiming at me are we Rocky's near intersection please leave me alone I've done nothing to you absolutely nothing literally thought he was already down that guy to it see something I've got a right force that you've already got a bad back to the boat mighty nice don't over loot here and kept poked by the g-seven skate and then dinosaur know that for the mekinese alright this is going to be a bit of a problem if they've backed up back to the boats which I assume they have they have indeed I've got two smg's I need to close the distance many people we talking at least two I think it's three people think it's a full team it's sat on our boat thank you don't I teammates come on a flank mission nice that's one day I wake that's how you get this is our boat ah the worst crap of the century I've completely ruined the mood good job to protect at a washout take the team extends the Gibraltar was bright always coming in for the revive didn't still the Bangalore looked even though she had gold shields and stuff 13 kills 2600 damn he's not bad at all 1750 from the Gibraltar and nearly 2,000 from the Bangalore Bangalore code that last fight she downed it she got like opening down and that allowed us all to just rush them we killed 20 people there and I don't think we killed anyone until there was about 35 people left we didn't see anyone until he went to the vault which cleared 66% of our Lobby from that point on that was a great game I don't know which one's better the probably I know tonight I'm none the wiser I mean I did get absolutely bodied that game bond a bloodhound who was using a prowler so maybe it is the private I don't know personal preference we're none the wiser friends hopefully you enjoyed that game though thank you for watching and I'll see you on the next one
