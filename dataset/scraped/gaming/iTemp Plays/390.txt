hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're going to be playing some solo apex and i am here to explain why my channel sort of changed in season 4 or 5 from what it was like before that so the simple answer is to why i don't really play solo anymore is skill-based matchmaking i'm maybe like a mid-tier masters player i can hold my own in those ranked lobbies like those like masters pred lobbies i'm not a pred player i'm not a top 750 player in the world i'm just not but i can hold my own in those lobbies and do okay considering like it's not you won't see me in those lobbies i think god this guy's terrible get him out of here sometimes i'm bad sometimes i'm good but i'm i'm a solid masters player so when apex throws me into a public games against so many other masters players or even a few pred players in there my chances of winning go down drastically especially if i'm not using my best weapons if i'm trying to make a mozambique video or an re45 video and i'm playing solo chances are i'm just gonna get destroyed by someone there's a masters player with a vaulter and r9 the change to matchmaking made content creation kind of tough in that regard but i'm not here to complain about skill base because it's healthy for the game when the newer players have more of an opportunity to play and learn the game without being destroyed by people that are playing every single day for for eight hours a day it's just that's just the way it is i do like my solo content but it is so demoralizing having to talk to myself for two hours whilst playing solo with no guarantee of getting a video when i could just team up with so far janks or ragtag whoever it is and have that team cohesion that makes game videos better and playing with them is a lot of fun as well i do want to upload more solo stuff so i will try and incorporate more of it on the channel if i can but yeah thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right screw it cts and me amigos someone told me that it is actually miss amigos but i forget every single time um all right g7 pk i'm down for this low day i'm gonna give the pk a go the game is testing me though give me an either eight straight away all right that was a zero out of ten all right well a lot of people have also been asking me to to break my grapples again and uh listen i think a guy is like on day 312 or something i think it's actually like um 70 or so i believe but the reason i don't is that because i don't play solo that often at all like imagine playing with someone for like three hours and every time they use an ability with the legend they're playing the like that was a three out of ten let's explore it this way it would just get incredibly annoying for the other person um so that is why i don't know i guess i could mute my mic and write the grapples but that is why there's a team and denise is here making contact with enemy it's not like a separate team wondering for what i have no idea what's going on i have a pretty much naked g7 oh yeah well thanks for this mate i appreciate getting shot from across the entire man and i've got a pk with oh i've got another one shot involved on in the other direction okay oh there's like a little hole or something stopping me right here i need an extender until i find these attachments i'm i'm gonna be struggling it's going to be tough uh i only have 6 bear time potentially should have shot the guy standing still first [Music] all right scraps of city has been good to us 700 damage with a questionable loadout if anyone fancies a purple it's up for grabs i have three shotgun shells one of these people died like oh there we go oh thank you next time as well these the attachments i was looking for team i played with this octane earlier on it seems like a decent player pretty good guy i think he's in his inventory i was trying to communicate through the interpretive art form of dance but it wasn't really working out there's a team here that's why i stopped the grapple not because it was a zero out of ten and any if anyone says that was zero ten in the comments i will i will swiftly give you a bang they are holding hands but it is okay because i can beat them from up here this always happens this is like writing me down them like i still knew the two as well or at least i stunned one of them and there's a team at train just ruining everything ruining my day are they bit like there's a ramp up beneath us i don't know i don't know which team this was this train team who who on earth is shooting at me and how are you shooting me and not the lifeline okay that my friend was just there and she wasn't i'm so confused i don't even know where these people are thank you recharging perhaps armor switch uh i have some 100. it's so nice having a lifetime on the team it means it means you can just rush like a maniac especially as a pathfinder because you are usually in the fight first you know these guys not here still oh i thought i thought the scrap was ongoing i thought it was an ongoing scrap um i need a better shot than fault like this is oh big reds humongous race like i'm i'm bad with the pk anyway then give me a level one shotgun bolt i'm struggling even more get this going on my hands i'm just the worst i'm i'm the worst please don't please don't embarrass me like this all right all right i've thought about it i've got some excuses first of all i'm on the new york server still so i'm on 80 ping second of all if i had a better shotgun bolt i could have shot quicker and not hitting four i think the last one was eleven and third um third excuse is that um i've got nothing i don't want to use this gun anymore i just i can't use the speaker i don't know why people like it why do people like the pk answers on a postcard if anyone knows the answer to that i'd be interested to know because i i honestly think i'd rather have a mozam half the time i'm so bad with this gun and it's kind of it's kind of depressing i'll say it is kind of depressing when i get punched out by so much do you know how embarrassing it is to die to someone that's been respawned i've jumped across the map first he's anything for an extra kill and then this guy just punches me in the face i mean it's nearly as bad as this grapple almost as bad i need i need a mental reset okay run five kills and we got nearly 1400 damage this is this is a decent position to be in going into um going into the top ten we're okay we don't have the the pk anymore the level one shotgun bob wasn't helping but the pk in general he's just a tough time we've got two guns that i'm really comfortable with and we are in a strong position i mean we are sticking together as a cohesive unit here it's not often you get that as um as like a random of course there you go i mean as soon as i drop it three at least the lifeline can still easy might be something good this way you're welcome i love you too was that my teammates steamer was that appreciate my teammates i i don't want to push um i don't want to push the tunnel alone so i'm just going to wrap around because i'm pretty sure there was a scrap over this way ah it's a good thing it's a very good thing but i am real far away i think it gives you an extra two bullets per clip for the for the g7 compared to the blue it's probably just not worth it i mean this looks like muted don't need that still yes you've got a level one back i know the struggle here level two we've all been there i'm almost certain they might have just been fighting in the tunnel or maybe it was harvester i need 18 damage until i get ready i don't know how i must have switched purples about three times then i don't know how i don't have red yet i have purple fairly early on i think these guys are looting oh he made it in can i get 18 damage draken i don't i want to die free i'm not going to die free using i feel like i die in these these engagements quite often just because the um the doors are kind of annoying because you can't really play around them is that oh that was their arc sorry i heard it i heard them cooking the arks out before it's basically about who sticks together the most there you go this one up top always landed on us okay it's not someone it's a full team of three multiple squadrons here reloading i see what's going in i'm down to push these guys that could give me fairly weak lifeline i got back for you i must have gone that way i was completely bamboozled then i stood no chat i was near every decoy and not near him at all these guys seem pretty far away i can hear a triple take i'm actually going to give three times ago and i need some syringes usually you would use the three times and then drop it towards the end as the circle gets smaller but there's two squads left and this is such an open ending here oh well that was waste time extended heavy mag here level four but the yeah the three times might come in useful is all i'm trying to say might be something good this way i got shot up by spitfire and a triple take oh he's down that guy this is the banquet trying to get back over to her teammates maybe not she might have been trying to but then we sort of destroyed her teammates and yeah i think she thinks you didn't want any of this smoke oh you don't have uh i have a little thing attached to you what's going on there we go last two teams one on the solos so we should try and team up with the solo to beat the other team of potentially teamer two team okay nevermind last squad this might honestly just be the mangrove nice that's a great game we had such good teammate coordination you are the apex champions i was actually throwing this game look at that four revives none with four revises ever been carried that's i mean i went down how many times i got punched by someone that got respawned the man had nothing i had a peace keeper and purple armor he punched him in the face like 12 times and i died so i mean slightly embarrassing but that's a great game that's a real gg thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
