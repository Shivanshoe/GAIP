hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we've got a new trailer for caustics town takeover with it comes a new heirloom a new area on the map of water treatment on king's canyon a new item and a whole load of cosmetics first of all let's look at bangalore's heirloom this is called the pilot's knife and it looks so clean and so sleek it will be available to purchase if you have a shards after the event but if you want to join the two weeks then you'll have to buy all of the packs which may be pretty pricey next up let's take a look at the new area on the map caustics town takeover this place looks incredible i love these sorts of areas of fighting there are plenty of buildings and cover loads of outplay potential and inside we can see a mechanic in the trailer uh which releases a ton of noxious gas on the inside of the building but once the gas is gone there will be four gold loot spawns there for you to pick up but you've got to be quick because the gas will come back and it will kill you now we have a playlist take over as well called ring fury these are pockets of the ring which appear in the safe zone and expand cutting off more areas of the map that are safe to counter this we are getting a new item called the heat shield this won't take up a slot in your inventory because we get a new survivability slot which can also house a respawn beacon there as well which is great news so the new item keeps you safe from the rink for quite a while but the time decreases as the ring grows stronger as the game progresses also healing items are 50 quicker and revives are 20 quicker inside the bubble but that doesn't work if you use this item whilst you are in the safe zone so this is a huge update coming to the game there are plenty of weapon and legend change is coming as well which i will be covering over the next few uploads so make sure you subscribe to the channel to stay updated today i have two games of ranked for you and the second one ranks me up promotes me to diamond so hopefully you enjoy that thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah i'm uh oh my goodness massive shotgun here oh teammate just got rolled trust in the old father they're raping hard whatever that guy is he's not anvils he just exploded cracking on the back with the horizon jumped on my head i'm climbing up practicing horizons one shot you need to crack your bait uh cause it causes one bullet i mean that's all i meant i thought man nice taking a moment to heal them he's still here what a night and day difference from last game huh i mean yeah nine scores left in a little place look at these seven squads left and the game before that as well yeah funny how rain can be like that huh yeah i'm gonna steal pier for a sec because i hear people save i don't know if they'll come these i think they're furthest out than that it's probably a bad call you're probably right though you're probably right just like both them coming this way yeah keep running finally bro this is why i got to play arcade that's his first jump pad of the game you would have had nine by now oh they're trying to get up they're on the balloon they're flying above our head they've gone this way what's going on here that guy's flash damn how far did

the game just died you should drop you is yeah nice merchandise uh if you grab a nine there's a blue light right beside you oh beautiful thank you i took the blue light man like an idiot i got that jumbled up in my head i all right thanks for playing guys [Laughter] that wasn't even like like anywhere near being a close fight they're they're going to uninstall energy ammo or our lobo is gone i

phoenix i'm okay actually you've got that thank you shields are recharging we have to leave it oh beautiful i can sell up but like if you could just drop two of those that'd be great thank you yes sir i was saying that like hey they know there's a lot of team on all right okay seem on all right they might come behind us maybe racecracked 150 ray just died by that team behind us nice strengths they're in this little cut and there should be one more team in the storm i'm gonna push i'm gonna flank him okay recharging shield down the crypto expect one more team to come from uh the riverside i just got hella focused i cracked two of them [Music] triumvirate yes it's completed don't worry about that i know you were looking for oh that is just such a good thing thank you there's still fighting in the storm behind us i am down to push after shall i let you know for any future try and bring updates of course of course keep me in the loop but it's complete at the moment but if anything change i'll let you know i got a couple pads set up so we can look at this bounce around here i thought for sure that one of these one of these teams was gonna come up this way they just went the other way all together so after this there was a bit of a late-game lull in the action we rotated to the final safe zone we were trying to gatekeep this team that we had locked down in this little bunker i'm actually down one of them but janks couldn't push in with me because they had a corsic so we just let them live we were there for rp not kills you know now this wasn't the world's best game but it was the game that took me to diamond so i thought i would share with you guys anyway i'll let you watch the late game here it was chaotic by the way i haven't tested this i don't know if you can stand up there i don't think you can mate i don't think i remember it forcing me off can i get rid of this imagine if we could stand up there that would be amazing oh three other squads left this is gonna better this gotta be we're the only duo yeah oh no we have to get past them somehow we could take this pad and pad right over their heads give it a go i don't know if we want to do it first yeah we want to do it yeah yeah we want to do it they had the same idea they did it right at the same time we did i'm gonna try to get ahead so i can shoot you back oh oh janks tanks tracks i can't get you i'm coming to you dory what the heck there's a sheila here to shoot me as well oh my god there's two nobody took this into account bro oh this is bad it's bad i'm down uh one bad three cells i i've got about oh no i don't okay i am a course that's perfect that's perfect i don't have that many heavy i'm gonna save my headphones oh my gosh there's two stitches nobody took that into account have they not seen each other i guess these teams here because of that though mate there's a pad there's a bed right there i know that's mine oh okay depending on me depending on me i'm going to do a thing to him i'm going to do a thing to him i hit him in the heart behind five see him in here give me that red oh my god oh nice i didn't know which way they went so i looked the wrong way when i got in i've there to the rank of diamond
