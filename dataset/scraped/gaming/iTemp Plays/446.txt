hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have two games for you with the hammer point mozart and i love this gun with hammers because of how unassuming it is with the peacekeeper and the mastiff there's a decently long time between shots and a big animation and the mozam just sort of it just like pew pews and eats for a hundred so casually it's amazing i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i might land on the balcony it's repositioned here um let him below you there's a team a guy with you don't shoot me there wasn't a single gun on that really yeah you got to go up top though reverse there's yeah i don't have any shield is he top okay he's up top he's staying in place massive scrap over this way i don't have any throw balls um i have one or a couple actually what i'm saying in the corner another team going up found one very nice i have hammers nice it's like a truck but probably can't land a shot we'll see yeah i can't land anything with those i have two phoenix's two bats my adventure is looking real weird right now i'm still i'm still blown away by like he's a tactical how far you could throw it is uh the tactic uh is it the tactical or the uh yeah the tactical the little explosion yes yeah yeah this thing goes so far and this is passive in general [Applause] wait it just knocked me out of my own wait wait it actually just denial kind of oh my god they're just multiplied that was insane they were i i'm actually really upset i need nothing really it's definitely a few of them again uh no i need to draw back i think it's just two and one away yeah they're just running right sorry i was i was you know i expect another team coming i was going third zone good i'm not going to put him up on this one's gonna phoenix it up i played well played oh oh which i swear oh right right in front yeah box hoisin doing the finish all three i love how just ridiculously broken the spitfire is and it's like almost the same as it was when the game first came out it was i think it's when it starts when the game came out all the guns were broken arthur was a laser beam yep and no one no one was really good at the game so now that everybody knows how to play the game and uh everybody kind of has a feel for it it just makes the gun that much worse yeah the wing members everybody everybody's pretty good now yeah they are or at least they know which guns are good and stuff yeah i mean it's kind of like i see the game kind of like fortnight the way the way fortnite kind of evolves because when fortnite first came out i mean people were terrible at that game no one knew how to do anything and then within like two three years like everyone knew how to build everyone knew how to do something everyone knew the mechanics honestly like six or seven months silence i'm not with you at all why are you challenging me someone's here on the right different team i think i'm just letting everybody know we're here nice nice nice if they're up top they won't be able to see where they are they don't know and they still see they can see come on wait they don't know yet care package incoming let's get to the lz come on in okay nearly cracked this is impossible i'm here with you oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh my god that guy's got blue just letting you know i'm gonna bet reno i hate this gun so much i'm using an alternator from 300 yards to put it to travel i feel like i could throw them faster than this gun fires them have you ever tried to throw like a like a tiny piece of paper and it doesn't weigh enough to to go through the air that's what it's gonna feel like like a really poor uh like a really poorly built um paper plane ring not even that like backwards exactly like a backflip oh they're coming across they're coming across the rope okay don't let them know that we know and then just beam them you ready all right i'm using an alternator you are a scam artist you just want damaged in here yeah i'm sorry i mean when i'm using the strip fire it's hard not to crack so with that with a with the thingy you're giving her smoke puncher puncher punch watch it oh yeah i'll never get old dude the sheer panic i'm sure that she's experiencing you are the teammate party i just left you know like our teammate did look at him in the champion screen yeah poor guy how was my p20 game by the way oh yeah yeah nice solid someone's here someone's there you're either no don't you steal that one this guy's weak on me this guy's not weak he almost switched okay i got you the golfing oh nice oh my god let's go through one golf mozam um i'm gonna pick up this p20 and i'm just gonna risk it i have to look in these bins just to maybe find out every point please explosive hold right there why is it so hard it's actually impossible smoke on me i'm on my way although brought over a little bit more i need access to that someone's flying in up here too this is going to be wait till i get my cue and we'll just fly over i've got eight seconds yeah i thought it might alt on these people over here i'm dropping this guy not with you exactly okay no i missed him i should be dead i missed all my shots with a mozam oh my god 14. are you kidding they better shoot this guy oh bloodhounds one okay i'm trying to keep the stock plane off us oh they're flying up top i'll just get out of here all right i'm going to i'm going the other [Music] he's in here oh no on me other door

minutes before on olympus lebron yeah but we won in seven minutes we are running around for like twenty why is my gun in single fire what am i doing there he's gone oh i'm punching him there's always talking about this people here it's not the last time you wait why because the storm's coming in why not show over here i'll raise you there you probably could have moved i need my red back oh my god i just messed up i'm gonna make a meme where it's like so far when he's popping off and it's just like a like a deep like a beast man a beast and it's like so far when richie's popping off and it's just some little fairy oh what do you what does that even mean means means it means what it means i mean if that's the case then it goes both ways right no i always try to win i've got the winner's mentality i've got a winner's mentality i'm just a winner all round i mean you know we haven't [Laughter] thank oh i'm not ready for this oh i think i was looking for a wingman uh they're over here i think it's just one guy he's very aware oh oh bless him he's a champion he just didn't i remember he didn't have any teammates that's so oh he probably just sat in a corner for the entire game poor guy he probably thought he probably that was probably his first fight
