they're gonna die back his ability they're gonna die back the team actually landed there a few teams do wait i need all these there's miles i have my alt oh nice okay let's do it sorry boys i'm picking up a lot of fan lights oh look at the info dude you can see the color of armor and everything oh that's so op what nice i'm getting beat in the back he's got a problem he's climbing up it's broken i can see him the whole time oh my god that's so sick it's definitely not the same out of that way right yeah they're at market i'm alton i have my ability in a sick oh the fire rate goes really fast it does once you crank it that's crazy the recoil is kind of interesting too the recoil like all over the place it's with without with that being charged it's so easy to control i can't remember it's like being charged though ah no oh god oh god this isn't you what is happening i don't know what to do what do we do how do you counter it isn't he's broken the uh nice [Music] it's a nice little combo oh wait i'm gonna go for every care package ever okay do it dude i'm i'm actually gonna go to climatizer i want to go look at this i never got to see the map where's that it's by epicenter open supply bill it's way bigger than you think well oh this is a family-friendly set of channels what is going on jesus it just happened so fast uh huh no no dude this place is actually so that was sick fast that was the rampage uh he was he was pretty low to be honest but it's nasty it sounded beefy oh yeah it was it was charged up right there so that was like at the uh the faster fire rate yeah i got my ulti popped wait that was there all day i should have got rid of him nice [Music] i yeah i have to get used to this recoil the recoil on the scene is pretty crazy i should have played over the last few days because i'm feeling like a big name like a really it's a good job i've got a spitfire i'm just going to say that what is what is uh what's the music are we finding different themes uh i'm with you i'm with you i think this guy's one i'm gonna go around him oh my god rng he's broken again rng on this gun is crazy just like uh spraying it just like full spraying it from kind of far and that thing bounces everywhere really yeah it's cool though it's it's so strong next game if we could could we land at climatizing absolutely we can or like near and go in i want to go in it i just looked over top of it and it looks amazing but i want to go in it oh yeah it's it's absolutely huge that place i need two times if you guys see one just behind us so when they i can't tell the difference like when i'm actually scanned by enemy does it yeah i need to i need to look for that i'm the same and they had an ultimate before and i walked straight past it because i didn't realize i was actually scanned wait 75 meters it's huge from 75 meters away for that put that in perspective i can see the edge of this cliff from where i am this way wow so you could actually like find people yeah that's just school time he might take bloodhound uh bloodhound as in meta and right i he's got so many uses it's crazy his ability's just so good oh you're all by yourself jinx engaging you'll be fine he's done [Music] all these names i have to drop here it's over there's that last one next level any person in this player base against you ah there's a purple and a rampage come on oh no stop rampage it's not rampage is it 30 30. oh i don't know where anything anything is revenant cracks i'm getting tracked here's one going why am i trying to flank when they can literally try me through if you want it you know i i don't want a repeater no wait basically sorry oh oh booster no no no it's a turbo what are you saying right now rich i don't know mate the vibes are all off you got my hopes up dude i was ready for a booster i am really sorry i'm damn bad i'm taking bags from my brothers i don't know what it is but when rich goes down bad like the way you said i'm down bad it's not that funny i'm even further damn bad wait on the other side i can't even see him hit by what was that oh he's got 33. i'm trying to lock my heart in a respectable place is that what he hit me with are you just destroying me with that i kind of get over there without this gondola hey i imagine oh there's a fuse here i'm coming over from the condor give me a sec i fell down i fell back i thank you you're right about the rate of fire on the on the rampage it gets a little he's a little getting used to oh 100 i'm kind of happy about that though because it's not one of those guns that anyone can pick up and just be insane with yeah definitely takes like a little getting used to like you seeing me with it i've seen you with it rich i was not even remotely impressed the dummies let's get to the next uh no probably about like 10 seconds i don't know why i've run off into the sunset but i have this i'm going for a twenty song rich got to see all this this is new yeah brand new to me oh the gold if anyone has any space for that i can grab it for you oh that would be tremendous thank you can you put it in the middle of all of us save just me with me like i could oh it's all kicking off i'm gonna die rampage stuff oh no so far no come really is across the entire map where's the closest balloon oh dude playing solo queue is going to be impossible now it's going to be literally impossible with uh sears and bloodhounds if you literally call the fireworks i'm just griefing these teams you're doing great you're doing great i'll be there looking at stuff bro it's really nice it comes with comms i have 10 i have nothing on my g7 so i've got 10 shots per clip if i had anything more these guys are all dead i don't know about that yeah but 10 he's like i need help okay rich you put this upon yourself i'm down to it i can't get my kills deal with the consequences i've got no bats i've got four cells we're all we're almost there oh yeah i absolutely should have there's a team down low there's a team in this building there's like everybody else in here right now look everybody still wants to go capital city for the love of christ i need some big scans where the scans are i've got two seconds you would have seen all the scans if you were here mate for the biggest game you've ever seen look at that look at that look at that i'm hitting the guy on the stairs so far needing him right now he went in second floor you got a 1v1 on the second floor with that guy does anyone have any shields this gun makes a lot of noise oh my god yes it does what is all this noise i haven't even used it the lobby's dead already i haven't done anything ah oh sorry sorry god sorry look at this cheese oh my god sorry sorry sorry no calm down calm down everyone chill i almost died i saw you and i just stopped all be bad i feel like it might it should be like a movement because if someone is sitting still like if i'm writing for example for rp i don't know it seems to be it should be like a small version of his old basically like because that's how it's all yeah yeah but you can't like shoot whilst it's up so he's just like a passive like a proper passive that makes sense yeah if you're just standing still you could rat whoa have you seen it down here guys have you seen it down here they changed it oh my god there's some great views if you go underneath there i don't check every spot i'm just making sure i'm making sure the breach was sturdy you you just you somehow managed to make falling into the lava worse by popping a bat for like about thirty do you know why i got four bats and two cells i got four best and two sounds oh you're a mess get behind me get back i gave you batteries hold on i gave you my badge bro yeah i picked him up i picked him up didn't i yeah but now you have four yeah how much did you drop damn there was eight though oh i didn't use that all right the the team synergy is uh absolutely i've never seen it i'm pretty sure there's a team here but i'm just running past him to go for the scare package i have another old that's not hopping i'm going to place oh on hobby huh oh yeah right next to me [Music] can you make it to me oh yeah lots of these lots of needs need to pop my oils i can get thermites okay come on idiot there might be my thunder please i'm cranking mine okay mine oh god he's watching i'm coming back he came back by the way the care package wasn't worth it again yeah there's purple armor and a 2-4 that's been there since the start guaranteed just no one's been over here all right we're not being third party because there's no one he's saying five minute radius i see him he's right here oh and you could just tap that thing oh i feel bad watching more videos i'm not gonna go steamrolling why would you just there's two in this two minutes up the rampage jinx the comms it's just always one person ow how am i always so far from everything i was just talking about oh he's flying at me i look like a flying squirrel ah i really wanted to punch and then i realized that we probably didn't hit this guy hello [Music] you are the apex if i knew this god rocked up to capital city we would have been able to eighth part of this big fight yeah i think we're doing it all wrong i mean i was doing all right so yeah i didn't know then i found so much damage off that team
