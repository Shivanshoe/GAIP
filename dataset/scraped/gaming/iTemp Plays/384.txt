hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the longbow and for some reason we are in a separate reality here because i've been enjoying sniping on apex and you guys seem to enjoy watching it giving the response to yesterday's sentinel games i've got a lot of nice comments about it i really do appreciate it and with the sentinel i told you i enjoyed using it close range with the one times hcarg but with a long bow i really like taking people out at long range with a three-time scope and you'd think this would be the opposite because the sentinel is like a lever action i believe that's the term i'm a gun fanatic as you can tell and the long bow is just it's almost like an assault rifle in many ways just a little bit slow firing um but no i i've really enjoyed the long boat at long range the three times it just seems to work well for me and this isn't one of those games where i say i'm using a longbow but most of my kills are with an r301 or something no i stuck with it and in many engagements that it wasn't supposed to win i still stuck with it i was having too much fun so thank you guys for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends was he yesterday who was yesterday was his game crash his game was crashing yeah but it was still really fun and then today with you it was we've been having fun hey good times unfortunately i didn't get a gun most of them be curse again bro oh that's the yeah she's looking back 106 on one of them from here with a no sight longbow i'm gonna let you i'ma let you go handle that uh i have a long bone that's not an old snake down the right look decent but okay maybe not then i'm just finding people in this miles away one bullet this is great news this is the rape i punched off spawn i felt kind of bad but i needed the boot mate so he's uh he's a good player too yeah he shot me shot me all right well and because he shot you he had to pay for his crimes uh yes exactly don't you dare ever shoot i tell you i mean why would you bother you know not on my watch i'll say that on my watch it makes me angry not even if there's a fire no mid yeah yeah which flight cracked yeah you cracked him here's the flesh i think i hit the other guy unless it's just him on the ground oh my god you scared me i thought i was getting dirty oh my god i almost stabbed you i just dropped a shotgun purple on these days over here oh i don't know how long i've had that i apologize that's okay i got my look at all these frags is this you uh yes rich that's unacceptable though the purple bolts i don't care about but you believe in three frags on the floor like that yeah i don't like carrying throw balls if i don't have a decent bag i hate it but over 100 sniper isn't really not necessary either so here we are oh it's totally necessary i need a yes i do it zooms in quicker i'm quick scoping i'm trying to join phase i feel like you were so genuine when you said that i am mate very much do you appreciate that i am juiced bro wingman purple mag massive purple bolt i call my ultimate somebody's getting boozled oh yeah multiple times the best mirage in the world third best rush in the world don't you forget it are they in here he was still firing me from the top careful this car's rocking up behind as well you're padding away nice i'm gonna i'm gonna stay up here for a second yeah yeah you're okay come on he sent one of these decoys towards me and they both walk towards me w keen that's just not it nah i did bamboo shots rich down one he's the sniper guy so many bats high fives no i'm good luckily definitely what i need is another team to crank an emote on that's all i need in my life look at you i'm proud of you bro what is this sentinel game earlier now you're bopping with a beat yeah i might have to know what's happening he would have changed man a couple weeks ago he comes up he says oh i like i like the wingman now like oh did you i mean i'm gonna need you to watch my video where i may we made the three stack give up for mid game because i was like i triple head i'm just triple head showing people in arrangements i won you played with so far yeah yeah right yeah that's how that one i need to set that i uploaded that too how did they i think so i said i had to say in a video like sorry guys i know i've used the wingman a lot cause i just kept using it every time i used it i was popping off sorry it's like the most satisfying gun to use i feel like if i use a wingman every video people wouldn't even care because it's just fun to watch yeah it's not overpowered and it's just you know it's a little bit of flair a little bit of style you know yeah you can put some sass on your kills you could buy an l star in arenas but i mean no you know it's just corny there's two different people in this world bro when it comes to like guns like if there's a spitfire and a wingman on the floor i'm picking off the wing man you know and that's what separates the the the man from the boy i just like the wing man me too now we are the wingman the winged mandem i don't like this rope but come up this rope it's horrendous and try to try to just aim just look towards me and try to come up this way you can't oh she's gonna nail it how'd you do that incredible move mechanics perfective perfected over years of fps gameplay i'm blown away that was pretty incredible i just ran off after today i don't even know how you did that hold on like it doesn't work i'm touching nothing i'm touching nothing on my controller let me try this i go up i go up the rope i touch nothing i go nowhere wait i'll just nail it again are you looking over here i'm like looking a bit upwards maybe no i'm looking i'm looking where you're telling me like 90 degrees this way bro i look up a bit try look up i'm looking up i'm telling you it's not a thing this rope is broken this reminds me so during that video where there's like a ledge behind the sign and you spent like 15 minutes trying to get onto this ledge with me that was a good game hit the injector seat that's a true octane man right there here we go whoa are you off to me i went straight up in the air where is he shooting i don't know i'm gonna try this rope again i'm gonna aim like this way see someone out there oh so i've read no way really yeah i mean he's getting three times long mode for the third best longbow player in the world i see what you did there that was good oh he's upside down what is this oh big five on him hold on there's only one oh that game mate what do we even do what i'm doing i'm getting triple taken in the back careful it works so incredibly well ah the triple take has been heard this is the time time they're getting third parties nice these last two teams yeah all the teams are here this is a big value phoenix they've been breathful to this mate the rebels i've seen today okay yes he made it the ref should be cracked i think for all these boys it worked so incredibly well it worked so incredibly well i can't get over how good the strat is i mean what's going on that was a great ending dude that's so fun this game is the best what it's been the best session i've ever played yeah honestly honestly this entire session that you and i have played has been incredible this is so the most fun i've had playing apex in a long time this is great i think getting sent into the edit to get shot out with the longbow oh gg bro you cooked with that ball look at that i barely use the alternator you know i use it against an octane and that was pretty much it nice dude good job that was a fun game mate jj
