we got a kill it's a scardy i'm a devotion gamer that way i pulls off the trump card okay this is gonna be a kill I promise I believe I'm right here let's go this way I mean there's a box in the middle of a car you want to try and get you know what it probably would've been a kill that ship wasn't in the way Eddie's uh blessing yetiz alts out right to make him a little bit oh yeah I'm good I hope they push this oh they didn't even push you I thought they would and wished his kill me if I had a single fire hemlocks if they change you want to take a different angle okay I'll take gym time wonderful thing let's go to the box yes Mac or this way these are here Barbara 5000 the Devo weird even quicker but I'll hop down off something and it does the animation oh I see sorry roids I have so many batteries oh this guy's six I'm stocking up I have three Phoenix is along with it I'm body does not carry cells yeah I'm so close to dropping them I only have six cells on the four Oh some top okay there's another how funny without healing thank you very much the pathway to have that trees curved ask him bamboozle behind it's right behind it he does indeed but he's affected by little profile so if his little arm is sticking out it counts as a full Joss that's true I'm actually thought about but this is the only place we haven't been yeah we feel like we haven't been anywhere near cage at all this is this used to be my favorite spot before they destroyed it bridges do bridges I'll link bridges so much more than this yeah me too it's a shame it's still pretty decent here it's been a nostalgia as well our four squads left I would bet that they're on the cage I had my own thing and I have eight eight your batteries I have six so we're really healthy against beyond age oh yeah they're just and another one stay away from that before you okay well they use all of their utility on us thick Dida and wants to talk I see yeah thanks for playing a little toxic but you know that was sign here good shot they deserve it those little wieners they didn't even say anything of repair how dare you while healer was looking for Oaks at the moment in a good way alright oh they're fine our way yeah in the best way that poor guy at the beginning got it he got exploded did you know he really did that poor head I went down about where are they going safe zone this way there's a triple-a going this way they could turn back up here I doubt they would but they could there's a guy there right here there on the bins care for these triple tight going okay no one started right here by the road oh yeah he jumped on my news gravel dude is it always teammates did that save your game somebody's finally home oh my god this is gonna be interesting season babies in the zone in like play I don't know I think I'm gonna play this corner over here and try to keep try to be a third party in trick okay three much different angles now horn up top is basically shirtless that's right nicely to that I'm okay that's gonna do absolutely nothing I can't use a flat line at range oh no no no no the Brico pants around us for that the way it goes sideways is messing everything yeah this okay thanks we have a guy from the Shelby bomb this is a Pathfinder yeah then we got placed on a little slower here yeah I agree I have no throw balls I should have picked him up instead of these needles I could just see on topic I thought with heavy bullets you could just shoot open doors open the door doesn't work yeah I don't want to play to aggress he's gonna massive and I still had my re 4500 that's rough yeah nice show been in here that what the team has to push them that work that way they got zone again really great they're really just not gonna move are they no absolutely not why is it every single game we have to be the aggressors and if we go in there I mean it's impossible that nights he's a massive yeah impossible I have a single fire him lock I open this back door this race wants to push I can tell I can t it in her eyes careful that what the team that way let's go they have to push side I'll shoot nice before they shoot then yeah thing that sucks though is because they're playing like that it forces us to play like it does the one speed I could drop tiny if you drop down you the one this other team this other team does not want to move yeah I think we gotta kill this other team first yeah we do I'm trying to make sure they don't he's coming up kind of there's an octane right right beneath us yeah the Pathfinder is the Pathfinder hasn't moved yet though he's only under the zip yes hold on good Rosi like even that like the other team underneath us didn't even I didn't care didn't budge like how are unified how are you not where's an end in Shorty's okay we can just say over there yeah let's go there now if they don't hear this in a thermite hit the river yeah she's quite sad this year that's what right [Music] beautiful the name fists Kennedy don't say I'm coming in for like 150 nice nice I can't believe that that game ended that way there we are here we are I think both teams had at least one person in blue I don't know how you have a devotion from Blue Shield's how does that happen and yet so many bullets in there - thank God you had a devotion yeah nice job wow you were going in okay I'm not believe that I mean you were sad to revive and respawn me but still that's okay team effort team effort
