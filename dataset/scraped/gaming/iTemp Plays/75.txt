hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing sia in ranked who i genuinely think is so underrated in the ranked environment so the split this season is on at king's canyon which is infamous for its third parties there are a few legends who are great at deflecting third parties caustic instantly comes to mind but i also think sear is really good as well because you often end up in these massive multi-team fights and sees ultimate is a great way to have a massive advantage in these brawls his heartbeat passive helps to get more kp thanks to finding solar rats that are hiding his interrupt ability is one of the best abilities in the game in my opinion though it can be very difficult sometimes and if you miss you are kind of useless that's where bloodhound does have the advantage i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh man did i say about the time i um had a meet up on card i did like a card like an open lobby on cards i opened my obviously my subs could join i was like guys this friday it's going down okay i can play some games with me it's going down and no one joined oh dude the saddest thing you've ever told me it was honestly why would you why would you start this this game with a story like that no how big were you like really were you brand new no no no i mean i was i had to pay i prayed about the beginning 1500 subs okay so i mean back then that was a lot right back then i was pretty much like really famous yeah yeah anyone playing i guess that is the saddest thing you've ever done isn't it i can't get over that and i left my i didn't leave my friends but i was like oh guys i can't play much longer i've got my open lobby i don't want to play my friends because i always play with them right yeah yeah yeah and then i i left to do the open up and then i just i had to go back to him after how's that i had to go back here i joined the party again it's already over guys sorry i don't know why i joined them back i should just say i should just went offline pretending that i was just playing with these guys so i'm just like yeah guys it went great there were so many people there were too many people we had to go yeah to have online security it was just getting crazy like people were fighting for spots yeah people getting hit just so they can play with you yeah that was unbelievable i need a i need a shotgun there's nothing in here what the heck is this mate you're the worst lobo ever how does this have anything to do with me being lobo only reason we survived is because i'm lower this is why no i can't smurf lobby because i treat him like that yes you are pushing right this way hey i'm behind you i'm ready the hot seats with the eye can not that's a really bad cereal for me i think one's on building yeah one's on buildings get up what's going around there opening fire reloading i'm under fire i shot it here bolts i don't know if it's worth using a mastiff on 120 ping without a shotgun ball i don't know that seems like a terrible idea i mean you just got to play to your strengths you know what all my strengths [Laughter] he's a good friend yeah for a long time i like that one time i you uh i uh i think it was i think i told you that that swag commented on your video like seven eight years ago he never responded and he responded like seven years later yeah i just gave him a like i sincere reply to i think it was literally seven years later i tweeted and i was like sorry for the live reply mate i was busy yeah i've got some famous fans apparently not uh i don't know i don't think i'm gonna lose one of you when you out of him yeah he did i'm not how are you not uh on face i don't know phased no sorry that wasn't what uh what i was gonna say what are you gonna say how are you not verified oh i don't know i i've i only attempted to get verified once and then after i saw you could get verified with 300 followers if you're part of a part of the team whatever i thought who cares now you know she'll join the team i should join a team i should lie i should just buy them on a team yeah just throw some random name in front of your unveilings through you did but i interrupted his uh uh i interrupted this uh call that out i'll just call myself like efx ef-z don't let them slip away oh my god this guy's on a team is that an actual team so now it should be oh these guys are great together right below me right in the open she's one i need it i need it there there's a guy in the tree kazak's still up right here i'm just gonna bat we're gonna help that valve team yeah we can go back where we came from he's still flashing he's 40 hp you can push his 18 health come on man he's wrong could have said he was one hp and that would have been a lie when i was watching this back i realized that i open engagements far too often with my caq i should never try and hit a moving target with it i should just shoot them when i can see them make them have to heal and then just use my cue to cancel their heels because it's very easy to aim at people because the heartbeat and often they can't dodge it because they're slow because they're healing one of the best parts about seeing his kids is his interrupts something to work on definitely true he said he was 14 he was actually 18 so i overestimated him better i'd have i'd have pushed him sooner if i knew this guy's a shotgun didn't have a shotgun bolt like okay what did this guy have there's a white one guys i'll get an assist for that too c is actually bursting right so i'll kill someone else in a tree so i just assumed that was all the tree people in the area a lot of three people around these parts as usual from ridge you say listen yeah it might call it do you want to come to my open lobby i mean i'm probably busy about it no come on it's like in three months you can like i'm probably scheduling definitely going to be busy that day ton of people are getting involved trust me crazy i'll give you a vip spot yeah yeah probably i'll be there if swag is there yeah yeah swag's going to be there swag slug's a vip member coming in hot okay here at erzvp do it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah one team sliding down all right yeah oh to my left oh yeah he's got red i him a little bit absolutely again that's a different scene that just jumped over there nice job i'll take a splash over there unveil yourself why did i do that to someone i knew he was down thank you for letting me know where they were down uh the bang is behind me okay well i have one but i don't want to use it crazy that was good yeah i broke them well played that goes crazy with the bow though most of me is a mess i have no big heels by the way i have two med kits uh two bats i'll give you one of each or you can ask no no no please i don't know like just oh they're pushing that machine uh i'll try and get up that i'll played it played thomas switching recharging let's go no one's even close i'm taking my other back recharging my shield healing one minute yeah i have uh i don't look at my health my arms 45 seconds and the ring closes my friends they will be bound 30 seconds until that ring closes it's not in heartbeat i think she's mad she's so mad he's already all the way over here wait they're they're gonna come down the hill they're gonna come down right here they're probably just going to run all the way back i just don't see if i can get some some shots on him because he's not going to heal yep he has inhaled he's still moving maybe i should try the bow what the heck was that this guy's boosting his own mouse and keyboard if uh i've seen a lot of like really good mouse and keyboards that are insane with the bow yeah it's it's not a hit scan but it's actually way quicker than you think actually seeing my best buddy uh t for you using it a lot oh yeah you guys are really good

seconds my friends are they're big trapping there is a rope here it seems like a big throw ah i'm looking for a little max rp angle right here absolute throw i know you want to throw these down taking the rope a little bit of rope each little rope one drops i can't eat a shot i'm getting beamed apparently one squad left i'll tell you where they are this way it's true yes it is he's just going back and forth he just wanted to stop too yep yeah i respect him smart man right there i respect it he could have hid for the entirety of that of that circle yes but he didn't you realize he got talked to
