hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and we are using the prowler and this is my new strategy get close to people utilize aim assist and use the proud it's a three-step plan very simple very easy to remember and there is a reason that pro players always give their controller teammates this weapon and it's because it is lethal close range where controller players have a massive advantage i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you so much for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this is this is where the real loot is look at this rampage prowler and my teammate got the bomb floor as well no one even landed market attention [Music] i'm coming if you want to go that way i can i don't

the face you know yeah he did that's going on here reloading it's gonna be for you maniac that is the worst angle in fps history it's impossible oh god good news is another soft landing i could pop a bat but i think i've got time shield's recharging here's a pick me up one that's not where i want that to go i can make that i claim this banner in the name of science i can either put the plastic

hold up things that was way when you remember the start of the game when we landed late and we all thought it was doomed remember that what happened i mean i feel like those are the games that we survive and then we die on the games that we have everything yeah pretty much many strategies to run two smgs and just hint um why because i've got aim assist that's how many assists i have uh four zero i'll finish my kills i finish my kills just not sure at all i have video proof of that being not true that wasn't a kill i was never a kill oh yeah that's like a duet you know they're duets on
