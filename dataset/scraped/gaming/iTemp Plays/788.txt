hey wassup Godsey twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and early today the old ways event trailer came out and it is coming to apex legends tomorrow it brings with it a new area or town takeover as its court brings with it some new cosmetics and also the return of Kings Canyon and duo's for good so the thing that I'm most excited for at the moment is the new area but in the long term it's part of the jurors playlist but anyway the new area is shown here at the start of the trailer I had no clue great was until I saw the zipline up to the mountain and it's quite clearly the area and the northwest part of the map with all the sniper lit on there it's quite close to skyhook and it appears to be a bunker within the mountain now inside the bunker there are prowess which other land creatures we've been teased about and also learned more about in the short animated film released a few days ago on the apex legends YouTube channel so I'm going to pause it here because there are three computers that look very similar to the one on Mirage Mirage you know the one that you activate to start the party now I'm not saying that activating these three computers is going to start a massive party but we still might be able to interactive them in another way I mean at each place in front of one of those little loot bunkers so I assume you press them and the bunker opens and they're bunch of players get raw mad and try and buy your leg off that's essentially what's going on here I believe so when you go in the bunker the pro to start attacking you and then you have to kill them and though they themselves don't drop any loot you do get rewarded with vault like loot by killing all of them they show a little bit more of the bunker here which shows that it has a way out of here is supplying the goes up top so you could lend at the front door or you could just drop down I couldn't actually see the zipline at the start though so does it appear when you've obtained the loot as an escape route perhaps I'm not entirely sure I'm really excited land here tomorrow with the 14 of the teams that are also going to be London with me and probably die there for three hours straight but it's gonna be worth if my friends he's gonna be a lot of fun but I've got a fall gameplay he'll for you I use the Spitfire least for my favorite gun on apex legends and I haven't given it enough love recently so hopefully you enjoy that if you do be sure to people I created I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right my friends beak I see pine of do minis and their abyss be another team I'm not gonna get a good am I absolutely not absolutely not nice I can't help that I'm weaponless weaponless in Washington I say they don't say that make some sense why we go take that nice before actually well give me their thank you good great teammates I'm coming I've got your friends thumb don't leave there's a beacon right here I'm not gonna let your buddies don't worry ringback well I'm not sure they would have had too many things cuz it is right to start the game bringing them back as soon as possible is always ideal there we go all right beautiful that was a beautiful stick wasn't really intentional it was so lucky I didn't realize he wasn't looking at me to be honest I thought he was looking towards me and I thought I've messed up its work tape all's well that ends well my friends do I need that yes I do all right this is the race already blue team this wasn't you was it none no that's not you guys okay I don't live there stuff you know I don't it step in their toes in an ointment break and all they'd have enough in anyway alright I'm going to get out of it I've got my two kills I got my public say inline mag oh sorry heavy Matt on the Spitfire I've been enjoying the Spitfire lately because it if you'd stick like a two-time sign on it it's a topi this used to be my favorite gun in the game you know this be fine we could be watching my channel since the start I assume you all know that this gun used to be unbelievable that's not a problem scrath mrs. Forrest's Oh 277 damage and then I get myself essentially purple shield right that's the next upgrade here you go from 50 shields up to over 200 actually look the Evo shield in the game it's not like game breaking oh that's nice nice or they're just killed me too I assume he's gonna go to revive here she gonna come back through we have no one looking at the portal so I had to sort of slide pastured to get a view angle on it so I didn't get rushed all right she does sound top I'm going I think this one guy I assume is loosely straight she's just dropped down I'm scared cuz I've only got level one shields essentially where you running to my friends are getting closer she's kind of tired well I'll get the back you guys make sure she doesn't run through the front where she go did she run off oh she's probably going for the banner I'll go too soon incoming care package I love loot in here assume that she's like this way I think if it'll piss fat earlier target I'll show how easy this is he's gonna be with the one times honored I'm a Spitfire anylock of two times or something or like the two times four times variable actually kind of Opie what she'll do you have five purple I've been rushing that's a terrible idea she's got purple shields which retreats its sister waste of time don't bathe in the boot Bluth my friend there is nothing to bathe in there is no Bluth around these parts she's too quick I could definitely catch up to her but I'm a lot bit intimidated because I'm pretty sure they're a decent player and there's a bit of a disparity here in the armor differences you know I've got level 1 shields essentially and she's got purple I could grapple on forehead no I could do I could catch up one kill we're not worthy revive a friend all right I need a better sign the sweet fire I think with the better sight they'd already been out to do a little bit more damage if I could have taken off most of our shields I would have been good to go there's blue shields here just like did I pink one order I'm coming for my pinky or not I assume he's gonna find it though there you go let's wail here level two this is where you got some kills up here as well this way I've got Evo - what am i doing white is a variable so I thought some welcome this way if dip down low I think we should just chase I saw one guy let's go this way this is such a little it's a good little reconnaissance building this one close come on friends right there far this guy's not he's a straggler this is separate team I want listen to do that I'll tell you not with my level one shields turn careful please be careful it's a Gibraltar with purple shields an 80s shield a triple Thomas and the g7 Scouts that it's the final buffs of Apex legends until it's a blessing pack it up let's just get out of it in a while since we had a good fight but we should realize I think if we play this right we probably just put them up there's also people firing us from across the way to let's go to rotate over to the fresh gun fight I think I missed tremendous I'm nice my tears are standing a fighting you guys okay uncommon some teammate or is that a separate team all right well there's my answer definitely two separate teams I've got my purple shields name from my teammate said coming over because there is six people inside this frame of course - gasps that's a lucky don't mind me I'm pretty sure it is going to cost a gasps are you all the same team yes they were okay beautiful those are the gunfights that you need when you've got yourself the yellow shield or two times bruiser beautiful as well because you just want to you want a third party because you just need to farm damage for a little while it's it's fairly useless until you do I don't know how much can be traced exactly five hundred or something I need some everywhere is here by 59 heavy roads and yes it is killing me having to walk past all of these habits I've seen so many this game and I've seen so much energy and MO as well nice thank you very much very much appreciate it don't die in a store Mirage please don't die in a storm last one all for then here good to make sure Mirage is okay they miss my ultimate are you good yeah that's fine basically not even close you guys open doors I'm pretty sure Dee's just be careful you never know these buildings could be a straggler could be just one one guy campaigning out there only three squads left let's explore this way we go scrap in the distance this is home then we want to get involved in here this could easily turn into all right boylar have to even look in this way giving the gunfire was behind I see the anything to fight each other team access card I come in I go they find each other night I have no idea why you even look in that way bangle oral some are maybe people would just download I don't use my graphic here we go I got way more health and I realized I did not need to do that what the speak boys so good get me out of here please don't shoot me ya know and paint that friend that's don't pick that who else the struggling Mirage has got my red shells that's fine I wasn't gonna go back from I think I'll be spending read but at least we're still benefitting from the red shirts you know at least a teammate you still making use of them all okay let's see me what shields do you have let me see shields my jury so does my my good hand here Hostel right here there's three of them then over there contact with hostile making contact with enemy I'm a place who's engaged in the fight with hammer points achieved absolutely nothing you've left this car behind I have 19 shots amazed well I guess that's why he was using our points you want to try and start this with the crab I've no idea what these guys are doing I've been running away for too long now hey I guess the pathline didn't want to fight you want to know the whole time I almost walked straight happy I'm about the last team literally thought that's the last team we'll look if we didn't get shown on the back I'm we did but I mean when we were fighting okay put home DS doing that way level c father shannon hunting coming please stop playing war zone again we have to grab up here zero athleticism pushing me off on my perch on bees most people just be one guy there's no way two or more players of play like this oh my god that's a fan bezel she's so fast oh stop fast I think this is the right from earlier on the one that I stopped chasing yeah a friends before they know that it is like because that team it was like one shop beat something you can't play in the man for money you can only run the man for blaming it is just one of those situations I'm afraid [Music] I should be paying more attention actually math teams left because I was certain I was certain we will find the last thing for about three or four minutes there at the end 2941 damage dealt just under three thousand a thousand damage from basically both my teammates they deserved more than two kills each I won't be saying that much but the game that's my first game of the day to shout out this P fire I had to walk past so many Harvick's but I tell you what I'm glad I did because they speak via is an incredibly underrated weapon and I'm misusing it because I used to use it pretty much every game back in the day anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see one in the next one [Music]
