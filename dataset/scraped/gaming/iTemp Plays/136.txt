hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here and we have finally managed to get a hammer point re-45 gameplay now i say finally this is an incredibly good gun but it's also incredibly hard to find the combination of the two on the first day i think hammer points had the lowest drop rate of any hop-up of apex legends history i think since then it's been a little bit more common but the games have been so short by the time you find them everyone's dead the games have been so incredibly sweaty like everyone's three stacking this was the first game that i had where i actually kind of popped off with the re45 and we also found it in the legendary golf version as well i genuinely think this is the best smg on the game at the moment if you can get your hands on it so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it if you are new here be sure to subscribe to the channel for daily apex legends videos i haven't missed a day for well over a year now and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alternator not bad at all actually oh with the gold light bank you said this luke teammate i really wanted the the wing man but it's okay i've got good stuff extended like mag here level three why did that not do it properly hang on just one second trying to find another wingman recharging my shields hostile right here tossing thermite phasing target down okay me picking up the heavy was not a good idea i will admit and i have so many level three phoenixes did they have a wingman i think this is a prowler right i mean i don't want to use the women all game but it's such a good uh gun to spawning on so you can easily kill somebody six main man shots recharging my shields the champion fell well we survived where did people land oh here we go i'm gonna get there about three hours later that's the entire that's half the team's dead that's that's hard from dead shotgun bolts i'm telling you they don't exist i have a point remember who watch out for this recharging my shield patching myself up all right i have re-45 hammers this is perfect wait i need light rains one minute before the i need light ammo any light runs going i need light ammo i don't remember where the ship came from i don't know where to expect people this is never a bad guess recharging shields gonna get enough shots in arcstar [Music] they spotted me i'm taking shots [Music] i kept leading with the re-45 i should have maybe used the prayer a little bit more there i didn't know if they were weak or not you know i guess light range one of these i think mine probably have more on it whoever i oh this is my original purple no where did my purple go we kind of brute forced that team really didn't we healing ah that's my original one there we go there we go there's a purple in here death box here okay i'm watching this back and i was wearing my original purple the entire time i never actually armor switch so yeah i switched to a purple went around looking for my purple and it was the one i dropped it's great making contact with the enemy hey someone i think see [Music] myself [Music] hold on i need to heal i'm out of light ammo recharging i don't have just a little bit of lies they spotted me i'm taking shots recharging my shield enemy shield broken sitting still broken i wish i'm so happy i got that that phoenix off i have so many i don't need that many it's nice when you have a like a a care package gun because then you have so much more room for throwables but when i play it's like oh i've got so much so much more room for my 33 shield cells and my 12 batarinos you know level 5. why are light rain so hard to find i want to lead with these evil shields healing up eyes are open now recharging shields okay we've been playing pretty well this game i have eight bats let me ask i have eight bats do you guys need any replicator theme these bats are a complete game changer i can't be running around on eight bats if my teammates have one each other shield battery light ammo here like um light ammunition you say say no more mobile responding oh goldari 45. i mean mine's gold anyway mommy's mom's gone anyway but this is nice thank you uh let's go and get safe i guess just run up this way hammers has been good to me i was uh really mad yesterday i had a great game with hammer points and it was the one game this season i forgot to record it happens though but here we are i mean the way they i want to fire them for you but you've heard them already this game the way they sound on that like on an automatic weapon it just sounds illegal it sounds why is this tree so load i'm gonna get crepe are they all that load hold on hold on scientific this one we've got no audio because all the trees across apex are making far too much noise yeah let's let's get safe let's get safe there are three teams and if if there were ten people okay so there's at most nine people so across three teams hold on yeah there could be like one full team at a few solos i think because it's like six people there you go firing they're firing over this way here i go somewhere i've got a scout and a hammer point re45 oh here we go here we go over there don't buy these we got this team we can't choke we can't choke who's ready to fly on a zip line i need this week i am too much i don't know about this crypto though we killed the full team and he only i think the other two are just solo i think we've got two solos rocking around here kryptoner an octane where's crypto guy he was here a second ago there's someone here he's there oh yeah yeah jumping he said we reload i need the bullets sorry friends but you're not solo opening fire broken enemy shield stolen it's here ah i missed uh well where's the octane this way somewhere right between us did that crypto oh maybe he self-raised because i already down to my thing i think he's this way throwing a respawn beacon for us i think it's the octane and this was his team so which way did he go to try and get banners he's going for the care package [Music] yes [Music] i am so happy i found them i've got a gold re-45 in there too yes yes yes yes celebratory shots oh god i am assistants i'm terrible amazing are the apex no one will see that part good job team gg amigos well played out there on the battlefield i'm way too excited for that game way too excited 11 kills 2500 damage if you guys have played season 12 you will know just how hard this season is to get a win and when you combine that with playing solo trying to find a specific gun with a specific hop-up is impossible so that's why i'm so excited that was great thank you guys for watching i do appreciate i'll see you all the next one
