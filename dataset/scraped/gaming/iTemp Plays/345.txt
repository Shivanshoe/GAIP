hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more aches legends of course and in the background you guys are watching the metamorphosis stories from the outlands this shows the lord behind the new legend coming in season 10 of apex legends called sia it sort of explains all the moth stuff as well but i still had some questions but there will be a link in the description for you to watch without me talking all over it so on ea's website they've revealed some new season 10 content for us today including the new legend seer but also the new weapon coming to the game and some new areas on world's edge as well so let's start off with the new legend sia his description reads uh with michael jones and an artist's eye seer spots opportunities that other legends might miss and seizes them in the most beautiful way he can now i'm not really sure what the micro jones are going to do for him but they're quite clearly the identity of the character and the abilities that he has are probably based around this as well moving on we have the new weapon this is called the rampage lmg which is a new lmg in apex legends and the description reads meet rampart's newest invention the rampage lmg with a surprising source of firepower now i'm not sure what the surprising source of firepower might mean i don't know if it's a different kind of ammunition or whatever but i mean depending on how good this lmg is it could actually be a huge buff to ramp at herself seeing as she gets extra prowess with the lmg category of weapons on apex we don't have any footage of this just yet but i do know that lmgs are quite hard to balance in a game where the other weapons are really difficult to kill people with just one magazine we'll see just how good this is soon enough i'm sure next up we have the world's edge map update and have actually shown us this image on screen which looks like a train yard based on the position of the tracks underneath it and it looks like staging to the left as well if train has been destroyed i'm going to be a very very happy man i never liked that place it was just weird and the gunfights were strange as well another bit of news for season 10 is the arrival of ranked arenas which is going to make the game mode a lot more interesting to play i'm looking forward to giving it a shot and developing some new tactics necessary to win and climb the ranks all the way up to silver three let me know which part of this you guys are most excited about i've got a full game here for you today as well hopefully you enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends when you get like to three thousand you get just full cent or something with a mozam oh yeah that'd be right it'd be so hard to do but i want to do it uh i don't know i was thinking about that too if it would like if i would have to do double yeah well the rules are hard right yeah i think that'd be so hard to do okay oh get it play your cards right you can probably loot that box whilst climbing which would be just insane or hanging on the wall yeah yeah yeah i don't know this blue looks better i just gotta patch myself up hey let's have blue there for you uh no you didn't it was just there it just wasn't good enough for you what's really far wait there's something gold in there what is it can you tell me about the colton um i don't know about the golfing oh turbo i think what was it called sniper mag oh there you go yep how could i forget uh would you like to run to the deeper oh oh i'm i'm uh uh what is this happened wait why is this why is it so smoky in here oh what's happening in here excavating is this like a part of the i actually don't know it's so like there's so much i thought it was bangalore smoke but it's like it's everywhere foreign what just happened what just wait what just happened what was i stuck on i nearly have my pad right here kind of they're out there actually the middle part uh it's okay and i gotta wait so he's uh going high ground hunger okay yeah she's uh right by me are they oh my god zoomed out by accident so i have variable scopes i think there's another team there too yeah i'm pretty sure the right things ah no i really messed that up wait there's no way i know i was looking that way for all that balls i know not the saddest thing you've ever seen uh they are going to chase for sure 50 seconds i have no med kits i've no big hills oh that's unfortunate come on i thought wraith one shot before i maybe should have chased there before you are left anyway okay understandable charging up my shields uh sure i'm not chasing anymore right ah no way stimming octane let's go back to luke i gotcha this place is open the boxes for you thank you i don't see anybody but i'm also not [ __ ] so maybe that's why uh that could be true that could be the reason i like it oh oh i heard something zipline i broke on 180 nice one left standing oh how does it feel how does it be is that the team or whatever i just got destroyed no no i don't know who that was but wasn't the team but either way they just rub all that stuff the elves are just went crazy right it's kind of good it's not bad it is just such a weird gun i don't know i never fancy picking up because i don't i can never aim properly with you that's my problem and that's kind of a big deal yeah i don't like being flashbanged into my gun yes it's like i'm firing snowballs but they're like made of fire it's like fireballs yeah yeah it's a great analogy but it's true though it is i was being serious thank you check out the black market the reminisce of our team they still exist she lives on is it still there yeah you can see use it again soon as you died um i don't even know if i use it the first time if i'm being honest i don't think you did ah definitely did it and that's all of him good job i'm chilling i know you mean about the smoke look at all this smoke mate yeah yeah you see that that's crazy i thought you know first oh this one is that's why ah okay well i wasn't over here you can't do that now but you see the smoke right you know what i'm talking about all that

attention charge rifle versus l-star i'm winning that's what's it's full team of three are they fine with someone else oh it's possible i wish there's a rope over here am i dead i'm an octane demon i know my limits it was lucky you wouldn't have done that if i wasn't here i definitely would not have oh they were fighting i should have had to worry about that it's going to take forever to get over there oh sorry i was looking my health bad bad huge they're trading after they stop fighting then no no no man i love fishing everybody's down yeah we're gonna get there's gonna be one guy alive and he's gonna be the guy that looks fishing i'm going to rinse it and try and jump this hello okay you literally did half how much damage did you do right there 36. pow pow pow pow pow full tank protein

bombs like come on man how nice nice
