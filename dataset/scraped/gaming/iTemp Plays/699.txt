hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing with so far and janks once more and i had so much fun in the game that you're about to watch and i didn't use it exclusively but i did pop the flatline into single file mode a few times and i just destroyed people it's so good i do miss the anvil receiver hop up which you could throw into the flatline and the r301 but the flare line just doesn't need it i didn't even know the flatline came with the single fire option until like three months after the game came out she sat so i missed out on all that spam trigger action but it's okay because i know it's their name and that's all that case so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i had a lot of respect for you well you would upload games all every day just like solo commentary my man i don't know how you do it for a few hours yeah i was i was impressed how you like would be able to be able to talk so much without having anybody like playing i would literally just not talk for a whole game sometimes sometimes you have to remind yourself to talk yeah i have double looted out of my mind right now um i have two alternators and no armor all right friend the subject deceased okay this guy does not like me there's a guy right he's not in

coaster trap on the little bounce pads and it doesn't send it flying yeah absolutely let me test the save i should have done that and then you click jump again and it double bounces the jump pad oh my

talking about this morning right uh yes oh i was watching a shiv i usually watch the ship is always on uh in the mornings when i get on so i always watch him oh yeah because he's uk isn't he so he's yeah yeah perfect time so like i wake up pretty early i probably wake up like six uh like six six or seven a.m so all the eu eu streamers are on at that time and asia streamers yeah i got up at half past 2 p.m today so i like watching johnny i love watching johnny i don't get to watch any of the guys that stream like late at night like they grind uh like like the graveyard hours i don't get to watch any of them because i go to sleep early and i wake up early depending on the schedule johnny's usually on first thing in the morning usually i prefer watching those guys like she's while playing uh hugs bro i i try not to talk though i always be lurking but i never saying always yeah when i say one word the entire chat is like thanks when are you streaming i'm like oh my god no oh i've been asked the total of like i wish i had a counter i've been asked about a good 55 times i've been streaming for 10 minutes yeah just find my damage into a gibby arm shield which is counting for nothing i'm going to lay on one shot i'm going to be useful come on hold on i can't i don't know if we can follow up on that if you even play them anyway i'm gonna well there's a lot of uh what's it called to give you the scouts bro why is everybody in this game using long range single i don't have any heals again oh my word you're just better i'm getting bored of this game bro i think he killed himself i don't know what's happening i i today all right listen fellas is there any shields like um i i might have i'm getting bullied here i might have a bunch of uh shield batteries made oh god okay no audio junk strength shanks i'm good i just found a couple cells okay just take one and take one of these then at least thank you this is chin up top that's a healthy family of three fellas i bet they've got triple takes and skates i'm watching you up top i can't hit him from this angle run janks and for you put his head a few times but he'd just be popping that wingman recharging all the rsirs of truth and justice i hit him oh my word i'm running right at him no this guy had a lot okay all right that's good how many how many kills you ever i have ten oh nice some of you have jinx uh six eyes okay see the statistic i wanna see is damage taken by a triple take that's what i want very specific damage taken by a triple take i bet you on that like okay i recommended these scans yet scans and i also need to see damage taken by g7 scope big scans everybody be finding range this game he's getting bullied it's just an ugly side when you see a gibby armshield up top and he's just single firing that g7 caustic is so fun like my word i love him dude i love playing carsick and he doesn't slide when he gets shot as well i like playing caustic before caustic was a problem yeah you know yeah yeah he's always been kind of fun oh my god they're like above me guess what they have they have g7 yes they're trying to help one i'm trying to fall off her from here oh we're getting shot on the back as well i think nice yeah they do not like me i finally took your roof oh my god i lasered an arcane i'll team for like a 150 [ __ ] on the back we need to push this team i think yeah i'll team for one or yeah octane for a ton over here i'm going to emp them lifeline 140. down in the coal stake nice job not turn around i guess we lazy my audio is kind of weird right now i need to fix it recharging shields good job boys yeah it works they're on the road one's right here by himself i'm gonna go push this guy oh it's got a g7 i think like no that might be simplifying how many is there only g7 spawning in this apparently one's like down low one's down low we can destroy him cracked they're all about they're all broken i'm getting there he's waiting for this guy to move he's gonna move the second he does he's dead i was not he's got a triple take drinks it might even be the same people no no no no i'm not in single fight mode he's got white evo it's definitely the same guy got the white evil guy i'm gonna ball bounce into this guy are you ready for this [Music] good oh dude hey okay can i like somehow block out my stats they're possible that's why i'll play with you most of the time this may be the first time i've got more damage than you you are the apex champions i think i did like five executions that game i could safely say that i got the most damage taken for sure oh my god dude like what am i doing i should have been trying to frag with you guys we could have dropped like over 30. you guys popped there were two separate corsics that were signing their own gas that game and i just walked in like surp with my prologue with a digi threat just walked up behind him that was fun
