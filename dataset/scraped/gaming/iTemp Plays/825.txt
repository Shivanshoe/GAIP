hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex and legends of course and today we have an intense game on season 1 kings canyon not only was it intense but we had the opportunity to explore season 1 Kings Canyon all over again we've landed on the supply ship we went down to a pulsar up nice crap cave debris jeez then to the River Center and then cascade and it finished into the lakes it's like a tour guide of the old map and I'm really happy with how the game turned out due to how much of the map we were actually able to explore again so hopefully you enjoy it's a little bit of a throwback here and I see wall in five now seconds my friends looking good friends the supply ship it is it's been a while since I lands on this a beautiful beautiful thing there are 16 of the teams here that's my gun thank you very much please don't come through kiss me as well thank you I know he won't do the wave I need ammo well I was an aria 45s mom oh sorry you probably won't be able to tell but my aim just went so weird then this you didn't think I was gonna get it and now I have fallen down onto the ground and there are people up top good grief but the reason I said Udo is because my you couldn't see but my aim went all kinds of crazy on the video produce sounds like how to screen for no reason but there was a reason let me tell you where did this guy go he's gonna crawl off into the sunset named come on lifeline me with me lass do you make me I don't think I'll challenge was trying to risk it Oh Timmy do the water spray spare and a boom boom indeed my friend is yes another team what was that two times Hedgehog which you didn't hear you till our last seconds I think it might just be one guy though bangles back nice team thank you look at this teamwork it's beautiful we got separated that's always happens at the supply ship Thank You gracias amigo did we kill that person the bank or did have a bit of damage on them so she was definitely involved in the scrap I don't think we've killed her maybe they just ran off there's every chance of danger phone or fax that all right somehow I only have two kills from that what what a crazy start though the reason I like going to that I'm coming that's not what I meant to say I'm on the way I love the supply ship man I wish there was purple armor up top though usually his purple armor up right where I dropped him there that was my go to plane to land that was them APEC Cyprus they came back here wasn't my cos I'm gonna try and steal the loot or my boxing gloves on my back level team thanks friend very much appreciate it I probably should've taken the things that's pretty for the Bangalore and there's way more sense not gonna tell you three times for the Scout seems a little bit crazy might need it in some closer range situations here as well God it feels good to be back on you in spending my friends my gosh darn look this map I don't honestly I've warmed up a lot to were two worlds edge as well I've Rudy like at first I wasn't too sure about it especially because the loose be weird but I've warmed up to a lot if we could always bathe definitely someone responded incoming package where do you go explain the scene I go to carefully I don't wanna get too close today so that he can hear me return sir I know screw McGrew he's definitely he's definitely had me he's running though commands terrified it's a revelant you don't like to do that I'm Kings Canyon taking down those surviving you don't like to be revin our companion as I said initially built up escapes that wasn't on contain I'm still trying to get used to the they may change the double tap gently on the g7 used to be overpowered but they increase the time between shots so it's a little bit weird now I'm tryna get used to it okay I was gonna go for my loops but that's fine they increase the time between those little double tap shots now so it's a little bit more of a nice nice oh please it win twice I'm not sure see quite amusing now I don't like double tap on the eve right because I've much rather be in control of when I'm actually firing I need an extended heavy bag five shots that's a lifeline package she might Pingo purple Oh purple optics I've got absolutely day to do that what the team must have run off anyway thanks closing there's a scrap this way get me involved friends I hear you this way okay Oh Oh downhill this we can't even get proper angle to shoot please take one right this way please don't self completely waste my time here think I've wasted my time it sound like someone went more to the left but I must have been wrong fortune on path my death because you see if you want to get to the right there we go very questionable accuracy oh did that accent it heavy he's gone my have one no he does not my name's phenyl all kinds of weird at the moments I'm sure I'll warm up to it though I've got five kills I'm not to kill me Dad someone well there's 15 people that here or 12 other people I've traveled this game though Billy do I kill you I seven kills I fight all I need to do is kill two people and we are on a level times no visit River Center because if you remember this way there was a scrap this way and if I had to guess I say they were around this way from back when we were four what it bellows mini scrap cave there we go only something would be going on this way definitely in this in the ring as well that's not fighting man here we go we're sort of struggling on strudel on loot so if we can get keep the storm here with the best pizza high ground on the entire game all we have to do is keep him there that's literally it that's not fighting that's actually a really good news I'm lacking I'm lacking in the healer balls departments in the freight hey friend perfect they were knocked down by the ring there we go that must mean the guy that got frisky oh that's so sad I'll get kill credit forward though because no one actually knocked him down it was just the ring so if you finish the kill you kill credit look now on six and someone's spectacu me I need shields I've literally one shield sell I could have gone around the desert I'm not sure they would have that's why I've got a g7 scanner wingman friend off here we go nice ghostie my spanner again Oh Tim is here he called in a little bit timid be careful yeah we can't even commit to this tonight's looking a little bit but if I look away they're gonna rush us look my teammates hold their ground this is something fortunate we couldn't commit we can't go in the cave like that I know as soon as we go escape that is so unfortunate what you've been able to brush those guys with 3v2 right there but unfortunately a team a rocket up behind us oh here we go right here all right one of them we trade it I can't even get the loads this rings gonna hurt storm again good leave Thank You teammate look at this look at this teamwork when I went down there I can spare a lot of light laughter that's enough it's enough time using to one-shot weapons or single-shot even semi-automatic manipulator so there's a team that way we've got these guys - I see him I think he's ready for a balloon I'm gonna leave him I do not yeah he's these out of here as well I think this is the team that we tried to gatekeeping the storm oh this is what we get for not killing them to be fair we couldn't kill them we were actually we were third parties pretty bad when we were trying to get keep a storm but they were pretty rapid tactics however we have no link whatsoever teammates make a run for it I got you covered run run run I'll be okay in that situation I know that I'm not gonna dame them and even if I do down them I'm not gonna get the kill credit because they can easily get a road while off however I do need please don't follow me however in that situation it's more about Curran my teammates if I don't if I don't fire at those people there they literally I think they would have downed all my teammates and it would have been good in game over I think I might have rotated away from that another I'm numbered oh here we go please say someone's forgot to loot this I'm not too bad he look heavy ammo for you as well my friend he said you need it any any decent armor how's your old one at least hey listen been in the mono dropped this is such a stroll it's the biggest struggle game of all time I'm nervous because that team would have rotated somewhere oh my G sentence guys decked out hopefully people stop scrapping each other I think we I think we need to be very opportunistic here I think we may need to employ some more rat-boy tactics they're fighting I want to get involved because I don't have any loot was that really the guy that I heard please done fighting thank you that must be the guy that I heard from across the boss I didn't I don't even know you could keep him from that far away they'll be sniped we can rush them though usually one do this I appreciate it thanks I think I've got a better long-range weapon the leaders sounds like is founded a flat line yeah without anvil reins what are you bet way to be honest otherwise we're stuck in the open there's a team here though there's that caustic steam careful lifeline I can't miss him being shop either by the other team yeah well that pathfinders definitely got purple they're scrapping the month on my boat still salute me to friend I'm struggling you've got more smoke just drop it he's gonna know what I mean I think the other two teams are fighting here we go should've came by two times bruiser Phoenix kid here brief what site you haven't a single boy hemlock they both the fire rate inmates unbelievable annoyingly part of the elevated position here it's still safe so we can't even wait these guys out we just need to speak their attention I think it's two people ah technology I think it's those two people that we try to get keep out the storm I think it's them stop Oh God these do good and if you stay away for my teammates a little bit because there's only two people if we can split it into a1 b1 and a2 b1 nearby at least my teammates will have an advantage if they can damage him a little bit maybe they can rush my something I don't know please don't shoot me well good I've need to pressure a different angle I think I think this is the play if it lets me look great there we go I'll kill me if I just run team is your absolute hero my friend thank you thank you honest tempting to just grapple up there but I don't even have an on line tonight which is annoying so I definitely saw one earlier on this is still safe which means it they're still safe oh my word it's not good all we need is the storm to push them off the edge and we should win 3v2 because they had to jump down or something we'd be absolutely fine here I'm try not to be too impatient here right well the good news is it's forcing them away from the high grades which means when they jump down we should be able to kill them should be is some sneak tactics see mister you should stay usually say we should split up don't shoot that we should we should honestly split up here this way if they jump down we need to be at different angles so we just fired them in the back though he's going to jump off in one minute ina Minuten it's still someone up there the problem is if I if I grapple up there I don't have a close-range gun and he's still a 2v1 no the guy was ready for it in the opposite corner I think I'm I just need to be patient was ID call you sooner one second teammates you guys should get closer you guys need to get closer I've got a grandfather and Nathan short 67 season four wins already I mean that he's unlucky that is so unlucky my teammates my teammates died in the storm because he ended on the elevated position I can get to the elevated position because my grapple but my teammates didn't realize it was gonna end on the rock and because I don't realize he's gonna end just on top of the rock like that either it was a 2v1 even though it's supposed to be a 3b - alright guys hopefully weren't too disappointed I know it was a long food and we didn't actually win but my god did we traverse most of Kings Canyon that game and I hope it wasn't too disappointing because you know you win some you loose some isn't it was so unlucky at them because there was safe up top of so long and it had to end on that one rock that my teammates couldn't get up on top of like if they tried to go on top of that beforehand they'd have been shocked by the people up top you know they couldn't really get up there was just a struggle it was someone looking or Seymour in Lucky's that when we were gatekeeping a storm which we had to do because we had no roots I needed to get some free kills we got shot in the back as soon as they were coming out the cave there would've been free kills then as well it's just some lucky but thank you for watching I really do hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you all tomorrow with another video
