hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here in ranked now yesterday in the intro i was discussing how apex at the moment in the public games it doesn't really feel like a battle royale then i said i was going to post more ranked gameplay and then the gameplay that followed it was still in public games it's because i had that game ready to go but today we are playing ranked and it was a ton of fun and this game exemplifies what i was talking about this is the pure battle royale experience i'm sure you guys will enjoy the ending thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends buck's turning around prepare for that kaiser that's how you spell it g-u-y s-i-r geiser it's not it's an a oh that's not how it works i was like is that how you spell it i just opened the map up to check let me see the evidence any guns in giza mate or what any guns here where visa i'm not calling it geyser let me use uh a lambo oh snazzy and then i think i'm looking for a volsky an extra one okay well i have a three times but i would like to use it but i'm willing to give it to you until we find another one oh i mean i'm fine for now we're not gonna be in a fight for like about 15 minutes so okay it's a crawler and a car over here i yeah why would you call a car right that thing sucks that's kind of the game yep real bad what's in the crafter line mag oh two to four oh put down your longbow hey yeah i'm gonna do some crafting i didn't have to find another vault because i've got one oh my god you're not going to believe what i just did what'd you do dude my brain is not working did you just do something with it doing talk off yeah dude i literally come after you loot that building come over here i'm just so disappointed it was way worse it was way worse i like tell me this doesn't look like a web you tried to link that too i was i was i was mid grapple and i saw it in the air and i got hyped for a second i was like yo a weapon crazy oh my god that's that's genius i'm so bad my brain just doesn't want to listen to me it's amazing i got a gold uh energy mag on my l star and i don't want to use the l-star i have a purple one if you want to switch oh no you're looking for a vault are you good what no i would not like to switch well it doesn't work on the l-star so no i kind of i mean it does not compare to it what's it do competitor it takes longer to overheat what compares purple uh oh you're talking about well actually i don't know does it does it increase reload time at all no because it doesn't like because it automatically realized that's the only difference right but the l star if you overheat it you still need to like even with the gold mag i'm pretty sure you still need to be like whoa this is hot well maybe it like uh you know how when you when you overheat it too much and then you have to do like that weird no i think you still have to i think you still have to i already got we gotta try for science so you know there's no wait do it do you express some hits it's right i have 100 bullets i will never do that i have 180 i can donate 20 to science i know i knew you guys well actually oh yeah we're all digging i thought it was you ahead there you go what'd you think she's going to get alternate uh hatred and hot dogs i like my hot dogs is that like a controversial thing no definitely not i don't know there's no way that's controversial controversy i'll say inventory inventory that's even worse do you have a license for that inventory mate oh that was satisfying she's one oh we shouldn't know what we should now there never mind i don't know where what are you just above i don't know she's still back there we're we're not with them she's shooting back behind us so we're going to get pinched yeah i'm coming back in here below me i still have this all-stars this is the worst of days it's going so bad let's oh yeah she's cracked sorry i was leading okay wow i haven't even seen anybody that's unbelievable i have three kills how much damage you have 400 not bad  if the person that's dead you get 400 damage i first hit someone for a kill credit and then i cracked that wraith and then she held up and then i hear a little bit um and i shot them with the three times from across the way and did like 100 damage too so um get your act together mate that's what i'm saying oh you're heading the game i don't know what you want for me yeah so you've been losing christ i don't want to be here i want to be on dark no you know i mean i'd actually way rather die on dark than die in this game you sounded pretty depressed oh i was but i'm always depressed that's him uh me too it's an absolute tragedy level one first i don't know where they're padding i'm using all i have no you should have crafted some there's some here the craftsman here look no no no no that's crazy talking about 20 maps he's 24 sniper bullets like you can literally never do that why i probably should have but i forgot you mean you are in talk-off mode yeah well we just jumped right into ranked we didn't have like a little little warm-up underneath right into rings that is the biggest lie you have ever told me i'm always bad does it make a difference you're the oldest man ever taking about 35 minutes to warm up just ever world record hallway our teammates uh i don't know what she's doing it's kinda just kinda she's vibing doing this thing here what is this game that's fine oh god oh god yeah yeah yeah give me crap oh i'm one they might name me i i can't see from that angle how can you see me dude there's no way they can see me there okay should have crafted horizon might be their best player she's like on masters and stuff might not be a couple horizons around here i think everything oh my god oh he's that team the horizon the good horizons in front of us like this team all right this is the gibby valkyrie team our teammates want to gatekeep or something here's good it should be unless we get pushed in the back which is what i'm worried about there's like there's so many teams that can push her i mean we're we're safe over here yeah i'm just gonna walk away and hopefully she realizes what we're trying to do i think she's fine i need help oh my god i have no make three syringes that's it syringe here dropped our two that's all i have left there's two more oh my god oh no there's another one one more opening i fourteen okay no i have eleven there you go okay i uh just a few just like four thank you recharging shield you have bats i have one back okay i'll drop you if you end up using it i'll drop you one because i'm still trying to snipe teammates kind of a psycho we don't have the resources to so why do you even get up there i don't know it's an impressive point everywhere they're not shooting him but they're shooting me i only have two syringes i'm just gonna use them yeah i have or something oh there's another team close yeah they're in that building and i'm swinging left a little bit i almost down that rave she's so low back there i really want to kill her i have one and four she's here maybe she's part of that team yeah she is she is one's got blue i crack watson yeah the the write that blue too we've all got red yeah we i think we need to kill the scene this gibby team won't leave us alone though in me i'm 130 i think that's why okay at least i have no name that's not going to do anything because they're just so exciting yeah it seems to be really annoying to kill in there might push up they might do i have stuff i have a lot of stuff i have nothing i literally have nothing oh she wanted to smoke it oh let me know if you still need some stuff okay i've got uh i have three bats 12 cells i have one bat and three cells no more heals after this an extra bat and some shields yeah i have one i think this gives actually so annoying i need that serenjo here i'll drop you thank you yeah i guess he's just pretty he's not moving from that window i'm going to drop her these so we don't waste ourselves and stuff give me a second i need energy are you oh no she did but then she pinged that there was a box out there with loads so so do you need this right now no i'm good i'm good i got 300. i want to try and he wants to he wants you to put a rope let's go this way yeah i mean we can do that that team still there the entrance he keeps smoking us out okay time i'm dropping thank you we're gonna have to take that now i'm gonna choice you get the bat all up yeah i did wait did you i didn't wait what no i didn't i'll drop i thought i had it dude i like i can't see anything because they do keep us out smoke them if you can they can still see us thanks like i can't i can't pee but they can still see like silhouettes and stuff when they aim in i think we have to play like left side on the outside of that fence i think this is bad i think we i think we dropped let's go i have to drop yeah not much they can do you know like free state she needs to stop tanking she must have the most amount of healables in the world or something that's actually insane give me a sec recharging shield south side's probably our best bet south like once that team's there though right now i'll come with i'm just kidding i'm sticking with you there's some cover the final ring is moving oh yeah you're right because we yes i have 27 heavy not supposed to have any we need to focus this left team yeah they're they're coming out i'm scanned for popular on the left uh right side right there the one the one that's in the building they're fighting around three seconds oh they're just bullets give this one one five and give me i don't know let's go on the left on the right sorry easy as much as i could but i don't know if i did enough the way once it worked out it worked out i was sick oh show what's going on sick oh you're just calling in the herd i knows i was happy i got more than one kill point oh yeah yeah
