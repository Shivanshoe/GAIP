hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using the alternator he's back on the floor i'm sure you guys know because season 12 came out five days ago but one of the things i love about the alternator is that it's a a low risk high reward weapon because the fire rate is so low and the dps is definitely lower than other options like the r9 but because of the low fire rate it's so easy to one clip people any time during the game and overall that means that the dps is higher if you factor in the reload time on the r9 tonight if you missed your shots do you know what i mean and that is very helpful for me sometimes thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos it's incredible how fast you can get rp with the team i'm going to take away let's go this way enemies are falling from the sky and landing near me i'm with you the enemies are shooting at me you have uh yeah but i'm gonna drop it for a peacekeeper when i find one okay so it's okay here i go yeah it must be yeah oh yeah oh they are fun i got a wrecking ball ready for them [Music] that god just got red but it's nearly cracked okay he went up top left i'm going to flank him okay charge the team no no i was just shooting the lifeline a couple times i don't know where he went i went away she's on me she's on the roof i cracked her she's running care package being delivered she has flushed up ah incoming care package i love loot i'm going through the pool i'm risking it no i'm grabbing this guy he has it he's on the door he's on the door inside just finish the bat 150 on him nice job please suck me i don't have a phoenix where did he come from i have no clue why does nobody have a purple full bats i got bats for you i have one i got six okay it's a lot of bats dude took me forever to find her armor they're all empty that fight was kind of crazy for them huh yeah they were popping off thank you thank you i haven't found a single connect feeder either yeah i mean either is it in the crafter it's not no i've been seeing the craft this whole season yo i'm going to be honest i don't i barely even find hammers i think that the the drop rate on the hop-ups might be like if it is this guy's a bit of a demon recharging shields i am repairing myself i'm gonna pop a medkit okay then maggie is in behind i'll try and give him a bait back on you really weak on you behind that rock the enemies [Laughter] what i'll be honest this guy running a duel show with the peacekeeper yeah he was trying to find he was trying to find a message surely i think someone's there there is a guy there oh god oh god he's got diva good grief that kind of hurts dude i tried to do a thing look i tried to kick my speed boost and like wall jump off of this but i grabbed this tiny little pole oh you saw it climbing why is why is this little pool why is it climbable don't you you can vouch how how many days has it been since the season came out stupid five days i haven't found a kinetic loader instead i find two gold ones all right double piece keeper it is the whole gold figure it's ridiculous it's just baffling anyways that's what i was saying they totally don't have like the correct spawn rate on hop-ups no no no no no haven't points just playing oh i was playing ranked with moose the other day and he wanted hammers for his mozam every single game i think out of like a four or five hour session without one hammer point it's crazy yeah some games i've got lucky like you know exists but most of the time oh my word oh that's two teams are fighting they're over this way too i don't have i don't have volte okay one squad left let's go ruin their day this is ridiculous it kind of is right oh they're on the bridge look at him i'm gonna throw my bowling ball at him do it knock him off the bridge knock him off the bridge that bounces back by the way and knock you off the bridge careful okay stuck on the crafter i am hold on hold on hold on finish your move finish your move and mine's still freezing on fire yeah do that in this one on fire slide it somewhere it's all right i juice near you sorry oh sorry sorry everywhere here oh my god coming to me [Applause] yeah where are they in this building that way i cracked him nice i'm gonna be raised i'm gonna be rest hey oh she's going over she's going over here wow looks like that was the last one in the squad so that was the last one in the squad oops yeah there's more do you need energy i've got energy stuff here there's more energy there oops i missed my grappler are you ready ready ready oh wait uh wait i'm still tap-tapping nice i didn't even realize that's going to is it not was it not nerfed was it not like i don't understand i don't know like a controller um west they sort of run off this way that's someone else right is it headshot the top is dead i'm switching give me a second practice okay so does the old does it hurt other enemies it does right uh damn nights mates how many times it's a wrecking ball yeah that leaves that speed pads i don't watch the trailers that detonates near the enemies i don't know how it works i really don't i don't know what i'm doing i fall back i have uh two come on give me a go mate no you mean no i wanted it to be a vault i might also hey i'm going to use my old successfully this time what's it do it it detonates come on you're gonna get the whole thing down no no it definitely that made sense oh they're okay too oh god i find it below he's running i'm running we've got to be careful with the top this one nice they're gonna be up with us i'll be there lots of stuff right cracks on the top nice there was multiple bag yields why does double tap suck on this skate like it was so busy when it came they're here get over there are they up top already no no they're miles away i also just then run this way i think it's more under us i think so yeah there's more yeah team uh inside too that did nothing he's in that corner when you get him back we're gonna get rocked up on by another team i'll try and protect you back if you want a third that i do but i don't want to die either let's go kill those guys there's two squads well there's one underneath this and then this team so there's no get those guys yeah i'm rushing over boost nice as you can hear from my crazy good voice line this is dead i'm gonna go on the roof to protect us from behind you good right giving my shields yeah is actually kind of fun she's got a good kick oh she's no she's using her speed pads near enemies she's won she's actually one race one i'm going crypto is red it's my last bat i'll write these phoenix in oh she got it off oh i needed to do cricket finisher i it was worth it it was worth it i got the bloodhound yeah i'm pretty sure we we left a block watch this so we know in the next circles oh that's huge those tactics to get up top there though i just i have spidey senses i knew i was tracking my head you know just perfect timing where is this bloodhound though i guess you don't want to revive there and he went safe he got it yep yeah oh hey i don't know where else teammates alive so fast yeah this way he did respond him he did respond from downtown it was silent oh they got all the way back here oh my goodness come on and they nerfed it too i should have cranked the finisher that was fun oh maggie's aggressive yeah well she drops the speed pads you know that didn't it new enemies oh man big numbers big numbers catch up i had escaped though i'm literally just farming with this gate
