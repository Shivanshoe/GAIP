hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we're playing some more ranked solo because i'm too low of a rank to play with my friends it's very sad but also kind of a good thing because i was so rustic in these games we were about to watch uh but it didn't matter because i'm in silver rank and played for three days and this is my first hour of playing back it takes a little while to warm up but we did get there in the end and our end goal here is to rank up enough to play with friends in ranked can we achieve our dreams you're about to find out thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right screw raptor city amigo amigos i landed first i believe this is mine sorry too that's not really the teammate you spicked me [Music] all right i am definitely not ready for the scraptor level of action here however when you're playing i have a subject are you playing corsica it doesn't really matter too much because all you have to do is log down your gas trap and which is always good i'll get this guy instead then since no one wants to find me hey he got beamed i was telling you to get a revive i felt bad deployed there we go look at this which is why i fell into the fire repeat nice job teammates uh good job all round i'd say nice they spotted me i'm taking shots oh okay they're close i don't think they're this close that's not good i'm gonna revive that's two on the same names he may be behind us yeah just like that this guy's getting all kinds of larry nice how did i down the first guy i was shooting my havoc when i downed it but it must have been my it must have been the cause of gas i assume maybe my teammates got them one shot well i finally got my ammo gun i've been carrying around this level to excellent mag since the dawn of time i believe oh evo shields there you go teammates in the distance as well that guy's one shot as well uh i have some for you you're using a wingman so 43 is probably fine my flatline is my close range gun here oh you're going over there okay i assume you hit them a decent man no they're firing back should we return it's committed i'm back can't see nice [Music] um i don't know how i've just done that the champion i feel like my brain is on delay and i've still 206 sprayed him with an r301a this guy's kicking off it doesn't sound like it's close oh my god the bullets are flying through they're down low but i think we should focus on getting up top because if one of them decides to jump up top then we are at a disadvantageous position you know someone's getting a revive off too are they don't know nice can't really challenge that don't worry i have no cover sorry teammates i'm useless here reloading nice i probably should have been here firing recharging playing like a big move a decoy yes that doesn't count as a bamboo so i knew it was a decline i still want him there recharging my shoes i'm saying somebody needs to put this caustic gas down i have a gold bag if you wanna man you're invisible over there that's safe i think we should keep the high ground here heard that we're going for the care package it should have pulled it you'll be able to rejoin the squadron there's a crypto drone going around and you are getting empty that seems like a bit of a waste recharging watch yourself contact with target opening this thing we got these boys trapped pretty much i don't need it to be gone away like he hasn't got an emp so i don't care that much that means if he's he's in the drone only two of them are shooting back 45 seconds but setting up my decoy i wish this was a g7 scout nice this is a good [Music] the ring 30 plan left oh my word oh my word the portal might be a little bit too close then it's okay we're back we're safe they have a better course as well we should challenge more from this side because we can literally keep them we don't have to go okay [Music] shield at least they're fighting my caustic gas nice good job oh i'll do i've got away with it we even need to play well for some reason they've decided to sit there where it wasn't even safe i just my aim still feels very very loose i think they're terminals good game teammates we defied all odds and winning that one 23 total kills oh nice damage andy let's go nine kills each five for the mirage it's a good game i'm happy with that all right sky hook it is you can take the mozambique if you like because this is gonna have gold shields and no just as i might then my initial battery there you go super crabs then level two people are scrapping the bloodhound trials who's this boy i do get here come on albert he's got a phoenix for me as well unfortunately i'm pretty sure they use the finishing move but it's worked hey um people are fighting at blatant trials and it's hard to live there fighting oh you can't do an enemy thing what's that that's true to the prowess don't mind we're gonna go this way reloading enemy i'm just trying to get albert's banner that's not allowed back here what are you doing [Applause] if we finish this one off because i killed two people i'm not sure if i got either one there you go free charge well i've done 68 damage but really i've done zero damage because the guy's gonna knock him shield that's real fun uh my team was shooting at someone else this must be a different squad then i'm gonna take my time is there are there any sights around here for a g7 because i can't aim at this thing pushing up there we go if he's near me somewhere never mind he's run off into the sunset could be rushing my teammate oh that's not even our teammate that's gonna respawn i thought we had his battle ready all right well you get your free kill over there and i'll i'll be on banner duty i guess i got your lifeline listen to hey don't worry about it i got you i could be over there shooting an armless fiend an armless man of charity you could say here we go oh this is going to be the blue town charles team too these boys are gonna have gold shields of knockdowns got banks got helmets gentlemen look at the balcony no no race shields oh you didn't even shoot that person either oh it doesn't matter that much yeah we are i'm surprised i'm surprised the wraith hasn't come over he's uh being pretty but there's definitely someone here there you go completely bloodthirsty so far she's been relating skyhook the entire game and he's run off subject over there i don't think he's coming back it's okay because someone else is here nine damage can i get ten and they're going straight back into the gas that's great i don't get too aggressive because these teammate could be the guy down low i think that's all coming over that's the good news i missed that's my bed i was gonna revive up top my mind is a lifeline that explains a lot and i'm dead and i'm dead i got bamboozled by the revive and the bloodhound's live up top big queen last guys up top thanks lifeline a gold bag as well [Music] never mind i've been scammed you do not have a gold bag nice however i had one kill from that engage is an absolute tragedy if you ask me i'm an idiot i need the med kit if possible where's my last one target spotted there i need help subject spotted all of the g7 oh that makes a lot of sense you know what i hadn't thought about that thank you thank you you'll only come to help me in the future i'm sure once i inevitably get knocked again after getting bamboos of my lifeline the only man ever to be bamboozled by a lifeline it's not something i'm proud of i guess that's the downgrade right reloading enemy taken out that was albert this is the original team we fought in skyhook that was the revenant that pushed me how on earth that's alive there's no way you know that shot if this is the bangalore she did not know what she was doing if this is the same thing you don't land those shots look you see look at this not sure if that was heard about shooting or my impressive maneuvers okay now i'm shooting a rock it's about too soon i'm not falling for this one can i get some help from this is it still broken hey hey thank you um someone's gonna revive it someone's also on the rope i'm starting to feel a little bit better on the sticks it just takes a little while to warm up still not 100 nowhere near but definitely a little bit closer that wasn't me trying to watch him by the way literally just trying to climb over the top i think someone's targeting me well they were up top so be careful i've been involved that's not good two different squads oh my god look at these vultures ice nice job i apparently don't have a mobile respawn beacon anymore i have no idea where that's gone thank you for the evo very much appreciated enemy spotted i'm nice teammate how did you steal my my my mobile wrist one beacon how did you come into possession of that i must have dropped you somewhere nice all right lifeline hoover up one of these boxes i'd say spam just get all the good stuff body shield here i have a subject spotted no phoenix kids all right i'm feeling a little bit better warmed up warmed up that was only sketchy because i landed on the bangable's head didn't know where she went that's not my fault that's not good now why rounds if i had a level one extended on this flatline the entire game okay that explains a lot target spotted there someone's got that select fire havoc they're charging it up it's a stupid gun target spotted 46 spare please guys i'll have some no once again i've been peppering them and i'm late to the fight somehow that's not good see ya come in nice no need he'll be a silo that would explain why he didn't try and third party this i think he must just be one guy [Music] 316 g7 he was too scared he saw the wall bench he knew he's over nevermind never mind he's just psycho back there's the gold knock down i believe this should be two squads left there you go last one better go back as well it's nice little combos [Music] oh that's come out the woodwork there's two of them where have you guys been we've been fighting for last 15 minutes hey get him the third part of us should have third parties that'll do i believe this is going to take us to gold started to feel a little better towards the end a little bit sketchy early on we found our footing 29 squad kills let's go teammate 3240 damage of him 3159 from me what is that 81 81 damage more than me must have stole a kill but it's okay because he stole my gold shield at the start haven't forgotten about that six kills and i survived from the lifeline as well that's a solid game all right did we make it to goal 213 output oh sorry rp i have achieved the rank of gold i have achieved the rank of goals there you go the dizzying heights we finally achieved our dreams my friends uh i'm not sure if i can play with janks and so far yet i might have to play a little bit more we'll see i'll ask them but thanks for watching do appreciate it see you on the next one bye
