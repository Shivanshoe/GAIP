hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that i have for you today it's a little crazy it's a little bit different than usual we are teaming up with janks he was running around with a charge rifle i was running around with a triple take and as many thermite grenades as i could find i think the peak thermite count was seven now usually i don't carry many thermites but when a team is camping inside a building and there is a window where you could throw the thermites in they actually become very effective the strategy is to set the entire place on fire and then shoot them as they commit the doorways thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds maybe goes to place like that game i got 5200 damage i wasn't playing necessarily any better than usual it was just the lobby conditions you know exactly that's that's what i like to do i just like to casually play and if it happens it happens yeah oh there's a purple in the middle okay thanks i think oh the purple mag and purple armor all right this is my 20 this is it okay okay i'm going in jenks goodbye goodbye on gotta get that peek out do i stick with the recharging double tape that good shots make good shots you i should stick with the triple tape yeah on this map the pk is so good right now though oh i absolutely love it and i've always been a pk hater i'm a pk enjoyer jenks what guess how many thermites i have you know how many times do you have just take a guess you won't get it uh four nope i know you're going to say four it's five five yep one crap the rampage oh my god time to craft the rampage i'm starving if you're crafting rampage you are one big tweet i'm gonna come and say [Laughter] you are a huge dweeb bro it's even better now to craft a rampage because like people be holding doors not expecting you to just blast i was playing around today flush i just got to hold this door oh recharging ow oh that passive me make it on the floor if you want it oh i have to thank you a nice tick-tock in the feed a lot of tick-tock advertising going on everybody be talking

we're a couple of boomers i agree that's totally why yeah but when i when i sit down to watch something i want it to be like 20 minutes plus yeah yeah i'm a long-form content enjoyer i i enjoy i prefer vine to take vine had so many good memes there's not enough tick-tock memes nowadays it was the originator yeah it's the original you can never you can never it's like it's like movie sequels you know like when you have the series one two three like the one is always better than the two three fours yeah exactly fine is the minus one blind will always be number one i'm gonna loop sniper's duck i picked it up whoa what are you running oh no i've got it double take triple take online the classic combo mate it's a classic combo that's a good one yeah guess what i'm running uh sense now wingman prowl no but that is a that would be a loadout i am running uh the complete polar opposite that would be like a chad loadout i'm running a dweeb loadout you're running the longbow probably that would be way more admirable than i'm running i think the weebiest combination charge rifle speed fire yes sir okay that's just horrendous oh my guess how many guess how many thermites i've got uh
