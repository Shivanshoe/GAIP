hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back in ranked and i decided to bring the robot fridge himself along pathfinder i feel like i haven't been playing much in season seven but he had to make a return he's still so so good in ranked before we get in today's game now i have a quick word for my sponsor thanks to lenovo legion and intel for sponsoring this video this is the lenovo legion 7i laptop it is glorious it comes with an intel core i7 processor a geforce 2080 super with ray tracing and a 144hz screen this is an incredible desktop build in the compact mobile form of a laptop it's an amazing bit of tech and my favorite part about this laptop apart from the powerhouse specs that it has is the fact that they included a 144 hertz screen here if you check the specs of any of your favorite warzone streamers i guarantee you that they are not playing at 60hz anymore you cannot compete with the best players without the best technology and having a 144 hertz screen here on the go is incredible the lenovo legion 7i features cold front 2.0 technology including an integrated two millimeter vapor chamber and an updated six point thermal sensor array which keeps the laptop both cool and quiet and because of the efficiency of the cooling system the laptop can be incredibly thin and light at just 2.2 kilograms lenovo have also included a true strike keyboard with sub millisecond response time just a 1.3 millimeter travel distance and also featuring customizable rgb you cannot fill a laptop with the best specs only to compromise on the keyboard and lenovo have gone a step above here and delivered a truly impressive gaming keyboard within the laptop itself the 7r laptop here can also charge from 0 to 50 percent charge in under 30 minutes with the rapid charge pro which is a lifesaver when something comes up and you have to head out i want to say thanks once more to lenovo
