crafter i have four i'll let you know i'm kill leader okay all right i i'm i have three yeah you took one from me though you should have been 5-2 not really i was in survival mode so there's no taking kills when you're in survival that's true that's true oh i just used my grapple nice nice nice i'll see you i will see you later there's a fight over this way where oh there's a team right in front of me right after me like literally right now i'm gonna come back this team okay this team's running right out of my face okay i'm coming back i have not have much ammo at all this is rough i'm being shot by i don't know how i'm being shot by both squads there's a car over this way mate oh come on john coming up to you i tell you it's actually screaming groot play safe i'll be there in a sec but i have no ammo yeah oh one's at the rock he's not he's not pushing or maybe he is oh my god thank you i took 70 as well our team made it out what a hero yeah i've noticed americans love to like shorten

now you were punching that keyboard say you type fast mate is everyone dead i'm confused no no no i think there's another one was it that just because it was another squad than before or what i got

lifeline i need i'll crack the crypto too track crypto got him off oh my god wherever they may be mate look at the circle this this is round one has just finished this is crazy i think the other team

that's left oh here we go triple t man i beamed him i didn't i didn't hit him once oh he's sliding down there's one low ground yeah and there's one behind me because they've really split yeah they're being kind of weird they're being a little bit weird won't just jump to your head i'll be there in a second i downed one i gotta oh please don't kill me yeah you should have been here for the 28th party oh my god that was unreal i ca i got like that sound cue that there's another team i got that like 45 times that game that's crazy oh man that was wild apex champions welcome back a nine minute game that was ridiculous yeah nine minutes nine minutes oh my god all right i may have yanked a few survival modes survivals purely survival a lot of masses a lot of pred trails we can't land center because people want to do it before us my bad wait his name um okay yeah yeah exactly his name that's so that's kind of that's kind of weird it's us it's us 4k after 80 kills i'm lagging so bad oh yeah all over the place oh like are you are you lag lagging i have a little i have a lot of pocket loss yeah i have my packets aren't being lost mate i don't even know how you guys are firing at people so bad oh my god did i kill someone no i kill him with my grenade oh come on my inn is and my house is 25 30 47 47 20. my end is at 43 now it's going down finally i'm going straight in i'm

just dead come on rich let's go behind you hello can't stop me get got so many easy kills there it was amazing i have one kill yeah i have seven and probably seven hundred damage extended what are they doing up there oh my god i don't know if you see a scientist i've been one what are these guys doing oh no i don't trust him though like i'm literally just lit in the open and they struggling i want to take this to go first i'll just tank it oh he's either on it they're on it you built coming in i broke up watson reloading over here i didn't want to follow his homeboys you know there he is sending out my decoy um i have zero ammo what you need heavy light energy energy yeah i have no energy i'm afraid oh i'm coming in clutch oh big plays big pins oh okay and take that however you want it's not what i heard but that's exactly what you heard i've been playing so much solid for me in the character selection screen i'm uh i'm full-blown content creator which means i'm family friendly so i don't know what you're talking about oh okay did you skip that pie oh well for content i put like the nudity there's a nudity filter ah for content purposes yay you might as well might as well don't wanna i don't wanna shock the kids no swearing but there will be a lot of nudes here a lot of pings come on uh pings oh pink oh yeah yeah yeah pink did you ever use one oh who was that is that my teammate no oh that took one shot and they missed it okay they've shot like 15 more and missed them all i wasn't even moving anymore 23. i'm lagging beyond delete you're wagging oh you got one clip by the laggiest person this ever oh okay nice i'm i mean that's kind of what i'm doing right now i'm like the laggiest person here and i'm just no one can shoot me i'm unstoppable mine's not pink mine's like i can't move how much packet loss you have okay at the moment it's 6 and 17 but i don't know if that's packet loss or what what does that mean mine mine went down i don't know i just i always just look at the latency and the loss oh loss is 46 45 what's in an 8 i don't know what that means me i don't know you're the one that kept talking about it yeah i don't know if it's a high number it looks bad so i i usually when i think the pacquiao are the loss is bad oh my oh my god it's the boys and they're back in town i don't know who they're firing at it's not me is it my decoy no they shouldn't our teammate oh okay your decoy is nowhere to be no no it's fun boosting them i can see it's literally somewhere i can't even control it i'm lagging so hard they're all on me trying to get an angle without dying i'm dead dude is trying to crouch spam his life away i'm so dead i'm i don't think i've okay seen somebody crouch damn so fast and missed so many shots consecutively and that's quite actually impressive i still have a spectator let me think i'm cheating men think of ddos this earlier um i might have uh i might have um crouched uh tactically crouched multiple times ah on top of somebody's box oh good okay but like i said they were tactical so you're just trying to dodge the head shots oh no yeah it was just preemptive dodging of bullets yeah from third party people being there no oh my god oh that was the weirdest i've ever played in my entire life i can't wait to see my damage i'm not sure if i'm going to be allowed i'm still stuck i mean yeah yeah are you still on this 1100 i'm still stuck on the chat i'm getting a nice are you really yeah yeah so can someone's octane padding next to me wow okay well i told you i was like kills and four uh you had a
