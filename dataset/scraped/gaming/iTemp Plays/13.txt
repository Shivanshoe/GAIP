hey what's up guys it's reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and first things first i missed an upload yesterday for the first time since december 2020. i went all the way through 2021 and half the way through 2022 doing daily apex legends uploads at least daily and on some of those days i even uploaded on my other channel as well now the reason i missed yesterday and i will continue to miss a day here and there for the rest of june is because i'm very busy it's my birthday on the weekend i'm doing something for that and then i'm on holiday towards the end of the month and even though i could have daily uploaded until then then i would have missed like five or six days in a row and it wouldn't have made any sense now the plan is for the videos to be every other day until the end of june just to give myself a little bit of a break you know but the video that i have for you today ended in such a spectacular fashion we came across the final boss of apex a completely cohesive unit whose only goal was to win the game armed with three charge rifles behind vampire shields it was absolutely terrifying the final fight went on for at least six minutes hopefully you enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends on okay i'm done speaking to you i'm doing a solo commentary what's up guys this guy under the same spot sir he didn't break off then rob my flat line i haven't played oh there's someone close and there's one here i shattered an enemy i'm coming to you i'm messing about she's gonna get away i don't have any bullets to shoot her i'll revive the weakness extends through generations um kind of uh yeah yeah lights this is a little care package for you ready come back i'm not moving light ammo here quick before you're obviously again nice thank you someone's trying to respawn over here uh tell him not to i i sniped it twice so oh you gotta tell them you have to tell them where do you rotate in a map like this uh well i'm ash i can tell you a bunch of people died at energy depots no one died at grove towers i he i hear stuff in front of me yeah and i see a person in front of me as well i'll be honest with you what are you doing i'm still very angry at this oh i'm very focused syringe here broken enemies i just like i knew she was gonna go i knew that was gonna happen you know you know what i noticed people on pc don't uh like rate phase and then leave the game just constantly you remember how often that used to happen on console like every every match or every game there was one one little wraith one bald rape i've done a few times always won a lot of damage oh where is it everything on my screen is blue [Laughter] units i i'm actually impressed um oh that's amazing standing by did they change four or five it's like 150 percent i don't know added a zero to it that was the ultra boss right there they're not dying i need a lead i don't have anything i need an exchange more than i need oxygen on my headlights i just found my first one there's a great one up here on that box there's people over here too there's this way i'm gonna heal all right we need to be smart guy here looking at me funny that team ran away i'm not gonna chase that i'm coming to you they have a rope in there i don't know what the rope's going on i don't know what's happening with the rope so be careful that's the worst part of nade [Music] three seconds just looking i wanna hear that comes the first thought the pathfinder get is like hold on let me put a rope in here gotta pop my ultimates gotta put a rope in here real quick this will save us they're fighting north thank you recharging shields scooby's an absolute legend i forgive him for the initial arguments that we had what uh oh yeah you were mad at him at one point for them why he didn't break off and then he landed and he stole the flatline okay you'd have been raging they might land on that give me careful there's a team there's a team down here though they might not give you actually okay well as soon as they come hey i called it half an hour ago so that's not my fault someone's close still yeah i think they're all back there no there's still one question eliminate the enemy one run back i just got lasered i'm trying i'm trying to cover i need to follow you i'll be sure to swap oh i'm better if you we oh we can't go back though i think we might have to i don't know can i grab his banner than asheville back is that a smart player um it's risky but it might work i need this car no left no no okay well we can just come back yep stack some stuff feed the balls stuff you know um we just go right yeah which way is right this way oh that makes way more sense yeah that's why it starts on what was i thinking i don't know you're you're just kind of there i'm an idiot be good yeah they will be bound fine choose your old if you need to yes yes i'm gone it's not that oh this has been a fun game first game on yeah sentinel as well recharging ah i wasn't warmed up before i'm warmed up now i'm gonna die uh yeah i don't think when you're on the team your team leader so anything you say 45 seconds um i don't i don't see them i don't know where they could have gone i hope they're not up here you didn't ping that blue that's a sniper mag i'm sorry beauty cringe behavior it's not every day i have a teammate that uses a sniper first came on kind of popping off though how many bats do you have i have uh three okay it's fine i'll say that is them i have one but i'm not gonna be in their face that much here i'll drop you in an acceptable selection where do the boys go i'm second shot from where all from grove towers i think we work it out is it yeah i think there's a team in grove towers oh i've got some bad news for you mate some really bad news my secondary is a car okay and i suck with the car oh okay so that's not what i want to hear this might go really bad that's what i'm trying to say oh we got this i believe um okay no they is that the same team i think it's the same thing they just alt again no i think they went to the right one is it it's a full team yeah i don't know i didn't get to see him i only see one gotta be more than one i think i think there were two beforehand correct i don't know on this okay i'm going up right here incoming i hate i hate these things i hate these things i can't shoot wall rotating in a very slow circle so hard i'll find the final charge rifle guy oh my god what is that let's go let's go kill them now hold on right now hold on hang on a second mate reach out she got something i don't know what she got but she got something so will she cross them up and their teammates because i've noticed that they're not shooting her no i don't i i i don't understand what's happening wait did a team just i think you saw team wait wait how do they see me i don't know i'm confused i don't know where this other team is same this might be the worst you idiot mate we can actually bait it though if i go down they'll come over um how fast will they go they get over here really fast though with that rope honestly go down i'll rez you that's the thing go back yeah but look at the way they're playing you actually think they're gonna push if they down one of us they'll get too excited they haven't downed a guy all game come on that is true they're behind ramparts they're gonna take that rope but they're gonna be here like two seconds oh this is terrible i mean we can just if we can just push up i can just uh tack up and then all open yeah wait i can craft two bucks here replicator i have four you need i mean but recharging shields hey fine how long do you think this fight's gonna be i mean this could be a while oh no no we end that's why we end it now okay go what are you doing i'm healing up you know that okay i'll do that what are you doing that's what i do what are you doing they both what are you doing there's three of them i thought there was one what are you doing go go far right go swing far right far right oh god there's a problem there's a problem it's a bit of an issue we're facing and they're safe and we're not what am i watching how many um how many cells you have i how many buddies you reckon they have this could be another strategy sniper's hard to find they don't have a crafter yeah but even still i don't know i think you're i think your us are underestimating their playstyle they've probably been farming bullets all game right yeah let's go let's go far right we we have cover over there that work where we can walk up and then if they if they don't if they don't like uh group up then we can just kill the one that's far okay i'm gonna charge up now i have too remember so yeah i got mastered too so we we're getting there i mean all three of them only have one gun there's decent price range oh yeah you're messing about getting getting in can you get noticed in my house making stupid noises sorry i mean i'm here don't worry just press it i don't think i don't think i think they gripped out i think they all backed up oh god oh my god oh god are you serious oh how do we do this i don't know i think we i think whatever plan we use has to involve detroit we have to we have to utilize what we've got this is exactly why you're not idling i'll keep shooting those down are they all right there yes recharging okay when you heal up if i can get if i can get an angle i'm going to creep up and then just uh go up and talk wait for me to heal up yeah wait for me to look i've got my tack to keep one of them there and i've got an arc off your ulti okay are they all still there they have a shayla yes okay oh let me know when you want my attack let me charge you we've got to do this so i think i could walk up left side right now if you just keep shooting and stuff so they can't hear me i'm walking up and walking up walking yeah is there more than one right there i don't see them i don't know where they all are i'm gonna actually i'm ready i'm dropping can we take those can we take their shields maybe i don't bind once the top one's attacking i don't know marshall remember okay oh god i was trying to knock her off the edge oh five seconds five seconds left they're right in there right now i'm ready go go go go go go watch she's behind the shield she's behind the shield you can wait for it yeah yeah oh my god what played i'll play apex champions what an end game what played at the end i didn't really do much damage to any of them i was trolling i i promise you we shouldn't have won that one minutes what
