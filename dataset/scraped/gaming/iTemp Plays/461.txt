hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing with ragtag we had some great games yesterday including this one where i nearly got my 4k badge on pathfinder but when i was watching it back i realized that i was only close to 4 000 damage because of some questionable decisions that got ragtag killed now i know that ragtag is uploading a video not long after this one so be sure to check out his channel in the description if you guys would like to see some more of our games that we played together yesterday so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you know how you hit landing in the states i am absolutely down to loot one little house get a stock and a shield bath and no armor and no gun and grapple to save it which are you landing in the middle right in the middle oh i like it i'm going to literally oh i'm going in the building in the door chill bat armor i can't see i'm dead it's good she actually is trying to finish me i'm gonna do the same turn i'll have the table sometimes we can bring them back mate just do it right in the middle you ready i'm worth it yeah totally ready you've got to enter stakes with the mindset of it's over in 10 seconds no one can see me i'm actually invisible there's a guy over this way let's move this way yeah that's the mindset and if you don't have that mindset get out of the states that's what i say i'm dropping this in this building mate i'll try and look over you i can it worked dude oh yeah there we go it's been popped oh run off down again beautiful boys behind that's a separate scene oh my god fortunately he decided i was more important than you why would he do that because it's caustic i might be able to raise i'll just get these guys fighting i am so sorry are you i usually see these i can't believe you just did that does that matter in the game i mean throwing is a strong word it's the right word but i wanted to i needed to arm switch off you but you didn't have you have any armor only one minute until the ring closes how's the fresh red like a newly born giraffe i have no energy also no heavy good job i didn't work i'm so sorry i knew that trap was there why didn't i just react to it can i is there one in the craft that you know that's gonna full send send it just send it out grenade watch his final gift how tactic is this this one we should go this way i would feel vindicated if you just wait for that caustic banner to time out i'm sure i'll just stand there and come back no no no we'll let him rest and we'll just kill him from the respawn that's even worse oh there's so much here it's like looted not i'm gonna i'm gonna open the bins i won't look inside i'm gonna save some time i don't believe you i don't believe you someone's here yeah they're here but i fine and there's another team they've got some major hegwitches they both have purple i think shield back to lifeline coming upstairs giving my shields a recharge lifeline 120 have no shield hills nice there's another team here [Music] reloading this is phoenix i'm not with you really i'm yeah i'm on fire and stuff man i need to i'm with you oh my god sorry close enough i climbed up one of them did they're gonna kick this again yeah do that again kick it kick it it's tough it's gonna definitely land behind us here yeah them oh my gosh what's the live rag i i have no idea how but we'll take it take it did you oh we're fine we're fine fine i just wondered if you did drop that phoenix i didn't want to leave behind but i don't think we're gonna go back for it yeah sorry that would i heard the little footsteps and i knew it was close i have nine syringes i don't know if you need something yeah i could do with a football oh there's two here might be something good this way um all right i need some light i assume they had some but i panicked and influenced them there's some light for you i think thank you very heavy uh yes i have 120 heavy and i wasn't using oh here i have who knows we're here this way i'm gonna get to the middle 112. but all right we do this oh but these people that rock up late are giving us a chance here if they didn't love the firmware and just wait for one of us to go in the open and beam us um um do you need themselves i have i may or may not have uh 21. i have 13. i don't know why i feel comforted to know that we have over 30 between us [Laughter] late stage camping activated absolutely i need to double check for light rains when i loot like i'm so bad at looting because i yeah 300 here perfect i only look for a certain thing one at a time when i'm in a box i don't know why i don't multitask yes i i understand that i'm definitely with you on that one there do you i said too convincing um it's more the the flashbacks horrors of the comments section going tank you missed another three battle stabilizer yes thank you watching it back while editing it it didn't become clear at all you know right here he's down what's happening here do you have a phoenix i don't have a phoenix i do i do nice i don't want to promise one and then not deliver again i'm not going to hold that i was going to say i'm not going to hold that against you but i would i'll complain brave by the way in public games yeah honestly we need to talk about that what's going on here i can't be friends with someone that does that wow next game you want to play up 10 reps yes just a tackle you're already inside the next round i love them get i'm giving my it a recharge me i forgot to pick up grenades and stuff uh i have uno grenada package i love it let's go and get this care package who are they shooting at is that all right yeah it's fine mate i'll save my grappler if you need it yeah my friends recharging shields the one no i aimed this did you know we don't get any aim assist on the crater i did know that yep horrendous but it's still fun you were dead half the game because everyone kept using the respawns though okay i'm sticking with that excuse me where are these losers there's two up here but there's also a charge rifle charlie over this way i mean they're all kicking off we could just like wrap around to get behind this team so we don't get surprised by the charge rifle team well all the way around here yeah could queue up the wall but they'll probably see it anyway the right ones here let's explore this way [Applause] too quick yeah let's settle down here bloodhound right there nice he's flesh oh mate he is a literal oh i'll be back i'll try cracked one just keep going just keep going i'm gonna i'm gonna protect you back there's definitely two there i wonder where they went inside i think they're fighting back that was nice to get you i mean i did hit one for like 120 or something let's go let's go it's actually amazing i managed to miss forgot about that i nearly had a 4k i should have found a little bit more if you use this game you have to add a zero to my damage i just remember that i killed you with the corset gas i'm never gonna forget it just remember that part about that game oh i will don't you worry
