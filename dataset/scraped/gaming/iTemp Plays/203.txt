hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more a pixel legends of course and we are using the hemlock in single fire mode every now and again i've really discovered just how fun this gun actually is i don't think i've posted a hemlock video in months but here we are having a great time with it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends well that's not my gun she's cracked there's a white armor swap right on the outside okay a lot one someone here there's someone here yeah this should be he's the best someone back yeah get ready there's an enemy close by he's one on that recharging shields mclaughlin i did not want to get hit by that oh the after death made ah martyrdom mate this guy's this guy plays cod 4 you play cod 4 um i don't know maybe probably i don't remember what it's called for me it's too busy being a real kid having fun playing sports yeah i was in the kid when coffee came out outdoors doing good in school yeah yeah well i was not uh on me oh my god finally lance everyone lands over this way i've been up there trying to get to you someone else took the gravity thing i think maybe not myself i'm just trying to survive yeah yeah they are really messing him up i don't want inside so they probably just revived him already i finished the uh one of them i try and get banner okay some of them revive on each side pop this one okay there are three squads left because everyone was over the side the map apparently whoa we survived though yeah pretty much i'll stop here just for a sec actual no it's rain all right look down here oh yeah any of this is dude uh cascade looks it the other side does and there's a rope from that building today yeah it's gonna be good should be there's no way anyone else is on that side of the map i refuse to believe it i completely forgot that was a thing booster loader these might have some the most insane attachments come on yeah come on please yes the barrel stabilizer was up there oh god it's cracked there's one fire left by there are five just take this behind rampage and i'm looking for a hemlock but until i find the hemlock rampage is a pretty good placeholder especially with a few early uh watching mccorms thermites as they're called i am going to go this way let's go here i can i guess i'll ah i can't i guess i was gonna drop my ultimate over there but i don't think it's worth it maybe drop in the middle here careful it must just be up here surely where on earth are these people man where are they hello sir someone just revived mama's got you now that is not what i wanted to go what it is but i didn't realize there was all that mess down there do i have time to change this just about i don't have that much ammo hi there's no way ow setting up uh oh my god that's one guy here on the left i think trying to mess me up please i'm gonna die please someone shoot this guy oh my word thank you i've shown the challenge with basically nothing left in the tank but i thought we were all just gonna rush him i mean i killed the other two nice thank you i mean they are big scrapping over this way and there aren't that many people left you know what i'm starting to agree with people that world's edge like my word to be honest it's the same on storm point everyone just scraps at the first location well on what's edge they don't they scrap it scrap at all but if lava siphon is the first location they'll scrap their instead just a factual statement oh they're so weak oh we got the corsica least always go for corsic first it's got better sessions than me going on here what's even up to careful teammate i mean that teammate's dead but we're about to get third quick here there's only two of these guys yeah no that's why we don't understand there yeah don't stand there teammate enemy here shut some throwables we made it to the top three now to clean up the rest dj package careful i should probably crack some hammer i think it costs 20 though when i'm low bur all right are we going to be the ones that get 30 here is it going to be then are they still from us it was gonna be us oh my god they didn't follow i knew this is going to happen oh now we're going to get okay it was so obvious it was so so obvious please get out of that you're gonna get shot in the back i just i just can't i just don't know what you're doing darlings that was a leap wasn't it i'm out of heavy ammo they got the banner i'm confused are there three people there i see someone over there we've got ten seconds don't drive out donnie we could have had a full team here they didn't listen to my pings that team's top middle i mean can't even contest that really it's too difficult right we just need a zone to pull them out i've won the uh the war there if my team would've had many of these thanks don't forget who hooked you up this friendship yes that is who i think is left like i think yeah look lobert pathfinder she's masters he's got like a 20 bomb that's who we're dealing with here i've got your back team up top he's our enemy they're masters 20 bomb god i didn't need this first game of the day you know it's too stress this is what solo queuing is like it's oh you want to play against as a fully stacked three stack do your first game of the day cheers apex go i mean if you can't handle the fire don't jump into the frying pan as the saying goes you know are you peeking stop it i've got a single fight hemlock maybe maybe i think the other team is just sat inside there oh this isn't the team that was okay there's a team inside oh my god where do we even go we gotta try and play like low low ground oh my god these team up top i need to i need to team up with this guy oh i mean i'm dead right the wraith is gonna hop over this wall like i don't know where else she could be oh my god me gets two yeah what can i do i can do nothing we tried we tried man we could have had a full team of three there at the end if they listen to my pings like we're just putting ourselves in the worst positions to get third parted and it's exactly what happened like twice in a row i mean it was a good game it went down to the y if only me and the wraith could have teamed up but we were at the same level so we had to shoot each other if we could have teamed up against them and if they didn't have the ultimate high ground the entire game we might have been able to kill him you know it was still a good game good job guys
