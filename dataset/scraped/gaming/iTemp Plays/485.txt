hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are going to be playing some more apex legends believe it or not and i don't know about you guys but i love the anniversary events you can find amazing loot within the first minute or so of your game you have to waste your time finding level 1 armor or knock down shields everything is blue and above however landing with the mozambique has meant that i just get triple dropped on all the time now they will see me landing at a door solo and the whole squad turns up and shoots me in the back 12 times with mozambs it's up to carnage and it's infuriating now this is where course it comes in i can control a building easily with his canisters if i get dropped on and delay until help arrives it saved my life so many times it's funny that whenever i find an issue on apex i feel like corsic is always the answer he's just so good but before we get into today's video just a word from today's sponsors thanks to lenovo legion and intel for sponsoring today's video this is the lenovo legion 7i laptop and it has desktop grade power with an intel core i7 processor and an nvidia rtx 2080 super gpu with real time rate rating but the lenovo legion 7i laptop wasn't designed just to be powerful it was designed to be practical as well we don't always have access to the greatest monitors or peripherals whilst on the go and that is why lenovo haven't compromised when it comes to the quality of any of the components the display is a 15.6 inch full hd refresh rate 1 millisecond response time screen these are the specs that you need to be able to compete at the highest level of gaming it also includes a true strike keyboard with sub millisecond response with just a 1.3 millimeter key travel distance your inputs are instant now the problem with regular gaming laptops is that even if they are powerful you need external components like a gaming monitor or keyboard so you're not at a disadvantage to desktop gamers lenovo brings the power but also the quality of desktop gaming and makes it portable you will have the advantage with the quality of components on the lenovo legion 7i laptop which makes it a true gaming laptop and that is why i love it now once you've had the 7i laptop for a few months you start to appreciate lenovo's attention to detail when it comes to both the cooling and the charging of the laptop the cold front 2.0 two millimeter vapor chamber and six point thermal sensor array help keep the lenovo legion 7i laptop cool whilst gaming and you can also go from zero to 50 charge in under 30 minutes with the rapid charge pro it's a lifesaver thank you so much to lenovo legion and intel for sponsoring this video if you want to find more about the 7i laptop and get your hands on one there is a link in the description and you can also get 10 off all of your lenovo devices with code item 10 at checkout so thanks for watching guys i appreciate it and i will see you all in five

action-packed start yeah something like that i'm kicking off maybe i should take these balls and go and get that i don't have any leave one sec i'm gonna go get this extended energy it was gold so it's time it's worth it ready i could check that box but i can't be bothered it's mile away is what people don't understand that play me so far is that you can't look you know that's just kind of true yeah you are in the fight i'm impatient you are the that's what it is very impatient that's all thanks to uh wait whoa whoa the heck okay i have five battles okay okay zero star people right from me i mean you missed the get in so that's come on are you kid why are you kidding are you are you actually having a laugh what do you mean around the corner oh you're fine i'm not sure okay this is a cool this is a great spot let's get out of them i'm dropping my massive five ah i have six anything worthwhile oh there's a digi in that one there we go oh it uses bait 180 or something on one of the guys hey they're so challenging i'm not switching when i need 20 damage off charging on my shields just switch nope i'll hear that please say you have a pad i'm knowing that um i do indeed i'm trying to think of where i should put it don't think just throw the fight i think i'm gonna go i think i'm gonna go up this way let's go here the big big brain plays targets there's a rampard up here okay they all jumped a lot of damage a lot of damage nice thanks that was that was a lot of damage i sent flying with the first nade into the secondary arc star i prepared earlier they did not see the frame place coming no they didn't expect that at all no much like that no one would even blame them uh this is not the way to go right this is definitely the way to go what do you mean where are we going are we wrapping around energy department yeah we're gonna we're gonna find something this way look at this look at this you're a genius nearly crack the first guy okay i've never missed so many shots in my life i'm gonna need you to start hitting those cracked 91 nine damage nice 14 yards come on well he was i mean he was cracking from 91 so you're probably 14 but you're actually nine maximum wait this is the last team by the way how are you such a tactical genius you know you know i just i don't know you can't just you can't explain it it's natural i'm gonna be i'm gonna be i'm gonna be honest with you you are the apex i didn't know the circle was going that way so i just committed and it worked out okay all right i see there were there was no tactics involved there's natural intuition yeah we might have 10 minute wins we've had today like imagine if that's a 14 minute game we're going to end game with like 2 000 damage we're dropping like dual 3ks maybe a 4k you know
