hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today is the day my friends we are trying out linear if you aren't aware linear is a response curve on apex legends and it is also what so far plays on if you don't know who so far is then you probably haven't seen any of the videos on this channel in the past like three months because most of them are with him and in most of the games he out damages and out kills me don't tell him i said this but he's probably the best controller player i know but his control scheme is just really really weird linear is raw importantly it's just so unforgiving i remember i turned it on for about 20 seconds before i got one kill luckily but instantly went back to classic but today is the day we're going to test it out properly i just really hope i can win some gunfights that's the that's the dream my friend so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds all right i'm liking this tactic because the care packages are landing nearby and the age old tactic in the current care package takeover is to land at the closest little loot spot in the in the distance there is a scrap and it's at the care packages and the best thing about the care packages is that they do not spawn any healable only blue armor and blue guns from what i can remember so if these guys are shooting each other there's a good chance many of them are awake potentially even one shot smoke up there there we go oh then i was going to run over i would have run over those buildings definitely oh god i didn't mean to throw that far to the right am so sorry i've been there my friend ice doing that purple i'll see you level it up okay please don't shoot me i'm just trying to get my i'm trying to pop a an organic non-gmo shield battery gluten free shield battery right there about a boneless shield battery where's the where is this guy oh he's dead fantastic work have you ever seen a more so far killed than octane keep flying with a flat line i think that's the most so far kill you can get and i've just pulled it off uh i'm also kind of struggling especially considering i have a uh i need it please oh my gosh oh my heart dropped but i'm still here so i'm still alive the only thing that can take me out of the moment is um is gravity it would appear all right three kills my oh my um my tactic is working out my tactic is just to full send anything no one ever got better at fps games by camping in a building until there's two people left no one gets better by having one gunfight every 20 minutes you know you've got to get yourself involved you've got to make mistakes you've got to lose gunfights to get better that's exactly what i plan on doing i plan on losing a lot of gunfights that's my speciality what i'm known for takes cover huh gotta stand in the open advice like a man look at this say goodbye to your shin bones nice and then we can respawn them with that banner is the guys alive would appear the answer to that question is yes quite nice uh well there's a respawn where he came from and oh hello fringe what you got for me today a shield bat tremendous thank you gracias amigo as they say spain and other spanish-speaking countries and the good news here is that we also have the the purple care packages dropping down next to us going to spawn in getting himself some some brand new fresh off the press purple armor all right four kills i've contributed if there was an assist column i would probably have like three six so four kills three seas honestly i've exceeded my expectations for this particular game anything past this point is a complete bonus i was just trying to get a few kills for a winner actually gonna take that it's got level three mag and stuff i mean the one times two times bit would be weird i don't like variable scopes because i always accidentally press them but it's worth it for the magnum and the stock i think oh it was way better about 400. i'm still in need of a light mag but i mean and a few extra shields impossible i know that a few of them died over this way any line max i need an extender can you hear a giant scrap of the ps5 that all fights over the last ps5 that's in stock and i'll tell you what i've already got a ps5 but i still want to get involved in that in that scrap it would just be nice to win it you know i'd leave the ps5 there for the second place but i do want to scrap yeah let's get on the drum tab let's go i don't know what he's done to his dome shield i heard dome shield but there's a there's a fight that i'm more interested in here i need to change the sticks on my scuff i'm insane stick drift i thought you were sending me put his friends in here careful hello i'm shooting between these little robot legs oh dear me what's happened there fringe you've got yourself i can't believe i'm standing still they're behind they're behind no they're not this is so confusing this audio is bamboozling got my pad if necessary we can just climb them are we are they they're not pushing us are they take that 32 damage let's fight and trans and oh i don't know i can't remember isaac i think my mind is just i'm so focused on trying to actually control my aim but anything else right now is he's secondary you know what's not making much sense here you're just you're just chilling at the top i might just do it no one's making any proactive plays you've disappeared nice you're invisible oh my word is the whole gang hippies just jumped in front of lifeline like like the secret service protecting the president we haven't been pushing the back here that's sort of a suicide push really the world's biggest flank oh he's got my shield guys what's going on is too good let's go let's go let's go no medki here donald's about to close it on us i always call it the storm like it's four nights stuck in my old ways i think storm is such a better term than it's all raining stuff thunderbolts everything terrifying we need to get out of here i cannot believe we've survived this long i would go as far to say that that may be a christmas miracle okay oh it's got care packages just in time oh my god imagine if i died evo i don't fancy the only problem is they don't spawn with much ammo so if you don't have the same ammo type you're kind of struggling should i hemlock actually no no no the flat line is the so far good and that's that's all we're doing replicator r9 flat line off thing oh here we go gold online as well to go along i need light ammo please don't hit me i'll take it look i'm taking two stacks i just felt like a school kid again i was intimidating i don't know if it was because it was gibby or because he had the high ground of what where's my hollow's out there this is my only shield back that i found the entire game and i got it from a marvin boss they're still in the world i'm just trying to win i'm trying to whoa marvin's arm i don't know if there's any marvin's about i'm just trying to win gibby now my control is disconnected there we go we're back these are the last two teams and they're big scrapping and we'll come in with a third but we might we might actually win the game hang on let me this may happen oh god please die nice did we win no you know mass potentially probably down in the ring yes they are actually sensational that lobby didn't seem to too sweaty i know recently the games have been horrendous i've been playing against the same predators every single day but this one they've thrown me a bone 2400 damage i'll take it uh give me did he take a few however i don't mind i'm just trying to win i'm just trying to win on linear and he doesn't know if they're weak you know i've been on the flip side where i have i've i've been the person with 12 kills and 1500 damage doing a 100 damage per kill i've been there you just you see people you shoot them you know or you just dive in front of them like the secret service to secure that last 50 damage it was a good game i'm happy with that i might stick with linear i need to sort out my stick drift but apart from that that felt good thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
