hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be using the wingman i know what you're thinking just a few videos ago i told you to never let me use this weapon but i am determined to get better with this gun the intro clips here are from winter express but the two game players that i have for you today are just regular games by the way just so i'd let you know that uh but yeah it's definitely the best gun that i'm not good with all of the other guns that are top of the t list i can use and be effective and output damage apart from this particular one i'm trying to get better and the biggest change that i'm making when i use this gun is just to fire it a little bit slower and try and be more accurate rather than just spamming it and praying that one of the shots hits whether this tactic is going to work for me or not is yet to be seen but one day i will be a confident wingman gamer one day so yeah thanks for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i watched him for the whole game did you dream uh he got like 23 kills or something one moved me i've had more on that i know i was like dude you're cheater you can't even get that much actually i think that might be my max 23 or 24 uh i think i got 27 like three times i was so mad that i couldn't get more than 27. oh and then they put skill based in yeah oh yeah i mean that's out of there i'm looking at this door so many people running close side no i'm not saying baby that little banana little banana middle banana oh my god i just eated way too far say banana banana banana i like what you say no banana banners banana banners i have a school piece of wingman so i can't drop it right is that how that works uh yes i believe sir all right speak following man man let's go face there nice nice ice i don't have an armor nice hey kind of struggling first game on bing man we want to have this one last time we have to get inside the room we're all going back full circle unless you're going to leave the game have guns i'm coming over oh he's getting lifeline rice nice oh you closed the board mate i didn't mean to i was literally trying to open it sorry what's happening oh mate oh my god she just kept lifeline resin yeah it's such a good spot for resin i sort of trapped you in there man i didn't realize i was trying to i don't know what i was trying to do i mean i shouldn't have went in to a fair but you kind of kind of did so it's fine that's fine yeah you know do that have you ever med kit um yes i do level three i could definitely use that thank you you know what you actually could i kind of i kind of deserve it you kind of need that i did i landed two headshots in the same guy for 100 each i can't believe it that's that's just big i'm glad are you happy with the windmill i mean for now that's the thing i feel like i should quit whilst i'm ahead do you ever throw one so i got a treat for you i have i do not there's a team over here too by the way i don't i have a public senate line let me know if i need it my aim is horrendous by the way i feel it yeah they're all here i'm trying to get here pack the lifeline come on come on turn around come on let me almost oh my god mate i was trying to armor switch trying to obviously trump on on controllers it's not this is not the play it's not the play ah i was stressful that was uh very stressful i will admit you ever like um you ever get really into uh you know there's a really intense fight or something and then after after the fight's over your eyes are just hurting because you you're not blinking i do that all the time i don't think i blink i think like when i get into fights and stuff i don't really blink much so after the fight my eyes are all dry i haven't told you my superpower have i dropping from there what is it i have a superpower and it's that i just don't need to blink you just don't blink ever i'm not lying like i can cut onions and it just will not affect me at all so you just never blink never i don't well i don't need to like i do because it's like uh you know when you i know it's just a instinct right but i yeah yeah but i just mean like just regularly so i know do you even have eyelashes yes i have long eyelashes yes i'm very beautiful i feel like your body doesn't i feel like your body doesn't need them at this point you've just involved evolved into another species yeah i'm not seeing eyelashes but yeah when i've got onions i'm just like it doesn't affect me all right eyelashes only to like keep dust out of your eyes or something so and rain and sweat right i think so yeah just to keep stuff out of your eyes i believe so let me know if you find a one times hitchcock for the boys please i huge pigment good accuracy that's linear for you no aiming system that one time oh no linear at all no aim is this at all that's why i just missed everything what's it gonna be it's gonna be a crater it's gonna be an armor yeah it's in the arm at this stage is he hand yeah we need to i'm gonna i'm gonna get to the building or something yeah this is kind of a mess i think i'm gonna try and get behind this team it's right on my head it's gonna heal up just a little bit oh my god team um i don't know hey i don't know this guy's got a digital threat i know he doesn't even just see me through smoke i'm getting shot by this there's devo i think i can just crawl off i honestly think i'm okay just to crawl off rockstar i like thank you what a guy do you have any shield it's so bad um i have two i'll drop you one thank you right here in the smoke in the middle smoke thanks very much oh nice how are you alive i don't know that's uh that's not my oh that's not my own hey ah don't hit me please lifeline here just find this she ran off i should have picked up a digital threat that one the heck's going on did i not pick up the phoenix kick phoenix man i do and do enjoy trying to learn to use the wingman i i feel like i just fire it too quick and if i slow down i'll be all right yeah i think you just got a piece of shots a little bit you should just panic i don't know how we've survived all of that um yeah i think our teammate rocked up with the perfect time he came in just like he revived me and like him at the perfect time he did i think they're fighting inside fragment oh yeah they must be scrapping oh vic is just absolutely popped off i think i've been down three times this game maybe i don't know we've been on death's door about eight different fights have you really been down that much i think at least twice at least i hear someone might set a new record okay how do we win that game i really don't know first game on and i started using a wingman mastiff i mean that's if that's not bravery i don't know what he's that's a lot of confidence that's courage wait why did i team i have no neck did you see that that's good do you want me what i didn't know it looked like that i guess it does it looks like that guy from 99 fiance and if you've ever seen him ed yeah he looks just like him his name's ed edin rose my game uh are you landing four-story uh i'm at market okay i probably i don't know i didn't know where you were okay i'm in autopilot i'm in autopilot you're good you're good i have a finer dream i'm usually asleep by now by the way are you are you actually no no honestly um what time is it no i'm usually asleep like around 9 10 at the latest which is in like two maybe three hours okay that's not bad not terrible sorry okay over there i have a turbo have a sorry that's that's the only thing that i could find dude in fact do you want a turbo like devo again gonna go round two no sooner or later suppress big surprise speak subtract oh i've just dropped the flat line for flatline you can send mine if you want nice i'm gonna res oh big nights coming in from behind i think there's multiple teams here by the way just fine kung fu kick me oh my god i'm taking that down the right against you on the back on me program okay what the heck is going on over here my lifeline is not happening oh my god it is popping i see so many people flying over here everything i have to go i just saw like three people flying in the air what are they flying on what are they doing i think i think there's a pad over here oh yeah there's an octane here popping about from that way i mean desperate need of some energy i have not seen any i think that's a different team so i'm gonna probably ultimately nice lifeline wasn't the last one right oh my god i mean i wouldn't be surprised if another team rocks up in the next 30 seconds i think it's great for content it would have been toxic i was going to hit the pad and try to mastiff him like meet him halfway and just mask him out of the air i mean i'm really oh i'm trying to fly through a fence you can't fire where are you at buddy oh he's is he at the top i should bat tempted not to but i should we have to move here and say there's a guy right here he went like up top left i think i'm very confused is he above me he's not climbing is that you climbing i'm no i'm confused i heard him but now i don't we'll have to go this way so yeah i have no clue what just happened i need someone to find download need a vault so i'm going this way all right yeah i saw some teams flying like southwest over there that there was definitely horizon back there but she may have just like rotated yeah she threw her old at me and then she just ran i don't know where she was yeah she's out of there she's gonna raise those teammates that's okay it's fine what you're full health and you're running away from the fight this guy's like a lifeline lifelong life yes you boys then you know because they could have pushed i'm my ultimate i'm going to pop it right here mate are you muted or you just you're coming i'm literally i'm i'm sorry zone zone dude wait i was i'm sorry i was just confused not good at multitasking i don't know if you noticed i can't talk and and pop off that's fine one or the other i love the ebay so much it's not as good as massive though oh it's ten times better i mean it's not i mean it is yeah but it's not i mean it's all right i mean i'm i'm down i'm down to leave it at that one oh yeah you done i will destroy you no cover what are you talking about what there's covering apex though you can't just all right then all right i'll stand a kilometer you're getting rid of the rng there's no like in the in the there's no actual equal spots of of cover in this game we're getting rid of the rng you're actually dead so good luck you are oh my god oh my god where is this person maybe i am dead yeah here how do you just destroy me right yes these stupid rocks mate and i just destroyed this dude just had a massive and he just got destroyed absolutely out of his was a big flat surface the best gun in the game would be the g7s game you wouldn't see anyone rocking our knife you wouldn't have it that's not as fast the spitfire would be the best gun i i wouldn't hey you never have to reload you don't have to reload yes you do and it's not at the close range it's not like it's all right medium range it's not bad the g7 is by far the worst gun to use close range uh well that's not true it is only viable mid-range that's it i'm running double shotgun right now oh would you get pk a yup yup wow i didn't want slime downhill so if i miss that's fine i see him there's two packs over here i missed no there's a team on me i'm here no he took the crew i think what would he have oh god i don't know i cracked him he's weak oh his boy's here oh my god mate oh my god massive first either eight gb and i had no shotgun bolt who wins i mean here you're better though you're gonna cry that i did there's one they um have stoppers uh no just the mobile okay mate good game listening a little bit heated but we're all friends here you know we're all friends people are gonna think we're actually fighting apex to be fair i know the mastiff is better than the eva all you little i just like the ebay better it's fun let's go there oh very even very even
