hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are continuing our ranked journey into diamond here i am playing solo unfortunately in the first game i was literally playing solo for 90 of the game and uh this series isn't like a strict silo to master's journey by the way i've played a few games so far that i'm sure you will see on the channel soon but i think most of the games i'll be playing by myself with random teammates and i hope you enjoy the struggle thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm landing the bins got a team over that way i'm keeping the uh the mozam there's blue armor this way you got the quad bins i'm gonna use this i can't use the pk come on who are we kidding me with the pk i suck let's look at that gun let's look at the r9 i should protect the longbow longbow vault r99 here someone can take it i need light ammo yeah there's light ammo here loads of ammo here i need energy which you got 60 which i have i've less than you i need energy ammo oh my god or not hmm i think it's two teams be careful maybe shields a maybe actually i don't think i don't think it is i only killed one of them to shame that last shot in landing we don't have a blue tank so there's one cloud still it is a different team i was right two teams i'll put a rope down i think there's three teams to be honest with you all right so there's a team in that building team there and a team up top i heard we need to loot for some stuff first we should go this way using grapple care packages ah such a hard shot it's nice there he's one enemy taken down nice job friends yeah third party i don't have a kill i don't have a kill i have 900 damage what an absolute scam i have one shield cell i don't see anything happening in the feed like he's just gone back there and revived his teammate how unlucky can you get maybe you can save there's two full teams there mate there are two of the people missing from this lobby right because there are four people missing because you should be 18 24 i'm missing two two others oh man i i i nearly picked up a mobile reese one beacon not even a complete waste this is my rat spot i'm sticking to it oh this is great so close to me someone's here all this from minus 18 rp i was just i was way better off before i even joined this game i don't know what i'm supposed to do so horrendous 6 and 12 most people are duos but then if you take me out it's five and 11. the average is a little bit higher than two people per team oh god like this is i think i go there maybe on top of that rock or maybe like one of these rocks i can just maybe chill there just a minute until i thought i heard someone in the water wait for anyone as a person i thought i heard sansa amigo i love it when that happens my bad spot i knew i heard someone close i knew it and now this is the best frisbee in the lobby all right a minus on minus five rp this is great i deserve that kill got a thousand 168 damage let's be careful no one comes around the side though someone could easily come around there i mean i've got grapple though another racquel yes let's go i'm busting 20 here this is great all the rest want to come over this side of the this side of the map do you have a care package gun oh red armor oh i switched that didn't i just a minute until the ring closes at least i don't have to wait for anyone recharging shields hello 45 seconds giving my shields a recharge recharging shields i need to dissuade these people from over here from coming this way they've got horizon on their team yes as long as this team doesn't come to me i'm gonna put pressure on him a little bit just poke him if these guys horizon killed me i'm pretty dead i don't think they want to i don't need to move i have no shield so i can't get hit i mean i want top three so bad beginning there's a climb up there are you climbing 45 seconds until ring closed that team should hopefully display people from climbing up as well because they've got an angle on it and i can just chill on the roof for a long time unless horizon queues up don't do that please i got no shields 30 seconds just 10 seconds steal some kills here achilles worth 18. that's what that means giving my shields a recharge still four squads still four squads nice horizontal pawn up here no gimbals oh my god my heat shield you might kill i got a kill i got a kill i got an extra kill for rp we played that about as well as we could wait we placed third not second i thought that was how what i thought we'd play second uh no wait a platinum is eight rp and diamonds oh come on come on game this is a good drop hoping it is it better be now my favorite place to land i say it every time but my teammates haven't been shot yet and uh it would appear as though it's not anyone else's favorite place to land either don't mention dropping my mark in case they want to go enemies they were that close if i had the havoc so i might be able to beam one if i if i saw them quicker i'm not sure they're gonna push this i don't know i don't know if they are give me a second i've always got time to pop that one's pretty my shields a weak i killed an enemy that was a tough tough um gunfight because i didn't want to cross because there was someone still on top of my building and you saw as soon as i start to cross to try and help my team i got um i got whacked what's in the back boy wing man as the saying goes position revealed by ash they're just where we were yeah yeah which means they're actually pretty close we're in the middle of the next safe zone position revealed again they're just inside the building aren't they we're not the first ones there i see a target in the distance trying to find some damage here i shouldn't have really done that i should have let those two uh i should let those two teams fight really giving my shields a recharge oh i might be able to craft some honestly they're distracted huge thank you do you guys want to switch armor i can farm uh i can find purple with my charge rifle really easy i've got an evo shield here yeah fight's over look we are in the next safe zone though we're fine for a long time i'm not thanking you i'm not sure this team behind us has left you know teammate probably has revolt and he wants to use it though attacking what's up scared behind auntie him a lot i'm not gonna waste my i'm not gonna waste my grandpa i really wanna grappling [Music] i don't need to do this we can get 30 degrees here incoming care package we have good kp right we have i've got four so these syringes i have if you hold on look at that delivery service right in front of him i love the gosh darn charge rifle i've only got a few shots left in my charge rifle hopefully this gun i'll just switch whatever you have it cost 20. oh sniper beautiful [Music] i could have really done with that crater i guess i might as well carry it my team might need it dropped a divo maybe i could take that i have all the energy in the world it'd be hard to find it that's the worst replicator of all time shame we couldn't loot any of those people backed him back to me more i need 10 damage i should definitely switch my um i will be the teammate but he gave me back let's go over there again i've only got a i've got a charge rifle vault i can't really if it's a close range fight i'm pretty i useless be too desperate to get rid of it honestly just let him fly around it's not harming anyone trying to get 10 10 damage there we go why are they doing that that's them on the hill right they're not gonna send us are they there's no way what a waste of an emp unless he needed it for his shields or something to level it up i don't know does that even work carefully behind if anyone was in like the prowler's place they're going to be pushed to us get this guy out here man like i was fine with him driving around for a little bit but now i'm sick of it where's he at i'm not playing quidditch stop it idiot team behind as well team from pretty sure i saw someone pretty sure i saw someone and they're getting pushed by zone yeah they're over there i think that is the lawn maybe i safe in that corner here here two more squads left plus 90 rp feels good wow he's doing that super boost thing i should have stayed up top i'm an idiot we just eliminated well the team we know they are we need to get up quick up top quick because if they push the edge of the i don't know where they are if they push down a little bit what's going on they have them we're fine this might be tricky to be honest we should have saved that uh it was just one guy we didn't need to use the bangalore ultimate 10 seconds this building's safe we can try and get our cold ends back here we wait here until bangalore uh has alt again and revenant on my way just a second i'm stuck here oh good you're fine they're just flying the drone around again they should have pushed up on this really it just made me feel like it's quidditch oh i don't have one back it up terry this has been a great drop because like i wouldn't have wanted to land here but we haven't had to move the entire game over there does two minutes left we're kind of screwed i know what we're doing no emp that's good news i think we need to try and change from different sides here or just wait for reverend i'm gonna follow them it's better to be as a team almost broke i have a nice head glitch here we're going to kill these people like they didn't push off the emp it was the worst emp usage ever that's huge just heavy he can see me how could that guy see me oh good job guys well played what played all i was trying to do there was just sit down so i could like draw their attention to me and then just crouch and let my teammates move up and the guy must have been able to see my head he must have landed like three g7 scout head shots on me there good grief pathfinder your head's too big man it's too big did you well played i've played four diamond games and we've been positive in every single one of them huge
