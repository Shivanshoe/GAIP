hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here in the lobby because as you can see here from the top right fight night is available you can see pathfinder he's ready for a big scrap he's got his boxing gloves on it's live for two weeks and it's the takeover as well uh we've got a limited time mode which is here airdrop s airdrop escalation isn't a limited time mode isn't it you just wait is that literally just the game is that is that just the game i don't realize that i thought it's gonna be limited time mode oh okay well i've learned something new and if you go here to the top left where you can see the new gibraltar airloo in all of its glory the war club it looks sensational to get your hands on this you either need to get yourself some airline shards if you've had some saved up you will be able to unlock it i believe but if you haven't you are going to have to purchase a a bunch of these in fact all of them so let's get into it i'm gonna buy the packs with the money that i've already put into my account and now i have 165 oh i've got the little pathfinder boxing glove we got a prize tracker what's the charge rifle one oh sensational the red prism i'm a big fan we've got an re-45 on here oh it looks like the octane one uh any of the skins that we've got a little goopy skin beautiful but that's not why we're here we are here for the apex packs from this fight night event of course from these fight night uh packs you are guaranteed one from all of the uh oh it's like a diamond encrusted one oh my iced out it's called little weapon charm uh the middle one is always going to be the one that's associated with the event that you're playing there are 24 packs and we need to open up all of them until we get our hands on the gibby heirloom part of the event i guess is this kicking it skydive trail emote for one of my favorite legends on the game uh crypto so i shall be putting that on at my earliest convenience can't wait to be flying through the air uh kicking it with with crypto this is our third pack a g7 escape skin oh my word it's my favorite gun on the game it's beautiful it's geometric as is season seven as a whole i'm putting it on looking straight down the barrel my friends look at that what a beautiful skin i believe that was our third pack got another legendary one here of course but it's not too much of a surprise given the fact that there are a bunch of legendaries oh my word bloodhound you are looking sleek my friend that is a sensational skin you're getting put on straight away as well i keep forgetting to look at the uh the other two things that i've unlocked which aren't associated with the event they're just like regular banner frames or or skins or poses uh so they're not too interesting unless they're getting there there we go hey you would have been nice before 30 seconds ago i would have thrown you one but you've been outclassed i'm afraid by a dangerous game here's the hemlock skin i'm going to throw it on it's part of the event you may as well we're getting to the the event spirits you know two legendaries in the same pack my look is just unrivalled this is a watson bottom skin she's looking extremely french that little beret on heart drop i assume that's a french word i'm not sure if i've pronounced that correctly but i assume it to play on words so you would say hot i would assume hot drop what's going on i'm not really sure i don't know any french at all which may come as a surprise as soon as i am an extremely fortunate man and a lot of german words a lot of spanish words but not too many french words i'm afraid another two legendary pack here on apex i love the theme of these skins i love them they're all bright and beautiful just like olympus there's a little mozambique skin so far i've had two extra legendaries i think of course we've got one in the middle here which is part of the events which is the triple take skin not too dissimilar to the one i already have on i believe unless i changed it curse of the awakening doesn't sound too much like an abstract idea but we're going to sell some massive skin and a ramp skin as well i'll have to start speeding through these i'm getting too excited i'm getting too anxious to see the gibby heirloom in my hands so i'm gonna go to the firing range and put some dummies yeah longbow skin it's a bit it's a bit green it's a bit green perhaps if you're trying to seek refuge in the shrubbery um you can throw that skin on for camouflage purposes but i mean if you're on any of the map within king's canyon you may be sticking out like a sore thumb there we've got ourselves a ramp skin her face looks a bit different there what's going on right but we had a corsic skin there as well it wasn't too good though apologies caused it you're not part of the event i'm not really that interested here we go under the skydive trail this one's for bloodhound oh he's got his crossed swords oh they sorry that's actually kind of cool and i play a decent amount of retain so there's a decent find spitfire skin it's animated bit of glowing magnetic volley thrown that on i can't remember how many skins uh how many packs we started with so i can't really do too much of a countdown here but i believe we're about halfway through i'm gonna start spinning through oh double pathfinder skin i'm pulling you on that's actually kind of a nice skin uh this time around i haven't spoiled any of the skin to myself i don't know what to expect the last time i did this that is tremendous straight away that's how i did this i looked at the skins beforehand so there are no surprises this time range i have no idea what's happening apart from the gibby allen of course oh my word that's kind of creepy oh god i'm throwing it on to strike fee into my enemies into my enemies that was a full stop there at the end of that sentence he didn't sound like him but he was i mean look at his look at his little mustache i can't i can see him look at his little mustache oh straight off no other options another legendary part of the event though bangalore got a skin bangalore and it's a good bangalore skin she got shown some love finally after all these years my original main apart from mauro i made mirage up until about 100 kills but then oh my word he hasn't got a face i love it i made mirage up until about 100 kills that doesn't came my actual first main was bangalore and i got like 2 000 kills which may not sound like a lot but it is to me because my most amount of kills on any legend he's about five and a half days and i'm pathfinder so 2000 it's kind of a lot it's kind of a big deal nice little weapon charm oh i found his face there it is i reckon if you use this weapon charm and and that reverend skin at the same time he just molds onto his face and gets he gets his face back oh double legendary legendary low skin legendary revenant skin side by side the old friends the old amigos look at these guys all right so glittery they so look all the sequins let me get this revenant skin again cool skin i would have thrown you on but i've just got to call it skin apologies revenant this time it only gets an epic that's our event skin well arthro one kind of nice though i've seen all my friends log into ifx legends one at a time first it was candy then it was chicken uh then it was jenks shanks is lagging behind i'm afraid that's that massive oh that's a havoc oh what's gonna say if that was a mastiff it's the bulkiest massive i've ever seen all right another legendary another day another legendary look at these baggy pants look at these baggy trousers sensational i think we're getting very close in fact this may be it's it my friends it's the gibby heirloom pack all right let's start left to name right i love that i wasn't expecting that that ending here is the gibby melee weapon skin at the war club unlocked we're thrown it on i had to buy this because obviously the event is about melee is like a it's like a boxing ring so if i if i turn up with the war club i'm hoping to do double damage and i'm i'm praying that it's pre uh pay to win here we go like a rock imagine that imagine if in the future we had like an archer as one of the uh one of the legends and this was like a tease oh i would love an like a like an art like a robin hood i want a robin hood character and he steals he steals from the rich so there's a kill leader and he can steal stuff from him and he gives it to his teammates and then he's got a bow and arrow as his ultimate but gibby obviously give his arm shield he's going to counter it because give his arms counts everything because he's just stupid so a little bit of a rant going on here but i'm sure you guys can agree with that all right how do i change legend again give me goodbye here he is here comes gibraltar with these war club how do i can i not inspect hello there we go well it's on fire as well as always with the new heirlooms they give you a bunch of different inspect animations this one looks like it's the same one oh here we go whoa i'm looking at my arm shields no wonder it tanks so much damage look at the size of that thing that's the same one that's the same one i'm going to give this a few more goes i'm not going to sit here and try and get like the special yeah we've already seen that one here you go my friends hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you for watching this is the gibraltar oh that's a beautiful animation oh i'm gonna oh my god i missed like that dummy i hit him with my shield as well anyway if you're new around here be sure to subscribe as i'm beating this this dummy up and i'll see you on the next video
