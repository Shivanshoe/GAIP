hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in this game i was playing it was my first game of the day we got some great damage but the the end of this game just proves that apex is golden rule and this is a golden rule actually for pretty much every first person shooter since the dawn of man uh keep the high ground stay on the high ground and you get a free whip that's all you need to do it's the golden rule just don't forget it so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends which mean no but you mean no where else we going i can try the bk i'm not too good with it though i can promise you that uh big strap at the big building as you would expect god the pride is good smoke out everyone chill everyone calm down timmy's got purple i like that another team nice job lifeline lifeline yes thank you thank you maybe shouldn't have pushed there but i heard there's another team and i just wanted these guys out of here as quick as possible you know recharging do i have time for phoenix teammate did you hear him i thought my team would have heard him oh my god i'm on the way i've had to craft some ammo and a slightly strange start here i'll crack one of them went for a different team some reason i guess they just looked over us anyway though care package we just gotta respawn our teammate i think both respawns have been used by the look of it yeah it's five o'clock somewhere am i right just inside the supply bin uh we can oh they've just used that one too maybe this way ultimate's ready that's beautiful actually level three got an evo shield here level three do i take the hemlock now that oh wait there is an hammer i thought it was a hemlock let's go this way i like this get that teammate back this is tremendous that actually worked out really well there was someone that close oh my god wait they weren't even that close they're miles away let me team over there too but we should be fine still 23 people left this is a fun first game of the day i mean i've been down twice but still who's gonna get there first yes one sec healing up oh my god did she not hear the pings do you not see the things let the ash go two of them i can't get to you please don't die he's got a p20 i'm scared danger close i can't defend us i can't defend myself i have no heavy bullets no one had any at least i don't think they did i looked very very briefly please have some heavy yes heavy yes oh my god oh so much so much heavy i have 250 nah this is beautiful yeah all the way around ignore the care package we could go for that one i want to go thermal station though let's reposition here i'm gonna go for that one you'll be the maniac it's a bit risque but let's check out this area oh she can party craft one crafting over here's next door 45 looking for gear i'll relay what i find on me no she crafted a mobile that's huge this place isn't looted too i should have taken someone else's gun i've got two close range guns here i mean that's pretty good there's bangalore you can definitely weave in and out of cover to get close range uh i could take that now i guess let's do it let's look at the pk 10 seconds rings just ahead this whole place is unlooted this is perfect drinks closing so it's only got like 40 seconds but it's not too bad is that someone else getting race board is that just a helmet here oh it's just level three side of the zone level three helmet thank you i need it there's still 17 people left well 14 if you don't count us that's actually really good this is a nice healthy lobby this is how world's edge used to feel thanks amigo you're welcome i don't like my teammates here they've both been really patient some shield cells light ammo she's using heavy and light we're all using heavy we got four heavy guns between us extended heavy mag here level two danger they do be crafting they're crafting in the zone which is kind of weird where'd he go don't think they made it inside the amount of times i press triangle and it doesn't go through he's crazy and i don't know why like i'm always pressing and it never goes through i have no clue why it happens like that i've pressed triangle there as soon as i maybe i don't know maybe it's a weird what the heck's going on maybe she's scanning the area i think with her ultimate it's actually pretty smart i like that i've got decent ammo i guess i should do a little bit more where's his valkyrie actually crawl after here we go spitfire fire here taking that good mid-range compression shield battery here i hear people firing in this way i think we're just gonna have a little cheeky peak here we've got great damage there's still this many people left uh we can go around i guess i'm not gonna go through that way let's check out this area good thing about taking that team out as well as that now our lifeline has some some decent moves oops i wasn't even trying to ball jump by the way two of the teams are because they're fighting there's still one rogue team somewhere oh this could be a three a three team scrap you know saw someone out there stay focused nobody panic oh ignore me i'm hungry don't know what i'm saying hello just decoys or what let's get this one behind me too i'm gonna try and help my teammate though not gonna heal nice job give my shields a recharge don't change too much don't have a challenge 160 on him see anything where did the race go i confused where the race went are they not gonna get hit by that let's get back i don't know where the wraith went we can't let them get them up for free we need to get up top because they're just gonna take the rope we need to get up here they're just going to take the rope and get high ground on us i can't believe they haven't done it yet how the heck do i get up there let's go to that rope i guess they're going to get that right though we need to hold this we need to hold this here we need to hold the high ground here guys maybe if lifeline can get to me lifeline lifeline please tap me lifeline we had these guys on the road sir we killed that like the this guy i downed him i've already basically killed this guy that was so annoying maybe i should have dropped when they had the high ground when they were roping over but it's it's game over if they hold that high ground anyway i should never have dropped i only dropped to revive the lifeline we should have stayed up there such an easy win that's so frustrating oh well you can't win them all you can't win them all gg
