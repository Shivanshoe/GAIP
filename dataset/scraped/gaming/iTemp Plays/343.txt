hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in yesterday's video i asked you guys what you would like to see in season 10 and i said it can be anything from weapons to legends to infrastructure anything and these are some of the comments that i've picked out to talk about today first of all we have jeremy he says both shatter caps because they are useless and i am in full agreement jeremy they are absolutely horrendous and i feel like the hip fire on the 30 30 is stronger when you don't have the shatter caps on but i still like the concept of turning the 30 30 into like a close range decent gun like the shad caps should turn into a mini shotgun i think that'd be really fun so i agree both the shatter caps next up we have jacob he says spitfire in the care package energy burst pistol or instead of heirloom quick and heirloom finisher would be nice so spit from the care package i think that'd be a good time much like the devotion that ended up in the care package for a few seasons and it helped alleviate a lot of the diva people running around spitfire would go the same way i would assume energy burst pistol sounds very haloy to me but there's absolutely no reason why we could not have that in fact it could be a very strong weapon and i love burst weapons as well you don't seem to use the hemlock too often but i do i promise i love burst weapons you know i keep apparently in burst mode all the time and an element finisher is actually something i saw a little bit of in the comments uh yesterday and i agree i think it's more i mean keep the the quip the quips are called too but a custom heirloom finisher for each legend will be insane i think it'd make more people want to get the heirlooms as well so thank you for the comments next up we have don john he says kill the health heals let them regen like other fps games shield heals only for the love of god now i think don john wants the healing system to be much like war zone where your health comes back pretty quickly but i'd still be interested to see what it would be like if every legend had the passive heel um much like octanes where it's like one health per second i just love playing octane just for the health regeneration not having to pop that syringe when you're about 15 health away from that you can just let that regenerate and you can carry on running and gunning i think i think it increases the pace of the game i think you can still keep the syringes and the health hails uh like the medkit of course but that's just my opinion i would i would be interested to see how it affects the game it's an interesting concept don john thank you for the comments next up we have batman i believe it's the real batman here oh sorry it's batman 282 381 he says the return of disrupter rounds would be awesome and annoying now i miss disrupter rounds because i missed that they made some underrated weapons or underused weapons really strong in the meta of that season i don't even remember what season they came out it's like three or four or something i think it was i think it was four might have been two i am i've got the worst memory of all time but i appreciate any changes to mix the metro up a little bit more people run around with the alternator more people running out of the re-45 maybe they could even have it attached to different weapons that are underused in the meta imagine the p2020 i know you had hammer points but imagine that would disrupt range that'd be incredible thank you for the comment batman taking off time of saving the world to whatever you're up to to come into my video i do appreciate it thank you next up we have benjamin he says character who can hold and use three weapons now i love this concept because it would allow me to run snipers more often than i do the one bad thing about running the sniper is that i often want my other weapon to be very specific i like it to be a flat line uh i like it to be evolved and maybe an r3l1 uh and any of those three i don't like running sniper shotgun or sniper r9 because mid-range i feel like i'm pretty useless especially if my sniper has a high zoom optic on there however a legend that has the ability to carry three weapons would allow me to run smg ar and a sniper in my back pocket and i would absolutely love that i love the concept benjamin thank you for the comments we have three more to go next up we have matt he says greatly decrease the gunshot volume over distance and i think people have been calling for this for quite some seasons now because it would just reduce the third parties on every map that we have and make the lobbies probably last a little bit longer i think it's a good idea matt at least one worth exploring for respawn entertainment next up we have overgame50 he says or they say uh i will ban wraith from getting a battle pass skin forever this guy just absolutely hates wraith i can appreciate that and then last up we have deranged watson buff now i'm on the same page as deranged here uh but i'm not sure the devs are great i think watson is both no fun to play and extremely useless i mean she's got some use but it's so specific you know it's so specific that it's hard to make use of her in a lot of gun fights so i agree a watson puff would be interesting to see in season 10 see if we can bring her back into the meta so those are all the comments that i've got for you today i thought this was a fun little thing to do a little season 10 wish list from the community if you will i try to mix up the uh the suggestions in there as well so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm never glided so slow yeah me too and you got some on your roof i do indeed obviously because i was going up a rope i couldn't get my gun out because i'd stimmed so yeah when i got up there yeah yeah not a good day i have an aria and i would like to drop it i have uh i'll throw one flat line that's like really weird one of the backgrounds he's practiced 48. i sound that honest like i don't know how long it was i found that there my grade for about three years even if it's like a half a second it does so much damage ipad that sounds like they're in construction it's just gonna launch it because you can use your grapples to get up there anyway almost broken i'm on the roof there's one on the roof plane isn't cracked that's a noise over here really crap team reloading see it seemed like earlier nice this one just under the bridge okay come on okay yep they're pushing they're on the train tracks if they're about either bad yeah watch out on a you know big phoenix you know charging up my shields powers scurry hey look at this yard sale i had going on at the start of the game was this you yeah oh you're just a hoarder what's that i don't know i saw it in the air for a second okay yeah yeah there's no circles on the radar i don't know where it went but i had a feeling i had that i had that feeling you know you know and you know just know your wall hacks you know the monitor on the mini map yeah yeah yeah i'm nowhere near you just cancel i'm dead broken it's got the same setup as me our flatline here what's his name pandora's warrior okay that's my setup i'm using it so but it's fine oh in front of me on the road yeah him a little bit oh he's so low i ain't for an extra 35 mate couldn't mean that lie so low is like 50 oh what's wrong with me wait this is just lazy oh he's on console i wonder makes perfect sense sometimes my right trigger gets stuck so i can't pad or alt or ping or anything didn't even need help it's got you all right now hasn't he uh probably same team no i don't know who that is let's find a path it's like i heard a few different footsteps there that's on uh from the building uh are you like inside no i'm on the well bottom like all these guys doing two teams yeah another team's just rocking up mate that's the should path to the beacon charging on my shields one that dude there we go they found each other took water off then he crafted it back no it's time if i drop you on this care pack would you reckon if there's a gun in it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's huge i mean you could take that just give me yours no no then i have to drop ammo and attachments it all comes off at once rich now then you have to pick it all though oh i got to get shot in the back so replicator is probably gonna send yeah i'll try and get up top but i have anvils thank you you good uh that team's still over there they're just chilling okay uh there's one inching up though they're all actually they're fighting the team over there should they sway again both over there on the back they're fighting over here too okay within a second i need right now here i go i'm not gonna bear someone just revenue taken nice someone under me i'm under here i'm gonna go for this guy under me [Music] oh yeah i can barely see him he might have this oh this is the wraith that i ran away all the other teams this way oh this guy's one he didn't even heal not bad on him where is he he's just he was like behind this like behind behind can't ping behind just back up if you can yeah i think these are the guys have been sniping me i saw a random guy like he was running this field i don't know but i think it's not for a long time yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it's a spring dude i think it might be a solo there we go where is that yeah not to die are you may hedge on me i haven't got selfies or anything i actually got hit there is no way trying to push him back i'm gonna pad away from where i was though get as far as you can i'll i should be i keep that i think you're rest i cheated i traded i'm gonna get you here i'll never know that i'm here i was trying to retreat i was out i've gotta be careful not to get knocked and i think you just headshot me the longbow yeah yeah they're both i think they both have snipers yeah thank you another pad okay yeah if you want to use it to get back over here it's uh i might tell you i'm going to take that rope i broke one oh man it's a roller coaster of emotions i'm having over here it is my apex for you you are there do the emails champions oh wait where is it which one is it hey oh oh oh hold on oh nice
