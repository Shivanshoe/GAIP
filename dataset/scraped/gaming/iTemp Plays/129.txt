hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i know i've recently did a crafting only challenge where i used the flatline and the longbow but i wanted to do a flatline focus video here because it was nerfed alongside it being put in the crafter as well and i wanted to try and use it as a primary weapon if you don't know it was nerfed by one damage and you really cannot tell the flatline truly is the ak-47 of apex you can one clip people with no mag so easily now the game that i've got for you today i didn't actually shoot anyone until 20 people left and i still got so much damage a load of clutches i even got one of the greatest nades you'll ever see so i'm sure you'll enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right here we go i've gone on a crafter which means i can get myself a flatline incredibly quickly get one of these my mozambique hopefully i can find some come on oh wait what was that what is that dualshell don't know why i'm taking this much time to do this because i'm gonna craft that's not what here level three we got the new kill leader the two cocky use that get the bamboos this is the only problem with crafting though isn't it really is that there's half the people left uh by the time you're actually finished crafting but i can't complain i've got a i've got a flat line with a level three mag a two-time back-to-back 1993 1994 bruiser you know objects here which makes me happy i know there's 20 people left and the zone hasn't started everyone's getting respawning inside the map target spotted here we go there's some action a people are fighting oh hello friends knows one of those i'm not trying to get too eager come on switch please come on switchy because this team hit us i don't know i am me i can i can just cell phones it's fine oh at least we killed that team i didn't realize how weak i was there and i'm back did everybody miss me of course i altered a little bit too late maybe i should have altered to get in the fight but then as soon as you start shooting then i don't know use it they look small if there's definitely going to be a team behind us and also i didn't know which team to go for there sending out my decoy give him my shoes hey i got someone's self-righteous dependable mirage who's just the greatest friend right get shot i'm out of heavy ammo sending out my decoy give him pretty sure i heard someone and i'm pretty sure there's a low brought over here somewhere contact running let's go here i don't have heavy so i need to find some hold on heavy ammo here huge thank you thanks there's a low broke here somewhere oh marvin didn't pick up that dj either this guy sort of jumps on us i'm not feeling this guy's gonna padding us from this way they can ask you whenever they want can hurt over here to recharge my shield bam there goes a boozer something like that broken enemy shield reloading down to the enemy i killed an enemy okay that must just have been the last one because no one's where'd you go or whatever nice i'm coming okay uh don't worry i'm coming to help check out that replicator coming in man i'm sad that us in the pathfinder got so split i was stuck between i got this trying to like turn around and help god not knowing if he was just going to slide down to us because if we run right away there when uh it was just me in the race that team just surprised us anyway so maybe i should have just committed with rate to try and get rid of that team as fast as possible it would have been the best thing to do i think i mean i have eight shorts no need to recharge my sure these guys have something for me come on hey shields yes good grief this has been fun though a lot of arm switching there we go all the bows i need to go back here that gold is going to be gold so many gold weapons this season they're everywhere i'm on the way i've got good stuff one sec oh good stuff i need the dj because if this guy had gold prowler there we go patching myself up phoenix kid here if you need one of those oh there was reds back there shotgun get them you evo shield here level five it's gonna phoenix this no thanks needed i do take bribes though using a phoenix kid one minute until closed now we're just leaving nice teammate i saw someone we don't want to be the team yeah they're here i really want to be the team that engages though might be something good there i don't get stuck in the opening there's no cover got one spotted make it that far was one like it behind maybe broken okay wait how do i know that i'm nothing oh they get you on the back i think dream within a dream stuff you got bamboozled are they no they're not they're not we need to sit up top or try and cut them off there i think gotta hop up here shatter caps i need to recharge my shields right here using the decoy escape how about this way they found each other or just in my decoys there's only two of us so attention delivering replicator over the top that's a waste of it no i might just we're not gonna hit anyone should have saved that bam to the woozle yeah sending out a decoy a bunch of gold stuff in the middle is it actually worse well nobody faced this monstrous mammoth it can't be worth trying to grab this the computer program who will challenge this turbo charger turbocharger you got bamboozled reloading enemies nice teammate i'm really with you i was going to try and disengage the last guy just kind of you know dropped only one squad left what did the right thing there just committed which one it is that is i go back back here level four there's a care package i want to go for here well this is just bait already in the next ring that's my victory come on give me a give me a vault give me a vault no the video is supposed to be at the flatline spitfire here i forgot i yeah know where this other last team is you'd think they'd want to get involved you think that they'd be on that side of the map apparently not i really want to vault seriously i haven't got to try one this entire season well i have a few times wait did i miss an attachment i didn't yes prowler smg here yes i got it i'm gonna stupidly stick with the um with the digi i'm gonna give it a go oh my god what am i looking at okay well they are holding us we are gonna have to sneak we're gonna go left and right like this because they think that's me down there what is this 2017 i am cleaning the face oh my god oh my god oh my god the nade of the century that was great [Music] that was that was that i will hear no nadeslander on the timeline anymore when you when you're hearing names like that okay imagine sitting up there all game just to get naded like that you know that's that you can't allow that to happen you can't ggs though i got to try the vault the flat line is 100 worth crafting still it's worth your time that was so fun ggs i'm sorry we couldn't save your path even if we came over that team that we were fighting would have furthered us it would have been a disaster either way ggs
