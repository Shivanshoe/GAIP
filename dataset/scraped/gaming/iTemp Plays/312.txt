hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back it's another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing the only legend in the game who is a detriment to their own team in this current meta and that is bangalore with the scan meta being stronger than ever at the moment with bloodhound and seer dominating ranked and to be honest every lobby in the entire game the last thing that you want to do is smoke yourself and then get scanned you are screwed if this happens and unfortunately this is bangalore's speciality it's sad though because she's such a fun legend to play i love her passive in gunfights although sometimes it just messes me up and i'm not used to it her smoke is just harmful to your own team though it's crazy let me know what you guys think about this and thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends such a shame i love the bangalore earlier solid what was he made ah good [Music] i wasn't you next to me okay that's all i do when i've got like a problem like that i've self sabotage and i've run in there and almost purposefully die it seems like the play because then you just avoid blame yeah there's no way you're shooting there's no way i'm leaving the game miserable let's see sit the back of the bow three times oh my god i need to oh i have a couple monitors i'm just going to like put them by my desk and if when i get really angry i'll punch it mate that's all you say which one is this not mine like an old one though i don't want to punch like my new nice they are
