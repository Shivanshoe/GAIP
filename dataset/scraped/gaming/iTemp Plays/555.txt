hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some duos with jenks back at it again in world's edge it was my favorite type of game it was the uh it was the sitting capital city and fend off the ninth party but in a good way because your loot was actually good type of game we've all been there also i know in the past few videos the frame rate has suffered a little bit i thought i fixed it for yesterday's video turns out i didn't but fortunately it is fixed now silky smooth thank goodness thank you for sticking with that i do appreciate it and i do appreciate you watching this video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends any guns any guns for anyone i went all the way bottom on the mid floor someone's up top picking up guns all right there we go they're both on me apparently just running you can please four i'm good i'm okay i'm coming down mate i'm coming down i tried to make the biggest play ever going just on the app okay well i'm the worst horizon oh baby i basically just bounced back to the same floor it's essentially what's just happened to me i hear i have a bunch of attachments if you can use them oh beautiful thank you that's about all i found in my adventures just so you know i'm running my massive r9 okay yeah are they enough to find some good attachments yeah i draw i had great attachments for everything but a mass department attention the champion has been eliminated so people take it on the big four story i ran in 100 that's why you're on the masters friend wait is i'll that you some celestia that's it hey wasn't his teammate does someone throw this way tracks might go across the way that was fine right now there's a guy on 432 looking at us i can take us up there but i want to go up there yeah let's kill him i'm down okay they had this place locked down boys maybe get some shields first neither of them had any shields yeah poor souls that's the only way we could have gone up there did you see the amount of things that yeah they had to walk down it was it was going to be a tough push but are they doing it like a make your own armor challenge or something well shotgun ball let's go oh they they're like um hawting they were pausing i thought of the word jenks got it wait did i get my kill on the bloodhound i can't remember if i killed him i thirsty oh thank you very much you're going you got my back you oh you see that lobo oh yeah i'm gonna put my armor in there i'm gonna risk it i'm gonna grab the shotgun bolt right now i'll do it that's actually a big i that's actually a really good idea when you don't have uh big heels just drop your armor in there and it heals for you oh yeah and then you get shot by the sky and you then you die don't die i have two cells i'm just pumping them i'm gonna drop you a couple cells are they pushing you i don't know i can't hear him oh yeah 100 gibraltar i want my shotgun back we've got a bad guy i have my ultimate dude give one you got a purple thought oh doesn't see me gonna run off you're gonna leave him nice shots let's go rich nah that guy i'll just throw

another team to our right there's two oh my god by myself watch me i'm so low why they didn't i just rolled that gibraltar okay recharging my shields in a little spot a little spot ready because they definitely healed then he cracked again i just dammed her one clipped the wraith oh my god give his cracks if they're trying to fall yeah yeah you know again good job my night shot is sickening right now demoralizing the enemy someone's close right oh there we go i'll do it again right i'll do it again i just rolled it home there you go there you go i'm gonna get it reported i just gotta report it

at me you need to crack that i the horizon's up top she's having a great time i'm just playing okay well she walked into my old seat nice she died he has a massive he's fried though i should have had the mask though i use the nine on them let's go back too nice i killed this guy earlier that was the um yeah yeah you know what's going on you know what's happening yeah i know that was someone that was a guy in the game can confirm uh i have eight to spare our nine shots but i have a flat line so i should be all right any throwables here we go oh see isn't that crazy i was talking about right there it's like i damn near one clip i'm with the nine right then i just got two tapped by a master the mastiff is the wilder in boxing you know you can play you can you can box real bad for nine rounds tenth round one punch knuckle doesn't matter unless you find tyson fury and he stands back up and he outboxes you dude have you ever watched like tyson fury highlights yeah he's amazing dude i remember watching this one conference like a pre-game where or a pre-fight pre-game yes free game where he's like he's like look at me i'm fat i'm fat no not athletic at all at some conference i think it was post fight actually not pre-fight i think it was post fight he's like you got knocked out by a fat guy oh god right here your voice i'm actually for 20. oh my lord he can't get to the portal i'm sucking him in here i secured i secured the the death nice all right rich last one's you he's there in his portal he's making we're not trying to use that he is red he's cracked off red he's going all the way around oh i'm taking the portal back he's gonna make it all the way around too here's red yeah he's got a long bow so if he keeps the distance and he lands the headshot on us with that struggling you know can't get complacent oh my lord exodus and ten batteries ten bats this guy where were you looting not because he shouldn't be dying with that luke just because nice dude all right i needed that one i needed to come back the nine shot was gross that game was wonderful i needed that sometimes you just need a win to bounce back you know you do a morale booster i didn't even realize you had more kills than i did uh i was killing but i thought that you were doing more than me i did think you were doing more than me
