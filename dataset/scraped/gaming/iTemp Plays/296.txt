hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more solo and these are the games on apex that i missed getting a good teammate who sticks around and having a bit of a struggle game where winning isn't always a guarantee and i thought these are the games that bring out the best player in me because i'm forced to come up clutch and it goes right down to the wire i want to have some good news i have officially resigned with g fuel and to celebrate i have a 30 discount code for you guys to use which is just item in all capitals now we all know that i love the tropical rain g-fuel tub but my new favorite g-fuel product is actually the hydration types you still get all the great vitamins and electrolytes in them but it's caffeine free so i can drink it at any time of the day so make sure you try these out just use code item but check out the 30 off there is a link in the description i'm sure you guys will enjoy today's game thank you for watching i do appreciate it massively i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends is that a massive trail teammate i've got one too but mine's different i don't know mine's actually pretty old man i need to get masters back so i can keep my masters trail i think it's two splits you get or two seasons maybe i don't know i mean this is literally the worst building of all time it's like gold armor with a vault next to it okay like imagine if someone landed here and just rushed me with gold armor and a vault tonight and mozam raging wouldn't be the word who's this guy okay well i was gonna say mozamed after every kill but right here i can't not pick up an either eight when i've got a mozambique you know but to be fair i'm terrible right i'll probably be better off with the mozam this poor guy this poor guy with his feet on fire nice i think this guy was running away from he came from raid labs so there you go sorry tima i am messing up tremendously here on the waiver careful teammate no they weren't even the same team we were just getting rocked up on all right well we probably killed our biggest competition in the lobby do you want this i'm gonna run double smg this game like my master's trail is nice and stuff but this guy was a season one pred well actually back then that was masters wasn't it season one fred because predator only turned into like top 500 in like i don't know i have no idea what season it was and now it's like top 750. but still it's a badge i wish i had let's be honest thanks i figured this map out on publix you land containment or wraith labs or this place down here i need one of these if you see it i swear there was purple armor down there i'm low but i'll just yeah let's go this way i'll pop my ultimate i'll get myself an extended um energy mag hopefully i mean there's an explosive oh here we go don't even need let's say there's it explosive hole here which always has the good extreme max i need some more reigns no no attachments i can take my favorite kind of loot the kind that's all mine now this low price was nowhere near as good as i was hoping i'll be honest with you guys i wanted to do it's worth it right yes all right as i said there are people fighting everywhere there's a fight on the hill there's a fight down here near op bridge that fight looks like he's kicking off way more i think you just stick around the middle of the map i think that's the i think that's the play in king's canyon because for a while i was struggling to find people i was struggling to find gunfights and uh yeah i people just love the middle of the map here we go little bit ahead of my teammate here gotta be careful you went full health another thing i slipped i slipped on the thumbstick so bad recharging my shields i thought he's going to take the pads oh my god oh my word there's another recharging shields come with me over here if you can make it to me i'm pretty sure this guy is spooney pretty sure he's the kill leader with that either right and there's another team rocking up that could be the octane team that ran off and healed though i couldn't i couldn't get your team out i'm going to come back though i'm hoping he stays this is the perfect opportunity this is why we need the lobo buff so you can get your teammates banner from your ultimate 318 that's tremendous i need to get over there quick before these fights are there and they start looting and they all armor switch they're both coming for me okay when you guys just in a big scrap stop chasing me stop it there's another team coming across the rope there minimum two teams here but i'm pretty sure it's three i'm gonna let him go what an absolute mess but that's the most that is the most perfect little love heart i've ever seen is that like a russian character or something what is that that's not the number three i'm pretty sure that's a russian like letter i'm jet i want down my keyboard that made the most beautiful little love heart i've ever seen i'm dead hello friends jump drive freshening up with a phoenix kit no okay fine i won't even use it doesn't make sense until i get out the zone anyway a mobile respawn one minute and it's far good thing i've broken these let's see what we have more points to get my teammate back here by the time i pushed that mobile respawn it was a valkyrie as well wasn't it so she would just fly over me get to her box hoover it up and then kill me i need to get my teammate back and this is the perfect opportunity because people hopefully will push this respawn and buy some time to get my teammate back and i've got my lobra ultimate which will be extremely useful there's look there's spooney again with this either eight pretty sure he's still kill leader because i'm when i not i might have more damage than him but i've definitely got fewer kills he's now he's just killed another team okay well activating jump drive get my teammate back then we're double uh door masses players didn't even reload my r9 that could have been disastrous being delivered where is this coming from a box you could just hoover the box up of that it might just be a death box around here and this is the edge of the yes am i pushing i don't see him is this the same team did they actually just wrap around or what oh might have to come back i don't have the crafting material i mean these guys are probably chasing anyway the mobile response in the crafter but i've only got 10 crafting materials i can take the wraith portal the wraith labs portal and then just wrap around get the banner there's still another squad left i might use my ability where am i this should draw the other team at all that firing hopefully these guys get into a scrap i can get my teammates banner maybe sneak a revive or something like a big respawn but if they're fighting i might just have to get involved because we'd be in the same situation if i if i don't fight and i've responded my teammate and it's a 2v2 but my teammates just come back uh is that someone then it is someone there i'm gonna clear their heads here i'll leave the team to chase me to the wraith labs okay but if they land on them 10 seconds until they're ringing i might just have to get involved hold on hold on i'm going to use the phoenix i meant to get more versatile than the phoenix kit you know 1v2 pretty sure both these guys escaped because my third party was a little bit too soon which sucks what's in this care pack please don't be actually craver could be good but i'm not sure i have the conflict it is a crater isn't it it could be a triple take that's a crater i wish it was a spitfire i might just have to i might have to come back for that depending on how these guys are playing i mean it could be one guy still but i think it's two now that's be fire that's what i wanted and at least two of them and they have 800 armor switches in there because we killed pretty much all of them did i leave a shield on the floor i mean it would be better if it was at this door in front of me but i don't fancy running down there and dropping armor and then running back up with no armor i'm sure that's all there to be already honest the ring now they'll have to come to me i took it exactly the same time they might land on my head here i need that crater i'm dead i'm dead if i'd land the craver shot that's an easy win i mean i say i literally saved these guys from the better team that that spoon and his team that would have killed these guys but i ran in there and one clip spoon and then killed the horizon somehow i saved him i saved him too quick and i missed the craving shot it's still a good game i still enjoyed that and the teammate stayed around for the entire time as well even after he's been overnight what a great guy
