hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we have been getting more and more teasers for what appears to be apex's new map coming in season 11. now there have been rumors of a new apex map having a tropical theme for a while now and we got to see a little bit of that theme in apex's newest arenas map called encore which you can see on the screen which has sandy beaches and palm trees dotted around though this map does take place at night time i think or mid-storm one of the two so it doesn't have the typical sunny weather you would expect from a tropical paradise this next image is the thumbnail for the launch trailer of escape which is the name of season 11 of apex legends again tropical sunny the nessie has that flower necklace on i forgot the name i think it's a it's a lay i think now this fits the thing that we were expecting perfectly and so does this next image which play apex tweeted it's a marvin on a beach with a flower on his head pure bliss says the postcard i don't know about you guys but i'm starting to see a theme emerging here here is a gift tweets from muy para apologies if i have mispronounced your name uh they are the lead animator at respawn again sunny skies on a tropical island now the last season i have for you here is actually in game on olympus at the moment in the bangalore pod this came back yesterday but it appears to be a small section of a map which i don't recognize as any of the three that we have already this is probably going to be part of the new map you would assume now all these teasers got me exceptionally excited for the trailer coming out here in a few days remember that season 11 is i think only two weeks away now i hope i'm writing saying that so we will get more and more info as these two weeks progress be sure to subscribe to my channel for more season 11 content as it comes out i have a great game here for you today as well dropping over 4 000 damage as pathfinder so thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's the team about 15 minutes before us i don't know how people fly so fast and also i'm going to be honest with you that building sucks so the wraith is landing there i can't really help i can't even pick up my heavy bullets we are pinched 43 damage from there that's unbelievable right here hello friends giving my shields a recharge okay i hit him for more than 11 which is nice hit about eight elevens in a row these guys are distracted might that's at the race wait what happened to our horizon did she even go down i'm not sure she did she just left i have one heavy bullet to my name okay i need some loot like drastically i'm more than happy i think there's a team over this way but if you want to go over let's mess him up i need to get close because i've got a mastiff anyway oh he's using shotgun i feel bad for spamming that name he needs he's using a shotgun all right i can pick it up i've got nothing to offer you in return i'm afraid thank you my bartending skills are just the worst i've got nothing i've got one heavy but i've got 21 but it's now give me a second teammate hold on once again broken is unlooted honestly this place is underrated this is why i'm broken every single game i'm on the way i've got a good amount of bullets the hemlock's actually been doing me pretty well here two teams taking fire there's no way you're getting up there that is so sad that is so so sad you have overestimated logan's tactical for the last time there's no way an experienced number player would ever think she could climb that mountain with her tactical we might be dead enemy taken down we demolish those teams he popped his alt and then hopped over the wall i don't understand that's that's a play i would make now my con controllers broken there we go uh still lacking in the ammo department and one of these guys had a wingman right there's no way he didn't have i mean they those two had heavy oh there we go three of my heavy guns optics from assault rifle here you go well red dot here close range i'll do it i'll do it sometimes the wingman is so nice to have if he's not going to take the the one time's up i may as well use it what is this skin no wonder you died oh my god zip yes so you're up there well i'm dead i have no idea where you came from nice let's go this way this one hurts that's huge i could use that the only problem here is that um this is basically my first game of the day and usually that means i'm not going to be good with the wingman we'll see of all time i've hit my head that wasn't my fault i have zero batteries all right i'm resetting oh i forgot i put a zipper i have 20 cells and zero batteries this is a sad sad day oh yeah i forgot about that one i think it needs more damage than this one but i cannot be bothered to um use shield cells it's so slow nice thank you i'm getting absolutely babysitted here is that word babysat she's trying to get banners 45 seconds she's screaming she's 100 screaming i'll see ya should have been wearing a motorcycle helmet that would have protected you and larry now this is the worst craft of all time fuse is broken before i walk straight through it's tactical 80 percent of my alt there's a team holding this that way but [Music] this way i've got a heat shield but i don't want to let these guys know actually where i am i think too i should be fine i assume he's got a few syringes and he's got his uh face someone right near the edge of the zone anyway i don't want these guys to see where we are it's a good job they actually let us come through they must have thought that we were going either way making those noises i have absolutely nothing recharging thank you seems like these guys got themselves into a bit of a scrap blue shield gamer no shield gamer look at that too fair the only reason i'm on red is because i got given it that's not i won 2.4 000 damage i deserve a red shield you know i'd have made my own surely if i had any bats earlier on in the game this guy hasn't even turn around what on earth am i in what's that lobrolt could be a could be a sheila shields what they called rampage shield yeah i think he must be shields there's the sheila it's on fire i can barely see this is a different team right the portal went either way oh my god they're back we might have to commit to this teammate is i'll come with you is this the fuse i headshot nice i see you sorry no that's a good team effort we needed to get them out of there quick otherwise we would have been pinched i mean i have so many shields but i'll never say no to show battery ever i'll carry 34 shield uh batteries before i say no to one and you guys know that's true as well shield battery here let's drop the shield back okay we should be pretty lazy like robin hood chill out okay we gotta we got a real gun over this way a sheila that we have to deal with oh my i mean we god have to push this kind of unless we want to walk all the way around do you want to walk all the way around i don't think so let's get rid of the shields and just stop running there this is so sketchy we could get flanked so easily  is not that good at this range i mean it's okay oh there's two of them it's pretty good at that range but you'd be you'd be surprised it's very easy to miss guys it's a demon recharging shield i mean how are we supposed to get in here there's a team laying behind them we don't want to get caught here teammate i'm going to try and cover you though and he's got a crater i've got nothing i hope he knows that means yes and not just why why why are you asking why do you want to know it means yes i just couldn't be bothered to type it okay we've got crepe guy we've got the shield samaritans inside and there's another team left there's one of the teams you are i think duo well i have 40 materials and we've got a very handy replicator that's dropped here i've never made fun of these late game replicators never you know sometimes they come in real handy and i would never make fun of them that would be uh that'd be rude i mean we literally can't walk in there there you go you know medkit as they say in spain i've heard them say many times those crazy spaniards behind the shield ready to fight you know it's a shame you can't craft frag grenades this would be perfect but i used them all charged with the shields last time they're on a scrap they're actually scrapping hello i have to get this guy out of here otherwise they're just going to come back and sure it says we fight one left he's done first team that sucks we just got split it's a blue gamer but he's a giveaway so he's a red gamer of spawn and there are three of them and i am dead and it's got to be fire hello give my 4k we just got split we just got split they weren't good ah we'd have killed them if he was both of us but we got split i was trying to like defend the guys at the back because they would have flanked us and it took me too long to kill them if i didn't miss the rate that she was like falling down the hill i think i could have been there i've got my 4k though i'm happy with that gg shout out our hydro
