hey what's up garage ridge welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and prior to this game i've landed on a p20 and a mozam so many times in the maybe hour that i've played and i've dropped on it again in this game however this one was different because i turned the corner and what was there on the ground looking up at me it was hammer points and i was so happy and it got me thinking like no one is sticking with a mozam or a p2020 into the late game unless they have hammer points but the problem is it is so inconsistent if you find that happen i really feel like they need to overhaul the crafting i think it shouldn't be focused and changed day to day i think it should be more generic but things would cost more let me explain my idea like if you walk up to the crafter and you've got a hammer and you press the hopper button it gives you a turbo charger but just make it cost like 50 or 60 crafting materials so you can't really craft many other things if you walk up with the p20 you get the hammer points back if you walk up with a triple take you get the kinetic feeder but you also get banned because what are you doing crafting a kinetic feeder it's completely useless and it should be the same with weapons you can choose to craft an extended mag for your light or your heavy gun but just make it more expensive so you can't craft that mag and also have 18 bats you know make it like a 60 cost because it just feels too bad on the days where you enjoy using the flat line but the purple heavy mag is in the crafter and there isn't a crafting near you and you can't find a heavy mac it's horrendous i feel like this will open up more avenues to play the game i it's just my opinion and listen i've had some opinions on apex before and then you know fast forward six or seven weeks apex have heard it and they've put in the game so listen you heard it here first so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos don't worry i'm on the way with the p20 mozam again it's the ultimate setup oh god hello i was moaning about a p20 mozam these guys walking around with you know left hand right hand trying to throw feasts oh my god yes yes yes i've got hammers sorry mozam i can't shoot the mozam most of the time i don't know what it is terrible accuracy with the mozambian lazy [Music] that's cheating man please don't take too much stuff i have nothing we could put that to good juice over this way a lot of bomb pots in the local area i tell you what i'm not having any of you this is a no bond pot zone don't die though i mean i'll press triangle about eight times why didn't it get my gun name why don't you get my hammers out i'm confused is there a chance out recharging my shield coming in that's a terrible idea oh all right where did we come from i can't remember i don't know we came from this way didn't we yeah the ship came from this way found by my hand i mean maybe nice job please my tony has one bat as well oh god i have zero backs sucks we've got a bad guy they're close oh my god see you guys he's got no bats as well gotta be some bats here come on my teammates would have taken me if they were batteries yes well p20 is putting some work little p20 that could and that's not the only thing you could do i love this little thing backstabbing blender you know that's that's kind of deep you can't just be saying that's that kind of stuff that's a little bit too far you know i'd know i'd like to apologize oh my god i'm so far away i am really far away but i am running i'm coming i'm just going to be about 30 seconds late why you sound setting important are you sounding like your man i'm from na uh i'm actually very offended that you said
