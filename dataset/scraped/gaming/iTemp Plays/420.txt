hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and we are using the season 9 mozambique now i'm not saying that the mozam is as good as the other three shotguns on offer in apex but i will say that finding one off drop isn't a death sentence anymore not only did they increase the magazine size from four to six but they also tighten the spread so your shots will do more damage as it's more likely to land all the pellets they did remove hammer points which is a shame honestly but i could only use the mozam occasionally beforehand because you had to find the hop-up to make it usable now you can drop find a mozam and actually just do some serious damage from the rip janks knight actually played an arena game last night as a duo and our random teammate turned out to be dizzy the man himself we decided to go mozambique only for the entire thing and we ended up winning i'd have loved to have showed you this game but i messed my recording up unfortunately but you'll probably see on janx's channel so thank you for watching i do appreciate it make sure you sub to my channel for more season 9 content and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends look at us go dude why are you heading uh i was gonna lie on bonsai and then fight here and then go to the new area yeah do it man i'm waiting my glitch i'm good got scared for a second man one thing that i noticed i i i thought that we got like a full kit like of whites of white stuff but it doesn't give you a bag yeah that's the it's like why not

god you got you i'm watching i didn't see it at all oh really oh i'm going up the road what there's another team that was firing at them like i've just left tonight over there north here you go look at 22 there's a few of them obviously where did he go oh there's two teams here dude let's go 70 on a different bloodhound 70 on a bangalore come back to you what's up i've been scanned so many times this game let's go off 25 not much but he doesn't end that bang with the ball cracker nice 70 flush 70 fluster huge this blood's trying to climb up on the right it's really weird nice i'll knock dancing you know i need to recharge my shoes temple finally yes yes dude jedi temple makes the boat it's so fun oh i'm climbing up making contact with enemy i hear somebody on the right okay he's inside on me if you need to you can fall back knocking out but got him hello i'm serious jedi temple man it's incredible it's so good any shotgun anyway i'm trying to use this mozart oh honestly didn't even look nah it's not like one shot oh we'll find some i'm sure lots of people are running a pk i found it all being here and on the floor i have a little one pack stuff this is absolute tragedy man i'm gonna be honest i think the bow is just the best weapon it is i love this thing yeah it's good hey don't don't knock the moes until you've tried it janks i yo i did use it earlier it's really good him on the left blood oh i thought i had my bowl what am i doing oh we have to push this guy we have to rush him i'm gonna get pride come back and come back and come back i did all i could you got this just watching that back the bm it was unbelievable i needed 1v2 to the mozambique come on man come on oh poor chicken myth you already got punches oh oh that sucks we've all been there we've all been there the champion made a poor choice oh oh are we slow yes all right if this doesn't smart enough then we just back off yeah we'll give it a little bit not long it feels like it wants to fix it yeah it's getting close look at the feed like people are just like what are they just full sending or something we'll give what another 20 seconds we're inside yeah smoke appear thanks one oh always been successfully scooped uh yeah estates as well mate as well okay are you getting some high ground for the bow i like it let's do a little drive by here real quick then we'll boost straight to oh yeah let's go this way yeah a shooter oh oh that poor guy do you still need a lame uh yes please i think the white one level four honestly not bad thank [Music] i need to recharge you shields just using a phoenix kit should i take that wait like down low i think i headshot lifeline oh really she's most unbeatable she's on the right side different team running away from us sorry i could hear someone else i'm coming i'm gonna open it for you oh so i hear a drone she's one though cracked i'm trying to use chatters dude the other team might become behind us i think so i assume i wasn't sure because the angle yeah i didn't see him i just saw the nade i have no idea where where'd they go i mean they were running away from us to begin with so who would do that much damage to us and then just not dude he takes me on like 90 flesh did you see how much help i had left you're really low i ran away pretty pretty far to medkit is this there bro mate they honestly may have fallen off i'm not kidding they did they did there was two guys that fell off the map no way they fell off after doing that oh my god 100 they both fell off the map because there was two dudes that did fall off the map a hundred percent it was chicken it was chicken myth dude who's the champion no he came back he came back the guy that got punched he's had an absolute nightmare oh no that poor guy i mean we've all fallen off this map let's not like you know this is uh this is an easy one to fall off absolute death trap i mean that rope i want to see if i can make it it's that smart one though you know rich i don't think it is i i'm pretty sure i fell off the exact same way that those guys did i'm pretty sure i've done that like exact thing so i don't think you can do that it's because you try to climb the back so here we go i'm really far away one's going to rest go off then killed you the team like there's a bangalore they did it they didn't there should be oh there's a extra box here there's a bangalore that was just the bangalore ran off i feel like they made it top or something i don't know might be looking for teammates banners or something i don't know dude but i'll tell you this i've got two kills and 500 damage and i'm over it oh yeah i'll scratch them on it's incredibly boring i can't believe i hit those shots dude the ball has no drop-off no no it has none i have i have no throwables there's a team in here recharging my shield do you have any throwables i got an eric can you walk this door there right they arctic i'm not in it he's trying to i'm speak shots they're trying really hard i need to recharge my shields 70 uh rate 70 blood cracked him reloading rice how do i not shoot an arrow um try punching try switching gun arrows here like no matter what you have to shoot your arrow i mean you can punch but i don't want to punch the air yeah that's just you might as well shoot or just shoot the ground and collect your arrow back because if you on ads and you're still holding the ball back like you just it just shoots it right yeah i mean you can switch your gun but like something if you did yeah you're gone it's always optimal it's the same with like calling a bangalore smoke it's really annoying it is yeah there's nothing you can do you just have to shoot it come on triple take oh crowler smg here now no uh heavy heavy in my arrows i'm gonna blow them up with my grenade come on all right i'm going oh the heck would you do give me a second okay okay ready for 70. punching a tunnel breathe for 140 oh nice path guys guys guys guys yeah we're both so weak dude oh fellas what was that all about i'm doing an email ah it's bracelet oh you are the apex champions nice so they get for just sitting up top and just waiting for us to find him yeah that game could have been ended much earlier
