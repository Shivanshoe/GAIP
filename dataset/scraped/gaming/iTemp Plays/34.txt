hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing solo yet again and the reason i've been playing solo for the last week or so is because i haven't felt the best and it kind of hurts to talk sometimes and when you're playing with other people between games you're having a conversation having a good time you end up talking for like two and a half hours straight when i'm playing solo i can stop talking when there's quiet parts i can stop talking between the games so i've been playing a lot of solo over the last week straight and it is an absolute roller coaster my findings are that my first game of the day tends to be really good i don't know why and then i struggle for about an hour and then i have one or two games in that second hour they're pretty good and i don't know if it's apex manufacturing this experience for me i feel a bit played i feel like it gives me the first game on it gives me a good lobby because it's like all right this guy's fresh let's not put him off straight away and then when they realize that i've been playing for like 30 minutes but like this guy's hooked he's playing for a few hours let's give him some tough lobbies and then once i've struggled for a little bit they're like okay let's let's throw my bone here and then i get another win two hours later i'll tell you what though i've had an absolute blast playing apex this season it's honestly been a really good time if you're a solo player like me sometimes let me know how your experience has been in season 13 i feel like it's more formulaic at the moment thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos me migos we'll see how this goes it's not looking too bad give me the alternator nice big damage teammate i'll let you first him get some stuff never mind he wants to play like psycho i find him helping me out massively here i thought he's cracking everyone just finishing the kills with the alternators that goes full health 250 health oh i suck at this gun i'm genuinely so bad with the car it's laughable this is two teams i'm gonna need to get out of the doorway come on there's a night on the floor oh my god it's happening again let's keep this going guys you guys keep cracking everyone and i'll uh i'll get the last like three bullets in that's it's working for us so far you know i've got four kills i would much rather fight people near streaming building compared to construction construction sucks i hate it it's horrendous oh and the ox i hate him this gibby is stunned he's got a big bubble so he's completely safe i'll recrack him who's down to push i am taking fire friends everyone chill i'll come around the side the squad hello where's his octane oh my god okay that's how i need to use the car i always need to tell myself this is a shotgun the car is a shotgun if you can keep people like right next to you the car is honestly so good but i try and use it like an r99 i don't know about you guys but i think the r99 is way easier to control than the car the cars has got too much side to side motion i can sort of get away with using the r9 in sort of like a medium distance i'm on the way we'll come back don't die this is why horizon is so good on one's edge i mean i ignored but i wanted to get the last shot on the octane as he jumped over the top i will go back don't worry left does that mean like rank two is that like pred rank two or what does what does the two rank mean is this guy a demon or no there's only one way to find out you are currently solo unleashing my singularity it's such an impossible jump the ledge it overhangs too much so me and i've got an alternator in the pk fight hello trying to stick me huh no sticking aloud all right well rank two ttv's gone are we the new rank two is that how it works did we over did we leapfrog leapfrogging you're probably loot what you got any bats i've got two shall we head this way two minutes until the zone's closed um careful teammate this is bad angle to get caught over that oh i hear 1100 those arcs were ambitious i'll give you that we don't want this angled teammate around the side we don't want to get caught in the zone too much so even if it's none of the team they've got a different angle on us that's not good for the team beautiful we should head here let's finish this team she can run real fast we're gonna get we're getting pinched so bad here that bang was behind i think we just have to rush this let's commit to a teammate i'd like to tell this guy twice look at him go get him out of here please die reload three times guys are all brand new there's no way these guys are in this lobby yeah there you go triple masters badge i was about to say i feel like i was about to win this this gunfight against those two how much damage do i have two and a half in eight minutes oh that sucks actually sounds like a relatively big scrap of that wait i know i'm ready to join it let me tell you i was disappointed i didn't get to loot inside but i didn't want to contest the loot of my teammates so i took the supply beans but i'll tell you what have a cough drop with a little purple armor and bind them here we go ability legends i don't have that second shot least did we just sit up top i think we just stepped off someone is gonna come with the rope yeah well there's someone in here i don't know where they are low bracelet down too gracias amigo you've saved me please let me in energy that's i'll take it reloading reloading think you're okay though no no yeah you just someone just robbed it all there was like 17 there got to be some in the low broad though has to be i don't know like 50. give me 50. 20. ah good dashes good recharging i mean what is good is that they are big scrapping still this place is popping off i thought everyone would land a scrapple city but this is the newest capital city this is the worst positioning in the world i guess i could use the wingman but i've only got 20 shots i was going to try and poke with the wingman and then he grappled on me i could have just used the havoc and saved my heavy yeah yeah here we go oops getting too fancy with it that's two teams careful i'll try and keep this team at bay westfield nice teammate down one in this post team as well i feel like if i don't do that these guys are gonna rush us can we get these guys out of here quick the answer is probably no because he's playing courses but we gotta try i mean we could run off but we are committed sorry i was real because of the call thickness reload [Music] i mean i guess we were the third party i think these guys were fighting when we got here i have a car not bad six kills still 20 people left that's not bad at all this honestly was a breath of fresh air fighting here at skyhook as well my aims just went weed then i think because there was so many decoys in the way good grief is this bullying there's no way you're actually 65 iq reloading spot for might heat shield good job squad i mean horrendous accuracy for me but this is my first game of the day you got to cut me some slack i don't use it now i'll never use it that's one thing i'm really bad at when i play horizon i i very rarely use the ultimate reloading there is no way that didn't that didn't connect with making noise scare me for a second we all saw holding these guys though kind of feels like useless damage i've only got two bats and these guys probably have more than i do oh my god get up there team i'm gonna get beam coming here but my teammates are already shieldless should listen seattle coffee go stop their advance gotta peek over they big heels so bad gonna cut us off okay i'm not typing ever again it looks stops my controller from working fortunately these guys start fighting each other i love the damage you can do with this thing that looks so good now hold them hold these nerds last team easy easy beams first game of the day doesn't matter when you've gotta have it i think it's pure damage nice i'm happy they ran off they gave me a bunch of damage and kills at the end there tremendous thanks guys you are the apex champion my teammates are actually really good some clutch in there too oh this is such a good horizon skin what's the damage like i don't even really look two and a half thousand not bad not bad first game of the day drop 11 kills 2500 damage win i mean i will take that that was a gg that's a very gg
