hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are looking at the new season apex legends saviors which is season 13 now in this trailer we get to see the new legend in action he is called newcastle but his real name is jackson he's the older brother of bangalore and we've been getting teasers about him in game for a few seasons now she thought that jackson was dead but it would appear as though he's very much alive in this trailer now usually i don't mention leaks at all because i don't like giving them coverage on the channel but so much was leaked a few weeks ago it is hard not to the leak showcased his abilities and they were confirmed in his trailer so newcastle's passive allows him to drag down teammates his ability is a deployable shield which he can control and redirect and his ultimate sees newcastle jump in the air to a target location deploying a large shield when he lands so he's a support character who's good at reviving i wouldn't call him a medic in the same way that lifeline is because he lacks any healing abilities it would be like calling gibby a medic because he has a fast revive in his kit he's more of an all-round support character in my opinion it'll be interesting to see how far you can jump with his ultimate as well because this could be used to reposition in a gunfight to gain advantage to use a defensive ability aggressively another thing to mention about this trailer which you may have missed it was a slight minute detail but the gang seemed to be fighting a huge scorpion of some kind now i don't know if you guys saw or not it was kind of it was it was a small little guy now first when i was watching this i i thought maybe they just put him there to showcase the new abilities of newcastle but then i went on to ea's website and it would appear as though that we are going to see this beast on storm points it's called the damned beast and the description reads what treasures lie on the shores of storm points stay sharp and stick together even dead beasts hold danger i expect this to be the same sort of concept of blue times trials on board's edge where you have to pve to gain better loot though this guy looks a little bit more of a challenge than a few prowlers i'm kind of scared ea's website also mentions ranked reloaded rise and fall through the ranks together in a reworked rank system that rewards teamwork and skill now these hints have been able to drop through the rank so you can't just sit at 7200 ranked points in diamond or 10 000 to rank points in masters and not have any punishments and many rework perhaps now just returning back to newcastle imagine his ultimate with rampant shields behind it protected by newcastle shield so you can't destroy them easily at all the ultimate fortification squad just add a gibby on top of him and there's just shields for days you can't kill them mind you you could you could probably just emp them i think crypto is going to be good when i first saw this trailer i noticed how big newcastle's character model looked he's a big guy and thought perhaps we will see another fortified legend like gibby and corsic allowing him 15 reduced incoming damage and not to be slowed by incoming fire but i remember the apex team have previously stated their regret at making the characters and apex all different sizes which affects the meta in different ways because of this i doubt he will be much bigger than the standard character model so they don't have to implement fortified or low profile like they have done before if you guys saw any extra details that i might have missed in the trailer be sure to comment then i'm actually really excited for this new season i don't think it's going to be too long until this comes out and we're going to be seeing more and more trailers in the coming days next one is on the 28th so make sure you're subscribed to this channel to not miss any of the coverage i have a great game here for you today i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that is very interesting this guy's run off for me [Music] i can't get through there it down here bring it down here geez we're filling up the hospital today all right we just keep making our way back towards where the ship came from one good fight at a time there's a respawn sounds like cascade falls that's the dream yes it is unleashing my singularity so i'm missing that first one with a second by screw me slimy slop what's up guys it's your boy sloth they left him wow what are you taking what are you taking here first damage that's what i took oh i thought he took something oh he did but mainly there's damage yeah his boy ran off he had uh he had white armor oh that's not fun pretty i'm not with you it's an octane it's probably him it is i reckon it is ah darn it he's too fast are we going to spend this whole game chasing this one no no i'm leaving him i just wanted to go cascade so i thought maybe someone'd be here i don't know i'm not chasing his octane anymore i don't know connor looks like you're chasing him i'm just looking that way kinda looks [Music] you jumped good job spray she tried blocking the door with the port and she messed up and then i stood in front of the door and she tried getting into the poor and she was like bodyblocking from walking through the door ah it's one of the you had to be there type things yeah well it sounds funny sounds like she's being an idiot i got a hooligan over here yeah i don't think he'd touch one's up top yeah she was weak recharging the shields yeah yeah they are over here somewhere i think they're fighting okay good job from you this lobby staying alive honestly good work quite a while we're talking about at the start of the game it was looking hopeless but there's still 15 people left yeah that was a great job for me your boy that's what i said recharging myself i said it i said good work people to shoot to pick you up or too far an egg i mean if i die way higher chances of us just not even winning the game so it goes from online shots this way fantastic i wish i had my cue to get up top be quicker yeah if only there's somebody shield away to the top i want to punch i have to pull triangle to get rid of my gun then i have to then i have to punch also i don't have a climb burn i can't climb oh my god you're just you're you're you're ruining everything you're you're ruining it i think there's anybody over here there's somebody over there i'll turn around and wing mandom straight away so they are shook they have red but they went this way fancy a stroll this way shields recharging there appear somewhere like irish that's good interesting right replicated geez valkyrie big 22 damage i am finished as this guy starts screaming at i mean i don't think she cares she's gone yep give it a piece of still one of those team oh yeah i thought his teammate was level four so he blessed him yeah yeah they just stood still unfortunately there was an octane here somewhere i heard his little face you are that's right yeah things thank you ah yeah
