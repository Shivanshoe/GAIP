hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the two guns on apex that require items to charge them up to make them stronger it's the sentinel and of course the rampage it's actually kind of difficult to keep them both charged up and ready for a gunfight but if you do run into a team and both weapons are prepared and ready to go that team is going to get absolutely melted it's actually a pretty deadly combination here so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah anyway game time and games and gaming and games i'm gaming out here and non-controversial subjects no i've just seen three mozambs no no no i picked up a bow and a p20 zero cappage i'm dead it's good all he wants in life is to kill me i have a two tons mows i'm gonna bring another opening fire i am taking fire i brought it the worst oh i've ever hit nailed that whole squad you've got fighting down to our silence i am repairing myself oh man i'm actually taking a rampage jackson i've been scanned yeah oh this way over here no i could have used that thermite grenade firing these bad boys they're just all running everywhere everywhere hello and he's gone come on why do they call you michael ridge no reloading go go go go ah oh my god they're everywhere idiot i'll shoot that door oh my god he's got enough sorry rich he only wants to shoot me standing by the window okay i'm just taking all this so he's in a lazy day he's looking am i trying to help just heal just have to sail recharging shields risking it all jackson he's outrageous oh yeah it's it's got its moments i like it please look for the timelines i have zero actually there's a team up top okay dude there's no way oh my god you okay you okay thank you okay well i didn't expect him to do that so i wasn't ready they they might try and oh god no i'm getting sniped [Applause] this might be the worst in my life i know i'm one on the sorry i thought this was you you with me so i committed to like punching out this this team thinking i was there yeah i would understand what was yeah you know me yeah i do mate you're a crazy guy wow i mean i don't have any bats though wait i didn't mean to do that and then i didn't mean to do that either way there are actually people here oh no don't use no yeah okay all right crack the fuse big name big name watch this never seen this nervousness in your life that might be the same team where's that friend go oh my god he's revved up from our name properly oh this maybe this is a different tune oh this guy these guys are all just scattered everywhere they all have ankles nice wait is this two oh it's two four what this is there's two teams behind you budget left that's a full team okay they are all dude this is they're actually all we're all just gonna focus right now yes i know i should have looted that been i got two on me one come on come on thank you i dropped all my lights by accident this one out here uh i'm good do i have a med kit yes there was blue in the south eastern what do you think is over here don't know where i'm steaming too but i am i feel that i keep messing the marvin's up racing i don't know why oh i like the like picking the colors apparently there are people here i don't know how it always happens but i'm nowhere taking oh i feel so bad but i'm actually worried now i'm the worst oh that's teammate oh nice kanye hello she's literally dancing in front of me teabagging i thought she was a friend and i didn't have got my second gun reloaded been scammed like that come on come giving on shields a recharge i need an extended sniper all right charging my stance enough again rat i'm going crazy seems below wow looks like that was the last one in the squad how's that mace it's a weird gun rampage i have a rampage golf rampage and a sentinel uh okay is that the combo who's that the combo i mean i would say no but i dropped a tony with the rampage like two days ago so i didn't say that that was pretty good that mine here huge all right so this is the this is the weapon combo you just have to charge it up oh my god right on the edge he drops recharging shields there's rock offline kit yeah i'm using double heavy right now i need it i'm gonna go this is just the weirdest conversation it was ever used did she sell frozen already down this there we go mate she switched to my broken purple so i killed it and now and no sorry my broken red so then i head shy and i've got it back fully charged that is what you call tactics right there i like it i'm a genius and i've got a lot of heavy oh vermi where was that oh the box down there that you were leaving no it wasn't no someone put that there literally literally the box that you were in well there's three here so if you see gold please let me know because gold would be outrageously so uh gold armor yeah because it takes one cell to charge the sentinel and then i don't have to carry bats i'd have to people show up in the middle like they will just show up there i think i just got here blessing because he's confused oh they're on the rope we took oh god no okay so far that is very unlucky did you just land on the rope and they're all here yeah oh it's so unlucky i got two in one shot probably my rev rev up thing right now just stop shooting them too i'd have at least down one it goes really fast when you spray it too it's just it feels like it's gone instantly yeah cause i had it there for a while too yeah yeah over here oh yeah i think the other teams here i don't know maybe it was the effects of your olds oh they're all um i literally have a spitfire and an all-star i never if i choose to i never have to reload everything forever on blue blue gamers blue gamers huge big another blue one big 1919 actually it might have been like the revved up rampage is so stupidly powerful you i know it is really broken wait hey oh oh toxic toxic man i like doing that like over people's boxes when i come it's great yeah that was good huh [Music] man
