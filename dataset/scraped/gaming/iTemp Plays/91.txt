hebso guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing horizon who he's one of the best legends on the game who sort of flies underneath the radar i don't know i feel like all the tryhards play path and rape and they're only a select few that play horizon also in the two games that i've got here for you today i made the mistake in the first one of dropping the alternator and then the second one you will see why that was a mistake because i just i just could not stop one flipping people with this gun i've enjoyed both these games thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you kill leader watch out dears bad nearby divorcing eye give me the blue so i hope you guys are okay for a second i just gotta heal don't go down i'll gotcha i try to send this my teammate backwards i'll go back and i'll ping the uh they're not getting back up again actually never mind you i guess you can just arms right come on hold on i need to use a phoenix kid here he's gotta finish his own anyway i hear them fighting like the wall which is really weird not something i would expect my ultimate is ready to deploy ultimate's ready i'm recording teammates got white still that doesn't seem right surely it was a blue back there no am i being an idiot i think so because she would have taken it one squad nearby where where this is looted i could hear people this way i'm not sure if it was oh there we go my spot teammate oh my god that's i assume this one's actually weak and my teammate's there i should have just took it nice team yes tremendous i didn't want to take the um i'm going to take an r9 but i didn't have a line meg having an r9 with no light mag is no comparison to an alternator look no light meg oh no i just i thought i took that that's terrible that's a tragedy oh someone got respawned as well we're back up to 18 people i feel like that oh okay that's so annoying that is so annoying i don't see anyone else land on this guy another soft landing which one which one which one i'm a proper horizon man look at me with the nades and everything just unbelievable i'm actually using horizon properly that's huge which way are you going they've been removed let me get my first damage their first fight something i never do when i play horizon is actually use her ultimate properly like i never remember to carry nades and when i alt i should probably throw it you know oh a vault now i can get rid of the light go hop up here turn extended light mag here level three whoa what's his skin oh god the wings are so i like the skin but they're so obtrusive oh okay those creepy crawly hands are way better is valk afk shall we hear this weekend reckon we should head here come this way rather close they come here for the uh cat package maybe i don't know if there's another one that came down just now beneath us okay the three times he's kind of okay you've got crazy high ground these guys that's the sky needs careful let's be careful no one comes behind us as well all right now to get inside i can probably just queue over this though oh we're fine here how's the crypto down low let these guys fight oh that was teammate number one oh my god that need he did no damage to me though all we needed to do there was stay up top and like okay crypto was team leader with 200 damage and i think 100 damage of that was in the emp i i just okay oh my bloodhound has the uh the little prestige skin on and the tsm contact which i can't imagine was easy to get i'm under this door oh my god i'm sliding i'm sliding everywhere havoc alternator i'll take it that is a beautiful start i found a hop up here oh god ugly ugly ugly flies everywhere well they're scrapping up this way i reckon we should head here enemy right here yeah yeah okay you confuse me team smell over there you kill leader you data there are two teams inside as well two teams inside as well remember attention somewhere reload straight down recharging my shields i did see the shotgun bolt here i've only got a few cells i need thermites i don't have any afraid it's a big scan teammate loot recharging my shields not all of it was mine let's be honest i heard that i saw a ping ultimate is ready it's all behind him some good teamwork in there oh nine i'm gonna keep the alternator it's almost like my little pocket assault rifle at the moment with my massive secondary this place is pretty cleared up because it was the hot drop and we got here late so we should probably move we should probably get going oh teammate looked at me and then decided to go the other way i decided to go this way because you at least change from like the high ground but we're in a separate location now i'm still going to risk it i've run too far am i coming behind a different team i hope not [Music] field answers yes i am i got them uh this could be any random guy up yes good nice work squadron taking a moment okay i have no idea where anyone else is we just came with different angles kind of cleared this team up or two teams up people were in here but i doubt they are anymore no they're in here oh we've got a bad guy they're close to chill then come to the open okay i've still got all see i need to remember to use it properly it's just so consistent in a dps standpoint like it's outclassed by the car and the r9 but then they need to reload after they've missed all their shots i don't play horizon for the ultra okay i play horizon for the incredible air maneuverability and the uh and the horizon kick rings near and closing ultimately it's just a bonus free time was that night i heard an aid i think to the left somewhere like here-ish or maybe maybe i think it was that replicated dropping turbine is unlooted amazing oh my god i don't even reload either no the first one's good oh the first one was really good oh nice that must be a separate team one of these guys made it ace up shields recharging killed an enemy level squadron trying to put shots in for my team trying to get a different angle maybe if i hold this angle unless they all pad on me and i'm screwed okay well i'm screwed how on earth did you do that my teammates possible i mean i've got no light rains but it shouldn't matter there's two people left well that's one of the best you've ever seen one of the best there is that is actually unbelievable from the squadron there guns busted oh where's the last one was that not the last team what happened did that solo get away with the banners i thought that was the last squad oh god i need light rains oh forget it i'm going in it might just be this one guy i don't know i also left my bread behind i mean what can you do literally nothing i could have done is this what is this one man this one man on his charge rifle how did he escape hello friend yeah i'm dodging i'm dodging you can't eat me see do you claim the alternator i'm telling you way too clean with the alternator gg amigos gg that was a great game i confident i'll tell you what the most important kill of that entire game was mad maggie at the top of my horizon queue like three shine someone with the big man i do not know how she pulled that off but it was huge absolutely ginormous got nearly 3000 damage hey that was a fun game ggs all around
