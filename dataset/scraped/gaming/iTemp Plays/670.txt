hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as i am sure you are aware in season six there was a slight overhaul of the shielding system in apex legends now every bit of armor got knocked down by 25 points including the legendary gold armor and before these changes i still thought that the red evo shield was the best shield in the game it gave you 25 more shield than gold did and sure batteries were not difficult to find whatsoever it was a bit of a no-brainer and with the recent changes even though all the armor variants as a whole got nerfed i think the gold armor got nerfed even harder than any of the others because with only three bars of shield your your second shield cell is still only providing 25 extra shields you're only benefiting from the first shield cell it's kind of sad to say but it's almost useless the only time i think it's worth picking up is early to mid game when you haven't had a chance to level up your own evo and you just switch out for the red evo as soon as you kill someone that has that and i'm talking about this change because our random teammate in today's game wanted to go to bloodhound's trials and the best item from these trials has always been the legendary armor and i lame heavy i really wasn't too fussed i wonder if there are some things they could do to this legendary shield to make it worthwhile picking up again i reckon we'll see some changes sometime soon perhaps but anyway thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed today's ranked game and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends by yourself bless her gold bag purple armor that's the loot bins that i like to see oh my word i don't even know if i want to spend my time here shooting prowess honestly i really don't the loot's not worth it it's really not like a gold helmet it's nice on the path but i'd rather just go shoot people yeah uh it's not worth it because with evos now the the main reason was to get armor right like even helmets helmets are let me know if you need to come over uh i'm good [Music] just being a nuisance is all right they're fighting again still over here they finished their fight i went to third it and then uh another team pulled up wasn't expected they're party central over here she got the gold shield but i'm fine with that i've got the goldberg gold knocked out i think she had one too yeah she has gold shield gone knocked down i've got bad gold knocked down and you haven't got bad what yeah i forgot about that we're looted yeah i'm looking for a vault if you find one or a mastiff either one i have both there's a massive in this building i'm nice thank you i want to get involved one of these will have a vault i'm going to help a scan for you me and the writer nice might be dead 119 pounds another 100 on a lifeline nice shot [Music] i have no syringe did any of these have syringes i dropped your syringes out back by those two bodies oh oh they're here one spam pretty much my name i got hit by a uh thermite bro i'm dead somehow i don't know they were that close i thought they were further than these yeah i thought so too you can tell i'm selfie two dead the last one's a wraith right here okay i mean right stopping last one's a race right here i am still alive she's on me look i've peeked over looking dead too far down he's climbing nice job let's go we'll play dude our teammate quit you shouldn't quit why why would you do that i was suffering too uh i am just gonna heal before anything else i saw you cranking the selfrest i knew you had a gold bag so i just full committed into that fight yeah i'm so lucky yeah and the wraith was the one that got down first i have no healables surely i'm missing stuff here here we go i'm just taking the right stuff as soon as you quit on us what this is the rice bag taking his stuff they said honest i was like where oh sorry yeah you heard those two words next to each other it's like instant uh i have extra bats uh i have 2 and 14 cells take another one thank you all right just the two of us again rich we can make it if we try yes sir see but like watching watching how that race played right like that race that's not a silver oh it's not a come on that race was a good player yeah he knew what he was doing it's so weird playing on pc like that though because like there's not like the player base is so much smaller on pc so not that many people are left that are really not that good and if they are we're not in their zombies evening bronze yeah oh the gold bag gold knocked down we wouldn't have won if it wasn't for trials it was yeah no you know what oh you know what i should go back and go grab that other i picked it up i that would actually be really sick we should probably try to pull that off someone come and shoot me please unless you jumped off or something i'm literally one janks yeah i'm gonna hold it off for you that's got top oh nice job jenks we can kill this guy he's got blue armor nearly cracked wanna me too he jumped that's not him he's not back here dear lord he's literally one shot i exploded him i've been bamboozled twice in a row scanning the area oh i can still catch up to him get him out of here he should have jumped down with his team sometimes you just got a full sent it dude if he would have full set they would have killed us they would have yes ammo nice job mate batteries stock i had your back with the second guy that jumped i just took a different hand guys just about ready to shoot but you're too good on the clock dude the ring's close we played that well we both had a different angle and when they pushed up it was it was a wrap yeah i'm getting better with hipfire now on pc when i first started playing on on here it was so difficult definitely getting better with it dude i'm not gonna lie i thought that you had your armor deposited in here of course oh that i thought you had no armor i was literally i pushed up on the fence and i was just about to drop you my armor and then grab this one because you had no help ah i was about to make a like a crazy play like that i'm like wait it's already red don't you don't drop the 500 that's my favorite thing about running the massive is like you just carry one stack of ammo and it leaves so much more room in your inventory yeah i'm carrying so many shields and i still have five knaves yeah my second oh that's a that's a care package right yeah my secondary is a volt and i have 300 ammo which may be unnecessarily the high but still i mean it's kind of it's kind of nice though for that poke damage since it's an smg that's the worst care package ever it's pretty bad are these both replicators i think they are someone else just got raised should i use my art since we're going to train yard i'm in i only have 25 of my old still i use it to get to the care pack wait someone's close uh i hit for like 70 for red cracked look at this bro do you see the size of his graph incoming oh they're looking down on me this is the guy with the creeper oh yeah i don't see him what's the right or oh yeah i don't want to change that much i have no more actual healer balls i have shields but no here the ball is like an idiot okay i'm terrified to peek this dude do you have a multi keyboard player on a goddamn craver oh it could be bad who's nadines is it then yeah they're gonna care facts then they may just be distracted right now yeah yeah they are they are there can't throw that far little rubber arms into the the way they go yeah second right again they might go on the balloon they're using a crypto drone might be something yeah they're they kept going to the right they're gonna be behind us we just swap spots it's not a crypto drone it's a weird blue light in the air never mind yeah we switch slots but we might get further from behind yeah yeah yeah right here they're right inside once you got my knees already okay i didn't really have anything i must have just got red i didn't even bother thinking that there would be another team behind us honestly two teams fighting oh the last two teams are they i'm coming all the rest this is that guy that we killed oh i just got boxing gloved and gloved oh they're all yo we can we can chill we can chill we just play smart what's happening here are you rich okay he's uh crashing for a hundred yeah that dead do we just push this last team or oh no right yeah oh they move that way look at the rope here right yeah yeah crack him i got a nice job nice dead everything that was great that was the perfect game that looked like someone raising you know but it was rampant and it was a massive minigun [Laughter] great teamwork mate you are going to end on that one right i'm going to ask it at 666 fatality666 and yeah we are i'm surprised he left i sacrificed my life for that for you and him to get the self resolved yeah he just wasn't interested we could have easily responded he had no faith in me he probably thought we'd just lose or something are you into a few you know ten ten ten seats would have been a good law split but eight takes nice and even [Laughter] good game mate good job
