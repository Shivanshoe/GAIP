hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now a few days ago you may remember me and janks in a game and our random see a teammate did this my friend he pinged out that he had no heartbeat in the vicinity and me and jax had our minds blown then and there i actually got a few comments saying that it was a recent patch see it got some quality of life changes and one of them was that you could announce your team when there were no heartbeats nearby now this is such a good feature because people forget how good apex did with the ping system which is very important on a barrel game where you are forced into a team of three or at least a team of two i mean you can solo but most people are playing with random teammates you don't have to have your mic plugged in you don't have to talk to everyone to actually communicate where enemies are what your plan is where you want to loot what you need and these little quality of life changes just add to that now my question to you guys is is there anything like this that they could add to apex to help you communicate more on your main and now i play pathfinder and i don't think there is to be honest maybe it's something like when he goes to graph and he doesn't have grapple he goes hey i don't have a grapple that's not that useful though is it to be honest there must be something though i've got two great games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all five and a half seconds my friends this direction calls to me all right 45 i don't know what we're all landing here though what's up here a purple i'll take it i don't know two times i'm an rv45 it's the new meta if you don't know this is this is what you're supposed to use let the games begin sniper stopped being that level one how's it looking all right let's go look what's happening let's go through these people let's get them [Music] good shots good shots on the right i think reloading oh my god okay he saw a purple i didn't realize i'm like half health oh shots no please that is dropped no heartbeats watch for the new kill leader okay that wasn't the best time to use that because there are definitely people here he just cracked his people okay there's no absolutely no need for that from this uh this valk absolutely no need to destroy that from this uh from the valve that was just that was uncalled for what played that team that's actually such such a good drop landing that way because this place is an absolute mess so you can get your stuff up there give them the chimney and then you and then you just kill them all please don't kill me [Music] there you go we see him judging my shoes who else is around i'm out of heavy ammo death box here contact with rivals there are no doors where are all the doors okay i'm such an idiot [Music] these three times at this close range is not really working out for me [Music] right here working at that range though i thought we oh i guess that's too weak oh my god i thought we i thought we were there to be honest i thought we were there all right get your predictions in the comments how long is the team going to last hot drop in estates i mean didn't look too bad to be fair i think people must have been sick of it you guys landed that way i'll end here yeah everyone was landing there i'll take the double bats i will look a good there we go i didn't mean to throw it there should i line say i don't have a gun because i need another one i can need more than this re45 that's for sure [Applause] neither of my teammates had weapons and they looted two buildings that sucks and he's going this way oh i suck the guy's about eight health absolute maximum i don't think we killed this guy yeah pop the finisher i'll finish on this idiot where did the guy go i'm recharging my shoes what did you have light rains another enemy down reloading enemy here i'm using a phoenix yes he's playing all that i refuse to believe the ring closes my friends hello at the start of the game and i said how long are we gonna last here whoever said that we're gonna leave you've won yourself three v books three not three it's not for free it's just three of them crafting over here just a moment and then are we crafting oh lord i'm farming get farmed idiots [Music] up top all day we had a need oh this sucks why am i stuck on this i saw you teammate one of ours just you and me down shell so bad we've got 60 seconds on that's fine i needed the jaws up shell so bad and i needed the um the stock as well for the zoom in there i'll get you better shields are recharging oh man uh keep a lookout for mobile respawn beacons let's bring them home not one in there oh my god but the old days you guys remember the uh the original gold r301 could have done with this i'll be honest uh i don't think you'll gain teammate back anyone near this loop so unveil i don't care about losing too much health i'm using this i'm mainly careful throwing thermite under fire i don't think we can now they're gonna be danish and they're gonna get annoyed okay that won't be arsenal midfield came with much love huge players one is almost correct hit him with the ump do it oh hey how about no more dying today i believe i think it's just one of those you win that you win this chess at this stream by the way seems like a good guy he's just chilling he's playing some apex he's eating some cereal yeah we're a good guy that's right that's huge i don't know if these guys can hear me but you know oh that knock on the bloodhound as he's getting to the doorway by the valve there absolutely clutch absolutely vital nice i guess that's up too it's going to valkyrie i think i know i hit this maggie a lot so i just went for it i don't know if it was the play i need shoes do you have many bats shield battery here they can hear me one sec healing up i'll say thanks don't worry recharging thank you lifeline's being patient too go for a burn we are still alive we are still breathing yeah i agree we just want to get past these guys i think look at that flying that's unbelievable i need to compose myself over here agreed standard stock here level three it sounds like the rest of the lobby i guess that's not four squads but they're more than likely over there right there might be one squad just chilling around here all these looks unlooted uh which way are they more likely to come around terminal but also like this way all this is unloaded there's a bat here too evil shield here shield battery here i can't remember how to do the marvin's at the start of the season i'm so good i'm so good with the marvin's but now i'm useless safe to touch down i agree they might be coming this way they might also be coming that way too they could be coming that way too but we can only look at one score listen on heartbeat [Music] i fell back a little bit if i can stop an increase uh a hill i could actually kill him [Music] we have to hold them here that's huge they're gonna pull past us i think antagonist in sight too close they're waiting out my uh ulti as well i mean we're going to get 30 in a sec and i've got a lifeline drone over there i think we have we need to have someone more to the right but recharging shield taking a bit to heal no heartbeats hey he's talking to me let's go i've made a friend i made a friend i have nine kills one friend yeah do you think there's gonna be another team over this way i can't get around there this team seems really good the rate seems pretty good they had good tactics down to 30 seconds rings just a little further i hear no heartbeats what they could have done is just double back they might have double back they might have just tried to get our wrench my heart beats then door back i don't know might as well get safe rings around the corner 10 i see him up there man my head's killing me oh my friend let's do the last two teams foreign this team went sure right there oh they did make it man i don't think that's even sending the them are you going backfinder probably stuff teammate under fire revolving stuff reloading confirmed enemies it's the last team she self-raised unbelievable that's the advantage here i think to god's top just go from the sky let's just get safe you are not leaving until you teach me the drums like careful the race is good player nice we're played well played guys against all odds nice they played uh they played too greedy the life on the hot game champions i thought in my head they were going to try and get the right to port the lifeline or the lifeline's going to self-revive i had a feeling they had to sell revive and they absolutely did they absolutely did ggs well played everyone oh
