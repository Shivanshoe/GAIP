this is Deshawn Lutz all the all the loot supposed to be the same way no okay no white and in the middle is what I'm trying to say is in the middle there's a gold cents in our name and I swear when I first played today Volvo Thailand here it was purple shields so if they change it and I just didn't realize all what happened blind every shot I need your stuff I need e stuff why sure that did I get okay well I got the Spitfire I've got that x10 line man I just don't have any ammo that's pretty what they were trying to ping we might have to back up I don't think yeah none of us got any and any ammo whatsoever watching I've landed every single shot lady friends why would you go that way Braith none of us had any ammo whatsoever get your banner okay I'll be overcompensating my hands ashole shaky right now let's get some food in me and the same thing that I said before I think shot by someone else I think there's like a third team involved here my hands are so shaky got a peacekeeper [Music] use my hands right now yes I can try and revive you but there was a third party so they'll again shot by the hill like too spicy for us I'm in need of attorney let's get the right back now because there's a little bit of Lutz around I mean the sooner the better I would assume along we leave it that more people product come from its Cortana and the like free supply beans I mean need a fluke to I'm gonna check them for energy roams I'm not gonna take anything else other than any grounds unless there's like gold shields a [ __ ] if there's gold shields in these 5-inch year people demand to you soon anymore it's the same gun as me French actually pretty good all people have been here I go elsewhere I guess you can't ask for much more than a g7 with earth with a blue extended line man on e for a starter weapon active just respawned don't get escape right all my word you you're shirtless friend alright he's wounded gunfight nice I'm struggling though in the health departments [Applause] you lit that guy I'm gonna look this guy makes more sense loose each other skills do a snipe team jealous okay thank you I did not reload my Ari's 45 that's cancel that we're gonna get me I'm gonna get em peds what's the point well feed on fire we need to just regroup I got some stuff for you hold on this one my Emily she wasn't fast enough to keep up with that are they not pushing let us cease with an EMP and they're not they're not going to try and take advantage of that it's a nice use the other one for some reason there's one closer that I used okay well they're not pushing that's the good news I got some Hannibal's for you I'm so I'm sort of struggling as well I'm dead to my last job better I had for a second ago I got one left uno más come on friends it's a healer come on Beecher say hello exactly that's me that's true guys exactly that's why I'm talking mate patch yourself up a bit three voice lines for healing up I think extended heavy mag here just escape just a second whatever it was peacekeepers we should sure you ask for chopping ammo earlier on it's good this has been unlooted this is what happened there's a god sentinel in the middle now boss wears purple shields when i played first for grenades on bikinis my last short battery annoyingly I had four let's rush me to thank you I did a whole lot easier I can't leave your friend then you're gonna see inside would you believe there's yet another team here good grief the fights never end on this friends right we've machine-man half man-half to eat machine back at it again why would you start the fight with our points please use a decent weapon you might actually mock me if you could shoot him once just once and get him away from me she's hiding hiding nothing there's another squad I'm gonna get a impede again we stand too close that's that's rough I'm shield was here I need my teammate shirtless to know that you're new in there contact with target that's the Korsak that I shredded to begin with let's explore this way no Timmy I can hear you now we need to ambush them one minute before the ring closes we have time before Qing what the lifeline was hiding bankruptcy hear her footsteps ambition them in the open would have been beautiful if you could have happened but I don't think she could have even got away from that that Lisa if that team going back there are 11 people left okay that's not happening why is there a nice Eastern time players oh of course of course it's another team where are you going three energy rains to stomp hurts French daddy still hurts is that me the boss Darkon know where to go I did fifty one uttered fifty-one damage well can you what can you do in that situation we got fifth party there may be even more to be honest our dealt by themselves no one did they didn't push earlier I was thinking why they didn't touch time should I do 2100 it wasn't even the end of the game 12 minutes scene uh questionable decisions by the right there earlier I mean I don't know why she pushed with no bomber she could have just healed up a little bit I probably I don't know I can't even remember when she quit is it because we didn't get a banner literally can remember what happened but still fun gamer I tell you what it's fun I don't care if more parties get involved as long as the matchmaking is nice you know I never felt like I was getting dominated by three predators there the match may come on data on Lucy's is tremendous compared to the regular mode but anyway good luck jack Jack I hope you win my friend D solo just like I was at the end I was solo goes on to win that good game stop containment today's my friends I know for a fact that in this particular supply bin there is a haven't and an Evo shield there we go we Shaw so blue shells in here that I see that's the only thing that I know that's the only spawn that I know in this area the last real one action British I saw Blue Shield some night I did not one in there I am going to commit to the evil shields the Evo shields are leaving us on a Tuesday I believe because that is the end of this lo event that we've got going on system of right so make sure you try them out you test them their full potential I mean there I like them personally I'm a big fan of Evo shields because I think gold shields are ridiculously good on this game and they are so much better than purple shields obviously they don't offer you any more protection but the fast hills are ridiculous and I think that purple like the step-up is massive from purple to gold and I think Evo shields give you a little bit of a it's all bridges the gap a little bit but you have to risk it because I could have 75 shields air but I do not have 75 shelter I've got 25 and that is the struggle it's the it's the high-risk somewhat high reward situation is the offensive sample now they are nuts you are be my litter Friday how's it going revenant doesn't look like a real character especially on Kings Canyon you just saw our plates back Duvall said friend I'll be there on Tuesday but now I'm gonna play I'm gonna keep playing this mode especially because the matchmake on stage are Lutz I'm pretty sure there's no skill based matchmaking and a solid since its tremendous since your play boards edge again I'm gonna be up against apex predators for the rest of time I believe oh my god is Kenny Sprint's panic 3000 IQ place here by this krypter where is he was that him just under the stairs the chili okay it just melted my face off he's not cool to thirst get him miss him felt God is weak there we go he Missoni shots at the star where did my health go exciting and a horrendous is the only way I can describe that unbelievable as a respawn she is from the air base of all places I'm tempted to go there it's been a while since I've been to the air base corner of the map almost friends are somewhat on the way Oh be honest I can't really remember where the respawn beacon eats in air base think it's out front somewhere it's not too far II am I should be there right yeah there we go there's Appliance up top I try not looped up hopefully this is a guy that just came back and he's got absolutely nothing you can't hear me I'm jealous I have to go all the way around unfortunately please not you in the back you can't see me smoking away sorry team I'll be there in 25 seconds here we go Shelby state everyone show us I like this the app yeah I think another powerful field off all three of them flying on my evos up to purple now I've just absolutely [ __ ] them all I've got one kill for that I did enough damage to get my Evo shields of Grady to purple so we haven't lost eight that's the good news 474 damage to rent a shield which isn't too bad I guess I hate small heals so much we are game rushed oh sorry teammate Shawn the site this man is extremely wait please okay I mean he should have should have tried to go away because now I assume my teammates are gonna bop him does he already but no no he is I'm pretty sure I'm seeing on to kill still here but I feel like I've done so much damage offense right that's pretty far away but there at least there's a little beacon here not a beacon sorry that's the balloon of justice I can use it to get my old loop back no one touch my Evo shields I've spent a lot of time upgrading I think leave it alone please we're back in the action unfortunately not Pathfinder so I can't really get to my old links very quickly but as I said there is a balloon there so cuts down the time a little bit I guess let me at him if I hit someone I will PayPal everyone who liked this video 15 pennies 15 of the finest great british pennies available on the market purple shell - took this is yeah this is mine Oh where's my evil shields who's taking my Evo shield my team I think my team's got a regular purple going on here no that's not any leaks i evoke right not what struggling here yeah my evo shield doesn't exist anymore my evo shields gone for good unfortunately so making oh no it's just a what's affecting the storm is making a noise got a freaked me out there for a second if I found some alien technologies who didn't sit in the door at the map so I found like an easter egg I don't really care where you taking us here friend I'm just gonna jump on this because people are dying and I am not involved in a 10-watt I want to get involved yeah we asked for our love but this inverse therefore squads left 12 people 9 other people and I've got 2 kills to this vie yeah that's definitely bunker I'm getting involved there's heavy for 13 caustics down here after the-- well now it's 8 from any place someone's reviving hi Kel Campbell family's got a peacekeeper [Music] I could push forward because I think it might be might just be one guy even if there's two one of them is extremely weak I gotta get to run five off storms pushing on in as well then come through the door if they like they're gonna get their feet sound father ferma toast they're saluting they still hurts as well although the race could just use their ability that's my teammate all right well it appears that they are committing to go and all the way around which is fine by me only three of the squadron only two squads even and I found it I found him in a couple brutal high ground as well we put these stupid Rockets here let's play aggressive there we go 80 damage go get a pinch I'll try and heart be his team off I can good hands with salted behind me a smoke obviously that can see through but there's not a me sees through smoke time to be healthy nor be you see all children healed up by name [Music] oh my word we are the champions my friends pretty sure I got five kills there which isn't the best however I feel like I deserved a few more kills and that game was over real quick we only had three fights and I'd spend about 5 minutes getting respawned you know 14 total squad that's not too bad that's a vestal quarter the lobby and we only really revolved in three fights a 13 minute when I got 5 I did get most my Danny damage but only by 15 only some of cheesy always nice to end on a win though so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
