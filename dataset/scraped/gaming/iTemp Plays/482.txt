hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some ranked today and i have been spamming octane recently king's canyon is a small map and well known for its third parties octane can join a fight but also get your entire team to safety whenever needed it's crazy how useful he is now and how often you see top players using it before we get into it though a quick word from today's sponsors lenovo intel and microsoft lenovo legion stylish outside savage inside [Music] thank you once more to lenovo intel and microsoft for today's sponsor i have an action-packed octane ranked video for you and i hope you enjoy it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh online off tough job dude i swear the ebay it's everywhere no 80s it is i had on the entirety last game they're trying so hard to like influence the meta they want to change it from uh from massive diva i honestly agree i can't not find one it's crazy right and that's how it was before with the mastiff you would find like a hundred mastiffs in uh in one area now you don't really find you still find a lot of massives but i feel like you can find more evils than anything i've found a massive i didn't fall in the entirety last game i was walking around with the only the last one i killed um i'm kind of stuck uh well it's all right that might look pretty good i have r9 after i won but it's any magazine looking bad now i'm good to find someone here i got 99 volt they're fighting in our labs okay on the way it's popping off produce the vault oh i need that desperately i'll come back for it i will i won't full send it if you want to get your stuff inside all right actually put i appreciate it two teams here there's one right on my door all sniped [Music] down some life stick around but this can i'm gonna get my mac i don't see anybody in cage you know i don't think there's anybody here it's not cool to camping it still might be oh there it is massive shotgun here ah all right in the face i'm so speedy you have to find creative ways to slow me down you saw that little 180 look coming close oh no impressive i was an enemy out of taking damage that's the hardest thing about oxygen right now is that octane is so just unbelievably fast that he just completely can get across the entire map and your teammates are just kind of like yeah i'm just there have me last game just sort of vibing whoever plays octane that's that's usually how it is for the for the other people right here too this is a weird sound chuck come on come back to you i'm going to break with you oh my god yeah okay these guys are trying really hard really well things i'm not with you guys survived [Music] bad dude what is with this shotgun i have been down by the mastiff so many times yeah i'm not even sure how it's five what do they flank all the way around like how am i not finding anyone recharged i think it's actually in the game of the century dude like i'm just eating massive shots it's actually insane the only one taking all these massive damage no i took a few at one point we had them all one shot on me six headshot one crack that guy forty-two and one on my shields inside uh two of them are in here okay really right for a lobby yeah i can do either pad i'll just do here savage i'm already here i'm ready okay wait there's a team right here there's this team okay obviously let's back up and jump protect our loot yeah they're trying to fulfill but i should i might send you i'm gonna get pop on this big rock we're just here let's go over here one's basically cracked there's a team behind them and they're shooting me [Music] 35 oh my god mate these 14's carefully said the team's coming over frank's one over there i don't have rainbow double g so i can't really reloading there's so many people shooting me i've done someone trying to rotate like they were like there right here i think it's just two reloading they're not getting back up from that see that still gonna try and get some shield from this there's a down over here i think i don't know it's armor you don't need light right still do you no i'm good is there energy over there uh energy no on this guy same one thank you thanks i just gotta patch myself up did all the teams in the storm die was that all of them i think uh one team wrapped around the other side the uh they went the other way because there was an opening on the other side oh okay yeah yeah and then there was a team of two up here and they just backed up i mean that was something that's stressful i have no bats dressed is kind of fresh it was probably that uh that um one team was a lobo and an octane or maybe i think but we could just walk it the prop here what do you think is over here if you land on that i can pass up check out here oh cause it's cracked i mean i'm down i'm on the ground the eye drop i dropped i dropped i almost i almost down there now we can never use that pad again good idea though is this possible that of course you have blue armor i'm down scope if you are yeah i'm done and an octane finishing this man coming in i got a good angle with the the octane with the mastiff as we came in the battery yeah that's such a hard push to make but i was just all for it i dropped down and realized i had about 40 health and i was in corset gas i was like no this is not gonna work it's nice think about octane after like when i was reviving you i was not about 30 health nah you're just all the way back yeah you didn't even have to worry about healing level five [ __ ] that guy oh come on no she went on an octane pad after that she's like there i have less than 100 likes please let me know if you had come on okay i thought i i i knew i heard somebody i'll come help you pretty sure it's a solo fire don't get that look at your timer you'll reach more time yeah oh my god i just gotta patch myself let's see if these brakes had any light rains some zombies oh oh there's still another yeah that logo wasn't eastern get back here i mean i'm octane so i can catch up my punches weren't registering on him really you punches suck me ah you know what rich but i won't put people all day you know that's all that really matters i one click that low back was she looting and not moving yes maybe was it still a one click yes it was yeah yeah i was definitely just moaning that whole game
