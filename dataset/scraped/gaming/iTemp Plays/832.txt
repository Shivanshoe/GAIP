skyhook Cadiz my friends I am back on Pat find I am back a good hand and I am back with 15 people on the rooftop that was the worst punch I've seen in a long time and I've seen some bad punches at least it did no one find a gun or something give me the flatline I think I found all the weapons here even a pitot into it in a Mozambique had to five people land on a rooftop and no one's no one's shown each other oh it's because they run off okay guys you have like a spam Medicaid or something Mike let's finish this kill hope he's got a few syringes even a Phoenix kill do take a lot out there I'm psyching a triple take some was gonna get triple took us means come in stuck on a Ledge that is not fair I was stuck on a Ledge alright well let's get the AMA switch now on stuck on another ledge surprised up on that I'm coming for your friend I'm just gonna arm switch on the way I'm not sure this drill tech is a good idea actually enjoy OHS I think it's a little bit closer range because the teams are more spread out he served 20 teams of three there are 30 teams of two so people are more spread out which means the Flint fights a closer range so sniper is less effective in duo's in my opinion I mean I'm just that's my hypothesis hopefully that's great I guess we'll find out so I mean to further the trip attacks not really like a long-range sniper are you struggling aren't you spare syringe syringes my friends they go Quatro syringe OH as they say in Spain I would assume under the Spanish speaking countries oh there's some more footsteps there was a lot of people and geez it's not really that surprising yeah you heal I'm gonna shoot this one pretend we don't know that there it's gonna give me a gold polish shield and I'm gonna be laughing odd though though I've got body shield but it's a goth knockdown and a gold helmet gold hum being one of the best times on pathfinder of course why did the team go that's the question I was hoping that me shoon that cargo but was gonna draw them a little bit and I could go on the rooftop and then shoot them as they were transitioning but I think there were a sugars I mean this little blue tent was not well regular-sized boot out the same size of all the other bloodhounds I've ever seen that's Ryan Lee this is really lucid because I would prefer to get me some decent armor there's a scrap but I'm not going over there it's pretty far and blood Landers where you have the mobility to work to keep up puff my ultimate course we can both get over there if you guys off much longer I'll have to go over there it's a scrap in the distance and I'm not gonna know it this doesn't happen me and it's me finding some decent armor brownie I'll team so these cannot find that that made it worth coming over here for a level 2 extended line make another this your battery yes I realize that I just came all the way around to look the exact same thing gracias me Amiga I my Spanish is coming along obviously I know all of the Spanish world has named this way then tell me the scraps oh there we go middle building post and I thought use my ultimate here allows my teammates go over as well we kill them okay nice let me spend everyone I wasn't sure if this guy just finished the kill on someone I was woody down or he just killed the last of the enemy team but he must have killed some there's already Dame I don't like it as much as the one-time sage Clarke I say it every time but I'm wanting to give the digital threat another shot that my friends sounds like a classic case of a scrap in the distance I shall be taking the one time safe fun I've already tried the flat line with the three times I and I can go it didn't go too well a long range there's something about it but the bullets just don't travel fast enough please let me up there I know you can make this come on you can do it there we go maybe I was a little bit far away I'm not sure if I know you Childress I would have tried more precise shooting in single fire mode Dom name and a friend you see now it's a crypto joinery around here - we need to be careful this crypto doesn't try and third-party us the drone standing still which means that the crypto is coming over I just ran off I'm sure he's gonna try and get his teammates banner but we need to be careful that crypto who's clean not in the drone anymore I mean thankfully he didn't Altos which was very nice of him I devour me switch anyway to the purple it's still very nice thing careful teammate there's a rogue Pathfinder around do some way the annoying thing about this cave is that there are actually a fair few little hiding spots left behind the supply bins mind it wasn't hiding the man's one-shots the man's dead someone stole my kill a god bag so Lisa's getting some more health back trying to heal houses 360 it was an unintentional 360 I was trying to find him I wasn't going for star points there the good news is I'm the kill way that I'm not taking the alternator you have no fear I wanted something no you're a hemlock where's your heavy Browns there's no way you'll run around with unless they've already taken some I've so many got Sean he littles alright we are actually top ten here oh and every single Joe is a life not not everything okay there are duo's they're dead I just mean that everyone that's alive isn't solo everyone has at least one team at this quite a flat line and absolutely nothing as close in terms of heavy rains it's okay we did they did you take any of your own is my friends are you've been around with like 700 something he's done is still there we go it's what they'll do I've got a hundred tile bullets that's not that bad careful because I'm still a little bit shook about the crypto my teammates piece of batter I think it must have been but what this has not been a bad game at all so far unbelievable starter skyscrapper nine terms of the amount Cal's that we got because when in fp3 who is the volume of people oh we have that nice little couch in there too how's it kept package in the distance I'm about to get over to there are people scrapping that is actually behind I always think of that and receiver and whitey I survive that I'm surprised because I think he's bad or anything but I'm pretty sure he got shot in the back by two people I was just expecting to be weak nice job friend that's what I like to see another duo down now they're only three others to go I don't think anyone died in the feed so now there are eight people left six of us someone's taken a care package I think if they would have heard us fighting smarter at least saving the bluff whatever that means so when you win teammate give me a second suppose your backyard in what how long at the bait-and-switch was unreal my house the devotion where she come looking so the squad that's another Joe down though oh my word look at my health good grief that's outrageous I think God it'd be fine anyway I've got a God knock down and my team I was there to finish the kill anyway I think I'm doing good but he's not that he's too close for comfort they say all right well I'm pretty sure don't quote me on these I'm not sure how you guys would know anyway from pretty sure 100% win rates with the devotion I don't think I've lost the game if I find this good I've only found it like what three times though but I've got a very specific play style when I have the Devo it's called the it's called the Devo rush it's called the brain-dead fever rush because whenever you see someone you literally grapple into their face because the Devo is so overpowered but it doesn't matter what you do you're still gonna win the gunfight I like the idea it's get involved let's get some recon Nagar Barry off to you that way I'll follow you I'll be there it's a fairly small cell phone now we should go out to find these last two teams oh yeah the top retained here told you the gun was good one shot sometimes reloading that's a panic graft if I've ever seen one before we've absolutely walked through these top ten we've killed everyone these top 10 these guys aren't even finds in each other no-one's even fights on the map it's just us rushing everyone I'm telling you the Devo just that's how you play with the Devo you just land on their foreheads it's a free gun fight win we know no one's trying to use the respawn beacons because no one else has died and everyone was the life so now hopefully we spot them on the also benefit balloon with justice in it was going for the care package I suppose what you've been having before yeah I put a shelf my team I won't go amiss I say what I know the devotion won't let me see that though a solar-powered class set up a long time what do you know double Devo the old double Devo setup this last team is wise commonly known as scruple Groot the only question is where on earth are they waimalu t I've got everything I need I have six shield batteries I've got every gold item and I've got two legendary devotions with each other if anyone said footsteps that hopefully is going to disturb I want and grapple Oh only one guy oh my god you can fire this gun for so long I didn't even get a chance to double Devo oh that's toxic friend don't be a dummy she embodies good grief I've really wanted to melt someone's face off with one devotion and switch to MU the devotion of Mel T's friends that face off to 2213 damage at 12 killer victory you can't play much more aggressive than that at the end of that game we were flying everywhere hunting hunting the last team's name I miss to miss someone dying on the feed every person that was left in top ten had a do-over five squads ten people left two people a team and I thought that's gonna be an epic Double Dee Bost and off there at the end it's alright though shout out the blood ain't coming in with just under a thousand damage three kills and we says somehow survived that rooftop party to start we find people landed on my rooftop I was throwing hands and everything anyway thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed that be sure to give a like rating and I see you on the next one [Music]
