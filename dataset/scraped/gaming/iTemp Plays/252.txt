hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using what i truly think is the best gun in the game at the moment and it is of course the rampage if you've charged it up with thermites it's unchallengeable whenever i bump into someone with this they just wipe my squad instantly and it's just me left to face the demon with the charge of rampage it's mental i do enjoy using the rampage myself early game because many people don't have extreme mags yet so even if you don't have a thermo to charge up you often just win gunfights by default because you don't have to reload and the other person does mid game is great because you have probably found yourself a few thermites by then and then at the end game it gets kind of tough many people have red armor and you don't always have thermites to hand still there are ways around this you can play loba and stock up throughout the game you could play fuse and carry around ten of them if you wanted to or you could just try and use a sparing drone because the rewards if you do have a film right at the end game in a squad 3 squad situation you are very likely to win because this gun melts so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i've gone to the solo game here for you today and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we are here for the scratch that is why we are here unfortunately you cannot turn up to a scrap with a two times on a p-20 i mean you can but there's no guarantees on how well it will go oh my god okay did you want that did you want that gun i don't know if you dropped it on purpose or not did you want that he did okay darn it i wanted it too okay there's going to be just an unbelievable array of guns up here guaranteed you see got a bow and i've switched it to a red dot now which is good i can carry i mean i've got some good attachments evil shields thanks amigo i need it wait for me i've got two re-45s here and one of them's got two times on it this isn't that bad i gotta stop complaining oh my god what am i doing oh i didn't think he'd go that way it should be somewhat weak nice giving my shields what an absolute lunatic okay i'm playing like a big move but it's all right we've got a lot of time to improve here is that a mozambique what be honest is it nice so i really want you mozambique it i'll find some i've got 27 in in the mag that's more than enough to come across the big rope oh my god hello that's my shield battery i want that as if that's never gonna happen do you have any heavy bullets yes he does tremendous all right time to actually start playing the game time to start hitting some line shots he's not even coming this way is this over here no it's the worst crop you've ever seen it had potential though it had potential to be a huge grapple wait haven't i dropped like a thermite grenade this game i'm i'm in complete shambles here they're gonna think i wanted to go all the way up top this guy's gonna come inside he's gonna come inside come inside come on oh my god sorry teammate i might as well pop one of these i have six of them i can't get there through these stairs reloading i don't know how i have a thousand damage i have no clue what i'm doing all right where would i have dropped in my thermite grenades does anyone remember just leave a comment and i'll come back leave a comment i'll come straight back pick the thermo to charge the rampage and it's an instant win you know that's how this is going to work there you go thanks guys i read your comment this guy must have had some no it's a fuse it my grenade all right here we go this is the game right here me and my teammate we're kind of frying we're kind of kicking off why did that cancel i have no clue this is okay i was lying we're not popping off this is doomed yeah you better back it up why is your body shields i have a really annoying right trigger which is my ping pong if you didn't know i haven't switched the charges upright your teammates down now what you're going to do oh this bad boy he's charged up ready to go recharging shields i don't want to try and cross these guys 100 oh a better bag that's huge be careful please be careful please get off the train tracks there is zero cover shouldn't have shot i wanted that guy to move up on the train tracks well he's got one of these as well oh my god please since when were they both there oh guys teammates i think he's doing it left i heard my teammate oh no my teammate actually like finish a kill what is going on here like yeah let him on the train track it's an absolute death trap now what enough he's going to do we're angled on him he's screwed he's screwed i could charge it but i don't need to let me get this kill as well this is worked out perfectly right ammo in here 100 i mean there's 18 death boxes here we'll be fine recharging shields we're damned get off the train tracks the train tracks suck they're not moving up why they're not moving on try try one minute i have nearly 3 000 damage and i feel like i'm playing at 10 of my capacity so if you extrapolate these values i'm actually on 27 000 damage you know so it's it's possibly a world record game if you think about it directly i can get away with calling that no the name of the video people call me clickbait will they world record 27 000 damage game in as long as i put extrapolation in brackets they can't have me for it you know you can't complain we need to get off the train tracks man everyone that's been on the train track has died it and my teammate wants a pop-up phoenix kit for about 20 health i can appreciate that all right let me check my inventory we have one shield cell that's what we need i don't need this many light rains i'm gonna grab all these guys shield cells there we go to the squads nice oh they're right in front of us they're trying to gatekeeper so do they keep running okay they didn't know saul on the right that was low brother over there too there's one here please don't say they want to try and get up top don't sit up top oh god it's so boring it's so boring please don't shoot me please don't treat me thank you can i like get i know you can get an angle on here somewhere oh you go oh my god teammate you're a lunatic oh they dropped nice yeah careful that guy's trying to steal from the poor and give to the no wait that's the wrong way around get involved let's go this way i really want to use this thermite grenade i invested a thermal grenade you've got blue you've got white shields if you kill me i can't upload this video it'll be too embarrassing i can't see anything okay where's the plan part who's shooting at you and does that plan part happen to have a spare thermal grade i wasted mine okay we need to kill the devo guy i think the race is solo don't die guy i'm looking for a thermite no get involved just get involved be sure i think he killed the right though he wants to try and keep the wraith alive it's like a distraction she had white shields she can take us up here okay the rampage kind of sucks without a thermal grenade the vampire without a therma it's actually decent at the start of the game but when they have red armor it takes so long to kill people are they honestly are they just running off what's going on what's going on here hold on don't fight i'm looking for a thermite love this from you that's huge where did this guy go punch him punch him punch his man oh i wanted to punch him good game where are you great game yeah yeah yeah i shouldn't ping the gold longbow although to be fair she got like two kills with it on that little sniper platform she was actually kind of popping off with the gold line but i should have pinged it okay we've got two lessons here one that's a world record game 33 000 damage unbelievable uh two do not stand on the train tracks you will die there is zero cover and three late game rampage without any thermites kind of a tough time okay not the greatest but mid game and early game even without thermites it's pretty good 3300 damage don't know how that happened ggs all around amigos i had a good time
