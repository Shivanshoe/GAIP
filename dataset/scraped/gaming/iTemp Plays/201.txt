it off although the hemlock isn't the greatest companion to the charge rifle but the charge rifle is the greatest companion to ranked mode because everyone is playing a little bit more safe a little bit safer i suppose the terminals and you can really take advantage of those long lines of sight however my hands are freezing and this is indeed once again my first game of the day enemy over there my guns suck for this team i can't really shoot through these i'm pretty sure i mean i tried before to shoot from here into that window and he didn't work so if you can treat through here scam took out an enemy oh i'm leaning so slowly i've got amigos you know my mentor my fingers aren't working properly let me turn my hair back on hold on absolutely freezing in england at the moment cannot be

was hitting me from here and i was over there i was like on this thing whatever that could be confusing for the team i got a good secondary gun the charge rifle's doing us proud are we looking this way i think that's just where they're looted can we just go this way what's this what's the star wars blasters did you see that oh shots like here let's go this way but we should probably go around the edge yeah yeah yeah this is smartphone this guy's a tactical genius i love him let's go toy machine and he's got the i got clan attack and listen you better believe it we got this way around because if it's a prolonged fight then we get the uh the advantage of the of the safe zone we need to go this this way how do i say attacking here we go i'm going to attack you using gravel i have my ulti haven't used it yet the ring isn't far he's one this might be someone closer though yeah they're close to give me all forgot you need to reload this i just want to valkyr out of here i can't see

go charging up the bad boy hold on why they shoot me for i miss every shot what do they give me push like i'm that back we're not going back yeah i think it's because i stayed there they came to help but he was reviving i didn't want him to get the revived we could just run away no one can see me in this rubbery recharging shields recharging nice job i was one team left can i get a thousand damage i can drop a little bit i barely got any myself it's one squad so i should be okay with 72. let's use it oh okay i do not have my graph ball of course they're south there where else would they be safe watch this ha blue gamer but he's one shot now these guys have to be shook they're both blue gamers what's this guy purple gamer i'm a purple gamer i've done nothing in this game i'm making amends i've tried to push this angle before and it's absolutely horrendous it doesn't matter what angle you take they're always ready i should not be letting him farm really this is a bad trade because he's going to get purple from me really easy it's like 300 damage quite crappy crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap hold it is that a bass i didn't take it careful do some damage give me some damage i need the damage damage uh that's really well played by the wraith she went in there made him weak escaped with one health perfect perfect engagement on these guys who have been sat up here since 19
