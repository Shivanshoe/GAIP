hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more solo ranked and i hope you guys have been enjoying this little series on the channel we're slowly working our way up to diamond where we will probably play with other people to make it bearable today i have two games for you which are not in order so ignore the ranks i'm there or thereabouts in platinum at the moment and the legends that i'm playing are the two mains for ranked for me at the moment of course one of them is pathfinder my favorite legend on the game i just love to grapple what can i say but the other is mirage who i think gets disrespected in ranked sometimes he has his ultimate up every single fight pretty much he has a great revive he's got great survivability and an amazing kit for 1v1 situations i love playing him in ranked when i'm solo and you'll see some of the situations that i get out of in this first game these are the two legends who are going to carry me to massively split i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right i always make the same mistake when i land here and i prioritize the loop that's up top when i should just be sprinting down low and taking the gold items so i'll take like a mozambique from top for me god knock down you can tell that teammate i'll take the blue armor i was hoping it was gonna be gold there's one right here sounds like his teammates in a fight their last teammates like caustic this guy looking over him yeah they're backed up to go in the fight i'm about to sneak into nathan amigos let's go here first which i'm not the best with but an alternator at the start of the game i think i'd rather land on an alternative than an r9 i guess that was the last one i think that might be both teams yeah an alternate or wingman i didn't get the one time to hp that's okay and also next with no attachments he's probably a lot better online with no attachments i need light ammo i mean i have like i have less than one stack but i can spare 20. you can't see me oh it's getting shot let's see if you need it here level two party going the wrong way really either definitely here i'm just getting destroyed apparently my shields are recharged are going in on this team i think i just need to try and hold up this team at the back trying to sway them from pushing my decoy teammate killed that team nice they can armor switch i can really group all right we played that really well actually was that them so is that them getting shot on the back that there's definitely a big strap i had the turns of tables that's cracked i don't want to heal i want to keep the pressure up over there that's about anyway she's already downtime i'm coming back to my sweet time but i'm coming i've got your teammate you're gonna have to waste the gold knock down i gotcha there you go dude i got one kp from that entire thing that is an actual tragedy how on earth has that happened well that's such a big scam one kp all right big scrap big scrap not really that big one person is shot but that's humongous given that we haven't heard anyone for a while hang on is that the same scrap no we got two we got two two concurrent fights going on i actually don't really want to go to this one i'll be honest with you team are you i'd rather go this one i think the teammates are in agreement okay giving my shield to recharge i hate your shotgun oh my god he's using rebels it's absolutely nailed me too of course yes i have no idea what's happening i don't even know if this is the same team that read from the top right back to rising again if anyone cares and she's challenged that because she's a maniac who challenges yeah i think i think we need to get away from this because that fight from this way hasn't happened in ages i think we just rotate i haven't heard anything from behind us in a long time so this team's probably rotating towards this fight let's keep rotating sort of low but i mean i am i've got enough to fight i'm gonna have to fight i'll come back and this team's rotated as well this is horrendous just hide team storms come in no that's the mother respawn not a heat shield okay well yeah this is targets all right the good news is i've destroyed this team absolutely destroyed them he showed in the storm who cares one guy i don't even have a med kit i need to stop in the loop for a second you can push that i think it's one guy hopefully that right doesn't die let's look in the storm it's third range great late let's go this way all right milo's looking fine i'm coming i've got one more times classic on the wingman i was landing some good shots anyway both teammates like if i were him pretty sure it's a pathfinder right i'd walk up please be careful okay all right tremendous i've got my kp i have my 6kp which seems to be i mean i should be at least on like eight um we have 40 seconds we can rotate our range but our teammate he's still voting uh let's just let's just go get easy let's just go the easy way i think going around would be bad but battery here because our teammate's still looking in the storm i don't think he can make it all the way around do you want that one you can have another one i've got the wall supply of hey you my friend are very welcome recharging my shields avoid jumping so we are safe here so we can just hold the top of this ramp i need to recharge my shield targets right in front of me heard that warning movement i could easily just made this team i can't push that without knowing that this team's not pushing i don't think this team's going to push they the bluetooth has to heal they've got a full three stack red push teammates where are you going oh my teammates are absolutely maniacs oh my god that's marvin there's no way you just got me there's no way breaking oh hello friend that's that was the dodgy's push i've ever seen there was absolutely no need for us to push that there were like five different teams 2600 damage though i mean it was a fun game we just throw away our rp it's pretty sad i can't believe i'm moving friends i'm so good i haven't seen anyone this entire time i've absolutely no idea what's going on i haven't had a bloodhound scan i haven't seen anyone there we go nice we're tracking we're tracking now we're in business yeah i think this is the guy that i saw keep tracking gold's backpack uh yeah it's not me it's the bluetooth i don't see anyone and it's not interested at all uh it might be because he's shooting maybe after the gunfire he'll drop it [Applause] there's only one guy left i gotta stop himself right actually i'm gonna take that i've only got a level one extending mag on my r3 recharging shield and that technically wasn't my kill but i did 170 out of 175 damage so i mean it was really wasn't it it was my kill bloodhound i don't think you're going to get this gold back off him i honestly don't think it's gonna happen any things where are we aiming french what's going on i'll follow the thermite i'm going in i think it just must be one guy there you go uh they're dead teammates when they got some good loots but we do need to get the heck and freak out of here uh weird start but we're alive and i have 3kb kp even that's good debating the bluth my friend there is a team over this way i need you to bathe in the bluff over this way there you go now we're talking now we're bathing i'm pretty sure they're enough yep my suspicions were correct oh my god i've seen him in the toe how many throwballs do my teammates have he's not playing with two fuses good grief you down someone they're just they've got three nades of people that are already down i did get that shotgun bolt i thought someone beat me too then very furious all right so where's his teammates then where are his teammates even they're gonna be grace that might be a different team because there is no way they got that banner though they did have a crypto but i didn't hear a drone i think this is a different team ah my team is against on the back let's go this way uh but they killed that team and there's a free kill over this way but they are also getting shot by a gym team beast is a complete mess as it's known in the trade like this team of three that's trying to get themselves a free kill yeah they're pulling down i think i need to regroup with squad here i think we should get up top where i am but if they're not gonna come up i'll i'll have to come down popping a finisher okay lifeline might be a spa bother you good the problem is i don't think they've realized how many teams are on me so if we're going to chase someone we have to chase them full-on otherwise we're going to get pinched this guy might actually be up top i think he i wish this was an r301 when i had one but i dropped it i don't like the r9 and olympus i feel like mostly gunfights at r301 range i mean that's a decent spray but i feel like i at least crack it there you go you're not me to do that oops all right fine i'm jumping in i am i'm assassed still cracking him okay i did better when he was in the smoke okay he slid and draw my bullets teammates i don't like this on the worst online play you've ever seen i've got a phoenix kit the end of the storm is right here there's only one kind my teammates know they've got heat shields over there all right are you guys still scrapping phoenix once again they've mentioned that man should kill someone that they've already knocked with a grenade like i don't know how many throwballs these guys have but it's actually kind of inspirational yes there's definitely someone else around here he's going to pop him up down i'm not gonna do in the storm let's get safe first and then i'll drop you the bag we should go this way like i played that a little bit too a little bit too safe i was there with the team i might have got myself some more kp not like i need it i won five there's ten people left i'm gonna get max kp but i could have got more kills you know but i got myself some more kill credit but i suppose in ranked it's not about the kill credit it's about it's about playing to win it's about getting the rp there you go lifeline uh this is one of the boldest revives or respawns i have seen in recent times and there is no way this isn't going to draw out the last two teams or the two other teams apart from this one right here taking a moment more energy for you here calling upon nature give or take i'm never using an r9 on olympus ever again making contact with the enemy there's not really much i can do with my current setup this guy's on track i actually might be able to scan this yeah they're not looking i'm going to give it a go because this can give us like such a massive advantage okay well lesson learned yeah okay my mistake you can't stop the animation wait that's actually a genius idea teammate yeah i have an i9 and an eva i don't really need i don't really need both of them uh i'm getting ready to either i've used like once the entire game i would appreciate it's not property nothing great nothing like a natural sniper skirt give me a two times or three times or even a two to four that's the guys got free spawn into the game i guess great already inside the rings this is a ridiculous end this is like such a low quality end he's got destroyed oh my god what is that six shots in a row two head shots without even a sniper optic well i got this team on the ropes oh my god my teammates are getting padded on they're reviving down here i don't think there's much i can do though yeah i think i need to get back to my team these guys are absolutely terrified of my longbow now anyway drive by 17 making contact with enemy i'm gonna be honest i'm getting big focused here i'm getting big focused okay i mean i think we won but that was i feel like that was such a low quality finish i mean these guys over here got absolutely destroyed with the longer six shots in a row or something you are crazy ex-champions ah okay uh i feel like i could have played a little bit more aggressive um i i definitely could have pushed 3000 damage that game but you know i mean he's ranked and we won yeah teammates a little bit more i feel like i deserve more than five kills gg
