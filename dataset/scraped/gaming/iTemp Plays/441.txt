hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today's new game mode is called ultra zone this mode has three ultra zones instead of the regular one hot drop and these zones not only guarantee a gold item and a gold gun but they also act as a flashpoint now if you guys remember the flashpoint limited time mode from last season you will remember that they offer health and shield regeneration inside these zones when you're not in combat so it's a lot of fun landing here and fighting here we found the gold gun and the gold item in the same room in one of these games i have you today if you're new here and you enjoy the video be sure to sub to the channel and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh there is another team joining us there are some people here in teammates i apologize because i don't think this is the greatest fine i've ever done i'm hoping you guys can get inside and get some link because where's the knee right here if you're behind me no that's been enough all right this is usually the place i'd love to go to when i land or cannon because this place has the loops you've got yourself a gold shield you've got yourself a i'm ready to scrap [Music] what did you have i'm terrible with 30 30. i'll take anything spitfire okay did this guy happen to have a site no he did not that is a big shame i suppose the wingman is the gun of choice don't need aside for the wingman oh what do i happening i don't even have any oh it's fine the ultra zone is healed me back up because it's a what's it called like a flash point we are absolutely miles away from the next one i have a few there you go i need it i can donate that to a good cause i'm having second thoughts about wingman i don't like having two oh here we go i know i dropped the spitfire for the wingman but then i'll realize i've got a wingman alternator here and a mozam two single shotguns and i'm i think that's a little bit sometimes you just need to spray and pray um and this is one of those times there we go i mean i'll take a flat line if i find one but for now this is the low date i was sort of scared that going to orbital cannon was going to mean that no one was on our side of the map and it appears as though my greatest fears have been realized but the good news is there are still 27 people left and we're heading on to hammond and there's people scrapping out estates he might be trying a third party i think the fight is actually down low all right i'm on the way everyone wait for me everyone chill out i ain't run here to get zero damage okay you stole my kill and then you started shooting me i'm gonna need some teammate assistance here i am invisible oh there we go i did hear that we were getting shot by a different squad i swear there are more people north i mean this is a bulletproof window i can have a little cheeky peek if they were there we'd be getting shot at i think we're fine great work friends i somehow only got two kills from that no wait i already had a kill i got one kill from that big scam anvil receiver oh could be a third one back here why would you walk through the fence that's my question see why walk when you can just fly over them like this great work friends tremendous efforts i'm the stealthiest spitfire player you've ever seen these guys literally i'm not on this i'm not on their screens i'm hiding around every corner are they weak i was gonna go for the jump shot okay there are two squads left somehow this went from 27 people left to a maximum of nine within two and a half minutes maximum i mean look at all the boxes here we're spoiled for choice kind of lucky people once seen behind these these shields if if they were looking this way through this oh there's a sheila here too imagine if that team that the pirates just now looks like someone doesn't understand i don't need to that's literally where we just came from isn't it it's my we did a big circle for absolutely nothing in typical apex legends fashion if you stand still people will find you it's just it's the way it always goes that could be first because it's a flash point [Music] if again i have hammer points i barely use my gold gun there are at least two people over here this is the last team so it's a stupid stupid gun and it's making me very angry just how good this gun is where bad about using this if i know they were a three staff see ya unbelievable scenes here in turbine one of the ultra zones as they are called these games horizon and spitfire possibly the most overpowered combo at the moment but um as i said people are three seconds so i've got to take every advantage 2400 damage eight kills uh pretty good good game i'm sorry teammates this is not an ultra zone i completely forgot i'm not sure if anyone landed here as well doesn't appear all right you guys can do that side i'll just loot this side all right this is operation loot as fast as possible and get the hacking freak over to the finite because that is where i assume a lot of action is going down it is one of the three ultra zones and the sooner we get there the sooner we can start shooting people and at the end of the day that's what we want to be doing on an fps there we go are you going in this if you're playing aggro i'm down i'm have to play aggro i'm gonna take this jump pad whenever he takes it he doesn't even want to jump listen teammate i'm here with you give my shields back boneless shield battery doesn't work if we finish this squad that's another team triple tape man see ya oh please reference the half health he's half health he's got he's got one single hb left maybe even less than that i think the octane side self reviving unfortunately for uh lifeline and me i suppose she was silenced so i didn't get the afk reds she could have been looting at the same time i mean i assume the obtain is uh far away from here at the moment but he might be back i assume he's going to want his teammates banners they're probably spam kinking him uh i'm looking at no health is this i'm running low on light i mean there's a good chance he had some right i was only interested in army switching i just want to get back to my teammate to try and cover him they go 100 perfect i need flung this is a man of culture right here i missed oh you did about 12 damage last night even tomorrow you probably did about nine damage there the charge driver always makes you think that you just gained an absolute destroys much like this guy is getting destroyed i thought that's how much damage i took i'm going to try and be a bit of a sheepdog here i'm going to try and shepherd these guys with my teammates kept them up distract them make them retreat my teammates have got a pinch maneuver on the go the secret here is not to over commit as soon as my teammates are here you're going to move 14 damage that's not enough ghost to claw what's it going on there is no way i'm making that jump even with my key i apologize terrible tactics coming out and show here this man's charge rifle is doing consistent damage unfortunately for him otherwise i would have let lifeline just try and deal with that low bear i need a light ammo amigo here uh it's my main gun like i will be spamming it so if i find some more i mean it looks like there's about 3 000 on the floor here you go friends looking for any light ammo i got you covered all right one squadron remaining it's been a bit of a strange game in the fact that my aim's been a little bit tragic at times but the good news is that is someone above yes there you go friends we look at you first we came across the only charge rifle dweeb machine player that can't hit more than 25 damage i don't think these guys are going to hop if i'm honest i've assessed to the situation i've done a report it's on your desk 9 a.m and these guys are holding the high ground because there's one squad left and why would they drop down that would be stupid it'd be a stupid stupid thing to do you're an answer would be stupid if i took one of these ropes this is bad tactics all round you can get shots at they'll see you and it's exactly why i am two people two people minimum fair enough well i've got my ultimate and i would like to try and use it but i am silenced for the next three games so i'll get back this is all three down knock down man this guy nice the teammates were actually outstanding they were a pre-made duo so i knew they were going to have the teamwork and when you're the solo that's drawn in the pre-made juror your job is to is to be the glue you've just got to mold into your teammate's play style 2200 damage isn't bad [Music] yeah i was going to say a little bit scammed on the damage to kill ratio but i think we all got about the same it's looking i mean the octane did if anyone but anyway that was a fun game i very much enjoyed that
