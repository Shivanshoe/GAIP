hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i am using the gun that i think is the most disrespected weapon in apex legends not just from the community but for me as well because i very rarely stick with this gun the entire game it is of course the havoc now one of my favorite things about the havoc is that if you pick it up at the very start of the game you pretty much have a gold gun you will not run out of bullets before you kill someone a lot of the time and it's still good into the late game because maybe one in three or one in two games you'll find the turbocharger which turns into a different beast i need to start using this weapon more is what i'm trying to say i have two great games with the havoc here for you thank you all for the support recently i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i've never enjoyed a map more in my existence oh there's good news i could just live on this map than i would which house would you choose at least i'd choose i'd choose this one i'd probably live in a tree live in the tree yeah like a koala don't quality have like loads of stds what are you trying to say first no i just i would never refer to myself they charging on my shields no please there's a guy down there taking fire firing better pick up another gun i have line energy a recharge the heck i mean going uh choosing uh rotating in this map doesn't really matter i'm not gonna whatever yeah i could craft some stuff here like a light mag and stuff that would be the smart play but since whenever i've been smart you know everyone i'm crafty you're crafting i'm not crafting you think i am actually i am 99 crafting on runescape so that's just sad to hear i'm uh i think 87 crafting on my iron man i've nearly done it twice once was once was long enough there's a bangalore i'll chill i'll just say this up the hill it's go time him sorry oh shields oh she dropped or she's still up there can't tell no there's still one up there thank you but his body felt my own come on come on come on do you need light 360 oh i'm julian i got 160. still drops him anyway i am taking fire friends what was that recharging shields i don't have any nades either for like sky nades i have one drop drop you need to crack that's this all year i'm coming did she climb she flew back up why would i drop my only bit of energy factual statement on the back for 98. no please oh my god i rested mate he's like maybe full health behind this box what happens thank you also when we were playing yesterday i was trying to get a crypto thing and wait what again when we were playing yesterday i mean james i was i was playing crypto and he was playing octane and a random team it was a masters pathfinder and as you can imagine i had about eight damage the entire game i mean that's the crypt of life oh playing with two good players on the most mobile legends so tough one more minutes are under the team so close uh oh no now they're fighting each other but you're a little bit too far ahead i mean they're right in front of me in this entrance shots i don't know where this guy's teammate went back to you okay yeah i'll correct her did she not heal she's got perf now unless he was their teammate wait what's going on here come on come on i'll see if i think yeah i think he's trying to drop stuff to box but i'm not having anything i'm not having that no way no way we actually kind of roll that lobby considering needed i hear your footsteps a lot literally yeah nice job down low on you as well proudly what's up good yeah i'll miss a switch about eight armors uh i'm gonna need some light but apart from that i'm doing decent that's perfect thank you level three you get the havoc oh yeah she took it [Music] i don't have um much light thank you i can use that mainly thank you over here i'm out of energy ammo no shake a leg i'm gonna check boxes right there oh eighty yes that was fun that's way better when we're next to each other oh yeah definitely because we were just landing on the opposite side before i just thought that i thought everyone played like that but i guess not i mean that's what makes it fun yeah i know i agree it's not a challenge when we're holding out you know we've got 30 seconds so what is that oh i think there's a wait what was that i think it was a valk that took the gravity cannon to like stop emitter it looks so weird a shooting star oh he jumped off right here she's going for the leak from the flyer we're already in the ring i think i can't even figure out how to get up there and be honest i'll drop mine off the roof you're like mid phoenix pop nah it was it was like two seconds two seconds i'm gonna wait let's be honest i'm the only real champion here this is my hammock skin this is disgusting what am i doing it's pretty bad i don't know can you even see it uh yeah can you see yeah pretty bad hit the ejector seat that's as fast as you can i'm better off didn't work wait can i even make you from here jumping out here i'm so stupid now you're gonna get it nice why didn't you throw it out with the car you're so sad that you just missed that what was it what did you get a level three lightning what was it nope even better stockage a little stock a little stockage oh way i'm down back in the car blows not even close don't know but if they shot instead of throwing an ark star i was dead broke the enemies are shooting at me wait they're on me wait what where's the footsteps hello i'm here gonna need a replay what happened she was on my head on my cranium no sound the only time i knew she was there is because she was putting bullets into the back of my head what the heck even when they ran up on you i didn't hear them at all no i don't i don't know where they came from both of them are just silent it's not gonna kill us well simon that is yeah just my own killer silent decided i'm 94 like i am going to leave any 580 if you need some let's back up where are we going mate where are we off to just give it a little check a little cheeky peek you know never know jakey faking yo replicators coming in for a landing supply good value i have a gold line max i don't even need to crash they're shooting somebody down here though okay i have a patch i think the other team's over here somewhere target spotted all right let's go over here my pad's glitched i'm on the roof i'm fine be punchable i'm protecting this side yes recharging shields we did it you believe apex put the scapes and the vault in the care package i still find that mind-blowing what's that like it's like if they put the r9 and the what else you use a lot you like the r9 and the i mean they got rid of my crawler and the 99 like in the same season i think so yeah but they're two guns how are they the same guns the crawler was an automatic uh smg's yes and the r9 is an automatic smg what are you saying they're not the same gun how are they the same gun automatically get some trees and yeah but the scout and the volleys like they're attacking me on all angles you know they don't want to see me win that's what i'm trying to say are you kidding that's all i ever used never seen you use a vocal player already inside the ring you're trolling the ammo now you're trolling with the gums never run up the hill the enemy spotted over there one visual vision on one i'm on my way i gotta see someone at you i don't know maybe not ah you're saying that so i can turn around and get the kills they're always punchable oh no the team with the team of the team i'll go back they're all punchable i am taking fire friends it's for you opening fire on the enemy yesterday i watched it back and it was horrendous [Laughter] that was actually hilarious it was comedy i don't know incoming care package film stop me there's no way there's no way you've done it again i didn't do that on purpose you sat there and tainted nade why no if we both just punched it would have been a good angle they're both going to die that's not that's not going to happen it was a big curve angle a big punch angle and you've deserted me once more i'm going about this the smart way i'm never punching again i'm just i'm just beaming i'm beaming from now on wait the octane skin is actually kind of cool this is a cool scheme right
