hey what's up guys it's reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and a few days ago i did a video of talking about fuse three weeks after release and how much i liked his kit today we are doing the same thing with the 30 30 repeater three weeks old today in fact now for some reason i feel like i don't die to this gun often at all it's the same with the g7 scopes i just think that most people don't like these weapons but i love anything in single fire i'm not sure why but i feel far more confident with a g7 or a 30 30 repeater than i would with even like an r301 or a flat line i'm more consistent with the single fire guns now i have two games for you today and when i was watching them back i realized that i was trying a bit too hard to use the 30 30 in all engagements including those really close range fights i was up close and personal fights i'd be sliding next to people in the bloodhound ultimate trying to no scope or quickscope people and it's definitely not the intended use for the 30 30. now i personally love this gun give me a one times classic or a bruise there and i'm feeling good what do you guys think of this weapon i'm interested because as i said i don't see it used all that often so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends thank you very much oh my god purple stop right here i'm gonna i'll phoenix for the health and i'll come get it on bangalore that all the way up top at least one of them is i got one of them i got to go up top okay they it's kind of difficult crab blue on horizon nice by any chance yeah yeah oh my word nice i'm going with 30 30 in a triple take i've only got 28 bullets what full light i got the most heavy we're good with the beak right [Music] like they're just down here somewhere okay i grabbed this guy's massive i know i think they went outside i'm next to any light for you level two if you need it i've got a gold one nice oh uh i can't really hurt she's really weak nice did you do the sighting hip fire thing oh i decided this time i zoomed in i had to but if i just wasn't working for me oh my word thank you jenks i was not too useful in half those fights like i'm okay with this gun at a little bit longer range but it's tricky to use up close it's not it's not it's intended juice exactly i was trying to force it but that's good though it's a good showing it's kind of showing like maybe you shouldn't shouldn't use it up close you know yeah got a time and a place what if you can try and land your shots that'll help yeah i like to uh when i'm using it i like to think of it as a wingman i think i'm just going to keep it in full auto i can't be bothered using anvils man when they're a little bit further away and you have you have the chance to you run around with it in auto yeah i don't see anyone holding my head on the exit sign i'm gonna check up top the gunshots came from like the front of bunker scanning the area scanned a pad an odd looking pad they were they were where was that let me see oh op bridge 43 i almost have a pad oh nice oh that tim is on the bridge still we can split them i'm at 95 percent that guy's really cracked 15 headshots 32 is weak two nice shots dude is she inside she's inside yet oh she's on me i'm back thank you so much and if they're going to try and come down on us i did not expect her to come out that door i thought she was going to be on your side someone yeah me too honestly just ripped it all for a friend i respect it i land more shots with her one time i think that's my jam dude you beamed those guys hey go actually destroyed you beam those guys made the rest in peace i wasn't expecting to be calling out so many numbers i've yeah i would have got lost in the sauce if i was you let me just pick up some more of these they're still top by the way oh yeah yeah that's right i don't see him anymore oh there we go oh come on i'm gonna tickle me in there uh do you want to push him i got a pad we can take the rope i'm dying i think we take the the the rope on the far right okay yeah yeah not zero the rope on the far um yeah oh yeah they're here wait they didn't even hear us nice job when they stand still the 30 30 just like i put so much damage it's so good do you do you charge it too or do you just like i charge the first shot and then i just let it if they're standing still then i'll just spam it as fast as i can yes exactly wait they didn't even know we were there they didn't turn around i mean do you never know what apex audio did they probably just didn't hear us they might have thought it was this rope the close one so we're looking down this way like oh right yeah oh right here okay i was so tempting to push you off the edge there but let you know that i've afraid yeah i know i did the willpower to restrain it's it's hard it's tough this is so tough rich i think they're i think they're walking down towards they are they are ones in the open firing octane only is blue [Applause] fish on the back yeah diving board bro what no way i missed all my shots and those guys annoying me i just headshot both of them oh nice here you will get pad pad pad to the right and take their pad oh god thanks octane is really weak nice careful diving board someone else is [Music] it's something yeah might be me how are you alive no wait there's no way no no no there's no way hey no i hit this guy for so much yo you what wait that was a pat if you mean a pad then yes i'm always down yeah what was that noise though i honestly don't know i don't see anything looted over here oh doors are open hold on let's i hear them healing in the right they're in here they're this way too i'm behind oh my god have you even ate this season i have how do you still have a mozam his name was i thirst unfortunately for him he came across he came across it [Music] uh i hit her for 150 150 races so turned to the left i think i'm not gonna get another raise off okay let's bully that race little white guy run this way oh it's nice she was like bullied me with that wingman i fried her i didn't expect her to stick it and she did it i saw you steamed then i just let the wingman pop in i'm using the 30 30 repeater i'm a fan of this gun oh you're using one too i love it but it's probably my favorite gun this season does anybody need energy my problem i i would say it's my favorite gun this season i absolutely love the thing oh behind oh my god i'm getting plastic oh good thing i was done i just did the mating call nearly cracked him twice rack swan the mirage results on me nice oh i had a lot of syringes what's your favorite side for the 30 30 i'm going to go with two times i'm going to go i'm the same way i think the bruiser is perfect for it dude you can use it at range you can use it up close yeah yeah it's just a happy mixture i have a a gold extended heavy on mine too oh you winning winning oh yeah oh just here would you like to pat on their forehead um that sounds like a great plan all right i'm gonna get ahead of you and i am gonna throw this thing down i'm not even looking yeah yeah don't don't look down look who looks both ways before they cross the road not me not me oh they're way farther than i should have waited they're farther than i thought horizon on me i got the lifeline there's a bang over here somewhere oh she didn't heal poor guy oh she did she had i have a six more in the head did she almost switch she must armor switch right there she was flash when i hit her right there she was flash and i had her like one shot already thank you oh there's a box here i guess you almost from that that makes a lot of sense armor switch like last seconds i am liking the chorus when we get into it and fight the chorus of this gun you know you can just hear it sounds like a mozambique it it honestly does you could like switch people up they think that you're just pulling up crazy with a beak and they're like man the eagle on this guy and then it's like oh no it was a 30 30 and then you just destroyed it i thought i say with 12 shots they don't expect it a little purple armor switch yeah this is all unloaded scrap hill who's unloaded that's not a good sign it is not oh team right front coast goes [Music] we can just rush this team yeah let's go up there he jumped off no he didn't no he didn't oh i'm not with you i hope you got it yeah yeah all right i'm looking for uh the bunker guys i'm gonna steal that scroll oh okay i'm gonna get up top on this one there's a mirage right here raj right here someone's coming up to me wait what i heard a rope on me that's a whole different that's another whole difference yeah there's an octane on me this is the rest of lobby this is everybody i've got back yet thank you absolutely friday this platoon here he is yeah this is the red last team is right here what's the last team this is the rest of lobby oh my god they rest too

battery off he had 13 hp ah i did him with the with the all 33 oh at least the end game was fun it was a little short game champions ugh you're right though that's the place to be it is yeah yeah yeah
