hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and now that we have four maps in apex it's quite difficult to keep up with which legends suit which maps the best for example i previously mentioned that watson is great on world's edge but not so much on olympus or storm point and the same can be said about caustic however one legend who is still good on every single map in the game is horizon her skill ceiling is really high but still easy to make use of her kit apart from her ultimate i suck at using her ultimate and that's not a gravity joke i'm just really bad i've got a game here on world's edge for you and then another one on storm point for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm gonna see if this has a extended mag in it for me that's beautiful no extended light oh take the stocks i have so many bats already thirty do be hurting nice job i don't know what's happening here like i've got no clue there's two people to keep track of i don't have amuses through a window for some reason anyone knows why that's the case please tell me because i would love to know how many people here patching myself up oh my word this is something else rejuvenating the 30 30 is so good like i actually love using the 30 30. yeah let's get involved level three if anyone who's using that he i got a kill i have two kills i forgot i hit that guy near the post that had negative negative health even i have to make it so i'm okay they do be scrapping over here i can't reload because that was the fast reload oh god nice poor guys kind of sucks for them oh i wanted like mike so bad like so bad please someone's gonna have one someone yes there's a heat shield there i should probably pick it up right this guy said got some a balloon this guy got a blue mastiff this is the team that was ahead of us they got it from big morge and we just kept like running behind them i guess we finally caught up all right well we're still live top 10 which is a little bit annoying because we got here so late but 700 damage and in my video the other day i had seven i had 1700 damage going into the final two squads and i ended up with thirty four hundred i got i got 1700 damage from the last two squads are these guys trying to keep us or what what's standing for it flying over their foreheads two more squats two more squats my spot i spot they've got a rope to the roof just saying stand still like that hello we killed the wraith right well that was fun that's the most fun i've had all game i have oh this guy i only downed him once bam nice i didn't use my ultimate one time there we go gg nice that was a good game i mean we didn't do anything for the first four minutes but the last six minutes were it's quality we're not all under the same building are we when we kind of are uh i have an if we fight it's a gun i'll take it i was scared for a second i was gonna get a gun they are over there scrapping i oh hopefully we can just finish the fight quick and then we're gonna get sure on the back sorry friends bit this is the team's going to come behind that's the problem please let me armor switch that was the whole squad okay [Music] i have so many medkits and stuff so many shields okay well that team came over and third parted us but apparently there was another team after that the third party then i don't know absolute bat the eve right obviously had a bit of a nerf in season 11 with the fire rate which just isn't he doesn't feel good he doesn't feel good but he got the job done i guess i can't complain you know what i might just go flatline i know there's some predators some heavy i move that way i'm gonna just remember this i'd still rather have a flat line with 20 bullets than that either eight i don't trust it at all get out my inventory 45. i think after this we were on command center this is the play an interesting start hey there you go i think that's just the lightning rod i mean i still i'm still not used to the sound but i'm pretty sure that's what i just heard out what are you telling me a level one mag on a flat line gives you oh god someone out there you see five extra boys is what i was gonna say they know yes they know very eager i can't believe they pushed like that when i uh destroyed the octane i think they thought i was solo because i rocked up so well but my teammates are right behind me okay i know what i'm doing i've got the teammate support shields recharging i guess they were the ones that won command center but didn't make much sense because one of them had white shield but surely there's no one else over that way if they came out you know i don't know it's hard to know sometimes found a team and they're trying to rock up on this other team i think uh i can't go down to the right with this team up here that's going to shoot him in the back of the head with wingmen darn it it never works kind of beat this guy though i think his team is kind of close right okay kind of beamed him kinda beamed him no reload who's arc star shields recharging i thought that's a friendly arc uh okay there's a respawn right outside we'll get this guy bring him back get his old loot back i was going to be see i didn't manage to heal up either anyone need to pick me up i mean i've 100 pressed triangle to switch weapon but that's okay i'll get this guy back quick so i can get his stuff i think he should be fine though i'm still confused about the arc star i'm a little bit a little bit bamboozled by that there are two teams left that's the noise the gravity lifts yeah just get inside we're fine we've got arm switches in here too wait have i got a level one helmet still there's no way there are no better helmets i also just missed them i mean i'm sure this guy no that's a level one box we do need to go oh my god i mean so many shots we need to leave yes i mean then he stood though ah one team left are you small cells unless they're right here on top of us we should be okay that was sketchy but we had the zone advantage oh level two army and a stock wait my loop was terrible charging off of my red armor that's a little bit sketchy but yeah we had zone advantage and i'm actually gonna pick on the valkyrie who's playing a little bit to aggro there i still can't believe you're allowed up on top of you're not okay there you go you learn something every day we need to go we need to leave this place real quick i've got one stop and it's level one have i just missed loads like is that what's happened here and why have i got this extended light mag here level three three times ranger you know what i'm happy to give it a chance level three where i think he took it i know he's in here thanks amigo you know frag grenade make all the difference on a recon mission i don't want my team to die i found him i found him i mean we don't need to be these folks really i can't see nice i'm gonna get emp ow that was the saddest ending ever i'm not sure what these guys are up to i really don't know how did we not bump bump into them beforehand octane came in clutch with the uh the craver though i think he was on a little perch over this way nice gg ex champions there there we go guitars come back now it's gone it's gone again which is a shame i was enjoying that good game team nice
