oh hi friends are you here for my grand soiree I got all gussied up for the occasion that's a fancy way of saying dressed I hope you like games iris of cause each for each welcome back to new the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course while it wasn't today because the gameplay that I've got for you is a bit of a throwback in the background we have a king's canyon gameplay I went back and I found a random game but you guys haven't seen or loaded on the channel this one is from July so six months ago I thought it'd be good just for some nostalgia it does link in with what we are talking about today because Kings Canyon is Quinn back to apex legends but only for a few days we'll talk more about that a little while but that is why we have some Kings Canyon gameplay going on in the background I do hope you enjoy that what I'm talking about today is going to be the grandeur soirée arcade event which is coming on the 14th of January so next Tuesday FX legends uploaded the trailer for it an hour ago as I'm making this video and it's called the arcade event because there are seven different modes each one lasting for two days at a time which is great news for me because it's gonna be fresh content every two days will have a new mode to upload to the channel and it's going to be fresh for you guys at least for two weeks so let's get straight into it in the background I'm going to be showing clips of the trailer I will leave a link to the trailer in the description as always if you want to watch it first without me talking over the top and stopping it all the time you can feel free to click that link and you can come back if you want to if you feel like you don't want to then that is fine as well that's it's a bit mean but it's alright I'll forgive you so the first mode that we are getting is called Gold Rush duos and it has the description of gold weapons only with you and a friend so straight away we have a jurors mode coming back to Apex Legends which is one of the biggest requests I see so many people want to see the return of joy so I'm sure lots of people are going to be happy about that I never really played Joe is too much because I'm more of a solo guy anyway and though I was away for a week I was on holiday when droves of psychics finally played about four games view so be nice to try was it's available for those two days you may have seen the sneak peek that I put from the trailer on the screen the weapons that you can see them pick up here are the Mastiff and the craver which are two care package weapons and I wanted know whether or not it's going to be gold weapons as in care package weapons only like the Mastiff the crab and the L start ups hoping it wasn't just those ones I also wanted it to be those gold cutitout weapons you can find on the map at the moment you can find the triple take you can find the flatline the Eve ride shotgun on the map at the moment and this does appear to be the case because they do get shot by a single shot weapon which won't be the crater the mast is or the owl star probably got escaped there's another mystery solved here on the channel it's not going to be care package weapons only the reason I thought it could have been was because they only showed the Mastiff in the crater but still next up we have a third person mode this was teased with an Easter egg in the firing range a few weeks ago where you go into third person if you did this weird Crouch maneuver in a corner of the map I made a video on the Easter Egg and I said that I thought it would be a limited time mode and here at ease for two days only actually had some comments on that video and some people were absolutely fuming thinking that the entire game is going to go third-person mode but it isn't it's only for two days in this limited time mode I'm actually interested to see the meta in this mode which may sound strange I know it's only for two days but I'm sure certain guns that aren't used too much in the regular mode may actually be pretty good in third person I think that alternates will be pretty good because it's like consistent good heat fire weapon but we'll see I'm in assigning for two days so maybe people won't even figure out which burns are good or not I don't know for our third game mode out of seven we have armed and dangerous BOTS edge I'm sure you're all familiar with his game mode as we played it in Kings Canyon last season you can only get a level one shield and shield regenerating items were actually pretty difficult to combine the description has is shotguns and sniper rifles with limited armas I assume it will just be the same game-mode unchanged but just on the new map and actually pretty soon see better because world's edge just does have a lot of long lines of sight good for snipers I'm pretty terrible at sniping are pretty cheesy with the g7 escapes with the two times on it which is definitely not what the most intended for and I'll kill people in three bullets that goonies ridiculously overpowered this is one of the big ones here I'm sure many people excited for this one I know I it's called Kings Canyon after dark it doesn't look like it's going to be jaws or anything so this is literally just a limited time mode which is essentially giving us the option of which map we would like to pay king's canyon or walls edge I'm gonna try and play the game so much during the two days this is out so I can get you guys some more gameplay and I'll upload it and drew clearly to the channel in the coming weeks I think could be pretty fun to drop at Kings Canyon gameplay from this event on the channel to switch things up so I'll just save them I just really hope this skill based matchmaking isn't in effect on this limited time most please give me random teammates and enemies I'm praying please but this will be a fan favorite either way I am sure I wonder if they'll bring it back funnily as an option if they see a huge increasing numbers for these limited time mode it's not impossible maybe if the community shows they do want to play king's canyon again they'll do it I don't know so our next game mode that we have been teased this one's the weirdest one and they haven't really revealed too much about it it's called Dimmie Timmy's is called dummies big day and the description reads this game ain't gonna test itself and this one's a weird one as I said I went through the apex legend is still ready because I'll be honest with you I didn't have a clue what's going on in an oil clip that they showed I was trying to do a little bit of research on it but a lot of people were just as confused as I was the clip itself shows some green dummies using a mirage ultimate and that's almost eats I think but then I stumbled across this comment from the reddit user the verbatim turtle and he predicted there'll be a 16 Motor season of blue yellow magenta green orange and red dummies and you can't see which legend is what do me so you could be fighting at Gibraltar you could be fighting a wraith you don't know what abilities they have at their disposal and if this is the case I'm playing Mirage I'm telling you people are going to be bamboozled whenever they see it whenever I see Mirage I just assume as a decoy so if you don't know who you're playing against in its two dummies I'm gonna spam Mirage in that game mode this could turn out to be a good guess it would be an interesting mode but it looks like we will have to wait and see with this one because they definitely haven't revealed too much and it could just be like a PvE especially considering the description saying this game ain't gonna test itself it's a bit of a weird one I'm not too sure our six game mode here is called live die live with the description automatic respawn on living squadmates when the bringer closes I've actually played this game mode on blackouts which is Call of Duty's battle royale game and it was my favorite mode that that game ever came out with we played it far more than the actual game I think blackout itself is incredibly underrated I really wished that he went free-to-play and my god this game mode was probably the funnest game mode I've ever played on a Barbarella game it was so much fun it was just non-stop action as long as one person your squad is alive you're dead teammates can fly back in onto the map with very limited loot as soon as the ring closes so you get these huge clutch plays where you know your teammates are to spectate and you trying to stay alive there's a bunch of people around because people I mean a lot of people die but then they respawn so the numbers go back up so there's a lot of people around on the map all times and then when you're back on the map your focus has to be getting them some half-decent loops because I'm blackout you spawn back in with a pistol 11-1 shields from why I remember I actually predict this one to be one of my throat modes but also one of the community's favorite modes - one of my favorite things about it was the fact that if you had a good start and you code on to the game with good loot let's say you find purple shields at the stars the game and you get some cleated weapons you are actually fighting people with that will come back with probably level 1 shields and earn a feast or you know Mozambique or P 2020 you can rack up those kills so fast in this game mode so our last game mode in the trailer which is not necessarily in the order that we will get them by the way is called always be closing in the description like this one is keep on the move avoiding big damage from a ring that won't slow down and we miss one is fairly self-explanatory the ring doesn't come in waves it just moves across the map continuously closing be in the playable area it sounds as though you do not want to be calling the storm though as they described as big damage so maybe they've booked a lobby for this mode because you can't really be caught out by a very slow-moving curtain of doom we're both calling something maybe it's not even that slow but you can see it coming and yet I assume you can outrun it still don't ask me why I'm using this are a45 still in the game in the background pod way cuz I don't really have an answer for you I think I was holding for some disrupter rounds because obviously disrupt drones in season two we were sauber pete peacekeeper watch don't drop the peacekeeper I'm fuming in fact I'm gonna go and write a comment about it and also I'll write a comment and say at 8:16 you mixed just hook the reins cuz I assume I did somewhere in there alongside the game modes we are also getting some rotating skins in the shop as well I assume they will rotate with the game mode so every two days and you can see a few of them on screen at the moment from the trailer so we're definitely picking those up as well so that is all we have all the information that we have on the garand or soiree arcade event trailer the seven game modes look incredibly fun of honest I am obviously most excited for have to be the kings canyon one which is one I had to dig out these Kings can you gameplay for you I'm extremely excited that game mode I spent about thirty five minutes talking about in there as far than where you respawn if your teammates alive when the ring rotates and I'm extremely interested to see what the doing wine is like as well because I have no clue what it's going to be so those three our pro my favorite three leading into the event and if you guys could leave a comment and while you guys are expecting to be your favorite ones or at least the ones that you're most excited for as well that would be great as we come to an end here on these apex legends Kings Canyon gameplay so I had to show her this game indeed I couldn't just leave it on a cliffhanger its but actually in pretty interesting watching my gameplay back myself because I see I don't remember playing this game but I picked up a score Pisa and I've got a flat line a pre-birth flat line when I had a wingman earlier on in the game in fact I think I've had 74 boons this game I've had an RF wolf I've had a peacekeeper a wingman a devotion and I've got a flat line as well it's a bit of a weird one it's melody again brushed by someone I have level for shields my teammate was an awesome game i cut unfortunately and you boy went down look at that very very very sad times over this way and this is pretty much where the game ends he like grabs my banner he tries to finish the film and unfortunately as he's looting as always on this game so what comes down he wasn't ready for it I was disrupt around oh good grief it's a good job that got rid of that anyway thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one
