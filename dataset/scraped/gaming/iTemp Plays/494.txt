hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now octane used to be seen as a troll pick in ranked or competitive but the little guy keeps getting booked first his passive was buffed and then his jump pad was twice and then they nerfed other mobility legends which was an indirect buff to octane so what is he good for in ranked the short answer is just mobility for the entire team legends like pathfinder who can offer a zip line to high ground or wraith who can pull to her team to a better position safely these legends are key for rotations but pathfinder and wraith keep getting nerfed so legends like horizon and octane are becoming more favorable picks even in the algs the ultimate apex legends competitive tournament my favorite thing about obtaining ranked is getting out of a sticky situation which there are a lot of on king's canyon the third part is a strong but you can just jump back to safety hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right little little bunkertown it is i still don't know if this place even has a name oh sorry i forgot i'm so used to the anniversary event where there are no like level one items on the ground look at these level one extending mags on the ground ah i'm gonna miss the anniversary events when you can just expect level level two extended or above you get looted from one little place and even if you're not looted you've got a little mozam little white shield i actually hope they uh they allow you to spawn in like i i do like the anniversary event i know that's not really what i'm supposed to be talking about because we're playing ranked and this isn't the the time like did anyone land on that there's a chance that someone is already on there if not i mean we do have a horizon so we don't even have to wait for the ropes if she throws a little ability down is she gonna she does indeed tremendous thank you friend the blue shield there got knocked down okay got it this time but gold armor r99 i mean never mind we don't need the anniversary event i'm looting mcgrooted i'm i'm down to find someone shotgun bolt here level two i'm not sure what my teammates lose right that's the problem and plus it's ranked so the lobby stays live for a long time you know you don't have to rush into anything i think ranked the meta at the moment is wait for someone else to fire and then octane jump pad at them if you're gonna revlon even better if you don't who cares let's jump out on their face and hope for the best there you go friends massive in there too so you i think it's uh i think it's gunshots in the distance i can hear oh there we go sometimes the pizza pattern of the gunshots just sounds like someone is fine right actually there you go the mirage by aj is kicking off some more heavy rounds for you level four sounds like salvage is kicking off as well this may be our time for me or 99 here she's fast like me ready to third party this is why you play octane in ranked see someone else and they've set the place on fire if that's not an invitation i'm not sure what is 45 seconds i don't need that many your backs i have 16 cells in gold armor good grief all right hopefully the fight isn't going to be over too soon my teammates are a little bit far behind so i'm not going to grapple it like a grapple yeah i'm going to tell them i'm not going to jump right into the fight i don't have the best guns just still up here and third party but there you go in lifeline race my teammates are kind of close less than 250 damage and three kills that's the obtained go dream sometimes the mastiff oh that's an either right that explains it like when you land every shot with an smg close range against like a massive i know it's an e right uh i don't know if i should take that i mean i'm an octane i'm probably gonna die i think it's better suited for my teammates to have the gold bag thank you i mean i've got 92 but i'm going to use the voltage like my longer range it's going to be my ar hybrid i mean there's a lot of boxes this way we didn't get a chance to loot either both of my teammates have got bags now which means that i mean that's a license to jump into the action if i've ever seen one before no energy i mean i'm playing octane so i might as well get into the character you know every time i use a jump pen at market i think back to like season one when they put those jump pads in front of market pretty much exactly where i placed that one as like a teaser for the first new legend being added to the game which was of course octane i was some good times back then my teammate again got a company and they're not here to sell me that's definitely an enemy they're probably gone for the care package no it's unlucky too my teammate level three all right what you got care package i don't know what i'm hoping for here oh my word gold bag that means all three of us have gold bags that's tremendous gold bad gold armor gold knock down who needs the anniversary event for luke not me oh you like back in like season zero before we ever like had any new legends into the game we know how the updates were gonna be we didn't realize was going to get like a new legend every season it's probably my favorite thing about apex is the amount of characters they did yeah i didn't it's not as much of like as i don't know if you guys play league of legends if you don't play that game for like two months you come back to it you have to learn everything again there we go that's where we came from as always and the legends laid into the game on league are just they get crazier and crazier you have to read like a novel to understand any of the the abilities going on it's it's an absolute mess that's a watson ultimate that's not where you said the nade was going to go i see three grenades there don't don't fling any more arc stars they have a what's the nalty everyone halt the flinging 176. hello friends all right teammates one of them has got white armor do you have any more of those ark stars you can fling them just like they see yoga these guys behind us are pretty much on the ropes but if we get third parted we'll end up like that with the team well you don't even have a shotgun both give me that back i'm gonna need some energy rounds team i've been putting some work with the vault if there's no energy i'll pick up the flat line but oh here we go thank you that's team work right there it doesn't seem like we're going to get third parties oh they're they're in their own scrap do we go that way way out there are these guys still here they're burning our teammates so maybe one of them is going to push up i am just like a centimeter of bobby's head that's unfortunate i'm tempted to dive on this guy's forehead oh uh i'm not gonna beg for any jam of the rest of the game purple shotgun perfect i still got my vault i switched the wrong gun this is probably better anyway with the r301 makes more sense at the ball supply of heatbox here i don't feel like i need five batteries with gold armor 30 seconds until the ring closes you like cutting it close huh okay you want that it's on the house yes please don't have any syringes all right hopefully i mean i was gonna say hopefully these guys are still scratching up here there's no way i saw horizon ultimate they were really close together there's no way they're still fighting the winner may have tried to come over perhaps there's actually someone there yes there is okay i'm down great thing about octane's jump pad now you can just clear this wall and if you play it well you can just sit up there and they just don't see you coming oh my word i feel sorry for this team in a row absolutely outplayed by digital threat there's another team here trying to use my own tactics against me some guy just keeps taking my pad and he's trying to get up top stop shooting them they're my kills hello friends [Music] need more juice repeater here okay well that's not single fire let's probably walk around with auto though oh him chorus of mastiffs good job i've got my own i'm going in get those dog bags ready oh there's a live one in here too what's she doing i'm blocking this door nice i don't think i'll ever use it if i don't use it now gold bag gold knocked down gold armor combination one one little shield cell and i'm back to full health pretty much as octane here i always pick up this many throttles at the end of the game and then i end up either throwing them at nothing or not use them at all i might as well just jump they could be trying to ambush us the rotation options from like the octane jump pad now he's it's unbelievable there's a care package down here but it could be based they could be waiting it's happened before there are two teams left and we're up here so who's throwing grenades at the floor that's what i said i usually do 45 seconds until enclosure now just feel like it's bait even more they're trying to pretend there's a fight going down on there there are two squads left we're not falling for it a few more and would be inside the ring 30 seconds i want to use my anvil range but i'm not even sure these guys are going to peak that's safe we could just rotate around 10 seconds it's a decent spot it's not too bad whenever it ends here it just i don't know there's always one team that landed here and it's absolutely terrified and they just see inside a house but those teams are still scary they may not be the best players ever but if they uh if they're three manned in separate corners i mean everyone can fire a spitfire at you especially if they have me ceased it's just not worth pushing i'm just gonna sit here i guess all right well they opened it without consequence so i assume i can take the trailer without consequence too thank you but this really does feel like season zero now season one i guess i'm saying was released prowler this side of the map has never been changed at all and everyone who lands here is a massive camper some things never change all right it's ending right there our teammate's getting impatient i'll come with you just in case he's in a corner you good should be fine we're getting dangerously close to the edge of the zone here the edge of the edge of the map where is this guy oh man that was the least exciting finish of all time good work though friends you are the apex out there octane ranked is a solid solid choice 2 400 damage near enough and some solid teamwork in there as well two revives in the watson five kills two two kills from the horizon definitely deserve more than two with a thousand damage a 21-minute game that should have maybe been i don't know 15 minutes it is what it is thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in the next one bye
