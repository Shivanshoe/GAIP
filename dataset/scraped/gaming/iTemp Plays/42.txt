hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using a gun that i think is criminally underrated whenever you see a tier list this gun is always like c or maybe a bee at best but i always farm an incredible amount of damage whenever i use this good it is of course the 30 30. now obviously my favorite gun in the game is the scouts and it's in the care package and the gun that is most like the scouts on apex is probably the 30 30. i would say it's a little bit more difficult to use because it kicks a little bit more but if you land a fully charged uphead shot you're dealing such great damage and i need to use this weapon more thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds me amigos um i'm gonna line in this smaller building right here small building okay small building outside my load please mate please no you can't because i i hate this game under the team we're getting a great point of the team machine i can't switch that to light i need heavy i think i really did i to be honest yeah i don't have too much she died left fast sugar just giving my shields a recharge reinforcing my ego mate this thing cancels my drone look it's not healing me when you put your shield there on the other side of it no i don't think i guess stuff but then like it's last time yeah it like break even when it go even when it re-tethers to me it stops it from working it's really weird that's weird it works for me strange tempo on the ground done if you need dead-eyes tempo oh that's a big pic get the sentinel going hostile right here i should have really think that should i i know you're going to come give it to me really so it's fine all right that's that's that's where you're on i want to craft a bat i have no bats and i have nine sets i'll give you i'll give you one i'll give you one and the one i claim the one of my bags one singular bat that uh that belonged to me that i have in my pocket oh that's so cool i will i will share thanks so much mate you're such a good person oh it's this way well i can't give you the bat if you just keep running can't give you the bat if you just keep running yeah but this is going to scrap you got to slow it down i'm going to use both bats in this fight if like 160 something thank you thank you i'll take you there okay see just keeping my shields very good do not need this many heavy bullets kind of going crazy with a heavy ah you always need more actually i'll just use more let's switch it to heather yes i'm a genius god i'm good i'm really trying my best to go down this game and i think so far i'm doing a pretty good job gay you're doing all right you're doing all right it could be more you could die more and faster but stronger recharging my shoes hey calm down okay omni just taking a little cheeky peek i need your oh there's no jaw shells in this game 30 30 is completely nerfed it was so good on the thirty though yeah cause the mastiffs in the care package would only be on the thirty thirty i mean oh that i don't know normal jews i mean i like the 30 30. don't get me wrong yeah me too i think it's but i understand why they took it out oh they could introduce it to someone else maybe they're either oh they could have put on the either uh that makes no sense it's like a drum matter no but they could have i like how it's a drum mag with eight bullets too yeah you think you get more we played talk off just give me like just give me like a solid 25 you know solid 25 shots in my ebay he was completely busted yup i was having a fantastic time he firing everyone thought i heard shots but i don't know where you're not you're coming for this replicator weren't you i don't like you when people call the supply bins pills i don't like that why i think they look like big pills it doesn't sound good though sounds terrible why i don't know i just don't i don't like it that's just your own that's just your own interpretation of the word pill 100 no 100 it sounds like a you problem yeah it is i'm just saying i don't like it sounds like a you problem rich it is all right take us to other people i mean this is awful why are we following you do you win in the largest circle imaginable where are we going i'm going this way nah this is such a bad choice he's going this way i'm not following you we've had a lot of success following me around come on look at this look at this ride on my head right on my head are they actually they're flying yeah they're flying they're going to land on the building if you need my help that was cool i played well played made possible from me crackling you know yeah team play not team play in the fight i'm going to climb up just on my pink
