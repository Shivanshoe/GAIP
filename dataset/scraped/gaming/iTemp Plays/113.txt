hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and i have another 4 000 damage game here for you today i got it on wraith which is great because i didn't have the 4k damage badge on wraith yet and i feel like i'm coming into my element on apex at the moment so i've got a load of good games and the setup that i'm using this game was a 3030 and a car smg which are two guns that i'm not usually that comfortable with but i've put them to work in this game and i think the way i did it was i channeled my early g7 scout days where i would run around on king's canyon with a one-time sight so that's what i did with the 30 30. i left the one times on there and i was landing shot after shot it was glorious i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you so much for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends go this quadrant down here might be something good this way does anyone place the land when it comes to checkpoints and that is the triple triple beans i mean look at this get the hecking else car out of here get the l star out of the game i've fallen off smoke out get me back up all right come on paul yeah huge scrap you hear that i very much appreciate shotgun bolt here i'll put your shotgun bolts i off the chimney with the pk but i don't feel comfortable with this gun i mean hopefully i'll find a bolt if i find a bolt i'm okay it wasn't with the fight here catching myself up that was on point shooters that's a delayed reaction bangalore you're lagging or something out there down low it's on the the ropes maggie there we go i got scared i uh shot too early there but it was only a matter of time till she saw me at the top of the rope anyway who he's throwing arc size i need names okay on there up top are they perfect tango killed here two teams perhaps got on fast stop lobbying stuff just shoot him just shoot this guy how many throws do you have bangalore she's still loving stuff that's crazy she was have absolutely zero ammunition i hit him for 130. zero ammo just an entire arsenal of grenades you know i think she's playing the wrong legend i reckon she should be playing for you we could double up on the nades well i kind of cracked both of them kind of cracked my shots i'll put my head there like an idiot i need some help team i stuck with the pk [Music] i really suck with the pk that's left healing eyes are open though okay well it's worked out none there's still 24 of the people left honestly i think storm point i think i prefer king's canyon as a map yeah car i'm taking it i can't i can't run around with a no bob deep anymore i think i prefer king's canyon as a map like the design however i think i have better games on storm point because of how long the games have the potential of lasting sometimes it's the same thing on this map but other times we'll have games like this that wasn't even meant to be a wall jump and that was a purple shotgun bolt all right well that's not what i want to see but i've just dropped my pk uh all right we're gonna valve course we shouldn't have come down the road would get ready to score far more verticality if we said of top but this is fine too you can still clear the mountain so that's all you really need to do with it with this first thought and there is someone behind us we've got these guys easy and they've got white's armor kill him once close another enemy down reloading all right if you're gonna put your knock down i'm gonna get my shield back because i'm pretty sure you're the teammate he's revived near the guy that i damned and now i've got red armor that was the whole i saw you teammate nice they got the revive off so i didn't get the kill credit but that's fine that's how important like an entry frag is you know it just it sends their team into disarray three times so i'll take it i've landed a lot of shots at the the one times i might just take i could have kept that for the car now that now i'm choosing heavy but i got 300 shots it should be fine the nice thing about running the car is that how are you going to run out of ammo everyone uses lights and if they're not using lights they're more than likely just going to be using heavy here we go we've got a big zeros we need your nades bangalore come launch all your nades what are you doing get out of the open okay i missed enemy over there where on earth is the bangalore beginning i'll have to say the rope nobody panicked [Applause] replicator touching down is the fight over oh what a shot okay this valk with the sentinel my shields okay i've got double headshot placing a portal if i know of red armor i'd be dead that's kind of correct did they triple headshot me that might have been a triple headshot that's outrageous don't go down i don't have thoughts i don't know if they should just stay in the cave they're gonna get first if they come this way i think are you support one because you get an instant queue when i was one shot i also wanted to uh be able to get back up onto the cliff this guy's dropped that's goodness for us that's a good smoke just trying to buy time for the valve to crawl around the corner no they're fast enough i need to recharge my shields listen let's move here just us now gotta watch each other recharging my shields okay this good stupid like i don't understand how i was bad at this gun for the first seven weeks of season 12 because this gun is one of the best on the game this is ludicrous i can't really get in catching myself up [Music] we should make that recovery 20 seconds on banner recharging my shields that's a great smoke from picked up our teammates care package coming in these guys are kind of struggling the octane just got revived we can defend easily this rope 50 seconds that's all healing up in there i think and to be honest they're probably looting our kills just need to stay up top and then we defend this recharging my shields ugh ultimate isn't ready yet okay the zone's moving okay i thought it was 50 seconds i thought it was 50 seconds until the zone started i didn't look properly i'm sorry team recharging my shields i was going to shoot these guys how much for the three times i will take too long i don't even care if i hit them i just want them to know that if they come this way i'm going to shoot them i need to dissuade them so they don't gatekeepers here through this cave because if they wanted to they could have came through the cave here i think i'm going to take the uh let's say the gravity cannon separate ways for separate people you know we'll go out different way sometimes i'm being ambushed contact heard that but i'm right so he's fine i'm pretty sure you can climb this no spaghetti giving my shield the recharge throwing through my grenade i've got an assist on him i must have grenaded him off the roof killed an enemy good job then my teammate got the down we should go here just take the portal just just take the portal big portal plate listen let's move here there you go less than 30 seconds i'm playing right my heat box is too small i don't care if i have to climb up on you squad's down i need to recharge my shields too we've got no things keep people firing over the hill i mean i don't know about you guys i don't actually need that much loot i have good ammo i got three bats that's all i care about you're down as well nice because the zone starting five seconds if we don't heard that we're gonna move on soon we're gonna get gatekeeped that is not what you want contact with enemies recharging fields shields rings coming in might be time for three times but if this in the compound coming down over there i'm not gonna shoot them from here i'm gonna keep them one time honestly i feel way better with the 31st with this one time sonic this might be the play i guess we're not safe in this building zone's moving we might just want to move to be honest i think we should go to these little i was going to say compound i don't know what this is bit of cover come this way friends these guys might be trying to choose as we come in as well i need to recharge my shield stayed over there give me a second this is why i wanted to move down okay though get out of here that's what you get you gotta snipe to do the team they stole that kill okay i've gotta knock down i don't have vaults ultimate's almost there and it's kind of close you'll be all right i gotcha hey got our squadmates banner i mean we've dropped the pain we got a minute until the zone comes in and i'm pretty sure main band can hold this these guys should be getting shot on the back there we go blue armor we've got a blue armor bandit trying to push it's unbelievable for some reason the team on the hill he's shooting us instead of these guys in the back there's a horizon hello i heard you i'm taking but don't climb on the roof there she just shoots me from the top why are you coming back stop it this guy on the on the rock with the single fire hemlock is decimating us did she drop well i killed her i can't remember oh she's up here team we need to get these guys out of here but they're on their last legs just get them i set the portal recharging shields patching myself up oh i can't reload i can't reload i can't reload i mean i did 4 400 damage i have no idea how my teammates are in the zone still i've no idea how they died in the zone all right so this is me from the future watching this game back so this is me pausing through right and then i thought my first instinct was maybe they took it by accident because it was in the smoke uh they walked around the corner they couldn't see they both took the forwards or look at the mini map they went back there and then they both died in the zone but then after this whole kerfuffle happened where i tried to revive my teammate with the gold bag and i couldn't reload and i ended up just dying she was like why portal no good luck she was angry at the portal play which is understandable because i didn't see this when i was playing this wait it's coming up this way this is me dying look at this bam like she said in the chat i thought it was to safety they both thought the portal went to safety but i popped it early because i thought they were they might be on the other side waiting for it i didn't want them to die in the zone back then it was a miscommunication they tried their best it was still a good game with nearly 4500 damage i hope you guys enjoyed it thank you for watching
