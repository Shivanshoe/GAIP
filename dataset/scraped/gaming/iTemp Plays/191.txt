hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some bangalore in ranked and i've realized recently just how good of a spot the legends are in on apex in terms of balance i've played and run games since his in diamond displays with bloodhound pathfinder bangalore lifeline and sia and there are so many more that i could play like valkyrie pb caustic the list goes on i really think you can play any legend and as long as you play to their strengths you'll be finding ranked which is great thank you guys for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's another team here with us there's two teams mate where'd oh really huh oh yeah black buildings maybe yeah i'm learning a three position here ben's outside one's left i'm gonna charge yourself mirage [Music] one shot down another target i swore i heard him i'll kill him are you killing rush yeah yeah yeah oh sorry got every kill you know one assist from that really everybody oh there are more people here oh remember i'm gonna i can go up top might be another team i think there's another team on that team the time's really awake here oh dude i'll come and help okay zero a light round i have uh 25 mate we've got a crafter here if necessary i got my kp i'm on five just using one more i guess what would you do if i just kept the door closed to try and try i was tempted you know i mean i probably would have got off ah i don't know why but yeah you choose the worst times troll nah i was i would never do that in ranked especially i saw a blood down like right there running up i was scared i wasn't gonna make it in yeah it was close wasn't it and i was popping a phoenix so if he made it in i was dead i faithful i'd faith in the squadron extended heavy mag here level two the door stuck you need to uh you need to watch that it's classic hey i don't know the reference it's just this guy that gets stuck on a door and he says doorstop that's literally needs to know okay oh there you go mate i don't think i need to watch it he just told me yeah spoilers another thermite man can't carry them all not that guy that has all the limes and he says these are all our lines but wines are mine might you know what guy the guy that holds all the lemons another lemon can you stop running i'm current i need to carry these thermites and i've got this let's put the lime in the coconut not that one oh my god i remember that time can i take the gravity lift yeah there's more thermites over here okay good star mine's literally everywhere i know i'm rocking two thermites i need to change this to a flat line if you see one please running down the hill but they might have seen us one minute recharging my shields might wrap around this building just because they have to come this way rather than rotate to it first and then we kind of stuck they're moving they're moving forward one of the backs one shot there's two of them nice no three headshot on octane i hate the other one as well and body shot him close one yeah yeah i was building it's solo zip top on top broken up there it was so hundred percent different it said different team and it was definitely a uh finger before octane healing probably ratting i wonder if i see you can probably see him if you use his heartbeat but spot i have two of them sometimes they're difficult to get enough time though that's uh that's uh selfrest back here i was uh yeah it's back here yeah i want to kill him by the time you get there he's gonna have all his stuff mate he's gonna have all his stuff i can't come with you i mean then we have to just go there we're just gonna have to leave them yeah they're gonna be stuck in zone for a long time like it's if someone hears it and just holds us we're just dead i don't know they're going to come in behind us now it's not going to be good i don't know i mean we got to go now we can't just hold that they're going to be so screwed from this silence surely one minute that i'll be out in a minute i've seen anyone want to come behind us man like it always happens and we're the ones that are screwed you know team right in front of me what's in the middle of the ocean on here yeah i probably had the zone now their lifeline rose in i'm coming mate i got a knock oh my god i'm sorry i'll try first nice we're right in the middle of the zone yeah over here i'm not sure i i only have one bat some cells right there give me a second i don't have any white ammo yeah we come back and loads if you want so on that care package before that one package over there right here in the middle yeah oh i'm dead after that i'm fine fine nice job drop this stuff light ammo so bad swimming here oh like that oh i thought you meant this team of top sorry mate when you said behind i wasn't sure target g7 that's what it is all right they're coming into the spider's nest right here are they careful kevin kevin you're going to get on the back by the crib of the team yeah i'm moving back let me know if i should air strike one he says this one behind us nice that's my last major key i probably shouldn't pop it well hopefully they land over there they need to get out they're going to be behind they're going to sandwich this team what are they doing landing this way forward over here you barely see him i'm gonna get crybird if i move up much more need to recharge my shield try and put a try and put a port over here yeah yeah if you guys can just we can wrap this over this way private boys need to be dying trying to let that team uh yeah yes private i can smoke and then we can pour or something just going to make sure that team doesn't combine this yeah i'm looking that way this guy they're going to they're going to rap behind us oh did you need us to stay that way i'm sorry oh i mean it's fine i just i don't want them down one of them over there they're not going this way they're going either way we could use this opportunity to move up a little bit i mean we don't have to juice yet enemies careful that team teammate though sorry i didn't want it to crave her again i got smoked him nice i think that's crazy every single rocket i'm stunned by the way i'm still stunned one of them is one shot which is one i think it's just one yeah them landing there actually helped us out a little bit it was confusing i don't know why they did it i thought that was going to land the other side you are the apex i don't think there was anywhere for them too not really not really and this but to begin with was probably the worst spot of also nice nice nice i ranked up
