my guys are just a quick intro here we are doing the second quest today but we will have a full gameplay after it's done so I hope you enjoy let's get straight in okay the new quest is ready to play we are going in it's the hunt and number two it's called a legend falls clear out hostiles from a safe distance then locate the next artifact and we get an epic a Ruby chop oh that's not a nice you know what does it mean oh that's decent okay this artifact piece and then of course the detached a chaperone which is the chapter to the story let's get in my friends let's get going I need to open up some of these air picks back still I've got fifty four on PC which is kind of a lot really I went in after a little bit cute way way way way way way way way okay so I can't use these characters for some reason and they all have a triple take they all have a triple take with the four times ten time I might have to use mouse and keyboard here I'm gonna give it one go with controller but all my worth this site is horrendous with controller horrendous so I'm I'm willing to try Mouse on keyboard if this doesn't work out fortunately and I'll play on PC because the PlayStation servers won't even let me connect at the moment a lesson for us clear at the hostiles from a safe distance then locate the next artifact out from a safe distance okay no rushing I'm not sure why you're not allowed to play like Krypto or Bangalore I'm not sure what the reasons are all people are scrapping already here we go big scraps right we got some sniper mode this is my first attempt II I'm gonna stock up in sniper ammo it's still stuck so case taxes 24 not bad wait sit I'm gonna use my I'm gonna okay immediately I'm changing all right we're good what's my sense it's like not bad from a safe distance is this considered a safe distance at these the enemies are supposed to be shooting I'm supposed to be going oh okay I've need to kill four of them that's three Oh chill out I'm a mouse and keyboard I'm not practiced what kind of look we got here Alfie some better she'll fell dead Oh also accelerated which is weird as we kill four hostiles are there any more frames are a bit lacking hey friend going on oh right you wanted the big boys alright I'll keep that in mind next on my frame all my friends are struggling a lot 13 damage oh I don't have Hannah points on your side last time you had hammer points Oh No chill chill chill chill chill chill chill weapon is not too many of these things one announcement here as I'm playing did you drop a weapon I'd like a different gun all right these look like what some fences a week can we get in there there you go I'm just picks couple I guess it's more effective the to protect got these weird Electrike sort of vibe to the moment interesting okay so these are watts intensities I can get rid of my sheep now Watson because life signs I think we've got a mundane can I help you clarified you this works so a solution no Watson what's in his death box what do you have yeah denarii 45 and a charged rifle can I take the site off this oh my god this is what I should have done with the controller that's this sure what I might go back to Java then because my aim at the moment is actually pretty pretty horrendous alright alright there we go we're back I don't even I think I'm gonna pick you up just in case they're miles away this is probably a better choice right hello double tap action here two more watts and fences Watson's down but let's keep it together I mean that's it's pretty sad this reach the door team do not get messed up Oh Nelly huh your boys getting absolutely destroyed it locked but I can keep you honest this is what you want to do okay Cobb zombies back at it again do I have a Phoenix kitten no I have this hair wasn't expecting so many of them the last time I played the quest like the first quest it was extremely easy this time [ __ ] I mean really messing up right I need to access the panels I need to open the exits there's one down there [ __ ] here and only have four shots left on this thing I'm gonna have to use the triple take you soon they still can't Luke we have first another steel battery there which will come useful oh okay don't spit fire action I'm not gonna work that just yet I want to see what kind of I sort of lose around anything else I can use this is opener ball so I think this is where all those people came from ok cold peace cleaner to drop all this night grammo and that those drop anything are needed I think so anything behind no all right I've got two gold weapons here time's going up in these Exeter this is shield pinky - what do you wifey completing five meats I'm taking my sweet time it's been breached thank you for the ammo what's this on our 301 might keep the peacekeeper and this thing just has so many but it's in it that it seems like the right choice - oops I take this power - if you let me there we go you know I'm a sport of all company if I had to just probably I just had to phase away from these little gremlins he's the old prowlers that's what I'm talking about door should be open there all right nice unfortunately what's and I still got all the fences around so would you help me a little bit in that previous fight go all right dig up the hidden artifacts please don't hit me not at AAA give me a second thank you watch your six hostiles approaching from which angle this angle family [Applause] now climbing whoa it locks on like it's four nights [ __ ] its look a missing she's going crazy it's Phoenix - sure if needed offender this same term right sounds like it's neatly done right grab it and go it's gonna be friends though you gotta run to safety there's the extraction ship let me reload come on peacekeeper that let me out of here alright we did it we did him first time him again we did the first time solid that one was a little bit sketchy yet and I was messing about with Madison keyboard and sniping and all sorts of stuff there that was a sketchy one all right if you're on console do not panic when you actually get to play at leas because I don't think it's working at the moment literally just take the site off because I can't London I can't hit a barn door that four times ten times variable scope on any of the snipers art success we got our epic a Ruby charm we got the obviously start the story mode the occupational hope I know that sorry this is odd that the pace what how do you even say that but how on earth do you say that word Oh sip it'll occup it'll this is a CC uh I'll keep it on is that a natural word am I an idiot physical analogical connection Center for entire assembly delivered constant conditioned power to cause pass through channel for direct data between cores and an encryption sub but note at for the hub itself holds motifs of processing locally interfaced and translated between host structure was structures for locomotion and then of course we also get story chapter to the detach a chaperone so the game that I have for you today was from my rank to grind this season I'm not entirely convinced I'll push all the way to masters we'll have to see who I can team up with because I'm so far away I didn't really play ranked the last two splits I've been demoted all the way down to iron it's extremely sad down here explain it yes then I told myself I just I just rush everyone you don't get punished entirely it's always impossible to lose RP here in fact I'm not actually sure you can so their mentality you may as well just for send people and have fun with it so I've got a ton of damage in the game now I have for you today so I'm sure you'll enjoy it so thanks for watching and I'll see you all in a five and a half seconds my friends all right break flag disease my friends and I'm okay that's the course of his well Annie's coming over wait did have a diamond trail I'm pretty sure I had a diamond trail it's okay Tom confidence to come in because I know I could sting to the loot on my teammates on with me here I know two defendants by myself I think that can have half my health by using Simms as well they come I just it's not interested I can't see gosh on things with design cycle thank you god I hate that feeling that feeling when you know you just one shot it just need to tickle you Tim's got a revive nice I'm going down to you guys I was struggling down there I'll be honest I know I could sting to the loot but the link wasn't that good I mean there's a costing that's going off every single Avenue you need to take precautionary measures by precautionary I mean get the hair can freak out of their measures just retreat get back to the team I assume they're providing healing up in there as well most probably doing the same thing definitely not going to use any shield have nothing there we go speak of the devil I'll be able to heal up here is well my team and they say they'll have to swing G's after this why dost serene Joe's that they would say there you go sinners on playing octane I'll you know jock bit of the espanol in the vocab I need some covering fire adding work whenever I can flank them there's a back entrance of right laps but I have to have to get around this this war like an attack on Titan over here before you get excited if you are a big attack on Titan fan I think I've seen three episodes I still freaked out by the few times I'll be honest tickets no I couldn't sleep properly just freaking out I should have saved my ultimate I would be able to jump over these gosh Narwhal now my teammate said you know tv3 I think another team's scrapping over here as well but hopefully we can just ignore them it's like this right portal team I think me way longer than he should have I do not play knock times that very reason though you can just screen set past every one of rate labs and get the loot it's a decent I'll strategy unfortunately I was against a caustic and my teammates there weren't there with me I had to do solos or trig to maneuver but you know the premise got worked I still got to the league faster then all right who put did you bots with them who was the little brother that did that he was down here somewhere we're inside the next ring I don't think they're selling cookies now I can't see there's a hologram in the way he spends one shot though you can see there you go onto the course if I'm not going in there nice fire it's a caustic with a pub leave on this be quiet honestly I'm minding our we got a shield battery off the Dean who's we teammate I don't get any of those I think either Oh mr. entirely maybe God finally it's great of course it is one of my favorite not caustic science is why obtains one of my favorite characters the moments how are you last one we've one second friend make sure I got the healer balls I'll come and get you well we took all right five minutes of high now vice and unfortunately I don't get any of the kilt oh it's alright I think I'm gonna stick with my run up people until we find a gunfight strategy sin SBR in iron rank I mean even if we die now I've got sick oh sorry I've got 78 RP act on zhibing Z with Z there we go I don't know how this always happens but it does I go in search the fights and my teammates stay put and somehow they manage to find people for I do I don't know how to happen Shirley statistically I'd be more likely to find people but no somehow it's not how it works [Applause] turn around Romania that's an absolutely energy to turn around on me I said yesterday no more bamboo sauce and unfortunately I've just want to decoys from Earthwise ultimate I could hear I could hear footsteps but I must have in the race behind the wall you just got a fire where the gunshots are coming oh sorry weather footsteps are coming from unfortunately I was doing bamboozled it's it's so difficult though March is so good name he's so distinctively so sneaky sly it's price how much of a book they gave you lyfe you're pretty much every aspect of Mirage now like twice as good as it used to be I need to play more of anything else this is incredibly fun when you've been basil someone I don't think there's a bad thing on this game it just made a mockery of someone you just you just dis them here on the battlefield all right I've got four kills and four assists but I did hear gunshots going off this way all right there are four squads left and every single of us as a 14 to 3 this should be kicking off here soon here we go it's my favorite thing nice machinist perhaps the psychopath hit you hit me a little bit what I haven't and thought this is it this guy's going down there we go as long as using descriptive reins on he sends enough oh my gosh that is terrifying alright times I've been just down the hill from a three-man sniper squad our help is it's not the best place to be a team look here we go the people distracted they're gonna third parties are they now say hey look I'm tempted to bring this way I saw myself I was gonna play like a like a lunatic because it is iron rank and it's it's very difficult to rank down from iron let's be honest here I'm gonna go for it that's pretty here look here there's any two squads left so now is the good time to regroup with the squad that wasn't as bountiful as I thought it was going to be I thought it's gonna rocket behind all three of them that team got decimated some here and I stood up top they still have high ground I love that that's what I wanted to do way off in the distance like Lord cucarachas once more okay that's not please stop I've got a why think I don't have I'm saying hey I'm after like unfortunately turns out I've got to Phoenix piece that have been useful to know beforehand before use the shield battery anything persons in the way our homes down antenna been involved for six my French renew but sometimes you just gotta fall send it there we go solutely toxic nachos maybe a little bit too toxic this wasn't even the sniper team on the help those causing miss issues this was the this was the third party I think without I feel like I think so much damage that game but I mean cuz to get ice I think without kill the end yeah okay okay three thousand seven so I did get a decent damage there good because the kills team reflecting somehow I didn't get any sort of kill credit that game but Rankin quick in Iraq I only gear shaft at the team we're a good little cohesive unit strain to the next one I guess thanks for watching I'll see you on the next one [Music]
