it was a cottage reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I got the 4k damage badge on Wraith was a really fun game but before we get into the gameplay I actually have a short sponsored intro here thanks to LG this my friends is the new LG C 10 OLED TV it comes in a variety of sizes including 48 55 65 and 77 inch models and LG have very kindly sent me this 65 inch model and my word this is a beautiful TV the display combines the best of TVs high-end image quality and a lightning fast response times and refresh rates needed to compete Moore's game in as well first of all let's talk about the gaming spec C it's a 4k 120 Hertz display that's 120 Hertz at 4k resolution I had to hook up my PC and run some games at 4k to test the saves it's a simple HDMI to put one cable into the back and there you are done then his first game please Assassin's Creed Odyssey and as you can see in the settings it's running at the 4k resolution and 120 Hertz refresh rate that we were expecting now while some gameplay is running the background here let's talk about the image quality itself this is an LG OLED TV which means that each pixel is self lit this translates into perfect black levels and sharper contrasts typical TVs don't feature the self lit pixel technology which means they're even images which are supposed to be pitch black still have that glow around them the LG OLED technology on the screen allows you to not transmit any life through these individual pixels it just turns them off when needed so after playing some Assassin's Creed I wanted to test this screen out with apex and legends a fast-paced competitive FPS game where the right equipment can give you a big advantage of your enemies any silky-smooth the response time is great for the fresh greatest grade to the image quality is outrageous I refresh rates have always been difficult to show my camera here is record of 4k but can only manage 25 FPS at least quality you don't get to see the true smoothness of the game players all through my camera oh and this TV by the way is also the world's first g-sync compatible TV this gives you all games Lester to let flickr combine this feature with a low input lag and you can tell this TV was built with gaming as a focus and they've even said that free sync may come up with a future software update as well in terms of sound quality this TV benefits from the AI acoustic tuning which understands a space of range or TV and alters the sound accordingly I have a high-end sambar and I forgot that it wasn't even plugged in you don't need one the sound quality on this TV is really really good and it also comes with all of your favorite apps included such as twitch so when you're not gaming on this TV you can use it to watch other people game instead it's a perfect setup so in conclusion either screen is great mix of the near perfect image quality you've come to expect from LG TVs and a gaming specs on these are outrageous especially when you consider that both the next gen consoles which are releasing later this year are rumored to be running at both 4k and 120 Hertz options this screen will be a perfect choice and if you're interested in finding out more there is a link in the description you can follow to the product page so thank you once more to LG for sending this beautiful TV out to me it was a much needed upgrade so as I said the links or the details will be in the description but I've got a four and a half thousand damage game for you on rathe unlocking that 4k badge and I hope

idea was this bit sharper a background here as well she's always a terrifying no he's popped on friend I'm good it's a struggle town at the moment I'm afraid fell over this way to let's gonna get three kills not point really okay he's resin he's down for it I believe in you Ben and their wallet they're running off nice you've damn one it's bought some time for the revival I've got a Phoenix as well all right I have no idea how that guy's has been me like that just appeared on my screen out of no way no he knew where I was he's broken again revving reviving raising resurrecting it's a weird one I don't know which one to say off-time they are this guy it is so gosh-darn to the climate Isidro should have reloaded before I threw the ark style because I see the ark size is gonna force him eight and then I should be there ready to shoot I'll mess it up entirely so he's not gin nativist there's another squad I say we can just ok these presents right if you got hit by anything there's some fresh level one there I said was get involved he friend not really do too much 94 where did the smoke come from imagine trying to hear right with an aria 45 the strength is just too quick it's way too fast there's not much you can do with that set the same revenant you music I've send you back to your totem the gentleman's agreement is less everyone just chill out for a second that may be a different squad squads stand an icicle encaustic ultimate heed gasps absolutely do I insist another team over this way though it appeals if I know if hist DUI wants them as well suck they are so upset at the moment hey teammate I have are you put that on I'm sick of these people I'm sick of it I feeling for like 300 already at least hold upon nature strength mess him up get him like any third party someone's trying to steal our kills here we've been bopping them thank you like your seats all right nice work b7 he's actually late I can't believe that he's been nerved you know he used to be better than this somehow that's not good that's a people change here needs to heal up a little bit I just really just get some high ground I've got my Phoenix for you Phoenix get here are you quite useful someone's rushing terrible fight what am i doing I'm rock climbing teammates run they try and get to safety and we'll help and one piping that's not good in both parties unfortunately Montana sure he was able to pick up the [Applause] the Phoenix came afraid turn it over yet spinning around baseball see ya try to rush me I've got a 2 x 4 x g7 scope teammate the storms coming in these guys have to heal this is the best time for us to push them this job here keeping them back at we machine those are did you care for your facts proving the oken here Oh tickle just freeze troubles you know 20 here right with that strength from this range you can't you can't even aim like this so this with the g7 the buddies travel so slow you just gotta fire in that general direction it's not pray nothing oh I think I just got wing man hey tried but longest fight of all time why is that this was Oh God I'm in town what's my teammate it's got they've sent extra speed try and get to cover I only cover you this angle the flatlines so good the flower is one of the best close range weapons on the game like it's just it's just beefing it's just hit you know you can hit shots at the o99 and you can do about 12 damage you know you hear a chakra flatline the fun mony Catholic it's the big difference between the two asana online has a high potential price range because it will kill you faster than a flatline puss you don't need to hit all your shots with the flatline to get the job done something good this way all right that's the longest gun five whole time that might have been him even five minutes potentially that doesn't look good seem 800 offence that one popping off I don't even reload the g7 scale okay we can just get a different angle on it so I'm not interested in pushing the doughnut with all the Watson fences around hopefully she'll slow why'd you searches my teammates here we go he's gone over there he's gonna impede up there we go field trip enter the prom nice playing and I don't know where he is I came from this way on a third party I selves are there already set back up are they they've already got their fences and everything lost that's a shame I think there's a trap around here I didn't even get you in Pina there's no way they've got MP teammate I'm not wishing that why did he send so close that's him behind us has to move anyway we must move beforehand the g7 by the way it was it was actually such a good nerve that they did to it they reduced opposite the speed of the projectile projectile Steven which means that when a target is running in the distance like that it's actually kind of difficult to hit them but it's still a good gun like I think it's a good balance these guys have to move like the bots and course of people but let's get this caustic sorry to get the cryptogenic own futures what are you doing stop shooting me I'm shooting the caustic in a red race still don't know which one know what these guys are doing I am dead Word icon do
