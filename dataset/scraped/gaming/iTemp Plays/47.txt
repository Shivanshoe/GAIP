hey what's up guys it's ridge welcome back to another video today we are playing apex legends of course we are back here in season 13 and i am using a gun that has been in the care package for many a season it has just come out it is of course this bit fire of course they nerfed the spitfire when it came to the care package because you don't want a care package weapon on the floor that would be ludicrous but if you didn't know in season 13 respawn did like a blanket nerf on lmgs it hit the devotion the spitfire the rampage and the l star and the spitfire even though i got nerfed like doubly it was like a double nerf like coming out of the care package and it had the blanket lmg nerf you can see on screen some of the stats they did they decreased the damage by one uh they reduced the capacity a little bit they increased the five spread and they did a load of other smaller things like draw time holster time race time and lower time despite all of these this bitfire is still incredibly good i think this is such a good gun if you've tried this let me know what you think about this weapon because if i didn't read these nerfs beforehand i would have thought that it was just as good as before it went into the care package hopefully you guys are enjoying season 13 as much as i have been thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm going right he's doing there is absolutely nothing you can do about it there is nothing i'm going to ride the door why am i new york servers man what am i doing to myself here so hard to loot i think some get picked up i'm skipping i need to restart you've got to remind me guys remind me to restart please actually i want a close range again all right i'm good i'm down to certain people oh some rampant chills the fellow of rampart enjoy it over this way i agree i thought i was going to get kill credit for that my game is skipping it's not the video you're good it's my game reloading cover so bad that was a kill leader last one in the squad yes uh nice i think tim i got that that's fine all right i guess we got like cascades oh that's huge didn't i already pick up a level two heavy mag i mean i guess not you never know with this game it's on your gun it's off your gun who knows nobody does i am untouchable impenetrable i don't know how much i would have landed on him 50 shots left grenade watch good job team i kind of scared that for a second all right sometimes you can just shoot right the way through the new guys i forgot what his name is i need this there we go you can just shoot right the way through it takes a while even with a sheila he's almost impenetrable he's ultimate what's his name newcastle there you go i really can't focus on more than one fingerprints i am there is something wrong with me a bow a long bow i'm tempted like this grab that let's look at the bk one in the distance doesn't look too scary so you can come out of hiding he was in there pretty sure i saw him running about there you go they might just be shooting prowlers though oh it doesn't sound like it tossing up some amps covered oh my god this guy behind him what gun is this vaults huge sheila's kind of busted like man if you can catch someone slightly unawares they are just screwed i need to stop doing that and then moving past it because if someone flanks us from behind i'm giving them a free sheila turret and it's terrible that is a terrible idea not sheila tory i really can't think ah oh my god teammate thank you oh god [Music] good thinking quick thinking mates [Music] straight in here is one grenade tell me one of that was all right there's a nade on that door okay i don't really have any bullets nice looks like we killed the champion oh my god they're shooting at me we're already inside i'm struggling i see an enemy and there's beans over here on lucid i'm gonna go here for a second we'll take a little little cheeky peek yep i have my old say but hold on i need to heal i'll come over over there she's probably put it over here yeah yeah yeah definitely i'm recharging shields it's nice and heavy for you actually i've got to wing my name do you need a wingman i don't know where my downwind is exceptional she might push me now let's see what they left us yeah yeah i'm gonna pop it i'm gonna pop it here i'm gonna pop it pop it up oh my god pop it this guy fell he's just on the ground is he down i think that might be my no he's not down he's here alive and well oh that's your damn right there are you down there yeah i'm down here look at all the loot don't take my loot hold on i'm trying to help you we're not taking nothing there's they literally have nothing i didn't even use the i mean i can't i can't even get back up there yeah yeah you're struggling there's a rope here though i think there's a team down here maybe target down like here or something i don't know i dance more like further that way this way let's go oh did you need those okay sorry i only have five how many do you have uh okay here's the mark thank you it's looting uh he's letting i'm skipping all over the place man he's up top let's glitching all over the place get it together i think he's a bangalore i don't know maybe i did never know i have two bats if you need one um jump driver activated [Laughter] wait that's the second time and she didn't even do the little finger wag look i'm glitching all over the shop mate this game hates me today what means no lava's just always broken no no no it's not no you don't understand i'm i'm actually just skipping another place i'm 120 ping skipping look that's not working that's not working i don't i don't think you're used to the loba experience night they're on me they're not me they're on me i thought wait what reloading throwing an archers i broke one of those not the big guy okay on the left side there's one hp i'm situated i think it's valkyrie no she's below she wasn't talk i fell by accident it's okay indeed are you good yeah yeah just chasing this off then i might die don't die don't die please okay i hate someone else i hear someone else yeah there's still a there's still more up top healing somebody's shooting me at the charge right oops open up shop and shut them down there's one i'll take a phoenix as well i guess oh they are mad yeah they do not like that okay i was broken nice oh i'm going to get stunned nice job this is the one in the middle yeah yeah i nearly got stung by that stupid thing survived wingman here okay i saw someone sound twisted this before it wasn't good but i'm pretty sure it's good it's just easy yeah it could it can still probably have like half the damage it has now and still be decent yeah just because it has so many bullets yeah you can miss 90 and that 10 is still enough why do you think i like it yup that's literally your motto what's the matter uh if you can't hit 90 percent of a bullet just say 10 okay i'll give you that jump drive out just um the stinky thingy we've got a minute until the body shield here level four i need a bolt that's what i do need i have my old say we need to go back where we came and this place sucks so we're going to lose it man oh they are up there only one no they're not even on the roof so they're not safe there [Music] recharging here yep in fact i think i am getting 30. um yeah we can back up a little bit if you want we hold them i mean they're just going to take gravity yeah that's the thing that's going to take it i think there might be a team on the other side of me though they just yeah they're they're they're right here oh so i don't know if he's good ideas but he's just going to be by now we can just leave that part in at the other at the other one they're holding it i don't know how we're going to get past that if we need to we can always fall back through this spider cave you know we'll are they on the shields like i don't see them i don't see them either i guess they pushed i i don't know that's a lot of shooting though yeah they had to have well they stopped shooting i think they're just shooting prowlers there's boxes they might have killed this god i can't shame on that oh there's one on enemy down yeah yeah i'm swinging this way how does he have so much cover this is the most op rock i've ever seen i'm not with you nice like what my bad they can't really heal that much because they have to move yeah i'm just i'm just going up the hill so we don't get caught out there's still another team yeah i wanted that he just fried me okay i already thought they'd be distracted i have like an 85 heavy here you go you go dropped a little bit more thank you oh i don't want to i don't want to die no no this entire game we've been fighting people just on rocks i really want to use this no no through it then he's on my doormat he's popping a battery now [Laughter] that's heavy so many ramparts oh my god they're everywhere they have uh they're just chilling in those shields too nearly broken recharging my shields so yeah dude that angle it's horrendous yeah just play this i play this side yeah hold on i need to heal if they don't push it on on that side okay you can play these uh these rocks over here yep this is so annoying yeah dude this angle is so bad is there any way we can like go around yeah can we match them around my head oh god i wish i had some knights dude this is giving me a headache it's an angle i don't know what's gonna be in here but i made some lobby yep i got an ark star i've got a knocks on a thermite and if you need heavy let me know if i have 150. [Music] what's up the pathfinder was absolutely terrified of peeking tear off i mean maybe he had no shields left or something i don't know but good grief i played oh a 22 minute banger
