hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that i have for you today was completely unexpected we only had one random teammate and we didn't even land close to each other and we're in trios but somehow we made it work we overcame all odds kind of we did a ton of damage this game and it was a great one i hope you guys enjoy thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends remember eyes on the prize all right the game's decided that we do not deserve a uh we don't deserve a third teammate so let's just try and get some kills hello yes go 30 30. i appreciate it someone's burning someone's getting fried up oh is this above me just popping off for the 30 30. hey should he fired recharging shields i mean these are my kind of fences right here that's the kind of fence i've placed down look i'll keep this team out alive how about that there we go it's your boy triple trees he was kind of popping off with the uh one moment gotta use the phoenix game more first because if he killed me if he won the 1v1 he gets to revive his teammates then i mean he was afk i probably should have it's the bangalore oh that's the bangalore where did she confront me down oh what does my game freeze on steam this never used to happen to me on origin get back here hey you've tried this you've rocked up on me twice and twice you've ran away you're gonna have to you have to commit to something you've at least brought me a battery come on i like your style hey thanks i appreciate that listen we're far away from each other but the comms are still good these guys are still scrapping over this way let's try and play this careful unfortunately i've got a wingman so i can sort of sit far away do some poke damage frag out don't drive out this thing in command center hello this is the tactic of shoot a down guy once and then he starts screaming are you on the same team or are you separate teams your separate teams good not a good spot that can both see me i need to let these guys fight a little bit i'm being too much of a nuisance let me small hill yeah you shoot the damn guy once and they need to start screaming at his teammates for um for assistance right he's in command center to be honest i think there is very little chance we are going to meet up yeah that should be the end i'm pretty gonna die here as well let's go out in some glory can i please reload please i have messed this up tremendously okay i suck i didn't get the shield bats now these guys are rocking up gonna steal on my loot i could have stayed but the only bit of decent cover there was that little courtyard and i was looting down low those guys would have had the ultimate do you see them the ultimate high ground on the team it's making a bit of a move for it to be fair i don't think these guys are going to chase because there was about eight boxes i assume they want to loot up i definitely need a heavy mag for my b man nice teammate okay you kill everyone over there i'll kill oh there we go i'll kill everyone over this way we'll meet up we'll have a cup of tea we'll have a chat and then we will win the game i don't know if i even want to fight these guys to be honest they're going to be up top it's gonna be difficult to push there could be three of them i don't have any big heels keep running teammate we can meet up that way i've got my ultimate and i can go i got grappling 20. careful though because scuba dubert is in the feed and i've heard a lot of stories about scuba dubat you do not want to cross paths with that man okay change of plans let's meet in the water i'm on the way amigo voi n camino me amigo oh my word we have reunited they said it couldn't be done hello lobo are these people chasing i think i think we get high ground they might get overeager thinking it's a solo we're still top on the cliff with our nomad wingman that is a fighter cascade you fill up a little bit on maize or try and load when i got up i got a light mag i need a heavy mag desperately hey got a bat and only my inventor was four before so i didn't get that back from the other guy i've got an evo all right let's get let's let's buy these two let's get them i see an enemy over there okay they're running away from the fight yeah yeah why wouldn't you just run on earth instead this makes a lot of sense guys thank you oh my god oh you've messed that up you've messed that up tremendously don't worry i thought her footsteps right on my rock was that a separate team yes don't worry i'm here they're on the rooftop i think all right i'm not going to loot this close box timmy can i switch that grab themselves whatever's in there careful oh my word batteries that's way too far okay we'll send the forest on fire between us three thermites back up a little bit just enough for these guys to start fighting each other then shoot them in the back that's that strategy and that is the strategy we are sticking with it's not honorable shooting people in the back but listen we are a duo in a trio lobby and we are getting blue down yep you're coming this way that's tremendous i appreciate that recharging shields okay i'm not in cover i agree i'll run that tail giving my shields a recharge position revealed by ash hopefully that's a team that was up top i'm repairing myself i'll make them come this way and i'll shoot this team in the back this is quite even though this is like low ground this is quite a decent place to run off to because if they take the rope or if they fall off the cliff they're in such a terrible position i'll be going in here heavy mac please i'm so desperate i don't even have a barrel your saved my mind's got a brand new bag going in the side seams oh they're rushing as well that's going around the side that's just way too long hello okay teammates just opened the door when this guy's pre-aiming it with a charged pk but i guess even if you got me i have 11 kills how has this happened this is the game that i've played today that i've given the least that i've taken the least serious okay functioning this guy's down low is it reminds you of revenant he can just climb up if he wants to might be good to see on the roof teammate or you can kill him you are the best okay goodbye thanks for playing recharging i put it as a self-revive because i don't know where the last one would be don't mind you've got a blue knife rager amigo amigo sat back with a sniper way too far back maybe he was telling him not to push into zone you know he was trying to play positioning his teammates were playing like you do in these public games and i don't think he's happy with them either i think there's a big disagreement in the in the clan there life's good two squads left we just wait for them to fight we use my ultimate we get in there and we shoot them in the back it's to shoot them in the black tactic it serves well so far and i hope it will continue to serve as well i cannot believe we made it this far into this game i thought this was going to be like a quick two minute uh start of the game where i could have to go and try and find a win after this toward the end of it that was what i was hoping for that was best case scenario but look at us thriving where's your footsteps you sound like an octane they're dropping a replicator i don't want to go around that way i think we just go this way instead i don't want to get griefed by prowlers i really don't that doesn't sound like fun we're not in a rush these guys aren't firing let's play it's safe it's not safe something good this way no freaking over we gotta use care package it looks like people have been there target spotted there's someone over there these guys are running the sea i've got a crypto they're going to see us coming i reckon we go this way there's a good chance there's a team here to the safe and we don't want to get pinched nevermind i was completely wrong never trust your instincts you know just turn up just whatever anything to tell you to do do the complete opposite no it's a few situation again set the back sniping he absolutely doesn't care at all and i'm not easily impressed who's ready to fly on a zip line i am only one other squad kill that team there's three of them they're on the race giving my shields a recharge this isn't easy i need them to rush me because it's the 3v1 here they come did you get here okay oh it was so close how long was that crypto on the rock because i heard him claim about 20 seconds before he shot me i think he was trying to let the mirage kill me i'm pretty sure he was just there as like an insurance policy oh i'm so close he said sorry bro that's not it's not really his fault he was a 2v3 they had armor switches i think he saw my robe and he thought i was rushing in i don't really care about the 4k badge i've already got one i'm still counting as a 4k who cares man i still shake in those moments gg good game
