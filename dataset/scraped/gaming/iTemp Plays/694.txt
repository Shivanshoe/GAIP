so today we're going to be taking a look at what i believe to be the best new low days in war zone after a bunch of gun balance changes it's a bit of a weird one but before we get into that i'm really happy to let you guys know that this video is sponsored by nvidia and i have been sent a pallet geforce rtx 2070 super js edition it's one of the latest gpus from pallet they can hear to 1080p 144 fps plus in warzone it features a two fan design and support for pallets of thunder master software which lets you easily monitor and overclock your gpu to get the best performance now pc has always had some great advantages over consoles in terms of game performance but the two player bases have for the most part always been split up however the new norm in gaming at the moment is cross-platform and warzone is no different i'm playing pc with a controller and many of your favorite content creators are doing the same thing because it gives you advantages in so many aspects on warzone specifically consoles don't have access to the field of view slider so you can't see as much around you you don't have the graphics options to optimize your performance you can't play high refresh rate such as 120 144 or 240 hertz and even with these differences matchmaking is based on whether your controller or mouse and keyboard and not which platform you're playing on you can see here in the pre-game lobby of the solos game that i was in everyone that i'm playing against is locked at a lower refresh rate and field of view because they're on consoles yet we are in the same lobby it's actually kind of crazy so for reference here fps is the number of frames your pc can send out per second and refresh rate is how frequently your monitor's panel refreshes to display the latest frame which is measured in hertz let's take a closer look on screen of what the fps differences translates to in game here we have the 60 144 and 240 fps comparisons and you can see immediately a huge difference between the 60 and the other two options it's harder to track these enemies as the image isn't as smooth and it actually increases your reaction time to something happening in game because you don't get fed that information as quickly as someone playing at the higher refresh rates now youtube shows videos at 60 frames per second as a maximum so showing the massive impact that the higher refresh rates have is only possible by slowing the videos down this doesn't give you the true experience of playing on these increased settings you'll only know when you'll try it out for yourself and believe me it will blow your mind too so to play these increased settings you will need a gpu that is capable of keeping up that is where nvidia and pallet comes in i've been using their products in my pc builds for over 10 years now and i've never been disappointed on screen here you can see the capabilities of each gpu with a recommended 144 fps benchmark the 2080 ti runs away with it it's their flagship gpu but both the 2070 super and the 2060 super will provide you with the necessary power to start dominating at these higher settings all of my warzone videos on my channel have been with a pc on controller and for good reason today i'm using the panic 2070 super running at 1080p 144 fps as you can see and there is a link in the description to pallet's range of geforce rtx gpus you can go and explore find the one that suits you and watch your kd start rising my friends so moving on to the best class in war zone here i'm going to be showing you two guns that are using overkill the main weapon is the bruin of course this gun is dominant at the moment it's really really annoying to unlock but it's definitely worth the grind and these are the attachments that i use they are the monolithic suppressor the vlk three times sight the stipple grip tape the 60 round mags and the commando 4 grip it's a pretty standard brewing class but whenever i use the vlk three time slice i always have to run a close range gun in overkill for building rushing the gun of choice here is actually the foul and the attachments are the monolithic suppressor the osw power barrel the attack laser the monocle reflex sight and the merc 4 grip and this is a little different to what most people use as their foul smg class they usually use the no stock attachment and they don't use a sight and this turns into an incredible super close range almost like a shotgun this gun is so powerful but the trade-off there is that it's a little bit harder to hit those shots they're a little bit further away and this is all personal preference i've always preferred the easy to control smgs such as the mp7 which are still usable at a little further distance and i've basically tried to make my file viable from medium range and closer which is the perfect accompaniment to using your main gun with a three-time sight on it in my opinion so i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we jumped a little bit late so let's go there yeah i've got this one no no loads of people close one those people close one all right go you have one then there's someone's coming here too a lot of people i'm going to this one all right yep choice third choice it seems like you'd when i would ask if you want to play [Music] [Laughter] sorry that was about me you guys are my third choice i have someone else i was playing with and then i asked someone else and they went to bed and now i'm here it's very sad for me not really coming down i'm gonna drop him on monday oh okay i'll get it i'll get it i'm not playing oh yeah oh wait unique i'm gonna drop behind this building as you saw i'm coming in [Applause] someone did it on the

nearly then there isn't [Applause] is pushing him oh god no there's people behind that way too carefully they're both one more chocolate chocolate choking striking fill off his armor careful coming over this hill because i got shot by these buildings nice job guys i got shot by people on the buildings or in the buildings not by the buildings themselves come on i think it might be in the hill we came from you know i got shot definitely from this way and i just want to make sure that you can rotate round okay oh yeah this way this way this way he's coming over this way too two people both crack both cracked i can't be that way yet [Applause] how can he see me the one's dead only have three plates look i just can't see anyone you good actually i see him he came a little bit i'm checking
