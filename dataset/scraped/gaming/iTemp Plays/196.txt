hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing a corrido who i think is the hardest legend to get right you can be a great asset for your team clearing out traps and fences doing 150 damage on a team for a great engage all you can just become a drum pilot and your team is down in member i'm somewhere between the two i think i'm very reluctant to use my drone unless i have my ultimate ability and i think this is the golden rule whilst playing crypto so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends uh it's pretty busy amigos i don't know if you want to land over there i mean we were the team that could see everyone else landing there why would you still want to land there i don't i don't understand i feel bad for sort of leaving him but at the same time kind of a tough place to to spawn in and try and get some loot you know very tough i'm coming back there's more to loot here but oh god ah not little fate a little crypto fee i'm a crypto that's not even full shields but i'm still coming over yeah get out of there teammate if you need to hello goodbye need your armor sorry oh my god you're purple what a demon i'm gonna use this for a second if you don't want to get caught no that's not what i wanted to draw he's not pretty but we are still alive there's i don't have to stun a purple on this uh yeah look at that oh they're gonna rob it with no they're gonna steal it look here number three evil shield here level three what an absolute save that was i don't know where you were getting shot from yeah repair the damages and then think the enemies it's a two-step process believe it or not oops that was too that was too aggressive come on what died reloading so this are a different fight i'm trying to overcome it here i need to turn around and help where are my bullets [Music] that was horrendous just a few this will do thank you thank you hold on one of them over there there is a new kill leader there's a new king sorry how was he oh i thought his box was blue for a second how was he blue that guy had seven kills
