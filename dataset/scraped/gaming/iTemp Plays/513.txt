hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the best mobile legend in the game and it's not even close octane if you aren't aware he got a massive buff to his ultimate which makes it far more versatile for your entire team if you slide into the jump pad it takes you further horizontally but if you run into it from a standing position it still gives you that super jump mechanic from before now combine this with the one health per second regen the regular sized hitbox and not being a low profile legend octane is twice as good as pathfinder and as an ex pathfinder main that does make me sad to say but i do love me some octane now as well so thank you for watching i do appreciate it please be sure to sub to the channel to help me reach one million subs this apex season and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends and then those are the guys that like we mess with for 10 minutes and then they kill it they like okay um no i didn't loot up top though if you want to go like up top the top thank you they're over here i do like how the north side of map is like interesting is dead oh no that box just went in the weirdest place no dude just purple armor are you kidding me when i blew but i made mine oh okay okay sort of tough it's not tough i'm chilling i'm just healing enough he's just gonna get his teammates banner he's right on my door he's right here come on come on do the guys come across as well nice knocked down because i'm pretty sure that's the teammate of one of the guys i killed no i hear teammate we've got one minute and the ring is far i don't know where yeah oh i can't get out of there nice that was my last i mean i just need shield deals that's it um the shield cells will be fine thank you nice dude that was stressful most special moment my entire life every kind of slacking are they both sitting there either right i think so dude the either eight was i i thought it was amazing before so i'm i'm all about it i don't have a shotgun honestly it's it's kind of it's weird to use it's it's too um i the thing about controllers is i think a gun like that is way too situational yeah because on mouse and keyboard i mean you can you can get into like a close range situation and i mean you can still do a lot with a with a weapon like that close range but like on on controller close range you're not doing anything at all like you can you can hit flicks and stuff like that with uh with that weapon on the mouse and keyboard but you can do it on controller it's true it's very true damage right now um 794 are you kidding me no i'm 468 i was thinking there's no way you've got more damage to me than that fight because they were chasing me so i was the one in the gunfights you know i was i was trying to chase them chasing you pretty much wait oh they're ripping up i think he tried to go down and he sent him back there don't worry definitely dude leader how about that give him my shield oh my god full shot's dead i'm the best repeater it does it genuinely does from like it has a similar sound vibe you know oh i need some shotgun if you find please oh that guy might have had something oh yeah this guy did get him over here oh my god the that was the last one these like these games are so weird aren't they going on isn't the pace of these games just so weirdly strange that the third parties in the way we get like pushed are just so odd i i've never seen anything like it i mean i guess you didn't realize we were up there i mean i i i'm a i feel like it has to be the uh the damage counter just like changing the way people play mine's 128. at you i'm a thousand sixty-eight get right oh you're not a thousand and sixty-eight no you're not absolutely annihilated no you're not that's a lie i'm going down resume please raise me rich i need help uh we will need to run such a bad spot oh yeah you just take way too long to kill your kill switch you take a sport just farm that damage at the end of the game by the time you actually finish your kills we're getting the 15th party and then we're dead so i got it i have to clean it up for you i have to honestly yeah maybe that someone's coming in i'm the cleaning man i am like aggressively fast with the way i thirst people oh where did that come from in the head all right go behind him without me oh guns that i would not assume that i'd be that good with actually i assumed i'd be good with the repeater but yeah i feel like you should be good with the repeater i thought i should be i'm not really that good uh i have eight bats i'm dropping some bats i mean i have to but i'm kind of lazy to go back i'm already in it i will i'll pick these back up because i've i think entry slots i don't know what i need my adventure is a mess i feel like i don't take that much damage with uh with mirage because i have to play off my decoys destroyed have you been basil franken i'm on the way i'm on the way i got your bats i have a gold helmet um which is kind of bad on octane but then i've got a pad right so no just use it for your pad you can just crank pads like every 30 seconds just throw them as soon as you get them let me know if you see some tracking rounds i'm pretty sure there would have been someone there and it's probably a shocking shell not around uh yes i will indeed let you know that close they're inside yeah they're inside or at least one is oh another team of the team gonna wrap all the way around sometimes you gotta know when to dip i i literally just talked about how i don't take damage with mirage and then i just took like 500 damage in 30 seconds eight teams that's it yeah i say we are professionals nice i'm wrapping around chasing him i've got eleven either eight shots for one team that could work right i'm gonna quickly check for like mags and stuff there's only one team left careful okay that's why i'm gonna check like gold mags there's no way no one has a gold there's a godlike one in there in the bin next to that are you using that yes you are um i have a purple oh you said gold oh yeah yeah if you could see uh do you see that bin that i pinged here in the in the oh yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you my cat aries has jumped up on my desk and he's literally staring me in my face do you want something like that come on come on there you go watch that face come on now it's funny she's just looking at me like are you talking to me i i still i still crack up at the uh one video with your cat on your thumbnail that one just it just the way the way she looked just was so she just looks so funny to me in the thumbnail she's great she'd heard them crown nature there when that cat was in the back garden falling down i was trying to get did i tell you i was trying to get my bin back in and she was sound tough and she was just slapping me i went to another game and we're not saying hello to her the first time she was making like high pitch noises which i thought were like affectionate and then she's waiting closer to back off yeah she's trying she's quite crowded that's funny [Music] pretty sure you're here that's crazy that's actually wild he just sticks he took me yeah he stuck me oh my god he was sitting here for ten minutes dude it was a big boy play and i tell you what if he was solidly solo he wins so are the apex champions yeah but still how is that fun how do you how do you have fun sitting there for 10 minutes i nearly killed him i was so close i heard [Laughter] i love available
