hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got the launch trailer for season 12 of apex legends defiance and i must say this season looks amazing we aren't getting a new gun but we are getting a completely new mode which is a 9v9 we'll talk about that in a little bit uh we're getting a new way to play the game a new legend whose kit i think i'm going to really enjoy and we see olympus returning to apex but it's a little bit different this time around so let's start off with the new mode it's a 9 control mode with three flags that you need to hold to score points of the opposing team now this is a classic mode and it's my bread and butter i cannot wait to play this you do respawn after death so you can just rush around you can have fun you can get into more gunfights and practice without having to re-cue like you do on the battle royale mode now the maps look amazing on here as well it's spread across all four of our base battle rail maps so plenty of variation there too now in the trailer you see two pathfinders on the same team so you can have multiple of the same legends fighting alongside each other but there must be a limit imagine a team of nine caustics or nine gibby's or 9 of anyone to be honest it would just be pure carnage i assume the limit is two or three now this control mode also has a new ratings leaderboard which looks like it's all right players in this mode overall and not just an in-game scoreboard though i'm not 100 sure on this as it is a casual mode it might just be an in-game scoreboard now i really think this mode will spark an offshoot of apex and we will see plenty more respawn modes i'm really excited for this next up we have mad maggie and we see more of her kit in action here many of you guys commented on my previous trailer video that her regular ability appears to go through cover and you guys were absolutely correct you cannot camp behind doors with maggie around as jimmy fire appears on the other side of cover and her ultimate is also shown here to be that wrecking ball once again causing chaos bouncing around into people but the part of her kiss that i'm most excited about here appears to be her passive it looks like she gets charged up it looks similar to bangalores where she gets a burst of speed and look at the animation of her picking up the mastiff i think she might just be a shotgun expert just like ram parties with lmgs and i love the mastiff looks like she gets a power boost with it i really cannot wait to try her out okay i had to return to this part of the video because her case was just announced her tactical ability is the right drill fire a drill that burns enemies through obstacles her passive ability is warlord's ire temporarily highlight enemies that you have damaged and move faster with the shotgun which is so good her ultimate ability is the wrecking ball throw a ball that releases speed boosting pads and detonates nearby enemies that sounds amazing next up we have olympus which if you saw the previous trailer got teleported somehow when it came through the other side of the teleportation device i'm really not sure what i'm talking about here some objects were not where they once were olympus is all muddled up it looks like it has far more cover which is amazing and definitely suits a legend like maggie who needs to get up close and personal to make use of her kit and more cover don't forget means more opportunities to use her cover exposing ability as well it's worth noting here that there is no red sky box above olympus as well which is great because olympus is already such a beautiful map now this season looks amazing and even though we aren't getting a new weapon we are getting tons of other content to look forward to we should also be getting the patch notes here somewhat soon i would expect so be sure to subscribe to the channel thank you for
