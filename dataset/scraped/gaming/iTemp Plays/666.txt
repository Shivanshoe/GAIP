hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so when we were playing earlier on i was playing with yanks it came up that in the replicators which is the crafting system you could make yourself a devotion with an extended mag and a turbocharger and when a gun is in the replicator they don't spawn in as for loot and then i realized there is a free legendary devotion in one of the bunkers near water treatment and if i went over there and got it for myself then i would have the only devotion on the entire map yes people could craft themselves one i'm not sure how many people would actually spend the time to do it but at least for the first or five minutes it was the only devo in the entire game and it was gold and i had it and it was a beautiful thing so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends bad you know so i've been very lazy and just like you fly because you are the superior that's good here you i i'm a little short but we got the balloon all good first blood i'm running over oh he's on foot i don't want someone to land here and steal my devotion and then turbo charged me you know no we couldn't do that do you want that i want no i don't want that to happen i was like like rich no no no no no that does not sound like a fun time it spit in my mouth oh i've never i've at least never been in here how much you're kind of excited all right where is the devotion come on people i don't know there's i don't think there's ever been a gold gun in that one no no no i got a comment and there was a reddit post yeah here we go you got it yeah yeah yeah yeah i got it and there's a charge station here too i have a skull piercer wingman and a mastiff oh this is good looks really nice let me know if you see any armor okay i mean it could be someone i'm carrying energy ammo for you too when you inevitably need more thank you um you know we could do we could make you oh i've got a i've got a level three shot involved for you by the way we could make you a watch a mccauley what's it called a devotion with a turbocharger in the in the replicator you're going to make me rich two devos who did what's wrong with that hey what's up i don't get it what's up oh no we're going to get banned give me my day that's not legal yeah i mean yeah it's kind of about i'll we'll let you we'll let you run the devo come take it it's like a bullet okay okay there's a new kill leader just another dude wait i dropped wait where did i put it i must have dropped it hold on thank you give me one sec i had a level three shotgun bob for you oh oh here is shotgun i wasn't thinking level three ready man we had some weird games on pc yesterday i'm telling you they play different to ps4 players they will well they do not not the most aggressive not the best players on here like obviously the best players just rush you but there are a lot of players that will just pick up a sniper and run away yeah it's weird like they're very patient i don't know how i don't know how they do it i yeah i can't help myself i'm just getting involved sometimes triple tape they're exceptionally good too like when it comes to like aiming with the sniper bro the weirdest thing ever is when you hit a hit a box right somebody's using a sentinel or something and you hit their box and they got like a four to eight in there and they're actually landing shots on you yeah it's like what is this who are you bless you oh big scrap big scrap unfortunately i've got level 1 shield so i'm probably going to go in and die so um i'm going to use you as base set up a shield and go crazy with you that's a good idea you could call that combo shield there oh i see what you did there yeah very clever no what just here oh god i'm scared oh yeah i think they're going to rip it now this gun is so stupid crack them on the left purple oh my that entire god it's a stupid gun i'm so sorry they're imbalanced no that was not this guy's got more of these i'm good right now they're spectating they knew they just knew they got aim assist gold devotion i can just tell yeah you can just feel it you know it's coming aim assist gold devotion it's the combo of dreams don't spectate me don't make me feel bad come on you wanted to run two of them you should feel bad wait let me check my banner i think i've got the stupid no no okay i thought i had mine like a bronze badge on and stuff and i'm running caustic like this is just the most toxic thing ever oh i stole these gold shields i literally didn't even reload like i'm i'm a new please don't spectate making me feel self-conscious i wish there was an option to get rid of spectator let me know that i've got spectators i don't like it i was practicing a thing that johnny shows me oh yeah this thing he does that all the time over there i suggest we do some research and he just goes yeah to go on the roof i don't know how he does it how does he do it it's hard it's easy to do it's easy to do on on pc but it's hard to do on it's hard to do on console what's that you hold square okay so you go square x x really fast square x x really fast oh this is a matte jump yeah square xx really fast so you basically it's a timing thing once you understand the timing you'll do it every single time so one square x twice one square x wise how just you just climbed up does that count nope yes it does they're still watching me mate they literally just watched me i don't even care i just square x twice yeah we keep colliding a little bit oh they're a big joke guys success it's hard to do on console i was trying to i was trying to do it when i was playing with so far the other day i was like check this out i can do this now and i couldn't do it i i don't know what's different on console but i don't know if it's even possible on console oh my god this guy's got it six times what is steven did you actually hit him uh yes four times okay i mean this is the definition of diving board like oh my word someone's close uh i got you bangalores one shot thanks one nice job y'all think you're gonna save us while we loot i don't think so nice uh you too that could have been catastrophic it really could have been bad oh you they actually hit i hate they have to come this way soon they have to come this way we'll get our revenge oh they stopped spectating because they just saw that i was just the best amos's controller devotion player they've ever seen he's cheated he's cheating oh wait he's just using a controller oh please push us they're going up the hill oh i'm gonna try and get that first come on yeah they're gonna be right in front of you go get em dude congratulations on an optimal conclusion oh it's gonna feel so satisfying killing this team i mean at least we know they have one gun that's like pretty much useless i haven't seen them at least you haven't seen them did i just get way too late no they're probably up here they probably went through this whole they're really this is what i mean they'll get they'll get a sniper and they will just run and they'll be ready for us here and they'll be still they'll probably be all inside of the map yeah there's another gold gun in this one i've discovered oh totally 100 percent you have a little cheeky look you can take it away this one's probably you said the triple tag oh i can't take that i can't i'd have to literally make some keyboard when i switch to the triple take yeah it has to be like a combo aim assist mouse and keyboard point and click yeah you become those guys oh there they are that's them oh yeah oh i'm getting happy i'm getting real excited to kill them jenks please don't kill me the last time i said tonight that i got destroyed and i was very upset they're both sniping me get a bread get it let's go i see ya the other team started peppering me so the rings i like how if you tea bag it brings up the quick option have you noticed that yeah yeah teabag look and it will give you the quiver option quick i didn't know that what oh hidden update do you like that one you want to get involved these are the last two teams it's great i was just chilling reading that it's amazing [Music] that is hilarious rich i'm going i got sheila at the ready it's not sheila shield that i'm ready for them i'm 10 red i came for a hundred oh timber 150 i'm knocked in his cats he's dead oh my word that's just gross that is so disgusting oh my word that was such a fun game i don't like not that much happened in like the mid but i know that was great that's what apex all about sometimes you gotta have the fun oh man i think i did four damage with that octane by the way i just looked at him through i just set up sheila and i shot him on the at the door and then i shot him through the window oh my word that is great and i went in there the lifeline was struggling she was in the gas too i'll just hit fire
