hey mr. Godsey to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing a bit of revenant in ranked use such a funnel legend to use because its ultimate allows you to play really aggressive without actually having to worry about the repercussions as much and in ranked especially towards the higher end which I am NOT in at the moment I mean platinum people start to play more and more defensive because that's the easiest way to get RP he silenced ability take some getting used to to use it effectively at least because even though you can use it whilst you're firing and even whilst you are aiming down sights it has an arc - it's like a grenade would so often do the land where you're shooting and you'd miss the target and it throws your aim off because you're trying to also land of silence it's a bit of a weed skill to get used to and I'm definitely not there yet now lifeline is also on so many teams of ranked at the moment because of how good she is at keeping the team alive and topped up with health and it's worth noting that revenant sign it stops and lifelines afk behind there's a little bit of a niche thing then you won't get to use it in every single fight that you're in but lifeline can be so obnoxious in these fights and reverences of really good came set so if we enjoyed today's video thank you for watching I do preciate it I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends our water treatment titties my friends I'm not sure when the last time I said water treatment to these my friends was because if it's one place on the map that did not like mine to that its water treatment it just seems so far away from everything else on the map one first thoughts here and I'm mr. short that's okay I miss them I saw our impressed Barnum but still hey it's just so far away I know like nothing ever happens here as proven by the fact that no one is actually here oh hi friend are you okay having a great time I'm gonna do I'll tell you why the g-seven skeleton ranked for me it has been like thank you has been so good in racking of the damage it's been unreal I got a fall guy on wraith and then I had a 3,800 there is game on her as well and it'd be nice to get out and open it so I think I can get up here yeah purple shields in here and also I believe someone just scanned from the crypto town takeover it's more common today what a few people commented it must have been I thought it came up and said that you've been scammed but I guess you have to be within a certain distance of the town takeover but to actually give you the notification because it'd be pointless if you're in like repeats or some people told you that you've been scammed often you do that nothing who cares for finer I was fine at the playa that's fine all right let's mess him up team we know they're over here well we know that they were here about a minute I hate that's gonna vibrate off my head with that like a bass boosted mic that's a given with purple shields and I do my best friends after the hemlock and I've got a dream 7 skate unfortunately no Prowler has been found yet otherwise this plush would be probably a little bit more lethal and you give it a go anyway yeah my science is just went off a phishing message of Colton Silva's reports with blogs on the retina Optimus actually it's not all my work trying to fire a new sciences at the same time it's kinda difficult that way scans was that us definitely wasn't come back I had no big heels often the field battery obviously nice on land headshots [Applause] need to give a lifeline you know there's a lifeline on the enemy team because I've had good cheese at reviving now it's 100% worth you good bassy brothers you kill them nice it's 100% worth finishing your chaos like first them to begin with because it's to Edie's just horrendous is just horrendous I'm to deal with them just keep getting revived over and over again what am I gonna use it I don't wanna use the Arthur I want I feel like I'm not not that good at that weapon anymore nice I'll scan the scene right storms coming into this is one of the last times you can actually scan some hydro dam there's like four teams at market there are two teams a hydro I take that's the that's the area they're all gonna have to focus on here you catch up to them are they sticking around if there were honest if they were kitties if they were on it and they know that we scandals because I swear you still get nothing you don't get notified to some company I'll scream do some X in the noise right and they would know that they could literally gatekeepers here but I don't think they are away which is kind of annoying because I didn't wanna scrap people apparently they're just running off into sunset I need a prowler I went to nine I wanted to use the toilet literally got a select-fire I love the scouting ranked are we also know under my instrument been confused alright I think it's all some time not perfectly incur but it's far enough away from them that should be able to appeal 1:39 Phoebe's got that trying to fire whilst using your sciences and honestly that's not my last night it's gonna take some getting used to it messes my aim of one I'll turn in here I'm using a variable scope Jack me--off these variables - good good I never want to use this on calm down again I don't know how I didn't pick up any of these Phoenix kicks oh good job teammates i five shield batteries I may be a bit overkill I don't know if my taillights have any Hamill either I think I've made the decision there you go who know she'll battery as they say in Spain I would assume folly for the squad left how is this happened tweak every game of plan and rank that I play everyone does everyone is camps this isn't even looting see face Babs this is unreal she'll battery now if you want fans it won't go up to pinky through the wall the tank how are you I'm really surprised that there are not many people left mind you it is kind of a small circle the style game is pretty dead she'll be keeping up here and second though perhaps ones fine nolleke knows that they're literally all dead that's the problem revenant the whole lobbies dead if only 14 people left 11 you don't count me in the SWAT it's going down few of us this man is confused Yuki's my mother we thank you very much that was a very strange place to start healing these pieces of high ground like the reason I feel like ice tide pain on these piece of library I've recently like diving board this new area over this way because I didn't know what to go here what I do and even stand on it so gotta finish this is gonna push me off oh you've been absolutely but it was indeed trying to push me off but I was unlike the old treadmill there I what I'm trying to say he's I jump I've only started complain about these recently the last season because officer use played Pathfinder now I have to actually think about how to get up on the high ground it's a shame how on earth do you go mister I've never had to I've never had to think like this I've not a problem solve on ground before you just grapple every 15 seconds oh I miss the days this team would be at the very least in a gunfight I was gonna say screaming rude but they could easily kill me [Applause] mood very Tuvan though this is this guy's team that we just killed as a waste and Sheila's Philistine is another team I would notice if I get up here you have to see you might kill it ultimate I'm back friends well I have someone I'll do that's perfect I've literally I say I hope someone that shoots me so I can get back to my high ground here I know heavy rains this summer up top and I'm struggling on a high level stick that's all I know what it's all credit that I was lacking I was lagging there we go nice someone's gonna leave a comment of a lengthy stunk final taker you shall want to go back but I can only read the comments no that's on my mind that I've left something else though you good you're gonna need a beat I've gotta finish someone's envying you I've got another theorem again okay [ __ ] the other team we don't want to get this high ground up I'm gonna have to try and keep these guys from joining the fight we're still helping oh please don't shoot me thanks very much that's the power of having a path line on your team he was still my high ground I've been to a deer so having these last few teams starfire nature too soon that's I know when he did something I don't know what I want in this care package that's good for a start it's gonna take you longer I can pick him up after if you don't need them but I appreciate I can trade you there you go I'm struggling myself friends there you go thank you I am I am thanking you I appreciate this don't listen to our legend okay find these guys it's maybe a bit of a risky play I look at a lot but the Duke family will not to use it ready ready [Music] it's underneath assignments after you have to aim it separates where your actual shooting I'm so happy you took that because on as I probably here look let's stop being greedy oh that's on the cover wives I was confused confuse for the level one shields me with the late game oh nice [Music] you are the apex champions does it ton of fun it was it was a pretty dead early game I'm pretty sure we got into the the action I mean wait I know he had six kills accessor was kind of sick joke huh at a game neither day I had five kills in a ranked game as revenant and had a life line I had 10 kills with beth the semetic damage I don't know what how is it with revenant I just get I don't know sweetly doesn't matter doesn't matter past five kills persists it was fun game that's all that came to me got the maximum amount of RP that's fun time revenant is actually so much fun to play and I think part of that is because he actually takes a decent medical to use he's Silas's properly because you can't just spend them in the good fight because they're not gonna go when he want them to go and he's ultimate placement takes a little bit of getting used to as well such a fun character the moment you seen more and more of him in ranks but anyway thanks for watching I do appreciate in I'll see you all in the next one mmm
