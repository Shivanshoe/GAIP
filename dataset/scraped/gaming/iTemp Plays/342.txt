hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the season 10 emergent trailer just came out and we got a lot of great info about the new legends here his abilities how he plays but we also saw some amazing changes towards edge in the background of this trailer as well and some more info about the new weapon coming out which is the lmg so let's start with the new legend sear and his abilities so it's similar to bloodhound see it is also all about tracking enemy locations but with a bit more stealth involved so his passive is whilst aiming down sights you will have a heartbeat sensor which gives you an on-screen real-time tracking method that the other person won't even know about his tactical is firing his drones towards the enemies revealing and tracking them and he's ultimately sending out hundreds of micro drones sending out a sphere in an area that you choose and every enemy moving in this space are tracked so this seems like a more skill capped version of bloodhound a lower skilled player can still make amazing views out of bluetongue because their scan affects such a wide angle and they can just throw it out on cooldown now with the way seer was described you're actually better off trying to send enemies with your heartbeat sensor first before firing off your ability or ultimate in that area now his ability sounds amazing it sounds like a more targeted version of bloodhound scan but perhaps because it might be more difficult to use they will be scanned for longer we'll have to see if there are any other hidden perks for this ability his ultimate sounds great too it's actually a dome that senses enemy movements within it and this is the screenshot they use to show this off the area looks huge the dome is massive this would be amazing to throw down in a really built up area like scraptor city for example so you can keep track of all the enemies in this location and towards the end of the game as well where people are more close and uh and more packed this would be an incredible ultimate to use see it sounds like an amazing legend to play and i can't wait to play him so next up we have the lmg there was a part of the trailer that i'll replay for you here it's being charged up with thermite grenades of all things whether this increases the damage or the range or perhaps the fire rate like the turbocharger does uh remains to be seen but you can expect this gun to be pretty good whilst charged up i would have thought now here are some of the map changes that we can see are coming towards edge as well the most interesting part of me were the lift things like a gondola that has been added towards edge where this is going to be i'm not entirely sure it's probably a new area on the map that they've added this into and also we have this bunker that they are fighting out of as well now i love world's edge and i'm really happy that the map changes this season are being made to this map and we also have the added benefit of train yard being destroyed so that's always nice as well let me know if you guys course anything else in the trailer that i missed leave a comment about it thank you for watching i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends cooked a load of chicken yesterday so i've been having like chicken sandwiches
