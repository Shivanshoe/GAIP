how was the cottage which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and while you're watching in the background for this introduction is me landing in the same place over and over again because there is some level for body shield there now it's pause there every single game on the dejan live gamemode you guys have told me about this I'm sure there are videos about this already on youtube.com but my word is this place contested the word is out at the moments I've landed there and I've had to fight people off about to punch people I've started playing Pathfinder again I was trying to play Gibraltar because in the same supply crate there's a gold center now which isn't that good at close quarters of what my tactic is is grab the level 4 body shields and grapple to safety but this is going to be here until Kings Canyon is changed on the map rotation for de jour boots that's happening on Tuesday so if you wanna pick yourself up a gold Sentinel for whatever reason or more commonly the level 4 body shields you know where to go so hopefully you enjoy today's video thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends my friends training these for the 30 second time today with his I'm uncontested but I'm still getting there yeah I can take care today because if someone didn't under you decide the Train all I have is this gold sense now and I'll be screw my boobs make this thing it looks cold it's an interesting gun but but on control aids it's absolutely endless I'm not sure if it's the same on message keyboard but no the suite is just ridiculous it's outrageous I would say are you not rageous out of 10 let me pick the Scout up there we go as well I think that may be the second time today that's been uncontested every single other game that I've learned here and it's been okay I've had to grab the shield and then just run off into the sunset you know I'll just I'll just get the hair confer gainer there as they say that's the goal since now that I pins please don't take that please don't take it and the only reason I say that is because it looks good but it's so difficult to use like I said and my teammates are trying to use that oh my god that'll end a shot here in a second every load oh my god oh there we go super annoyed beforehand my rank please I stopped last one down and a boom boom was our friend life I would say I keep forgetting the attachments all the way at the bottom it keeps throwing me off what about here actually I'll take a level two on my half arrow one and then I can use the 1 times H conk on the altar r99 that's not too bad all right full team down I was 16 damaged away from getting a complete squad right there did 159 that's like one damage I'm gonna need one of them will to my ammunition weapons I'm gonna need at least one extended mag that's the dream but also I was saying about the sniper I have enough to talk about this today so far because my teammates haven't wanted it either but it just means that whoever is using that is not to stand so far back to be effective that it may be to be three in some of these gunfights level three to two that's the kill leader that's not battery I'm level - OH - now if you barely play alright sure and I really don't play this game as much as people would think there's a fine on in this is good news we're here for the scrap what is this flown down from this they're gonna be fuming come back up now he knows better look at him terrified so if there is a terrible place to do that do you have level three okay there are recon I know you playing against I hate not having an extended line man so I hate it across Western I mean you know mass yeah I gotcha on the new hill we go there we go five kill us that would have been a complete two squad wipes there if it wasn't for that off beautiful level two extended line mag that is what you'd like to see tonight don't take I mean you can't take that blood for this per player this way what a raven it was trying to run off into the sunset three fortunately our stopping you could have been a bit of a pain there if you managed to get away I mean I've got one but I'm gonna be cheek here and see if they have another one our huge describe a train yard in the not-so-distant distance my tears are healing some nice old loot up boys I'll begin their faceting yeah she's got the Conn Center now it's not the player I doubt it's each the weapon it's because I've used it myself this isn't even Lutie so to shove it up contact I want to take them a little bit sure no it's get involved here to reload this time okay then mess it up boy sorry to miss I have no external iMac on white our 301 so I very much doubt his teammates are over that way let me up this is the most difficult angle to shoot on that Hey it's impossible to shoot someone who studies at that angle like straight beneath you I don't know what it is it's borderline impossible some may say I'm amongst those people certainly no no we we didn't get the corner for Life Flight I feel like I didn't get the can on the lifeline because I spent our beautiful level 3x10 line man think they should have to see for 500 I shouldn't have pinged the lifeline I should had a shot I feel like I would've got the kill crane it's all good not a most important thing in the world as long as my teammates were away healable situation is much more if I like the new bank labs because I am a healer vol connoisseur you know I love carrying every single healable oh nice to him that was like 70 damage now okay get over there let's mess them up Shelby okay yeah got my need a it's got some friends to see that it just means it they can have to place so far back you can land a shine makes it really easy for us but that's all in cover from her I think aah gibralta miss rain not down you see remain up the shoe ease if I go down there they can revive them to 2v1 all of a sudden that's the only she didn't matter in the end because we absolutely bopped him and to be fair she did lands a beautiful snow upon them for us to even engage in the first place oh that was there hidden in this room right it's true now in the flowers and your library so he goes every 60 as a turret to add 10 grapple but there was a scrap in the distance that was distracting me come on friends only some fair for me to say that when I am the Pathfinder with most overpowered what are you going where you going hey is she I don't know if she can hear someone no she's run over I'm testing my maybe something good tracking with the nemesis but it's pretty big for all right scrap in the distance mimi goes on mis amigos you guys keep telling me that it's a plural so you cross a mr. Perron okay they are up top these guys have got some elevation on the bow making contact with the enemy I've got the verticality and I'm scanned contact with target are they gonna peek are they too shook up to peek can't just be careful as long as they're aware that they are up there then we should be okay yeah but looking in stuff we did they were sort of distracted by the other team before that anyway so it should be too much of a problem yeah I know they're gone what's the rights I've heard they don't hear this we follow one clip this week on all my gosh I've fallen off the cliff friend sorry Matt I'm sorry I'm sorry I messed up oh good grief a teammate you could he could have got the height I need say look she's not even interesting him Lucy it's not like she was trying to steal it or anything she does I think she's trying to take that back was a close one alright I shouldn't have fallen off the cliff I need it to heal her but I did need to fall that far back so they pull me Cliff Richard right one my teammate and not realize it these guys here will have the level for sale I've wondered you brought it to have it and I'm not picking favorites here good I don't want the the Bangalore to get it listen I'm not hating okay I'm appreciating a help friend its what I'm doing because Bangalore siphon so she has not as much use of the Gulf Hills as the Gibraltar in my opinion it just makes more sense especially because the bangle has given us long-range support she's not gonna take as much damage as is proof in the last few fights actually it's me in the Gibraltar that made it in don't well have been downed actually squads I know every one of them I there we go Oh Eggman okay I'm no covet please don't hit me thank you very much blue shield ah I wanted to see how fast I could fire it and you know record them which if you spandy the free-cos crazy on single fire it's worse on automatic to be fair but I said stop spamming oh my gosh don't run that way teammate you run this way I've done all that care package has I've never lived it before I've only got to this stage in the game twice and it's because I've been in this pile the game before because the circles are the same every day well they change every day but at the same for that day that's a decoy I know where it ends and we are probably in the best position here 42 damage I mean it's not looking drastic at the moments maybe that's a bit preemptive here 250 sparing in the reserves but you knows what can happen especially you okay that's because I keep spamming I can't help myself I'm a time the Tommies live over there let's go this way alright bangles come on I fooled the regroup which is good all three of us are alive what's that don't tell me that was a patch line you'll see nice my bangle was not looking she might be fending off you the team no machi try and cause a safety or something out that's tuned down unless one of them got a revival ready I forgot the hip I forgot he was gonna tie that so soon I don't think I could have revived there anyway I've got caustics I should have thirsted the kill shouldn't I I should have thirsted that he was like a revenant we can't respawn him though sure they have a window pop door then overlooks this pre spawn beacon so I don't know if I can be the one to respawn take this distressing smug dang it you'd be fine I've got you covered I can't cook myself I see an issue oh my god you mean the throw nice Monday it's worth to have but maybe that would have drawn so much attention no never mind never sure I got a kind of fun my man was weak this team is done for but let's do the guy has gone knocked down as well that guy flanked me and missed his crater shot that is so incredibly lucky I did not hear him though but because my team is getting respawned all right where are the short ends of a all that because I got caught it's tempting to grab lift up but he might be up top if he challenges and I can wake him up a little bit he'll pretty start healing up immediately I got some stuff here I think there you go I need one of them huge oh my god [Music] [Music] oh my god I mean he threw that game so bad champions by they getting Kramer the thing is I could just I only just saw their low head peeking above the door and a nice long head glitch oh I was I was so close to were four thousand damage I need to that needs to first a few more people all right shouts out that give you especially for that close revived there at the end the bangle was looking at a different team when I get don't and they rushed us but I think she was also keeping them at bay otherwise we would have been third party so I think that she was really helping there again to good grief I tell you what having God shields from the start the game he's incredible okay if you find yourself some shield battery some meds you are one difficult opponent to kill because I think there's only one of the god Sheldon the map at the moment I'm pretty sure not a fan of the God sent another leave that behind my friends do not bother touching that great game I think that's my most kills in season four so far a smooth fifteen but thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
