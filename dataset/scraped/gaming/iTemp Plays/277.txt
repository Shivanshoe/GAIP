hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have a new favorite way to play this game now because i die a horrible death every time i land streamer building i've taken to playing caustic landing there and throwing traps and popping finishing moves at every opportunity now i don't condone this way of playing because i'm sure someone will die to a caustic in streaming building and blame me for it somehow but i will say it is satisfying it's very satisfying it's a fun time i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends follow me i've got some crazy star wars music i've put my music on random and i've got some crazy star wars music going on right now uh what are you talking about like yeah um uh if you're gonna land streamer i'll land streamer with you i don't care all right every time i see an ad from mcdonald's i want mcdonald's but then i think about it and i'm like no i don't it's yes it's it's so trash i mean it's got to be better over there no no it's still trash i don't know you're kind of picky i can't take your your opinion when it comes to food but it's it it is it is what it is isn't it it's just mcdonald's you know what you're gonna get with it yeah but you also don't know what it's like that mcdonald's in states oh let me fincher please don't shoot me yes they're reviving my guy i think outside on this door maybe yes you go down there oh really i need to use syringes let me know if you need me i can't run around with gold armor okay the variable give in that corner pretty weak i messed up my shots she's going there yeah she's got heat you're careful careful who's going here octane stand doctrine with gold armor i think that team i need to help you there unfortunately uh problem checking for energy is that 16 here i'll be there did you hear uh going i'm going uh up i literally missed every shot is so fun in that building oh they're on the bridge on game hits actually yeah yeah i don't know where he went there's gotta be blue at the bottom they're just trying to double kick he's one i'm gonna back we need to shoot everything i have so many light rains re45 i'm actually going to switch and re-45 g7 i've already got i've already got a r1 then caustic is so funny stream of building yeah he's a good time and he's so anti-streamer you know yes people probably hate you ah they probably do mate i hate me so sam join the club why are these fences still here there's no way give me a sec i was like the first person that died in this in this building watson still here i i swear i hear someone what if it's just you what did you do i had a level one bag makes me sad roger dodger on the way did it for maybe 12 damage maximum i'm gonna i've got battle stabilizer that's why to recharge yes what's up here like from the street where i am and they were looking through that window yeah that uh that angle is pretty strong oh no i'm actually going to stick with the re45 are you i'm a man of culture yeah it's not even an e45 video never know it might be it's not it's caustic might be it's gonna be caught coming out here mate caustic is trying to think of a good title oh no i'm all about ideas i got nothing and if i do got something i'm not going to give it to you because it's all i got i've given you many good titles over the years um inaccurate such as i can't play with item anymore yeah but i kind of came up with that on my own let's be honest but i gave you the content knowing what you're gonna do with it you know i drove off the edge of the map on purpose that wasn't willingly i missed the race on purpose that is like not even that's not even anything new i could make a video like that every day if i wanted to i just chose to make one that day because i had no content but like you do that stuff every day there's nothing i i have my moments of complete and utter embarrassment yeah i'm not gonna argue one minute until then there's a reason i don't stream mate selective editing that's why you should stream because it'd be funny people would enjoy that yep please come on man and shut up like caustic now we're gonna get rocked up on from the tunnel and we'd have known about it that is the problem i'm on your team though we're teammates i'm gonna pull a rogue i've been sabotaged jerusalem no it's easy no you don't know what i'm talking about what'd you do oh did he fly his team off the map was that was it that one it was pretty messed up i'm not gonna lie i was pretty messed up but it was kind of i i'd be i'd be lying if i said i didn't laugh what was he it was a revenant like it was a remnant on his team in a pub but he just blew him off the map oh i did see that i did say that and he he was getting blind people hated him yeah yeah i'm pretty sure there's just like a large amount of people that hate him solely for that too that's kind of crazy kind of crazy i mean it was a little messed up but at the end of the day it made me laugh it's not the worst thing i've ever seen though nah you've done way worse i've done a lot worse even glass has his name level three where are all the one times i've found a thing you can i've got one on my r45 here you go i'm not using it i'm just kind of looking for close range i need barrel stabilizers i have two level one barrel stabilizers i can't hear a barn door yes yes my sword thank you where'd you get that sword oh my god it always happens let's just react too fast yeah reaction speed of an altar they're not gonna know we're here mate i'm just chill hold on look at this strategy look at this straight nice i throw bengal two bengals good luck telling which one is mine that is pretty low crack down that i'm here for like 800 and i cracked her so i didn't know you can get around now i'm gonna be honest with you that positioning sucks by the way can we get some better hyped everyone's just running i know it's just crazy they're running up the hill all three of them like i heard of gazelle get out this rope man get up this rope get up this rope there i'm trying we're gonna get pinched but we can just run at this team nice mate where you going trying to reload i'm getting shot in the back i'm okay to help you but there's a fuse please get over here teammate i don't think this works there it does easy oh i'm hiding right on your head yeah here for like 20. just like right behind us what can we do mate i'm putting myself in the middle of two spots i don't know why i'm doing it we all have to move do we just run across here we do some research in this area okay um nice wait that much damage are they on discord with each other this ammo she just moved careful yeah just push 166 on here wait how many thermos does his team have it's a fuse like he's literally just got every thermal on the map 85 on that guy he's right here he's almost working okay i can't feed that angle that
