hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am showing you my advanced look control settings for apex legends now with these settings my goal was to try and find a middle ground between the default classic controller settings and linear both have their advantages and i wanted to try and harness the power of both sides of them now people like so far play on the most ridiculous settings because they are just mental at the game and jen burton's settings are apparently even more difficult to control they do this because they want freedom of their actual input being how their aim behaves in game now for us mere mortals this just isn't possible i need the game to help me out somewhat and because of this i think that these settings will be more useful for the average player compared to those absolute maniacs on the sticks all right so first of all in my controller settings i have them on customized i have crouch on toggle as my right thumb stick down so r3 that's switch with melee which is now on circle and the only the things that i shoot with r1 um which is switched with the ping button which is r2 now and the same with the left trigger and the left bumper for ads and tactical ability so in the alc i have five percent dead zone i think you want this as low as possible where it doesn't affect your controller so when you're not moving see i have no problem with sway and five percent is actually kind of low because the default is let me use space for this the default is 16 or 15. i think the those those lines signify where the actual default is so for out of threshold is one response is seven uh your it's three seven five the pitch is 280 the ads jaw is 140 the ads pitch is 104 and pretty much everything else is on zero now i based these off nice weeks arc settings and i can't remember how much i actually changed i think i changed all four of these and maybe some things here to go with how my controller was behaving um but if it looks very similar to nice wigs jack i apologize i may have just joined your settings but they are extremely good now what i've found with these settings is that my up close game is definitely improving i'm still getting used to them but i'm getting better with heat firing for example however my sniping or medium to long range feels far loose than before which can be a great thing but i'm just going to have to practice with these new settings like the g7 shot for example isn't as crisp as it was before but my r99 definitely feels so much better and i know that my skill scenic is actually higher with settings like these i just need to put the time in give these settings a go and let me know how you find them thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends and they were like all right we're off i was wrong with people man you just love taking advantage of what's easiest in a game i'm like don't like giving themselves a challenge i know he's ranked but come on little wingman i have a 30 30 and an eva i have long bow wing man right here oh i'm dead all right they're both right there watson's pretty low that's the mirage night oh god another team this way cracked one's outside oh nice there's one guy left i don't understand there's uh yeah there's some below some of the top watch out for the new kill leader friend that was the last of that squad i don't see anyone in here oh maybe they're just out here there's no this box is in there should be i hear someone that thing they were just hiding oh they're born for losing taken down it was my fault guys i needed wait this is where everyone died look at this place yep was there any light rain i feel like there's still a team over here though oh come on respawn i nearly have my rope let me know if you see any lyrics by the way yeah that's kind of important  ropes over in one second yeah yeah definitely team flying in on them as well reloading enemy down oh god i'm so stunned wait oh god i can't see just take everything yeah pretty much oh like i slid down the hill there was more so i tanked those as well like i'd be dead if i was an enemy i just honestly got hit by like seven of them there's a gold signal in here oh i'm wing manny up today oh what'd you say uh i got that in that game yeah yeah you had a decent game oh you already got your you guys i got a sniper game i had some sniper clips before so i just need one little win yeah yeah are we using a sniper last game friends yeah i was long i was quick scoping people in here nice oh let's kill that that boba i've roped over and three times from about two yards nice proper zoomed in and the 30 30 doesn't if it doesn't have a heavy mag it's awful i honestly so bad without a heavy mag i don't like it without a gold it needs to be buffed like the the mag size at least one once or twice yeah i think so i broke again it runs out of bullets so fast wait i'm so bad who i am now i just scuffed that hard ah does this work no that didn't work thank you i tried to do a creative solution it didn't work for the best that was a mess i just the what's someone's name looking at me i'll need one wingman shot six okay i broke i think they're all up she's full healthy okay where is this man i'm gonna come over they're gonna run into me i'm gonna save the bun they're gonna drop down and i'm gonna kill him like there's no audio in this game i know where he's at now he's up top but like what is the audio in this game oh man i'm really bad i'm really bad it's crazy you had a 20 bomb nice wow i don't have a 20 buck with this game the balcony 21 but i don't have a 20 bomb sad come on oh it feels bad i'm gonna get you a tiny bomb oh yeah we need to boost what if i fed it to you would it not be i just can't would it not be the same i got a twenty-one medicine keyboard good day but i made a new account because i was just gonna do mason keyboard and practice it and like then you got thrown into like the sweaty lobbies already oh yeah but like it wasn't an achievement it just wasn't it's just so bad so people whoever can reach into those and sell badges they're just like it's it's money for nothing oh yeah you dropped 40 kills in the lobby because they're all brand new blessing like it's crazy to think that like we don't even realize that lobbies exist a lot of times yeah 45 seconds but we could just walk it having kind of a having kind of a banger i'm doing okay mate doing okay not banger banger oh ten nice that's some finger this is a match yeah you though you little bit of match with that you don't got the mash yet no run around in the water short circuit in my legs why does take damage from across the gas still it's just the game you know they're so possessed into there they're so invested into their lore though it makes sense nice it's bad for his robot lungs yeah what he doesn't breathe he says he doesn't have a respiratory system oh good point come on british get it together so it's corrosive it melts the metal there yes if he can tank flatline bullets i think he could take a little bit of water we would talk about the coastal gas oh yeah incoming coastal gas we somehow got to water because you said you were your legs were falling apart he said you're dying i don't know no short circuiting i think you mean yeah yeah yeah have you steamed once this game how are you full health i'm just kind of vibing i'm just kind of chilling i think i've seen maybe once i'm more upset at the fact that i don't have a heavy maggot on this 30 30. better on a 30 30. yeah a bit too bad it'll be better for the 30 30 here you go mate is that nice okay like 30 30 is kind of weird but my hip fire is kind of nasty with it i dodged everybody so i literally hit like like at least 60 percent on lc no aim assist come on now oh this guy right here no i can't see there's so many effects going on is that teammates ultimate oh not again not again ah i'm taking every single one of them i'm trying to crawl around give me that ah i'm just crawling around i you are the apex champions kind of a fan of the 30-30 sometimes uh you are alone oh that's fine probably but it's fine okay nice almost identical yeah you did first that guy at the end um i mean i did have one more knock too you know so that's yeah yeah yeah the thing is though the thing is though i yeah you ends no ends cut to the subscribe
