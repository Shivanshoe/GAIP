hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the new collection event is upon us it's called the warriors collection event and with it comes exclusive skins for the event and the return of control which is the limited time mode that everyone loves we get a new arenas map and also a new heirloom for crypto which looks amazing so first things first let's start off with crypto's heirloom this is the piece of content that i care about the most and this might be top three heirlooms released into apex from a personal standpoint crypto gets an actual sword which looks incredible now to unlock this i assume you need to buy the 24 packs that comes with every collection event to guarantee the heirloom though after the event you should be able to purchase this heirloom with the tokens if you have them saved up next up the new arenas map now i haven't played arenas in in around three and a half years it feels like i'm not the biggest fan of the game mode personally but i'm sure there are plenty of people watching this video who are the map actually looks really cool and it has a feature that we haven't seen in the regular vr mode which is moving pieces of cover which would be very interesting maybe we could see this included in the full game someday as i mentioned before control is also making a return as expected because the community was very outspoken in their love for this game mode the chaos returns and we also have a new location for this mode which is forced to treatment on the south of king's canyon set up in there it'll be extremely difficult to get the team out of what i assume is b flag now the collection event comes out on the 29th of march so if my mic went weird i already decided to walk in front of it it comes out on the 29th of march and i will be covering all of the content on this channel so make sure you are subscribed thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with the banglore game my friends hey they split as well oh my god oh my god give me this yes pretty sure i saw a light why mag yes hammers oh darn imagine yeah now we're talking let's do this i've been sorry for life i think people did land here they must have landed further along though i'll leave those two into my teammates i assume he's going to get there i need an r301 or an alternator he'll be fine i mean i've found two of them team and my team i found one too like i've used the hemlock so much recently i use heavy guns so much if there's a crafter here there's a crafter here i would uh i'd craft a flat line i haven't used one in ages okay i did nine damage for that kill what can you do just not shoot come on guys reloading i was trying to time the ark star no okay i love you both on the roof i try to time with the fred's blowing up could have stuck him maybe we can't really separate too much this is the only way he's gonna be is if we separate let's not do that give me a sec contact oh my gosh i smoked this earlier i'm fuming to myself half the squads are left let's smoke him one second spotted double timing it reloading slipped don't know what that was enemy spotted they look small do you guys have any bats given my shield to recharge i have 17 cells yeah delivering care packages i've got cells i just have no bath that's all thank you to the skies was there someone here we could craft so shielded okay thank you though i look how similar my ammo levels are i'm one bullet better off with the heavy this can't stand there we go now we're both even got a live one out there they're shooting over here eight squads 22 so there's two people missing could be a solo could be come on get in take this spin for all right could be two teams with uh two people on them either way i can hear a long range battle hicks it's a single fight hemlock doesn't have uh bubble no no he's gonna get him out of range i feel bad but here i have 20 cells that i do not need double time in it we need to get high ground here's a pick me up could you stop here look at the fast reload look at that that kind of suck okay i'm literally the worst i cannot be any worse in this game giving my shields of recharge go get him the phase so i smoked these two off try to rush the rate but she had she could just face back there which kind of sucks what's that though two other squads left stay close two of the scores left do i need to change to a light range no i don't deployed at 13 bullets one sec all right let's go get these guys get up i think i prefer the two times on the hemlock even single fire at like three times range it's not too effective these guys probably just gonna go energy depos oh it's afk no they risk their life to reviving no that's sad folks enemies here reloading wait these are two separate teams let's go this way ring fire i thought we were backing up to be honest with you oh oh let me just back up horizon attention hold tight i got your back all back maybe it's touching down they usually carry red plank points hold tight just left one down on that team smoke out we slap one down on that team we might win gonna use the phoenix kid i have one medkit though hello hello maybe he was one shot and he had to get in the heat shield come on it just sprinkled into the shield with us i'll be honest i thought when i um was bringing the heat shield there i thought i had a mobile respond beacon because i usually carry mobile remote beacons i'm gonna heal before i get over i these i think it's one guy let's be honest he's one guy yes [Music] nice gg well played ggg glorious good game well played oh 12-minute game as well and game's always spicy they're always spicy ggs
