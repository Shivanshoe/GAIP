skyscrapper DS my friends I've only got one Tina here but at least he's about the diamond trail on so I can put a little bit of faith into it exception b-boy it's turbo puppy the bills in here we go Prowler flatline oh there was a gun here I'm taking it prowlers like my close range the three sevens like the medium / let's go this way long range options here I talked to Tony it's gonna it's gonna pay me to leave this behind y'all 9 tonight I can't reject the Prowler after I've made a video saying I was wrong about about the Crowder you know I saw us have to pick it up now if we're not let me down again wasn't gonna be extremely upset friend thinks I may have shot cargo but now I heard something weird any shoes you over this way this is unloaded them maybe not maybe someone was firing or something having select-fire all DoubleTap well maybe there was people here ok oh here we go Bob shields I am linked and booties get me the heck in freaking vaults I've no idea who shoots you know I found the cargo but yeah I'm not gonna that's a death trap there's a reason they haven't gone on Lou did he this place has seen activity hey Jeff dawn shields two and a half seconds into the game okay then alright well that's three shields listen Seattle someone looking hey Mike you'll take man stole my kill getting color friend no no no no I wasn't going here I can see listen I'm telling ya you do not want to invite right back promise Red Sea yep thanks plane you stole my kill I'll take the girl she'll stop okay this isn't looking good what's he might end up still that's good that's the only good news here okay please be separate I think they are I could have used a finishing move but I didn't know how long his teammate was gonna take to get over I was originally just going to switch off I was originally just gonna switch arm it to the purple and try and fight through this is pretty bad sound better here it's not gonna revive that's all I care about he's good what ceaseless weapon and he's got a god-sized Jim that's one of the squad so destructive they're still making the noise of the self race but it does that shield there's some reason if you've finished the killer you still plays the audio file my four kills should have been fight but the chokes a man stole one what he'll that's okay as long as I ended up with the god shields lifeline who already has fast hills as purple shield as well this is looking here I think I salute these guys properly because I've literally just all the shield and run off I got the heck in free counter they take the gold rotation here comedy beat thee - okay never mind I think this was nice I think this was a mistake but I've already committed my ultimate to it and I don't know maybe this is better maybe we maybe this is better maybe because we avoid the choke point like the tunnel that could be someone there and I don't know if these doors yes reload this all right even in level 1 extendo max for this gates is an incredible find because it increases the magazine size by 50% so efficient and I'm stupid an avatar is the 10 bullets clip right don't forget there's another one here here might be something good this way donal prediction came true don't even hit me it's all shook here because scrapped or City he's a very busy place and also a lot of people would have been pushed through a lot of different choke points there may be people come came from like train station to but I mean there is a scrap going on Shore tech man you back Ram tube they might struggle a little bit with health oh yeah your lifeline forget about it all he's Marvin oh please stop there we go he's straight completely completely counter completely counted my meat my fire in their shield I aim to the right where he was going and then he changed the left good angles is why pathfinders the great DCT legend on the game scrappy this is good news questionable questionable accuracy this is why I never liked about the Prowler John it is I honestly I think it might be the I think you might be the dis your fret I don't think I get on with a distraught threat with the Prowler I like it on the wing man I like it or not I know tonight I don't like on the prowl I don't know what it is perfect just like three or four separate teams here were largely untouched some hey oh that one times Hedgehog it's tempting [Music] if you fancy Tina I'll just I'm praying that I don't run into a Korsak or Bangalore come to regret that but I think my accuracy is bad with the bond times also I literally I have no idea when I pick two best let by but I mean awesome mode now someone's pushing people potentially from behind get back it's coming down by seven kills still to spectators that stuck around for a while this is the new to spectators the top ten this is good he's looking real good hopefully we can get gold shields for the lifeline to not quite as necessary because she already has fast heals but gone shield is quicker so still extremely beneficial egg oh hey sweets so unsatisfying about grappling like that then just it feels like you're landed in quicksand you know I mean like you just stop there's no momentum it's a fighter geezer we're saying Timur anything good thank you thank you it's why are you good thing lighting connect pathfinder so were such a commitments using his ability sometimes it's good to just save it right do you know one of those times I'm gonna get involved now surely and his fees and he could be very helpful they definitely in there and they killed our squad korsak's done bloodhound hello friends I know you can run towards my teammate gold helmet perfect for Pathfinder nice right for me that's bad news because that means it's a teammate he doesn't know these guys got called shields in fact teammate I just so it's easy for you what the heck are they doing over there who is this mountain man I guess woman cuz it's clearly Watson mental without senses but we're not gonna go over there so I don't know why you've set somebody up Oh teammate careful those shields that's good I think this is a good rotation on that you guys come with me this is good this isn't too bad I'll say why they're on the south side here we're close to the sense of the ring so that means our chances are way better with the next safe zone have you been in our favor yeah I am right I can never really tell with the mini-map there's a good chance it ends in the lot ton of paving please get from this range this mania hey this turbine you fell that did a decent amount of damage not quite as which is a 3 7 scaled that still cannot believe they buff these good just watch your back drop I think that's guy wanna be able to see him now noted your threat mr. Dave yeah I was tempted to let him I was tempted to them but then I saw myself right about at about 40 Nelvana me quit bein back out of it oh I'm surprised when that against three paper at the end I mean the Watson tactics were a bit questionable we got a bit unlucky with the final circle but it didn't marry the end because they split up and I mentioned Damien at the Watson as soon as the Watson was downed and then the life lads have run over and trying to help I'm pretty sure he was wood at that point shout out the Prowler again once again I do think it's better with the red dot I'm telling you that the digital threat is not too good but the red dot you can't really miss you know you you can do no wrong with the red dot sight and I'll think absolutely what an overpowered gun I've gone from saying it's the worst gun in the game to to one of the best this has happened oh good game no thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
