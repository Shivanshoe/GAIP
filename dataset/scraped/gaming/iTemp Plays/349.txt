hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have finally achieved apex's longest grind reaching level 500. i don't actually play apex all that much which is why it has taken me so long to get to level 500. also my playstation account is level 300 and something i think so the progress was sort of reset when we were over halfway there but we made it finally and it only took me about 12 years hopefully you enjoyed today's gameplay thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends guess what i did today uh what did you do today i drove by myself for the first time nice how many poles and how many people did you hit uh not wanting to say that on stream not wanting to incriminate myself but i'll tell you that take a long look at me but it was a fair few minutes my parking was absolutely horrendous i was going to take a picture but i didn't it was bad though you should have uh that's the one thing i'm bad at driving because i haven't had that much practice so my parkings are so bad i'm definitely uh afk right now so i do apologize i'm sorry chat i'm sorry rich usually how it goes my first game on right yeah yeah you're never in order uh-huh i don't think you've ever been ready to go no no no never never not once ever okay i'm here hello okay hey oh i got a 99 off the riperson nice hope they looked at me yeah i'm actually kind of kidding now are you an afk yeah oh man i got i got a 99 volt there's no one here why'd you bring us here it was the hot drop ah i don't i don't think it was i got gold flatline with an r9 with a purple mag that's why i brought us here nice i mean i i wouldn't be opposed to a bigger backpack maybe a better armor the loot is sensational and my rhymes are recreational you know you can't keep reusing that line every single every wrap why not i don't send why not you have to switch it up sooner or later i feel like you've used that that rhyme like eight times a confrontational the sensational part oh okay this is okay my teammate is literally afk uh chat's watching for me they're watching my screen okay i can't i can't see it but it's still up on my stream okay so they're they're going to let me know if someone's coming uh i need to revive uh are you are you actually fighting no but i'm just i'm running to a scrap so i was just saying it pretty empty okay well i'll be i'll be there sooner okay all right yeah it's just your usual it's just a user uh so far mess i'm on my way there first game first game yeah yeah you always like this i don't i don't know why but you are i don't i don't know either i'm never i'm just never prepared at first how many problems you have like what what you said what's the problem now does i'm gonna keep talking even though you're in a fight um on my other on my other pc i had all like my keybinds and stuff and i didn't shouts for this pc so you know all that all that stuff i say now that just makes sense am i making this fight harder for you no the guy he just ran up on me with no armor so it was actually pretty simple okay i left a pad there for you um where i don't see it's on the ground can you pin it i can't it's pretty far [Music] there's whoa what the heck was that i've got no aims because the smoke help nice spent like half this game on discord so understandable that nice getting carried by eye temperature on first game on it happens it happens how does it feel going from like uh 10 to 100 110 i think you may what do you have servers like 10 um right 10 to 20. unnoticeable not impressed what's the revenue that rocked up with no armor he's gonna armor against the fair guy everyone no and happened people heard it uh did anyone have any light rains i don't think they did it's uh what do you need light rounds some of those light frames uh i dropped a full size anymore if you need it i have 120 so it's not awful you're doing stuff right like are you having a good game i don't know i'm doing decent i'm doing decent uh i can't even carry that oh there we go go get some more kills someone has to get something out of this because i've done nothing okay well in typical olympus fashion there's about three people left so oh yeah that's true never mind if no one's where you dropped then you're just screaming good you may back out i know unfortunately it was you that dropped us there it's not true wait is this an actual person it's an actual she took my third damage i thought that was you that was something i would do 100 oh yeah and then you call him a flunker it's just why uh so does that like does that mean he dc'd at the beginning of the game like an actual like error and then he uh just stays there until he reconnects himself and you guys have just done that to him which way do they go left or off all right oh they're going up okay what's 38 plus 19. i have no clue where's he going should go to school for math they didn't teach me that i wasn't a class i didn't go to some i didn't go to a class school was 38 plus 19. are you sure i feel like that would be i was shooting i couldn't concentrate on the numbers mason i was just shooting this guy's a demon he's really weak i'm going in he's honest and he's gone he's right i'm probably dead to be honest with you yeah you're dead he's the same it's the best gamer ever do you mean are coming back here oh there's more oh i'm leaving him mate you can have a fun time oh we've got a ramp oh my god did that go get everybody here you drop me ammo so i could kill people then i'll kill people then you're like wow wow wow abandoned taking my kills imagine taking my kills when i have under a thousand damage i mean i don't have much more than that this guy tap strafe just forget abc's fired with flatline how does it feel oh it should have dropped you're right i should have dropped my care package on the bane ah man kill thirsty [Music] i'm not even killing people that's all i'm asking for just throws damage boosts the numbers a little bit you know yeah understandable that right he stood around the one that absolutely clapped you yeah i think this is her she kind of clapped you too so uh she was running away mate i had a portal she was teaching her phasing the whole bank she had to use the whole kit to get away from me i'm not even using my gun very straight up it's on me i'm patting him oh i'm a genius mate i'll back this so that she couldn't get away with she's so smart i have 27 heavy bullets the wraith is beyond one shot i know what's going on puncher jack oh i missed i missed please oh my god thank you pop your drone please um i don't know how i missed i don't know if you know you're muted or if yeah yeah i just realized it wasn't good because there was no way you would watch me do that and not make fun of me so i knew something's wrong i mean i wasn't making fun of you i was just acknowledging that you were really close to dying oh right yeah yeah that's it and then you start laughing and stuff yeah i just want a thousand damage that's all that's all i was talking about okay we can make that happen i just wanna die they're in the ring just going just go in and start whacking throwing hands mate are they really in there yeah well the announcer is saying that people are in there so one would assume sir put me in there i got
