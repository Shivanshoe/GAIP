hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i got to use the product today and it reminded me just how much i missed it i love this little thing burst fire mode only no full auto buildings allowed it just shreds you know it's a good gun when they put it into the care package and they don't even need to buff it it got the devotion treatment unfortunately every time i find this gun there are at maximum two teams left and i only get a few kills of it but it's a massive shame because i want this gun i love using it and i want it back that's my season eight request to respawn entertainment please give me my prowler back i'm begging you anyway i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you

gold back from it so i um yeah i'd probably pass out too but wait i played midfield i was fast but i i was i ran a lot more than anything when i was when i played uh when i played soccer i'd admit i played mid so it's just a lot of running enemies oh i'm a 39 with a downtown i'm coming oh my god i'm so bad they're chasing me taken down i've done one on me but i don't know how many people around here there's decoys everywhere i'm scared it's two of them i think they uh okay let's do them he might did i get my life oh wait i don't have my lifeline kill so there is a lifeline down back there

might be the best time we've gone i was uh i was really good at basketball but i never played it like on an actual team i was like me and my friends just always we played it growing up and i played it a lot growing up but never actually played on the team i felt like there's too many rules travel there's no traveling so many roles in basketball that's why i didn't join because like i would have allowed to go on holiday you know yeah i mean they're saying stop saying that's that's a really weak joke i'm gonna stop at that one don't worry i can improve i can improve there you go let me know
