it was a gauzy to reach welcome back to another video today we are playing some hype escape with Jenks and chicken and we already have won five games on this new battle royale I have two of them here for you in this video and I'm going to be showing off my favorite loadout so far just watch some games of grips with the game itself so hide escape is a new battle royale game by ubisoft and i've got infected junk sphere a friend code so thank you to junk so very much appreciate it this isn't a sponsored video anything that intro sound like it was but it's not just a few were curious but this game is incredibly fast paced it's incredibly fun and took a lot for me to jump off grind in the game more to make this video I just want to carry on playing so onto the load a whenever I play futuristic kind of shooter like hype escape here what I like to try and do is to try and use the guns that are as close to normal as possible I know how they behave there are many hidden quirks about the gun so the guns I've been trying to find other Ripper which is an assault rifle and also a gun called the protocol which is a sniper a one-shot headshot sniper so when you try this game a I'm massively suggest trying to find these guns lying around because there are so many things going on this game it's hard to keep up so it's nice to be able to use two guns that you're probably familiar with since it's just a basic assault rifle and a basic sniper also just for a bit of context here you get two hacks which are disabilities that you can find in the game these are abilities like armor healing invisibility teleport things like that so if you see me doing some crazy stuff on screen you can see which abilities I'm using at the bottom of the screen to know what I'm doing anyway I have two games here for you today I really hope you enjoy them there are some of my first gamers ever playing here so keep that in mind if you see me doing some stupid things because I'm learning something new every game and I've only played about eight or nine and we did win about five of them like I said so thanks watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends its canceling I got it that guy Chris people here by the way or at least I think so I heard little footsteps you guys see another cup Komodo let me know well they okay I want to try to use the plasma launcher then once these like the repent let me know so I need an actual life yeah and I'm Disney any wallet armor that's what I want on it there you go sky bright guy oh there's fighting fighting there's quite a few over here my friends 25 I'm gonna Maxim I wall okay he hits those all day long the viewers have chosen with infinite ammo Oh Oh God Oh calls boys I don't wanna damage from just backing up oh my god I hate around here somewhere I haven't seen anyone Angus though hey with that twice all a whole team multi multi fine nice one sighs hello nice job Freud Oh where is he where is he worthy you went it visible on me somewhere let's see what lover I don't grow out of invisibility on me just improve this bad boy I mean a little bit on top of top always so weak tea bag he had a maxout invisibility a lot of sense pretty strong yeah no kiddin come on team aim assist we got nerds to Freud down on that scene anymore the tribe you guys betrayed us oh yeah beating anybody jumps and she's dead all he comes we got her first we climb Oh behind us -
