half seconds my friends all right air bag cities my friends this used to be one of my favorite jobs to learn okay I'm being contestants time I can't be which one of these has which funnel eat okay yeah you've got you've got I know yeah unbelievable I had a grenade they could have put at least one gun in each of those could make theirs now I'm weaponless in Seattle thousand that's about the same ring to as I said she at Ole Miss arena stumble avoids thank you I was a wing man was a Mozambique if I get myself some health and a bit of heavy grant it off beautiful oh I need to go syringes friend I can actually compete now I can actually shoot someone I'll let you saw you pick up bird syringes that's okay I guess this gets me a full as well okay take this then I'm not gonna steal you if you're he levels two syringes would have been nice but it's okay this gets me most of the way there nice with you I'm just happy to be alive I do want to go mess these people up for landing the same spot as me how dare they thanks it's interesting skinny bit too colorful for my liking our great minds just as colorful just just different colors not distracting in the slightest online were all three of them a little our nail forward they once them what's going to our man one stop no motivation left after his teammates have been decimated never steal my guns ever again they're from amongst your tickled him nice full tape that was tremendous that is why I would like to call payback I mean they didn't do anything wrong all they did was land at the same place to me it's not the sort of worst crime of all time I will look meet know how I hate begging for stuff I think I'm one syringe - my name's you said that med kit by any chance I thank you I'll try to use the Phoenix Phoenix is a way worse than metkids John the Phoenix here I don't like them if I'd if I had gold shields I'd keep the Phoenix but I do not why we ought to always gonna take time to work remember your manners you know before you enter the Porter you gotta say thank you first I appreciate the the old pinga minim lines them but I wanted to come up with haste because I'm on a mission at the moment and the zone is closing in the ring even there you go told you new people be scrapping over this way now we need is a bit of high ground I've overcommitted that way too far so if I'm done in like a year since I'd tell you my faults that he's right here sometimes that close to humming you realize right over there is this the same guy that's what a risk fingers heck if it involves come here ah what did the trailer kill the slide down the mountain hip fire Spitfire Yelp it would have been beautiful it would have been deafening the next trailer guaranteed my own thought that's my old buddy Schultz I'll take you back but he looked a little bit alright this beef is heavy ammunition and we are struggling in their heavy ammunition departments army two French here we go one suck each thank you that's very we can make it not one this your buddy thinks I've taken both on its way I could use that forget that just taken there we go I should have known it's scrap cave what else is gonna go on in this cave other than a scrap there's no porn those wooden shoes that I think it's more fit I didn't realize it was this father no good great for this was any faster than me just walking to be honest it's too far away there's about a four teams here I'm not actually accidentally walk into it yeah yeah nice house nice nice nice nice I swear we will fire at this boat ain't I messed up I shouldn't have used the Peacekeeper that long I hear full of always in white one to 120 121 or something should have pulled this before I immediately this event so many people there I had a 20 car and a fork a badge as well I definitely definitely should have won that gunfight alright Octane's gauntlet Erie's my friends I am a big fan of octane to go on at a salon take all the time because there was a very high chance in a no gold gun from the middle finger fire I'm very interested to see what this for us today this is where you try and get a gun before you go for the armor ok unless he didn't know he's gonna be honored because I was tempted to go for that thing too so I thought it might be like a gold prayer or something be so much makeup of all I have energy there are side energy rounds are you trying to beat Pete 2020 and people I've got Gentiles I'm not even gonna loot it my teammates anything you look and school town is right around the corner and hopefully my teammates are able to he looked a lot before people inevitably come over the of the hill here and absolutely murderous he's not starting to kills I mean the path miner was pretty much Michael when you're on deja Lutz you've got to try and make a mental note you have to this is a decent place to land because one it's close to school tame give me the helmet good great so I always leave how it's behind because you don't see but I'm spamming square and stuff it never picks it up so I just think oh I've got a helmet now a glance Damien and I'm helmetless helmet listen Seattle they say that's the face that's what they say and I'm sick of it it's not my fault people was I say oh yeah I'm gonna grab the hover that's my new go to Luke's my I think don't grab the habit and they turn around and try and contest for the purple shield I take that I'm gonna do it I'm not sure if I can control the Ricoh on the flat one at the moment a little bit too much for my liking octane score net only one squad landed here we've opted to move p229 zwei definitely Dame to go towards school team there we go not respawn in did he say it's not a scratch it's a principle I'm surprised no one's firing exclaims it's actually it's people their name actually sounded pretty dead for some reason it's not a chance we're gonna get to that respawn before they've able to work to loot up or anything so product worth rushing over on my word at the world's collection of any drones here there's a scrap at airbase right now before Cho Arquette I have to loot this because my team is gonna come this way and I know for a fact they can't help themselves not them just human nature you just want to see what's in there you don't walk pass up a dog's armor when you could have just opened supply be alright teammates yeah huge scrap grenades going off bullets flying everywhere I see people flying as well the buttocks are find the people of flying beasts guys ziplining a dear friend makeshift approximate between the two of us air look at this on one wage yeah it's a good job picked up the Arthur I want if I'm struggling that much with the Arthur I want imagine if I had picks with the flatline good grief I get used to the the recoil and stuff again right well to people without shields I'm not going to steal it I'm tempted to opt for you I might give you a little helping hand here there you go I'm money go look because I don't a steel intervene and if there's anything good there guaranteed old almost dearly I'm tempted just to go flying again I'm tempted just to fly across the mass way this is another thing that they took out when we got to play recently I swear there was no balloon towers there are no jump towers so again over to the fight and the next jump Tower II the next people scrap who was kind of difficult let's go this way so just far into the sunset here life lines coming ass good news I'm never going inside bunker I was thinking about go through there but if you're not caustic it's just not it's not worthy there's probably three dweebs son up there right now with an all gas canisters trying to get a ready click they're gonna put me on ready here we go this is one of more interesting and there's nothing wrong but I loved those clips I just don't want to I don't want to be the victim that's all I'm saying yeah yeah back it up Dwayne that's what I thought be fair I was the one who back to the first I was scared I reckon they're trying to flee the scene a little bit Hostel right here all chose the wrong way fill it up by name put Udall D jumped off I'll just climb back up so casual there's gonna be so many people here teammates healing I'm gonna go I'm gonna provide that lifeline I guess I'm coming don't worry I thought it was just gonna be those two I didn't want it to rush us and let's get chops in the building and still if you just get four names to pudding wasn't there's far more people down here after Bhutan stays alive here oh my oh my way how the heck did you get up there I must have took the Berlin Tower he's got a move of course I suppose his triple-teaming as well you can write it it's really playing the villain role here I'm scared a little bit that they're just gonna fly over our heads here they could have gone all the way around that I'm not sure why they would I mean I guess we do have a cemetery did not mean to do the boy sign sorry friends then this was a nice one there was no there was no teasing involved I feel must have rotated around okay I talk they say this is why I taught at this I told you I told you I had no idea there was a Corsican volved in this nice I know it is acoustic involved you just comes out of bunker it's almost your battery's name which is a terrible position to be your batteries are good fight wings I don't think I'm gonna get any here eyes on some stocks up when shield sells I should be I was right thank God thank God oh thank you friend a great guy very much appreciated someone's got a respawn in the distance - but at this stage in the game there's no way there's not like a Lube box surround somewhere there have been plenty lot of balls only if I saw this on war zone I'll be a little bit intimidated on this game I'm not in coming care package so I can get a higher ground so easy and they really can't mail me that quick Rudi's always going to peek through that door in the map says not all of us are inside many people run on the skull thinking our full-time there's a full team tune out another trip time indeed this is but this is not a minute it's always a triplet mo every time if I wasn't Pathfinder I'd be feeling right now because I mean I can decide when I want to go up there I've got my ultimate but if I'm blue tamed I'm struggling around school tennis the only bad part about see a lot of shields I guess right I've got fine ammo there two points bow got Arthur I wanted loads of footage to there's a topic ok you probably needed the more I guess but I still up there I'm not shooting I hear him though this is the last who teamed is awesome hey contact with hostile are you off to so yep I did my damage I want to go back but I don't want to you meet shields I don't to go through the portal it pulls an absolute death trap they go lifeline returning the favour' these the ones you drop me back at in the desert it's okay my killed is got self race nice our fantastic tremendous but he should have thirsty to kill don't open the door 1/2 there I'll go and get my thumb where I'm not gonna keep you Sivarama I've got your batteries now I'm fine I don't like the good grief peep I can't hear myself think if those doors going crazy I don't like that two times the close range I'm gonna say that much I'm not a fan the two times is so nice in the habit a little bit longer of a range there and because I got so that's why I already put in single fine moment get mass in single there we go marceline 263 my more if I just first appeal is this the last guy if I thirst until we win there and I don't have to embarrassment of going down [Music] stop teammate I still got these cysts on him and I downed him once you know I mean I counts for something I win here on page our loot on Kings Canyon Mayan absolutely no idea where any of the loot was not a glance I mean we got decent stuff now start the game with the habitants and purple shields Octane's inferno up tanks gauntlet even seven kills is in two shafts three revived I mean look at that that's a very even team five six and seven kills quite even damage really two revives from the lifeline three vibes from you boy I'd say that's a solid team victory great teamwork on show their apex is a lot of fun thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
