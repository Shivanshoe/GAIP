hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex collections of course and today apex it sort of got to me a little bit between not having teammates like the game will just be one teammate or no teammates for no reason in trios half the time when i did have teammates they were not interested at all in any sort of team play and then every single lobby that i was in died within the first sort of five minutes maximum there was about two people left there's only one legend to play in this situation and that was bangalore she's so good at taking people off playground she's so good at disengaging and engaging and she's actually really good at team play because the smoke is so helpful to revive as well sometimes my main isn't cutting it like pathfinder is not like a fridge he's just getting beamed by everyone but i made his work so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends let's do this i mean estate is absolutely popping off please don't say around here lifeline no please oh she didn't punch me it's not appreciated but i still come to shoot you it's kind of sketchy i kind of want it that's not the worst thing ever because now i took on my blue okay i'm just going to regroup on my team that's one loop this let's try and help the race these guys sound like they're distracted confused might need some assistance let's relocate here i need some assistance you'll be all right i gotcha i need this knockdown shield champion out out there there is no way this octane came from my pathfinder side without him getting shot in the back oh my god now he's going to steal okay i got you back eagle teammate it's my b of assistance why am i so bad with the car answers on a postcard if anyone knows nice all right always a good idea to get high ground there just because it gives you options it's so easy to drop down but it's a lot harder to climb up after someone got a shotgun bolt i have got absolute faith in you guys because it's going to take me a long time to heal up here god no big heels nice i knew they could do it there was yet another team over there where were these people landing let's reposition here this is the 13th century huh what the heck is going on come on in all painless is waiting someone's over here with a bow and arrow i don't know where they are somebody had put a bangalore all down i have no idea where this team landed so third parties from the angle oh great i mean at least we got some fights feels weird fighting at the states ship never brings me over this way up top but he tries to help his teammates top ten could i actually get a win how are you alive there we go well i don't have much damage but i have a ton of gills stabilizer here the enemies are shooting at me like i hear that grenade because it has to be grounded next season right where the heck did you confront don't tell me he was stood in the tree the entire time i didn't see this guy he's weak though i don't know i think he's afk you got that nice i think the maggie the maggie ultimate actually did a little bit of damage to me because he bounced off a wall and came back need assistance thank you very much oh gold bag as well you are spoiling me hello what are you doing here is it just her please don't say it's just her be so antique that's prime activity once again ruined my own bus route and she's where you gonna go though that's the thing like this is the final fight here this is it one team we saw a fly this way she's the last guy the final guy on the map i tried to get the wingman back out you've run that way oh do i still get killed credit she's got she's gonna die there's no way she makes it around in the in the third zone here there's no chance i'm gonna scream okay we kind of all landed at the exact same loot spot i don't have any energy i got some lights i mean that's okay that's honestly that's fine it kills someone steal their stuff and this purple here oh horizon we might need some assistance i really don't know where this team came from keep running lifeline she's probably got no no i mean she was running around almost punching people please stop it i'm about to run over there i'm gonna run over there it keeps my purple but that's that's fine i guess i don't know how this has happened i've just got white let's get her she's just been annoying please don't now me energy i'm almost completely out of resources but i've got enough to fight and thursday that's the plan fight obviously the same death box eight times and this one at the mozam okay i've said a world record for the american you know what i've done without going down like this is minimum like 500 damage i've taken this game it's on ring's moving okay beautiful i've had so many shields this game i want a waste of smoke i regret that instantly get him robbie's stuff thank everything oh great do i go up the rope i mean the chances are someone's going to come down right sometimes they don't he's going gonna risk it i'm bangalore i've got my passive ultimates down so now i need to control inside because they're gonna try and run inside absolutely not that i think is going on up here get him a spitfire gold speed fire terrifying shooting and nothing and as soon as we leave and get off the high ground they managed to commandeer the the high ground from us do not die i mean to be honest if if they get downed it might bring them off this high ground because i hate pushing this high ground it's horrendous every angle is bad i should help my team move up a little bit nice stop shooting my team he's got a dj nice i'll bring off the high ground i mean i've got my ultimate but i don't want to use it just yet oh god i missed my shield go get him i mean that's a strategy i've employed many times so i can't say too much [Music] such an annoying building to push i'm just gonna climb on him hello punch him no i didn't get the thumbnail shot [Music] no she's not well that was three gun fights we had one gunfight to start the game at fight nice granted it did last about about three weeks they had a fight at the fountain and then we had the last fight out of states it was like three separate fights you know it wasn't like a progression that's what i find with olympus you see 1700 damage but that was like a fast-paced game we just had to wait around for seven minutes for the last team i feels good to win though i haven't done a lot of winning today so i'll take it ggs
