hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are sniping specifically with the sentinel in the first game that i have for you here today it's not the best sniper in the game it's not going to boost your damage like a longbow or a charge rifle but it definitely is the most satisfying gun in apex legends there's something about landing a 126 damage headshot with a ground loop weapon that just feels amazing so thanks for watching guys i really do appreciate it as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends fox 3 sending the payload hey give me 407. that helps someone yeah yeah that's an octane go i can't even get my gun out at least you can't this is horrendous this is horrendous just been sitting here picking up the same pieces of like loot on the floor for the past five minutes they're both 50 hp there's another team there this team's just running i think that's just a decoy yeah they were getting fired up from like down though under you at the very bottom broken up bottom you can see just padded that was a different team than the first team i was doing that again let me know if you need some light i'm just picking up because i'm running low on energy so i might need to take a oh no i got some i have a 63. i'm dropping something i'm using my weight i'm using my wingman i don't know i don't have a light gun i've picked up in preparation but they haven't won yet thank you i think that team might have just ran away honestly tonight it was a mirage yeah i hit them both for like 150 each so i think they just ran i don't know why chinese are sent now on this connection did they have any energy uh i mean there's a stack that came with the gun i should have i should have came over that's fine 10 seconds and the rings just all nice ready to scorch another button did you um i mean i i had to look but you know that's not a problem you know through this it's a very sad time for everyone involved they're just inking and running every time i don't worry i yeah that'd be lunatics too right all right they're at the bottom of the rope already in front of you i'm gonna have to arm switch these i'm gonna fly up top in a second oh my god they're dream i did that ole miss i've only got a sense now play slow you're fine you're fine he's still playing the bin if you can get inside get behind the door okay he's uh still up there he's dropping i cracked him i got to get you yeah i have to slow you i don't have any big girls same yeah i have a medkit no no i got making him back he got here you got he got i have a i have a medkit i have no energy i have a sniper that's it he's reviving that down there it must have been 17 cracked dead well that was a little bit stressful but we are still breathing i have 22 cells and i just dropped about 85 of them so what happens uh i need a little bit of sniper for some reason i'm using this engine on why not i might help huge cruise over here actually to attack is that someone's diving board yeah well they're like uh rotating in their diving board they're like right here yeah he's right on my ping oh yeah nice nice spot nice spot it's probably gonna take rope right and there's a team on the right yeah i saw last second 63. he just did the crate he's just going more to the right more to the right he did the craziest little matrix book i've ever seen 170 the guy that we saw might have been his teammate who'd already taken the rope maybe i have 13 shots left in this but that's actually kind of a lot i have to slow hill only one hit one for 17 facts one best way she came flying down the hill she's right here on the right back right away nice what okay i died like five feet below that unleashing my singularity i thought i was up there so there might be somebody behind us i think i just heard heels i just need to trust my instincts i can't believe that team started shooting us they're over there fighting now resect mate i'll come in the worst horizon ever give against he's my old opening fire not rudy with you separate angle out on me now i broke played reloading i feel like i'm doing a lot mate the centerline is like you just don't get any damage i'm actually landing good shots you know how much i complain about this oh no but you're absolutely correct i know you got first oh i thought you're going to say the race ball still off the scene oh god there we go i'm landing but this isn't even high ground nope i don't know why you told me i thought it was high it was high ground okay so yeah i'd say horizon broke the horizon tears are popping about where's he at it's down here i missed get back here no he took that mate i can't use it i think he fell he's up there how much punch damage did you do doesn't matter it doesn't matter nice crack now he's cracked weak oh the sliding battery pop i like it you should have committed to it my punch just sounded like a headshot with a sense now i don't know how aha that's kind of crazy that was all about doors apparently oh this guy's just beating him down five i need to go kill that guy up there he's going to be a problem if he's just chilling after the whole game 115 on a lifeline down this way that helps anyone ah see this guy's just been a nuisance hello they're like right beneath us broken she's turning the corner she's broken 50 hp i'll control disconnected there's one on me come in there's another team that was behind that other team we need to come this way what's it download you okay down there i think so the team's pushing up about need like maybe 40 damage she challenged i didn't expect that then i know you're there though she's one she's one she's one i gotta get it played i'm popping about actually one is broken one's up top come on another octane i can hear this rake is down below three different octanes oh he's right below they come from the same way as before once crack one's pretty weak both cracks over there both oh this person's up too i thought she was down i need to heal and stuff mate shields recharging but the rings and we're not yet insider wow i have zero i literally have zero bullets am i gonna try and get to you i'm gonna get as far as possible with this don't worry how much damage you have uh twelve hundred i have yeah i have twelve ninety four thank you i am repairing myself i've had no ammo this whole time you need heavy i've gotta have heavy uh i could i could use a little bit i have an e total i have no shields basically i have shield cells just like nines are here thank you do you have any bats by any chance no i have four cells and that's it i invite cells on my head i want another one climbed into right now right right time i'm um what was that i don't know but i haven't struggled i've no time to even think i can't package over that way east i might go safe i'll follow you i might not have a light bag oh my god i'm gonna be fat fingering these paddles so much that's why i don't use more than one oh my god that took me like a day to get used to it yeah board what oh it's on someone being on top of diving board mom's away they're all in here that long and that hard at that place i mean about 90 of the fights that we got into were just in that in like that little section of that place that's crazy gg i think i deserve more than one kill but
