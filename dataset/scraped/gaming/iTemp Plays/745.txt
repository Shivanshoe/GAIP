Hey whatcha guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I was in the unfortunate position of her a teammate who joined the game and then decided to put his ctrl down and start doing something else which okay because he came back and then we're having a good time and then and then he went and anyone in deeds for the stuff again I'm not sure what was more important than playing apex and winning but he didn't want to play you know well fortunately for him I never gave up on him you know I've respawned him and he returned once more I read a great game hopefully you enjoyed today's video it is a little bitter from what if you do be sure to leave a like rating and subscribe if you're new around here to join the AI template we are incredibly close to ninety thousand and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends alright run off ease my friends I don't think I've ever said that in my entire life I don't remember the last time I landed here but this was the first place that you could drop and I'm hopeful they may turn into all look this law jaw alternate asset appeared you should be able to draw build these things all these doors are closed does that mean that there's no one here quite potentially I'll be honest right well apparently run off is okay Lord great sorry alternating you're off the team nevermind no you're not look at I had to you can you extract in the distance very willing to get over here where is this nothing think you might be on the roof is it just up top is that it no that's a blue lights how do I not know where disease oh it's downstairs I remember now this is literally the only look to join I think now I know where all that morning because I know or do this like if I heard one in bridges I know it would seem that little tiny little Hut all right teammate I'm getting volved in fact you have enough shields and I'm fairly certain you may be okay that's fine by me I guess imagine you know movie the only good thing about your team at being afk is that there is no one to let down when you blindly rushing unusual Smurfs we're not saying so now I've got free a free pass to play like a an absolute lunatic first why are you speaking i find that you're literally not even here and to why my opinion there's nothing I can do that really they're still scrapping Louie oh he's Hey Oh kind of shield you have tell me you how that least some shield and then you have level one just like me with a good news he's gone tell me is the golf helmet at 20% cooldown reduction I think it may be 20% and my ultimate is down to 60 seconds now which is 148 seconds when my teammates back he's back in the fight my ultimate I mean it's not too useful nothing because the abilities are really on much of a call then but this is gonna be so helpful for the to be ultimately stars pretty much cracked did you not hear me or something y'all hear me rampaging across this has got a response oh that could be the right way although very much Daisy I'm absolutely no I'm near reads it's a tragedy Timmy I don't have until ooh you've got and I really shouldn't have this digital threat I'm my mid-range gun because I really don't like you too much if they didn't even want to push us maybe no there's not a chance I was a god of response one what if you just flicked the scene love you literally just they've left us - we got we got away with it so just good hand if I say we just okay you can't climb apparently boss we use the octane ultimate look at this I've already got my pad back 48 seconds on the pad I mean octane as well apparently spawn they have some more buffs on the way coming soon they're not doing with girls that I'm showing you that you would have your boy named a might use it to get me let's forget naming all right brevis less leaf or at least less little bit orbit and escape and there are still 25 people left and my teammates come back from the depths of being afk we're back in the action people here cross and annoyingly they are Octane's garments they are trespassing oh no big scrap please don't come over and fire us whilst within a pig scratch I'd be terrible there we go Hammurabi's to goods bamboozles embarrass most yet just brush after this fine let's get him out of here he's right behind me Billy's teammate and there is a separate squads getting off the revenant he's back I need to back these box out get their banner get to the respawn beacon I have a plan friend I'll do one big one name this must be the revenant so you could pretty climb up extremely easily honestly I see you get for not not even taking the good fight when we would download it let us leave please come back to bite him alright I'm coming for the respawn that works a some hey sometimes you just got to use it as bait and this is probably the best bet this isn't safe but it's not too bad you'll take a pretty about three damage plus some octane so I'll heal it back up automatically and you can hit them you can even risk going into the storm to get ease result stuff back if you got anything decent alright five kills now sometimes you just gotta bait it out making it a bumpy one like that even if I didn't get the last shot in to down that first player there it's still a dementing it would have been a wandering one versus the revenant for a short amount of time if anyone if anyone finds a weak man at City Tower broadly the alternator's like my a medium-range of assault rifle kind of good at modes until I find a wingman of course still got this skull piece that T matter you if you go afk once more come on friend get out of the storm come on you slicing your shin pads up but oh there we go oh you've got one minute fifty to get back in the action otherwise my afraid you'll don't fall don't fall in this storm but he's come back from being afk once I've got faith he's gonna come back from being AF K twice if you didn't think he was gonna play he probably would've just left the game you know I reckon he's lefty he knew his dead maybes quickly went to get a snack called Nixon toiler or something I'm not sure but he's gonna come back and it's gonna be very thankful that I pushed him into the safe zone I mean I might need to play a little bit more carefully now there's that scrap cave pretty more towards the entrance of bridges which is annoying because there's that one bill that people live to see him yeah we all spread out long my friend you're still okay you still I scan your character is still talking corny for me I'm afraid under the habitat fun they didn't push there could be looting my stuff I guess we got 36 seconds to get to the safe zone it was he firing at all there we go wingman beautiful it's got a level 3 extended heavy Magus mal which is annoying because I think area at least level 1 and then the level teeth but their generation then half our meat crawl that's reckon see now coming on coming over I should be able to make it there in time I'm acting and it looks fairly close there to the ring - this man is gonna have absolutely nothing in terms of in terms of blitz but it's alright actually it's a Jeff box here we're good look at his health I should have come over sooner I thought I thought your way closely engineering there my friend it's all it's all the junk it's not fat there are only two squats left and I heard firing so I'm looking nervous that these guys are gonna be um already engaged in fisticuffs you know they're already gonna be here scrap him without has been there I wouldn't look at these friends it's absolutely nothing it's a bad idea don't risky teammate I suspect that Pat fine doesn't really have too much at the moment and we also don't have the Sun Vantage what these guys have fit so advantage on us even worse than not having it so we rocked out around to this he's inviting just a little long the way to we need some loot it is using light and lights and energy I've got light for you I've got no energy my even using this are you going free charge gave him a few shield batteries he stopped to leave that previous place it was unlooted to as long as these guys haven't rotated to gatekeepers here instead I think we should be okay Scalise treasure packets bodies first game of the day then first game of the day and he's going afk like that unbelievable don't Tommy its diving board every single game on Kings Canyon have you got your odds please please don't run to please don't use that please don't they will hear it they'll have higher ground honest it's not working yeah is that are you using a speaks are you firing me with this sleep fire from that far from on top of diamonite there I'm incident many matter too much these guys on there the shot yes it's right again diving board man give it a go anything so it's preoccupied you know he's getting flanked that last issue what we need to do here is get close and wait for a good opportunity for these guys to actually properly be fighting close-range and they're not here to sell me chickens thanks now the team still down like we need the other team to get up here I just want a flat analogous Ethel all my work all my word this is not now the team's coming over to for our friend [Music] good news these the both teams repair at least time you got a full sendy not again I mean see me right oh do do the last one okay I guess you mr. hopped down or the other guy down in the rink or something my words that was that was an experience right there look at there's no smiley robot face still thing in his banner he's no avoid anyone nearly 2,000 damage of that my friends is why you do not give you do not give up on your afk teammates if he was half a kilometer inside the storm to say I wouldn't have revived him half a kilometer inside the storm but if he was I would even have to use my jump pad I didn't have to push him onto the jump pad and he would have sent him flying I reckon I could have got some I could have I could have taken him some distance there especially with the golf helmet I had but he came back and didn't get a kill but toned your damage in the last fight I don't think he would have done any damage before that he's not actually that bad if you think about I think that's like pretty much a kill he probably made that octane here though and then when I flew over the top I was able to kill him fairly easily it's work tight that's all that matters thank you for watching it was an interesting game and yes I'll see you on the next one [Music]
