hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as you guys know i have been quietly putting in some hours into ranked on apex and we are currently diamond three very close to diamond two and i have a game for you today using the charge rifle of all guns the charge rifle is just so satisfying to use it's really frustrating if you're on the other side of it i think it's something about the noise and the constant damage it's just incredibly aggravating but using it yourself to get some rp feels so gosh darn good i hope you guys are enjoying these ranked videos thank you for watching and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah we can line up top all the good loots up top supposed to be at least i'm already on the ground you feel good i've got a charge rifle uh pretty far i'm surprised that there's still this many people up with how many people in a gauntlet yeah i expected this many people to die at this very start me too understood we can see on the wall here hey i don't know if that's a on the ball behind the wall oh they're on the wall uh kevin's the pathfinder still down here okay leaving you alone hello nobody's up here okay pathway it was further east okay they're going up the road oh they're by the rope they're not going up there crack blue on one nice job okay on his new armor i just fell up accident it's okay who's my friend cracks anyone qp uh he went sorry i can't it's in the trees like this way kind of little bit to the left of that noise i don't even see them they his teammates were really far away already from what i could tell he was just waiting for his grapple corner so he was behind that's box box over there uh a baby his name is like elves yeah yeah yeah that's a listen he didn't have anything now he doesn't he had two light bullets oh my god bless him okay firing 50 blue game cracked nice team close to me not with you just yet how much decent damage to those guys [Music] i'm throwing a pad down here level four send me back nerds i want my health back 66 they're not going to shoot me are they bro i love that you both have car drivers i need some snipers if you see someone spotted here many crack bloodhounds all right now for the love of god pick up some shield cells please say add some sniper rings you need 26 let's go with the crafty art things about 84 around here craft if you needed some stuff [Music] him teammates let's go bro nice job sorry screaming at us mate i'm putting a medkit on come on shots fix the problem i'm gonna go take a little gander oh a little cheeky fake might be able to do a nice little third here oh we gotta get you boys some sniper balls honest with you i'm not playing too aggressive here there's a sniper elbow on this balcony he's over here yes i'm just gonna try to get an angle and see if i can third i'm not pushing too hard your gratitude eight times somewhere the guy in the window too look at the window my friend's really awake 15 at the 15. yeah they're trying to sky nate yeah i'm backing up i'm backing up this is a nice little ledge run yeah you guys are doing god's work with your charge i don't have too many shots left they're sliding down the hill in the water look at the water look at this okay is that them am i safe from the other guys i saw one i think it's that team yeah right here we're going back flush flesh nice taking a moment oh they're getting dirty let's go this way come to this building it did have chapstick before i took one eight they were fine oh there's one in the corner you can't have that team jumping on our head following our trail did they like let's say just love to cause they caught them i just i almost have another pad we can pad to the rock from here too it isn't did that not go down there i'm jumping down there in the water oh man what a third that was i love being cautious just walking through all the gas no problem someone had sniper one sniper one sniper what oh no [Music] uh i'm gonna throw a boss too did he have a good bolt uh either either blue one less than one minute all right i'm gonna walk up walk up into the cave here yeah hold it make sure that we don't get uh held out the injectors thank you your gratitude i think he's still using it we stay on this app we just hold up make sure nobody comes up behind us yeah and then everybody's gonna have to fight in front of us no i'm gonna hold behind since you can hold front with gas pretty easy okay i'll make sure nobody comes up behind us actually has a charge rifle i think yeah he's still sniping and he's popping off by the looks of it contact with targets okay come back come back come back conduct a search right here safe play safe i can't i'm not i can't do anything about that my friend that's too far we find ourselves if he dies he dies we just we know how we gotta play yeah especially now i've said playsafe right here we say it we stay on this half of this of this choke and everybody's gonna have to pull fight each other it's gonna make sure there's no teams behind us we're gonna make sure all three teams are over there i think they are he's pinging team on the left there's a there's a team here and there's teaming on our rights i think you're absolute i think you're fine but it's worth double checking that battling the enemy we're so clean we're so clear 100 and one we can't let that guy get too over over again we don't want to get there's a team up there we're safe here wait we need to we need to just we need to hold this yes they're all going to converge on this front side we don't want to be there exactly oh don't die let's retreat i'm gonna leave a trap up here we can't take damage either like yeah we have to steam that that that third target can you come with me can you come with me and clear this we have to clear our back real quick no no i'm almost 100 sure i know what the teams are okay yeah we're good recharging there's a team on top of market there's a team on top of those rocks there's a team at that one salvage building or they don't have to move this is perfect one of them is only a duo at the most one of them to duo because teammate knocked one and it got thursday i don't think it was that team we just need to make we need to force those two teams yeah we need to be in the cave we can't be pushable don't be rushable exactly we play too far forward they're going to push us pushing him and pushing him they're pushing him just ignore it we can't help them we need them i still see everything all right we got this easy peasy bro it's more realistic for these two teams to fight each other which is really nice i almost one clip the horizon nice on the left or on the left no matter what even if you get yeah he's playing aggressive see this is what people don't get if you play aggressive you need to let them fight yeah the other team is full you need to keep making them fight dying outside the ring introducing we got this brother you have your all yeah yeah yeah and i have that there knock on the right down on the right okay i think i'm going to reload my r3 i'm just shooting her in the sky with the massive nice play that perfectly i played man well played because it takes a bit of patience you know well that's the thing if we committed to one fight on the left or the right it didn't matter then just the opposite team would win yeah winner of that play yeah you are the apex champions good job dude well played hey mate there we go y'all we're frying with those charge rifles huh that charge was great close for uh for diamond myself one more of those and i'm diamond one more of those and then i'm one more of those away from diamond two
