hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and it is not often that i use two of these same weapons in apex but today we are using double wingman's double wingmen wing mandem two too many wingmans now i love this weapon at medium range but i'm honestly not sure i've ever landed a hip-fired shot from a wingman in my entire apex legends career which is definitely the way you are supposed to use this gun at super close range it's something that i have to work on and what better way to practice than to use two of the same weapon now i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's like at least an extra thousand damage for the intel yeah yeah yeah yeah let's not take this gun please don't take this gun please don't take this gun thank you i love the wingman so much so i'm gonna use two of them no cap are you doing like a video thing what's happening i'm using double wingman to call me the wing the wingmen okay i'm gonna use double energy because i can because i'm lobo so i really want this portal but okay right here start out oh my god let's go 88 energy there's no way this is oh cringe mate there's no way it's gonna work i can't wait to meet them i set the portal this i 300 heavy and two men's oh yeah i'm gonna need help with this

i am still shielding absolutely destroyed what's going on thick clan not ideal energy ammo here ah i've got a wingman with a digi on it i'm going to give it a go that's not the play at all iron sights are acceptable but one time is s here no i feel like sometimes the iron sights are too clean i don't know  more shots with the iron sight sometimes it's weird they are really clean i just sometimes i just can't track well too much too much blockage on my screen a lot of there's a lot of blockage there's a lot of blockage yeah i don't like blockage i still i still really think that lobo needs like a a sombra tactical i agree that'd be so good should be able to like drop it right here and then have like a certain like uh either time frame or like a certain like distance to where i can go and then like teleport back but it should be like a bit more telegraphed because that would be way too good or it would need it would need like some type of trail like wraith like yeah yeah great as a trail you can you can like follow it once you learn it like anything i don't think it would be too bad as long as it's got like a certain range on it um that would be such a good tactical wow that'd be amazing i'd love that poor teammate he's good try trying to keep up virgin paddy here no there's no way that's that's the vibe i don't know if there is someone there i can't see anyone i hear a
