hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some pathfinder and fortunately apex have come through and blessed us with their bug fix of course with his update recently grappling left you with a visual bug that could only be fixed by climbing something now that's fixed which is amazing however i am a little annoyed with pathfinder's situation at the moment he was supposedly buffed in the mid-season update with his maximum cooldown on his grapple still at 35 seconds but smaller distances meant a lower cooldown this sounds great but the issue is because the cooldown is based on distance the game would have to wait until your distance is calculated and then it starts the cooldown which often times is the maximum 35 seconds you can see that here in this clip i'm going to slow it down for you look how long it is to calculate the distance and start the call down it means the real cooldown for a decent grapple is about 38 seconds in this case but if you go further it takes even longer for it to start we have been scammed pathfinder mains our cooldown is pushing 40 seconds now it used to be 15. i am outraged i hope they fix this by accounting for the calculation time in the maximum cooldown so it's still only 35 seconds at an absolute maximum because we have been nerfed once more it's a bit of a shame but anyway at least i can grapple with that a glove on my face which was a little bit horrendous so hopefully you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh my god glove in my face let's go let's see all right let's see let's see though yeah yeah yeah sorry so sorry i'm landing in this door unless
