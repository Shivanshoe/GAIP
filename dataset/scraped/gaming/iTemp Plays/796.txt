hey what's up guys its rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more 8x legends of course I'm right John time to play apex today it was the first time since I think he was the last day that we had Kings Canyon on day John Luke which was what last Tuesday and before that the last time played wards edge must have been the week before that so I think it's honestly been about two weeks since I played warfare about a week since I've played apex legends in general I've been playing a lot of war zone and then I brought my warzone muscle memory over to affix legends so I'm trying to ping things with upon d-pad I call my grapple ease it's a bit of a struggle however we do have a great game here for you still and I hope you enjoy it if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the Empire and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's all securities Mimi goes I had to go or later no one because I have not popularity I mean apart from today we make a we can half don't steal my shell please change of the treacherous if you're not a friends you're an enemy dropped aims unhappiness you want your friend non enemy alright well off to a good start here a pulse hemlock what is the flatline p.m. sylveon I was the most pathetic Slyke absolutely zero momentum on that why well I didn't really do too much there which is unfortunate because my team like Sidney valve is that that wasn't it wasn't anything please stop I need this woman from her out okay Icahn used to spit pies that's against the law I trust your friends you're a rampage he's melee him I'm new I forget the revive okay this is what we do you know if you know you're not too useful shooting which is unfortunate a case for me at the moments Oh it'll load vengeance oh we're next in line they might escape why not then you can do things like revive people and stuff like that you know this is incredibly difficult for me to have focus on the game pipe someone's here to syringe here it's more of a target and yes I did just try and clean with up on the d-pad cuz I've been playing too much war zone a bit of an issue I will admit I'd say gosh I think you're my shield aren't see anything give me off please thank you I'm serving you in friends I thought I was way close to the edge there than I actually was I thought I was gonna be shooting heat finally this guy whilst dropping down but I was just walking backwards since I'm on fire I guess Arius killed him I killed him my finger I said weak that man was the mere fact of him being spotted there just took him out of the game he was he was a half a health half health point all right well this big fight would know slightly he's incredibly difficult rid of me so the good news is now I have a purple exhale iMac on my 99 in my shield if it thank you would you get the hey I can figure to fear I've not played too many games today but what I have noticed is that these lobbies are dying off real fast this is kind of a chunky skin really I do like this game my favorite skins on this game for the weapons and the other characters to be fair the legends are the ones where you have to pay the legend tokens because they're looking more exclusive they're aliyev rarer and this is one of those ones where you have to have one of the legendary skins and then are you paying any daytime tokens is it like 15,000 or something incoming care package but yeah I think it's like 15 115,000 something like that 15 is involved somewhere hundred stack here in some way three yeah those are my thoughts on on skins if you're interested you must try to see me why not please be someone here to fight oh well oh well we have to huh a lifeline with the golds buddy okay it's gold armor please don't embarrass me please don't you'll heal enough your party's old health she's challenging that you can't do this though okay nice trying to grapple so much more before the RFM is nice about it or not then cuz they have a concealed there you go and they have God everything this guy our raided the vaults and didn't give anything that teammates can't say I've never done that myself but if you're a lifeline you should probably give your gob shelter to a teammate there you know buddy it's pretty best on Pathfinder because he congratulate Phoenix killer then prorack fall back into the fight or at least that's the theory yeah I was trying I've literally in that gunfire I forgot the I forgot the bun or my grapple so that explains why I was just looking at the bank wall for a little bit I'm hoping they try and run away from that fight then because at the moment it's in the distance the scrap that is but in the future you may be in the not-so-distant distance you know it's just one of those situations oh they'll keep coming that's right keep coming I don't use my grapple because I might get outnumbered here I'll get too aggressive okay that wasn't my kill don't worry about it not gonna get that one either even though I've melted his face off i melted his face he's melting my feet he was an unfortunate trait can I get this one perhaps listen it was a team effort three any joins they're gluten so difficult for me what's your party we're supporting earth I'm like a gate kept ass I'm in about two minutes a luteum is a problem anyway I mean everyone knows it's on on the channel in the IT empire but when I have to think of it this much I love French gosh darn it listen here are your friends and a please D better and it's body full house it's a serums Anna's Kota you try oh yeah you traded two teammates Shoom in the back my teammate son have an angle and this guy's got a gun children in behind a buff for some reason I'm not really sure why I could do too much chemistry you can't climb that I've tried many times that's all right I've got the utricle I stole the other kill oops five seven pills hey Sam hey Christmas miracles guys me have to go through the Phenom I've had this comment a few times since Valdez Bonet but this is definitely scrapped kv2 this is this is the scrap caves revenge this one really low I've got 120 spare but it goes quick on the havoc the scrap in the distance I still spotted making contact with enemy messed up is that alcohol good I should put that in the new trailer let's definitely put that in the new trailer give me your are 301 no one's got any energy rooms that's all what you're at a level-one extending mic level ooh nope Oh s close I just look to the radar trying to find a red dot good grief this is try and play two at once is a challenge to say the least no to a fatty week hey that guy's already down are you weak cuz you know I think he's trying to get in the fight never mind I need high Grange it's my frame maybe on a delay but I still got some tactical thought what's going on here high ground ease winds one squad remaining [Music] [ __ ] the sniper down pretty I'll not get in this I was trying to hide [Music] I can't they are on a game like that I mean I'm pinging with up on the d-pad I'm the game which burned the grapple lease I'm running around aimlessly I'm not used to sensitivity differences we killed 23 people I've got I've got 2,500 damage wait he said up he's a damaged batch always at 2,000 3,000 4,000 it doesn't matter I mean I've already got the 4,000 one but still 12 kills shout out the team the crypto didn't have as many kills or damage but he was in the drone half the time spotting them even peeing them slowing them damn distracting them solid yet we nearly killed half the lobby right there if you consider the fact that there are 57 other people 23 over 57 not a bad game that's all I think this is proof that if you want to get good at a game you just need to continuously play half liters mr. memory I'm telling you if you have to stop and think about what you're doing you don't stand a chance because there's people out there that don't have to think they can close their eyes and play these these sorts of games mind your having said that I do just wing its maybe I'm an idiot I don't know thank you for watching her I do appreciate it and the wound back on world's edge here I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
