hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and it is no secret the valkyrie is a popular legend here in season 11 not only in ranked to get free rotations but also competitive the professionals almost all of them have a valkyrie on the team because she is useful for those three rotations any point during the game but i'm starting to realize just how good she is on storm point itself just because of how good her flying is at the different poise i'm always at like checkpoint there's a obviously like the area at the top that you want to stay on if you drop down it can be annoyed to try and get back up the same thing can be said about antenna the same thing can be said about barometer there's a big difference between the top level and the bottom level and valkyrie is just so good at traversing a map as well as having a free rotation as her ultimate she's so good i hope you guys enjoyed the video i've got two games here for today i'm sure you will enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends outside everyone's the one i was looking at yeah sorry i didn't realize that even that close mate uh it's fine that's just insane i got here late all right everyone just to get to me generally take is too good charging on my shield broke um nice move unless you want to get barbecued i'm dead nice nice i have a one cell i have two back seven cells recharging shields i'll drop you some cells mate i got some recharging i'm using an re45 because i know you hate it oh i think it's you're using it because you hate yourself i i'm using it because i hate myself yes yes the only reason people use re i think you might be right is stuff it's my last bat i have two cells uh i have about few ready thank you oh my god okay here just take it soon to be me oh okay this guy's lessons for us now that's though oh this way they're fine at mill there we need a uh we need an ash ash valkyrie is the combo on this map you see where people are dying and i fly to him you know yeah it's a two-step process there's one to the right running up the hill oh yeah oh wait i saw him and because it wasn't moving i didn't look at him properly i sucked i didn't win so flying on the right good we're inside go back these guys are hugging them hold up i'm coming with you how am i this bad oh god there are so many people here yep i hope 20. him a little bit here a little bit noise uh did you kill it there now our surroundings she might be yes she's popping him angles one [Music] bangalore's very one whole squad crashed and burned oh my god that's probably the guy where his man is i was over here oh was it oh that's another team to recharge i have a p10 uh p20 secondary by the way does anybody yeah i have a p10 it's like a p20 but it's worse i switched to pk oh we both just baited each other so hard wings up he's burning someone that p10 extended who's the glow there my favorite wake up charging on my shoulder when's wings my ultimate is ready like spaghetti the ultimate's already back yeah 60 seconds it's crazy literally every single game before you're getting this place is loosely so people have been here 435 in the balkan inside nice craft i don't drop one ah i'll craft one i'm sorry i'll have alter here in a second especially if i tap this i think this place tony valkyrie makes this map so much better no it's not perfect but it helps it doesn't help doesn't help a little bit no i'll cancel this [Music] oh my god he's on the roof in my jaw might be at the team i headshot the bluetooth yeah it's another team in the other building okay giving my shields a rechargeable headshot oh that wasn't you finder i thought my decoy was our teammate oh my god i'm already thank you they lost a gunfight because the wraith was at my feet and i couldn't strafe properly i was trying to get into cover oh my god wings out my cats do that when i'm in the kitchen they body block you they're body blocking me you know trying to brush up trying to get some treats whatever keeping you from uh armor swapping i can't get to the armor in the cupboards very tactical i think once you use it twice you can't use it anymore for the rest of the game but for the rest of the game really i didn't know that i think i don't know if that's that might be wrong but i don't think it like reloads the passive weird because when you land if you use that it doesn't it doesn't use up your like actual ability and there's compounded outside of it i saw somebody over here yeah zip lining oh you just get a head shot i was already kind of weak i had no shield anyway oh my god it's coming all over the place i cracked him in there they bounced twice the heck was that no fear oh crazy that's stupid oh that's actually a really good thermite i'm impressed are they getting the car again or is it different damn he's good looking how people are still here oh yeah there's still one on me too i hopped out on the car i fell back it seemed like padded this way i don't know what the heck's going on mate trying to play the game this guy these guys are just driving their car on me recharging shields that is one of the biggest names ever from me tell me you weren't trying to pop a phoenix kit please please tell me you weren't she was recharging no why oh this last thing let's see oh no it's not to you guys i'm not with you at all by the way this game's gonna give me ptsd 100 this has been a weird one i thought i keep getting jumped i have ultimate giving my shield they just free spawn oh no there's a care package we are go for burn bamboozles that's weird that feels like a bug it's too strong and i i think it's always been like that because i think i remember being like that back in the day that must be what's your kills in damage uh cheers i have eight kills twenty seven hundred five eleven and twenty four hundred okay nice we're already inside the next ring i got this not him right there perched on me yes i thought it was i wasn't going to zoom in though because i was thinking there's no way that's not normal 245 good times want to confuse him though our teammate just fried him yes i saw that and i i looked at it with that aim in there and i was thinking there's no way there's no way that's all like i always do it's perched like a decorative gargoyle looks champions gg won't play i'm telling you valkyrie makes this map fun i'm telling you she helps which definitely helps nice
