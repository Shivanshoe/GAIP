hey what's Agassi twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more warzone of course now played this game quite a lot and have only had a handful of wins although that does include back-to-back wins I had 17 kills in one of them and then 12 kills and a win in the very next game but it is so difficult to win on this game and today I'm playing by myself I mean I've left Phil on so I've got two random teammates but I haven't got a party which makes it even more difficult I've skipped the first I think seven or eight minutes because he's all looting and after playing this game for a little while I've realized that by far the most exciting part is the mid to late game there are still a lot of things left typically by the gas moves in really fast at this stage in the game and it's all about strategy and positioning and trying to get angles for your teammates you know throwing the right smoke grenade and stuff like that it's so much fun so if you've played this game and you're having a little bit of a tough time I definitely suggest trying to play the early game maybe a little bit slower people have no reason to move the state in the game so you often run into defensive teams you just gotta be patient and wait to the mid to late game is so intensive work so I hope you guys enjoy today's warzone gameplay made a little playlist available on my channel that has all my warzone uploads in there I mean listen there's only three videos in there and after moments but it's early days still more to come so you can check that out it's on my channel for all be a future war zone a game place and I hope you enjoy today's one so thank you for watching I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we might get a little bit of action here I see the loader Josh can just drop randomly but when it's this close to a like a bi station there you go you can assume the people of bought in then just logic down from that's my shot like I would have died if I learned the sniper shot it's guys disputed in the last Belvin of all time stuck a little bit is a decoy going off this one in this building I don't get shine the side that's the only problem there we go squad wipe no self advice to deal with fortunately I mean I'm pretty sure two of them parachuted down from the sky so I think two of the more two got respawned which means that they can't come back in their gooblat sometimes you have to be careful when you're killing a whole team nice teammate we had enough to buy them back anyway even if you found that so you've just saved us four and a half grand it needs to respawn someone person before cook here we can definitely just throw parties and we have a little bit of high ground on the hill as well people are using two presses though a nice job team I'm talkative a suppresser I never lose this close though I sort of trained myself to hear gun fights and try and disregard them a little bit because they're always further away than you think on this game like it sounded close but was that to be close on this occasion for some reason alright who is this guy trying to call a fatigue he's crawling down the hill maybe maybe was only because it was further away from me well maybe he's trying to crawl to a teammate a cold-blooded you can still see him though unfortunate is behind a massive brick wall sigh trying to shoot through this he's not gonna really be too much of an option yeah was that the same person I can remember oh yeah a beautiful mount you saw like because he was had self raised I think a beautiful man right there that's exactly what I wanted to do all right what's nice we got here Hayek's 15 it's a custom 851 I mean the camera is horrendous but the guns pretty good you're not lending to headshots there I'm not showing too much of a fan of the thermal sight I don't like the actual optic like when you zoom II like it's helpful helpful to spot people but apart from that I'm not too much of a fan all right eight kills we have no kills leading up to that first gunfight that's two squad wipes and two random people do you make you need these desperately desperately but if you're out we've got a buy station there where you came from nice to running knew that hey they're coming back but the sounds coming in never mind alright well we waited too long we've got sold I've got 24,000 smackeroonies here sitting in my back pocket carnie vests them always a terrible idea especially one of your teammates I mean he didn't even pick up the old Ronnie Lee go I don't think he picked up the unplayed that I draw from either because he's still lacking the armor plate Department where to go muffled all jump shots where we care for this team nearby though its armor this demonstrates a little bit okay what's this maniac doing he was in store as well he was the last guy in his team he just flew down and a chopper unbelievable teammates down I think he actually got run over by that helicopter it's got be careful this of the team's delicious then we'll fight some time there anywhere the troops just a man saying a garage by himself unbelievable half man half sighing a garage by himself let's eat sanic Garrett Poe himself man the world's worst superhero this is busier than I thought this was gonna be we've still got these teams deal with that I mean they're scrapping another team as well so that's two teams out this way he's dropping our name just I'm here with your friends come get your own loot this isn't you you guys get the loot this is pretty much shot I thought it would be I shot it with about three clips I'd stopped my teammates in this I'm not gonna go to fajn they're giving this roof I stopped that my teammates in but I don't know I don't even more let's get shot out if three people start firing that once we are pretty much screwed meruit it's a bit risky thing up here especially the sniper glint foot so trying to at least help my team to rotate into this dorm there are two people two teams on its way that entire time I can see the gunshots fighting you becoming friends I'm looking over you okay I've no idea where that came from my teammates have successfully rotated in so I've been on that rooftop is probably a terrible idea I think Nova was in the store I hate how they do that but those on Team 8 are adopted for the wrong person at Oxford rain unfortunately there's a buy station here all right these jump shots are not working you're my back friends I'm still trying to get a flame nice double kill we desperately need to try and use this fire station I've got 31,000 in the back pocket unbelievably my teammates are struggling for armor plates we could buy so we could buy the world supply of armor plates these guys still chilly I assumed it was him that came over smoke I'm not sure he's actually gonna come over to this we call this in straight away let's all know that he's like rushing them nevermind okay in plant what tennis need to spend their money [Music] they found come on Ritchie take the body armor I could buy so many [Music] all right five squads left midcal here must want to thank us for some reason I mean the finest of press sniper range is not really going to make people rush us but we need to try and chill out a little bit on the edge of the storm here and try and hold onto these two IVs for as long as possible I think we thought had some coffee instead behind I think we need to clear these guys out and once we make a shot from multiple directions gonna get my gun I should have pushed through the right [Music] now I would start the reviving what I try to reload I don't think would have changed too much though ah stuck between two teens I think I should went to the right we got pinched by the team at the ball as well third place could reach the end of these games are so fun but I don't think we saw some for first ten minutes there and then all the action comes at once way that's my fault 13 kills though not too bad friends not too bad at all playing solo
