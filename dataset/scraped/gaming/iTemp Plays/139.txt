hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here in season 12 and there are so many different things to cover but the first one that i want to cover here on the channel is of course the new legend mad maggie who i was incredibly excited for because she's really good with shotguns and i love the mastiff her kit is all about speed and aggression and out maneuvering your opponents and if there's one thing i love to do it's out maneuver my opponents i hope you guys are enjoying season 12 as much as i am thank you for watching i really do pretty chasy and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends people about two seconds ahead of us look at him yeah there's so much loot though right yeah it's just kind of crazy still keep saying he's talking a lot no gun no gun no gun no guns person probably has nine guns killed one person shotgun team on me i'm coming slowly i've got no shields after this so i am taking fire wow looks like that was the last one oh so close she was so close to getting that i don't know well the angle we came out i think everybody landed over there yeah probably there's a rampage here but i can't bring myself to use it yeah you gotta be down bad yeah like me wait no no no no thank you must be close and the lifeline yes i should have punched her in it i actually love that ability yeah the maggie she threw her or ult at me and it bounced me in the air and i downed her while i was like midair and like getting hit from here hit me kind of a lot i don't think he damaged me but i'm stunned you know i could already see he's like disorientating just throws you all over the place you can still like hit your shots you still see anybody yeah you can i have 40 light rains i might say that's 57 might take the rampage can't do it can't do it before she closes i love abilities you can there's like a big skill gap like i think ashley's queue is really good if you're smart you can get such big value from me finder's gravel perfect example that means i should have taken the rampage and never stopped firing shatter caps i need to my i my mind doesn't even look for like the the purple attachments anymore because they're all they're all like useless at this point hot trash like i either don't use any of the guns that they work for or they're just not good yeah so i i need to actually look out for the power points think about it uh this has all been looted and they're fine over here i left smell a rotten egg what's wrong i'm lost in this maze of confusion that'd be so cool imagine be on the other map and you could see like you could see olympus above you i like tarkov uh but you can see lighthouse from shoreline kind of thing there to tell you a story about how i tried to get to all these yeah captivating story it was captivating these guys are angry man there's one on the rock this is a terrible road wait he's still up here i did nothing but nor did i i actually did nothing take damage did you may do everything yeah pretty sure okay yeah yeah i didn't do anything honestly man i took damage i took a lobby you're gonna fight yeah so yeah back to my captivating story yes i the first time i ever played tarkov i was trying to run to the other maps let me tell my story oh my god i don't know how it ends that's the end i died what happened hydration running imagine rage queen like that he's popping off oh he actually is i wanted more this is what my damage is like my enemies keep hp why would you put the hammer points away maybe after reloading and you didn't want to reload it reload then maybe he didn't want to reload maybe he's a bad player that's why he's dead nope he's done anyway unless you've got your hammers uh yeah there's only four squads left i need to pull over so i could i i can find it in the beginning that's the only way this works i stick with the pk quite a massive oh chef's case you know we should probably go top i have a rope in one two three i should have count uh should have counted backwards right probably could have gone up to like twenty yep directing oh my god the lobby dies so fast yep and no it's not it everybody's not even going to that one place no it's on me any jeweler coming in they just can't go the thing the thing come on the thing hello how do you not listen to these comms i didn't even notice there was like a whole city underneath i'm not making i was just looking at that no because it's got teleport that better be a new map oh that'd be so cool oh i'm dropping there i'm dropping there let's go that actually looks so good really really long on my pink i don't know this back side somewhere maybe this one oh all right now you're going to need to it's loads of loot i think too late detour i got a shotgun ball i'm happy with this level three the next ring is i need to leave i'm just trying to heal for oh they're wrong i threw my wrecking ball that leaves speed pads and detonating their enemies by the way yeah detonate any shotguns i need a massive shield oh i got my crypto kill was this him he was there must be another team either side there has to be this place
