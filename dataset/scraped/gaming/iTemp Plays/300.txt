hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't know how people play legends who aren't mobility characters the game that i have for you today would never have seen the light of day if i was playing anyone apart from octane or pathfinder being able to sprint into a battle to retrieve two banners and then to escape afterwards is so much more difficult if you're playing someone like gibby or lifeline and it's plays like these that make me love playing mobility legends in apex so much so thanks for watching guys i
