hey mr. closet which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more eight picks legends of course now last season I made it all the way to 8x predator by myself solo [ __ ] in open random teammates and at the start of the season I've to be on squad of neglected the ranked mode on here but I played a little bit of solo on rank today and I actually I'm starting to enjoy it again now I very much doubt are bound to make it to masters by the 12 of May which is in 9 days we can definitely have some fun with it and every rank that we achieve now carries over to the next season even though there's a soft herb reset if you think about it if you want to get taken down one-and-a-half francs it still means that I'm going up ranks does that make sense over for the video today for some reason why Mike was slightly turned to the site and it sounds a little bit strange he'll be fixed in the next video or self shouts out these three people on the screen can use my g4 code a link for that will be in the description but anyway enough chitter-chatter solo ranked he's back I hope you enjoy our sea war in five and a half seconds my friends are we actually uncontested I wants to come this way because usually 1200 okay there is no peer that explains why we were getting shot from here be the day you again shocked find someone that wasn't a pathfinder all the way up top now probably thinks one of them there's no way they you spoil up there I recognize it and update that I thought I must have missed or something give me the bag please odd very much enjoy carry stuff around this game how else were supposed to carry around 34 shield cells enteries makes me sad it also makes me sad that no one led to the containment it's actually my first place - so fight recently you guys see that yeah you know you know wait I think it was the undeniable noise of scrapping and medicines can I pass my dead son get there quick please not going on anymore I thought those shield cells oh no wait 234 unfortunate thing for it sounds dead but hopefully people are looking for a long time because that's my fans those just blew shields in there what's that that's unfortunate kill later and I haven't even seen [ __ ] these guys into existence I think I'll be in that French you got a scan he doesn't eat a scan this wasn't a guide we've bullish shields but there's no doubt because both my new shield so it's not really going anywhere doing this just in case one comes over I'm pretty sure he switched these sites for me oh you found purple you tell me there was blue shield up top to set you know Ben thank you and purple to stay in this corner and I was the first one there both times I know I've left with the worst armors me there's me I'm receiving thank you beautiful I thought I refrain from dropping Franklin a Jew this second shield sells very difficult kill me but we'll manage never look towards the west side here because school tony's popping off on king's canyon as always don't ready clip me thank you very much every time I walk past at that particular door you know there's no exit this is one door you can always expect it cause I knew this would lead us towards some sort of scrap flight Oh people actually find in it what people here tell you right here don't too much noise to make a sound Bushman every spawning they might run over you I get greedy [Music] these guys just done the limbo there's only one of them it's a 2v1 I messed up entirely I won't have made it to this I don't even need to here looking like a mean wasn't it so we felt that wasn't my aim as much I think that was more to do the challenge was find me a nice job team I'm not sure what happens to the team there was respawning because I don't think that was then you say evil shields say none more my friends thanks it's tempting to take the the two times with the anvil receiver cuz I'm gonna use a quite a lot but it's not one of us one Eva this is the Mirage oblique oh my word I think you speak to facts be Mirage baby I don't never want you go as well how many people are on to you with level one evil shields the haze path to the right mr. P alright I'm coming for you you've got two options you either run or you heal if he heals we can catch up to him and if he runs he's running around on her back twelve sorry use now for cedar George Tenet's these big all coppery wash it so every level I do intend to lose this fair amount thank you no way even with level one look the only character in the game where they can have level 1 Evo shields I'm still tank 39 shots Miller flatly sooner I was way closer than it should have been my friends will be careful this game from us scrap came there you go all right two pieces good news here firstly is that Cole tilts on the going to house hopefully we can get ourselves some cocktails and secondly I had shot the guy in the back all right are my words another photograph now got a revised I was too slow and see that he's taken me a long time to realize this but I believe this is my favorite sign the o99 I like it more than the destroy threat I like it more than the normal one times h Punk the holographic for some reason he's outrageous on the online tonight or that rotation I should have been a long time ago it's just so good I don't know why I preferred the one time stage cog on everything else apart from the other nights nine and maybe the Peacekeeper I have to aim with the left stick at this range that's what I get for not taking the two times bruiser but I can't name with that at close range tracking wasn't great there but I believe in general my tracking his body better we've got one time's strange if you guys haven't tried it because I know that I haven't even though both of these items have been in the game since day one give it a go that's my approach tip of the day chuni tomorrow for another pro team all right once crap cave gave us a bunch of decent scraps wasn't necessarily inside the page but it was close it was close enough for me to be able to talk about scratch cake you know that's what you need we got post 81 arcade good three eight kills me to see some netting on the best piece of high ground on the entire game never mind I've slid off the side didn't mean to do that Starly notes I like Owen ranked you can tell that you have spectators and I think they did that because cheaters would obviously turn their cheats off if someone was watching it and it's more prone relevant prevalent I don't know prep one of the team in ranked but I like that because I don't like it when people watch me because I get self-conscious and I'll try and impress them we move little stir okay nice I've got a pair of you knows these guys that do be running around Italy I'll tell you sit right with me are they respawning to 3v2 if we can get there quick enough be careful I don't turn around a train stop this one coming over good that's fine at that range I promise you with the two closed freezer I'm not I'm not lent in any chance I don't know why it's just that's way life is sometimes but it's annoying because whenever I want to use the anvil receiver I guess a variable scope would actually be pretty good but that's also quite at rusev on the screen I don't want those either I heard a little something what's that make such as satellites when you through that okay that's why you screaming pain he was acoustic okay there's no anything here is that there's no one here I think he's literally the same please I'm running I'm abusing the Phoenix kit which is fair enough lays the third poppy graph of the game chill verse in Seattle still challenging some reason if only I could lend of sharks in turn hopefully that's what's just the same team champion destroyed alright well I think this is the time that we should start to slow down Long Beach because it is ranked and you do get those teams that just can't a little bit so I would assume that both these teams have three plays in so if you get caught out by two teams we could easily die I reckon we just job Simpsons care package hopefully get some gold shields for the boys and then we'll run I've had with gold shields even over to go soon Oh fine I'll take it okay it's gold I should be I should be alright we just know 99 no throw balls okay one Franklin eight I just forget that they move by the way I'm gonna keep one sack of heavy just in case I need to pick up a heavy boom if I run out of gravy shots really Phoenix kick I thought of gold shields alright who's gonna get sniped who's gonna be the first person of all time to die to my Craver never happened before never had a kill this good not true had a few but still it feels like I'll never have hate this building guarantee there's something there you get a good screenshot you change weapons it's not on the screen then you can use the Healing Brush to take off all the other stuff all was alright yes I was there you go I don't know why I do okay okay I don't know why why wouldn't I just aim up a lot with there of course it's gonna be a bit of bloody drop you want to change much I assume he's got teammates or just revive them anyway no idea the team is that's all if we don't know where they are I think we should have camp this later is good it's truly the time drains here my grapples have been absolutely atrocious this game might be something good this way still safe might as well get over there this sucks because I'm not gonna messing as Mike Kramer name of course I mean I can try it probably won't be a good idea we still don't know where the second team is though my favorite them being over here is looking less and less likely I started to hear like a little cucarachas my French are you losing nice hang on hang on just I was you the last one yourself reviving that Kansa kill appearances of Craver killed I can now use in the female I've got a beautiful sharp there he's doing some MIT game photography before the from now sometimes gonna commit to you know teen was there he shouts out the boys no sounds you I feel like I did a decent man alright nearly 3,000 kind kind of like 209 shorts yeah Minori definitely deserved more kills I was gonna pretend see the guys name but that's bad idea friendly Channel that's not allowed on PlayStation huh all right how much I think we gain 201 you up games right you forgot to do my outro so thank you for watching and I'll see you all in the next one mmm bye
