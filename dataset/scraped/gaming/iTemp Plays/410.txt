hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we managed to find the legendary sentinel which has one of the new pop-ups on it dead eyes tempo however i'm not that great with dead eyes tempo i need to take my time to steady my shot to make sure i'm on target and with this hop up you need to fire in a rhythm and make sure you're basically tracking the enemies you can fire as soon as you are available to to actually make use of the hopper does that make any sense i don't think it did i did try and be good with it and i am happy they buffed the sentinel with this hop-up because although it's not the greatest gun in the game there are a few weapons as satisfying as a fully charged up sentinel so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh spectating through there why is valkyrie so tall i've only just realized i feel like what a goliath should look the same height as uh she doesn't really look that tall i wonder if she's the same height as uh like pathfinder when i jumped on this this oh no this is broken this is broken stand on this and tell me that you're actually standing on the box there's no way it has like four feet oh no yeah [Laughter] come on she's so mean and she just destroys my house like destroys it for the passion yeah about this hey jump back down the road yeah this is yeah i have seven bullets i can't really do anything i have 19 g7 join this rifle here recharging shield i will take any mean at this point leaving there for you for a good samaritan thank you thank you they're in shambles up there but i'll hear my extended energy i'm dance go back up feels weird not being able to stim everywhere oh she's yeah it might be another team to see one in the middle i'm coming to you the chimney light no she had none she only had like 20 energy into a bow giving my shields a recharge bunker down in the middle it's annoying me yeah and i mean i have enough ammo for like literally one fight and that's it yeah i think you'd be in there with uh the watson fences oh my god it's the lifeline goofy that's slow healing they can show on the back are they fighting oh yeah i'm behind on my mind i killed one i killed two on this team and still one more though i can't get to the fence oh my god no one has any ammo dude this is crazy i have heavy that's it it's right in front of me cracked oh my god that's big value all right well in case you want any of those okay i don't have any more to offer though trying to pick out the shields there we go yeah i have a bow and a pk but i mean i 800 damaging two kills i have 804 yeah i'll be there i'll be there shortly i'm just leaving this uh six boxes over here uh they like i think they wanted to but they kind of were just healing and stuff first i am oh that feels kind of nice now oh yeah oh care package frat purple nice dude that's that's about you i'm hopping out just trying to maybe get some light too this is my shotgun jumping off come on shotgun oh my god that's the purple oh wow come on oh wait they're in the storm they're going to be coming this way on my way oh i need some help i thought or maybe there's a third yeah they're dropping a replicator this guy plays on pc it looks like that was the last one in the squad oh i'm being bowed yeah you came with the armor you could tell honestly have no idea yeah we just got back here yeah yeah and the ring is far just how is it going to go that way i have my uh hitting the end it's not the duff plant i was the guy with the bow force very rude the heat shield in what's here [Music] and i'll do it again remember good work your health just went down so bad your steam i know stimming is great oh team right now don't see me though what's going to phoenix oh god oh god it 100 recharging shields i'm going to graph yeah any shotgun bolts for the boy probably not these guys aren't running shotguns you guys had all the loot i'm using a sense now forget it yes i like it i should probably run him nah son all day great has to be right i think so on me this one's lobry oh my okay i'm back i'm coming back i'm sorry okay you're okay i think troll it's the perfect time i don't always get those uh opportunities i'm i thought you kicked me off then dropped a pad to get me back up but you just left me for dead i guess you see the guy helping me out he did oh oh i went right between both of us i say cracked nice can i wait you can't move over that though yeah but it's a purple armor why wouldn't you want that true true come on now you're shooting at me i like how body shot doesn't even crack a red armor why am i standing here like this giving my shields a recharge like it's a cray bruise now if it was a long life some reason uh that's a scraper i mean that's all you i got a little something something something hold on i'm gonna grapple to you and papa i'm gonna put my ultimate upon the window can you climb this there's no way right maybe on the other side this side i think you can oh god that was mean these i don't know why everyone is way quicker than i am on the old flying techniques but these guys land up top okay this guy's on my head i could have fought i got scared when i came with a rope though just scared no no no intimidated can you stop i'm literally not even interested i broke down oh nice i have two bats nice i missed fine i can't lie yeah he's got no shields that that guy am going up how are you oh mate i missed every shot what's going on here thank you not every shot for like you know when you need one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think you needed that last one exactly i feel that level three keep eyes on the news are you really though yeah oh my god i'm confused i think i didn't knock down shield i hear him could have raised that definitely could hit the old race probably this is why we have to use like three games now here pretty sure someone's close still over there how many mirages are there it's the best mirage ever actually he's actually dude he's above us right shortly that's another decoy there's four four hostiles i don't know which one is him it has to be this one in the building there's a lifeline over here on play it's this one oh that's so good i'm just gonna i'm on the mirage there's no way i'm so i have to kill this guy i'm sorry i'm sorry she'll be okay oh no i'm not cheating she's got no audio what the heck is that i knew that that's danny devito if she had gone back i'd literally ordered any stream either done the windows stripped down noise and ended the stream right there i'm actually still mad at how uh how good that mirage was there was two more officers oh yeah yeah then we're chasing difference he had his old like every 30 seconds punching everyone who uses the ball oh i'm gonna get who's bowing me did you no there's another team by the way i hate who they were like they were like on this hell but i think they rope somewhere [Applause] oh my god though there's so much info cause of valkyrie oh yeah you just shoot it down here oh my god myself there's another guy trying to bow there's another valve around here i can't tell where these are flying out [Applause] i can't yes i can't spit fires dude i have to reload 14 times before i can shoot him it's been an interesting game yes it has been i feel like there's been one person who's been shooting us about uh shooting us with a bow it was the guys that came up this way they were showing us in the back like the t2p clan watch a lot of optic in the cod days i guess oh i don't know if you know you're muted i assume you do oh i just unfeeded myself sorry guys on me i am running enemy taken down did you name him it's all frozen taking a moment i might try and use her olds there's a valk i think maybe a wraith on the clock okay i'm just caps bad caps i've seen for 24's i think i hit 13 in there is nice mate how many minutes is that today i think maybe four not too shabby not too bad not too bad for boys two hours strain you are the apex champions another win for the squad
