hey what's up guys it's [ __ ] welcome back today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back in diamond ranking up or at least trying to rank up i have two games here for today and the second one had such a good finish to it i'm sure you guys will enjoy that thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends where is it disappear we can how far is it hundred centimeters i don't get out what's your 100 meter run sprint time i don't know if it's not as fast as me 100 i'm faster than you so you have really small aerodynamics no that's less aerodynamics how what what so you're saying if you had one of those big foam fingers that they were like sporting events you're saying that that would be better where are you getting foam fingers from my hand yeah if it was you're saying that would be better that's more evident how is that a good comparison because you're saying smaller hands that's less comparison aerodynamic yeah because you got it it's a whole motion you know it's a whole body running is a whole body motion i don't move [Laughter] i look like an ostrich when i'm sprinting i just visualize that it just made me laugh i'm so like crypto look at him man he's zooming look at him go i'm luckily how i run your ads in your pocket it's the forbidden technique they don't realize that which is actually how i found everything yes i've got gold bag do you want this um i don't know if i should have it 100 pink energy ammo energy energy ammo here i had it contact please do not do this this is actually going to throw me off my game okay you got him him with the burme that is i'm about to meet you come on man come on you have five seconds okay i'll stop all right i'll scout he's the worst thing i sound like it sounds awful it's like something i hear my nightmares that's why that's why that's what i do when i'm sprinting like an ostrich asmr just makes me so i'm crafting a bad boy okay i don't know where this team went oh they're up there ew i got challenge rifle something right here she's cracked down nice job i can't halt it they're in a cave hold on me yes oh there's my kill oh i didn't even revive her no i stopped doing i threw my old oh nice that's a big deal by the way did i throw that it's uh that team i think split that up path in valkyrie okay your path went to the left i'm just i'm dead here that's insane that i just got hit by i don't know what smoke out it's not crap i think oh that's yeah i got creeper makes sense wait to brush this quick uh thank you i'll try and thirst him oh right there it's got craig i think yeah i'm gonna go back and look to say they have a crater here oh i want mommy on me it's all about him it's broken we're gonna get altered i think she's all seen i don't want it i've got this charge right so i'm way better with this and if i realized i could have killed it yesterday so that team up top i got i got them saving my smokes like maybe i can smoke there 45 seconds don't worry about it yeah i'll find it everywhere that's fine they're shooting people with that thing on the right no she's i'm pretty sure she's gone i think she'll be playing that aggressive i have zero kills i need kills you got any kp all right recharge we are safe down this way if we have to we can wrap around i think 140. flesh what was that yeah it's been my left they got impede again going far left all right just lie down i'm just getting shot from behind now straight a day you mate you need to smoke out this building you need to smoke which one is something okay try and try and try yeah you're right all right i hit the roof sorry i'm i need to reload 44. look at those terrible smokes 18 inside that oh god that did not go inside they're gonna impede at least give me a second i don't see him i'm shooting incoming i'm trying to hit careful and i have no throwables it's fine we gotta go left anyways i don't think we're gonna play this one they're trying to look at us we need we need to get over here literally dude just peeks down hey guys they're on the roof up there how much damage have i taken this game is unreal oh my god no one landed here which is such good news elena bins rotate into a few of these buildings we've got all that split as well which is great i want to turn this into flat line vault if i can or maybe like a don't know actually of course it's not turbo what else would it be oh boosted loader of course imagine if imagine if the scope was on on the ground i'm telling you on this map in ranked easiest rp of all time and that's why i have to use the child drive from there you know i'm a charge rifle charlie i'm the dweeb machine machine that's just the way it is uh drinking my teammate oh that's not what i want to drop you need these standards oops they are indeed big scrapping i'm we seem to be so careful this team that's any problem that's huge thank you contact it's such a balancing act to know when you can and can't challenge on this is that that team what a shot can we get a first on that maybe i need the kpi did not expect it to keep challenging that at all oh good job team i think both my teammates are sniping no one of them only wanted a sniping he's been absolutely framed with whatever he's using though attempted to like if i can use a i can't snipe with him that's a problem do i need this many light rains i'd rather take four more cells just in case we're probably gonna have to go either way the right side of the mountain pretty much that's a waste of time to be honest with you it's not for the guy with the longbow but for me with the two times r301 i mean i can do i can tickle them and that's it i've got 2kp i don't have all the damage in the world but it's been the fight has been long range coming in i like that what's this one bam you're huge i don't want to go into prowlers can't lie are we going to go in there probably this place kind of blows no this stupid palm tree are you kidding me no gosh damn palm trees from them nice knock man you're shooting at me as well be careful they shouldn't really push us too much now so that's just we ended the gunfight it's such a good job there i need better helmets what is this everyone's got a level one means i can drop some of these pick up some throwables if i find them over there teammates it's got a small heel i can replace him pretty easy all right i need one kb for max kp and it's uh there are five of those guards left we're doing good here we're doing very well my team's a absolutely solid team oh my god my teammate's cheating he's so good someone traveled through here recently oh the rings closed i fell there's a guy behind me there's a team underneath as well be careful right underneath underneath i should pick up some of those frag grenades copy that there's another squad [Music] any respawn i can't really use it to poke too much recharging my shield we are safety but there's a team underneath us where did they go let them altered away so that's good we happen to be the focus here we need to get right up if we can that's what each team down i think that's why no one's fighting the moment easy absolutely demolished the end of that game absolutely destroyed them all whoa nice good game man nicely played i can't even take it no you are the apex champions oh everyone check out this guy's tumbler stream i don't think that's even possible nice well played well played four revives on my word honestly such a good team there really well played from the squad two wins in a row
