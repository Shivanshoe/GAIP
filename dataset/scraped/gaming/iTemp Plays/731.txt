hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and week 4 of the hunt is here i did miss last week's but i would assume by now you've either played it yourself or watched it online so i would just have to skip that i'm afraid i've completed it off camera and annoyingly it was probably the funniest one we've had so far we're here with a new hunt and right after i complete this there's going to be a action-packed ranked game for you with mirage of all characters so thanks for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh you get a gold shield and a gold bag with amazon beacon of p2020 uh so recently i've been doing the quests on pc because the servers were working there quicker than they were on pre ps4 for some reason so i've been catching up on the quest on playstation and i've been using mirage because someone told me that if you use your decoys or your decoy escape all of the prowlers they don't know who who to bite they don't know how to kill so you can just walk through mirage actually a really good character for these quests hi octane stay alive while pathfinder locates the dig site oh it's pathfinder look optimus already be here let's eliminate some of these powders and find the the tube tube reading time the train i would assume are they sleeping are they dead sound dead peace lord the whole thing any decent lure here everyone again you guys are telling me that this good loot hidden around the map it's always worth looking for i hate the aimsees on these slime requests i actually i actually hate the aim assist it's way too powerful here we go an accidental luteach there are octane pads gosh darn everywhere here so if they come over so yeah you can't jump like that as well right oh my word yes he can he's impressive hang on there we go don't want to on the drum pad because there's lou here extended line lime in fact i'm taking the alternator see ya there's lou everywhere here i just need to kill three more of them i can leap so far given my shields are recharging look decoy watch you see actually works so well the aims this is so strong like i literally can't control the recoil because it's locked in like one particular spot so it's so strange nice shooting i've marked the location the next piece sending supplies there now what kind of supplies we talk about because i'm struggling in terms of uh weaponry here i've got an alternator and a b right shotgun whereas the storm was pushing in so that's why i haven't changed would be proud actually moving actually he's moving i'm not turning down the opportunity i'm fully healed five isn't too bad five shield cells what kind of stuff you got for me pathfinder i reckon there's a gold weapon in here there you go gold probably and a gold on 99 a gold helmet so i can bambooze all the prouders even more eat them even more often all right so where are we supposed to be going dig up the hidden artifact where earth is that where is the hidden artifact here wait is that not my pink okay it's just a part of jesus i literally thought that was my pink i thought i'd put that there turns out i didn't and the storm's closing in i love this part apparently so does the local wildlife fortunately these priorities are far less potent and far less dangerous than the ones before them otherwise he's so insulted the ring's actually closing in a lot when he said attack that one he said think of this game there you go now they're all kinds of confused it's a beautiful tactic i'm sending them on the jump pads my accent though i still chase them across the map ding ding drool's done grab the artifact and now we've got to get back to the evac ship i just gotta get out of here we gotta get on board imagine if they had this many jump pads on the actual king's canyon map like just just in slim lakes maybe they're just turning to a massive bouncy castle wait is this a wait come on oh my word you can actually just use the balloon tower to get out of there you don't even have to run next to the prowlers you just take the balloon tower to safety rip in the chat for anyone who was actually trying to run alongside the prowess there and didn't take the balloon tower because we have escaped a rather easily he did get a little bit a little bit sketchy at one point but with the decoy escape it just buys you so much time the problem is just attack the decoys and you're good to go after that all right let's see we've got here we got the epic weapon charm of the how light oh okay so it's like the cyan sort of color don't know if that's how you actually pronounce that sort of like a turquoise charm got the uh retinal array artifact piece which is always good and then we've got the impromptu a kidnapper which is chapter four of the story as well we can continue the story here i killed 23 powders and succeeded in four minutes not too shabby alright so the story is ramping up we're nearly halfway through the entire thing there are only five weeks after nine weeks left i hope you enjoyed that and i've got a ranked game here for you as well so i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends why am i going so slow someone's stealing my door someone has stolen my door here at marketplace an absolutely unbelievable crime and someone's stolen this one too to leave you with this gift i'm going to get the hair can pick out of it okay she's back bangalore did you have any shields no you did not i was having my ark so i took it off or something no no tonight with a gold brow stabilizer this isn't too bad of a start considering i've had absolutely nothing to begin with but we're all scanned and i'm shieldless and i'm healthless i need a body shield don't show the dormie friends patching myself up literally people outside too see crypto this guy's not gonna let me shoot him though i'll do it these guys that's not our ark got one here sometimes that is the best strategy split from your team a little bit because your teammates are they're still going to be walking around a lot so they're like the main focus and then when they walk past you you just beam them they get beamed where on earth i was literally just on the roof i was on the roof four seconds ago and there was no one up there yeah i got your friends i don't have an extended line meg i've gone barrel stabilizer my loot's okay my loot's looking okay sometimes he's gonna respawn look at that drop ship incoming yeah i thought i heard something friends this is a bit of a dangerous push here i've got blue shield which is all right but my teammates are stuck on level one it looks small we've just been wondering around the wasteland for feels like 25 minutes here my second crypto stuck in his drone getting the team on the cage as well as expected i'm incredibly annoying i would assume i took care of it don't worry good kill i really don't need that much luke my teammate needs it more than me just be careful i find that there's a full team above you i am all the way back up top annoyingly because we have to go past them to get to the safe zone there's 60 rounds on the floor we have 56 seconds i mean at least i've got my ultimate to try and get past i can sneak past the there we go some good late he's got to stop waiting for us i am taking fire friends giving my shields a recharge hey if you guess right annoyingly i think this place needs a little more me ready kill this okay third time that's happened to this game but it's okay you're jumping down one by one you're just jumping down one by one like a power ranger's moving that's what you get from scene up top a little bit toxic a little bit toxic always regret right after but they are sound the cage and they they weren't pushing they were not pushing i'll tell you what it feels good to kill him listen let's move here i need to get out of here storm's not moving too fast a little bit closer to the safe zone than i thought got myself eight kills now in the stall 22 of the people careful teammate please don't dying there i don't know if she's actually still got her portal or not a paul be good here to get our teammate to safety but i always forget to use it personally you better pop this range there you go i think he's fine i think he's okay three people just died in the ring though whatsoever we should go this way uh he's on the edge of the ring target wasn't nearby though not sure i'm gonna have to get around where's my watson kill this way send it a decoy wait how do i know i'm not the decoy over there sorry teammate i mean you're a bit too eager for the loops over that way but and the wraith portal would have made it a little bit easier but i forget all the time as i said i'm not entirely sure if he wants to actually find me or not i think he was trying to teabag i'm sorry friend i'm on for a good game here devotion here nice work i barely have any energy i might have to take this definitely trying to find a different gun uh it's pretty easy to go around this way are they still on the supply ship did i get my kill for the watson i can't remember i don't think so i think i had eight kills coming out of uh one more previous gunfight all right i got y'all look how close he was to the safe zone it's a shame that we would in a big scrap i was trying to get there i was getting shot i was getting gate kept from the supply ship entirely sure unfortunately they're still on here or not gotta be careful doesn't sound like it but less than 30 bad guy over seconds please continue fighting i actually don't think there's a respawn beacon available there's no reborn beacons available i think there's three in this area and all three of them have been used got one here that's a shame i have one team okay you saw me apparently now i got one teammate i might as well use a shield battery i only have four shields as well what's going on i've got gold shields here check it out care package coming in ah okay apparently that wasn't shot at the bottom of the trap being scammed practice shield like 50 damage this guy's got no heels laundry is camping his teammate's shielding up as well unfortunately this means there's a good beat and of course you can hear find that might be between two teams here i've no idea there's a second team near the edge of the safe zone he was snaking around using the decoy escape giving my shields to recharge one minute until close rings nearby that's what they did you know i see you thanks for playing i nearly started to revive but i could just hear i swear i could either this little peter patter of footsteps in like the swampy marsh this guy's got ready for you level five not to heal up then i have no idea what happened to that separate team behind we've got to give you this unaccounted for because that wasn't even the team that damned the teammate for some reason they didn't even want to push and that's why they saw 13 people in such a small circle because people just want to play for placement points there you go oh my god this man's rotating this man is rotating look at him go he's beyond one shot and they stole my kill just kind of dropped having that didn't look like someone right in the corner just chillin we're in a tiny circle here now you've got to stay in heel or run and be half health all right got one here okay sound eleven health the small hills reloading recharging got one spotted it was an enemy what on earth are these last teams doing everyone had like one person every team had like one person on it i thought i was going to get a 20 bomb there i got 17. i tell you what i've got a good chance of having a four uh 4k damage bachelor a very good chance an extremely good chance come on 3.7 it's an absolute tragedy i didn't get either of them i didn't get the 20 or the 4k how has that happened to me [Music] i'm devastated i wanted i wanted at least a 4k i knew at the end i wasn't gonna get the 20 when i mean there were five squads left and everyone i shot was instead for some reason everyone just went everyone just died no no one had like a teammate around that i could have farmed some damage or imagine if one of the teams was a full team of three okay i'd get a 4k and a 20 bomb there assuming i could kill them but to be honest i feel like i could in these lobbies there you go thank you for watching anyway we are so close see you all the next one bye
