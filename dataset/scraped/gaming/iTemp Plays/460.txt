hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now apex is always evolving we get a lot of new map areas that change all the time respawn spoilers in the map departments other battle rail games struggle to keep up with the amount of updates that respawn do to the environment that we are all fighting in now change is great because it keeps things fresh but the dark side of change is that we need to say goodbye to some beloved areas of the three maps that we have i have composed at least a tribute to those areas that we all loved so much and if you guys think that i missed any points of interest or maybe you disagree with my ordering here be sure to leave a comment coming in at number five we have slim lakes now slumlex was a weird one because i did enjoy the fights here a lot the fights were quite school town-esque but unfortunately it was quite quiet here you could land here consistently and be uncontested which you may think is a good thing depending on your play style but i landed places that i like to fight at because it makes it more enjoyable i think the lou here wasn't amazing so there wasn't really anything to fight over but in terms of nostalgia i remember dropping here a lot and trying to find my favorite gun on the game at the time the devotion when apex legends first came out now this is a strange one on the list because i actually prefer what respawn replaced it with there is far better loot now in the new area the fights are better more people land here it's way more enjoyable but that's not going to stop me from missing some lakes so rest in pete's slum lakes i miss you so much coming in at number four on the definitive list of apex legends points of interest that we'll miss is bridget's if you are looking for a mid-map scrap look no further land on either side of the bridge pray you get a weapon and a bit of armor because by the time you're finished the guys who land on the other side are already sprinting over to you and your squad you may need to drop down and loot the house in the river as a last resort but now you've got low ground and have to fight your way out nothing says apex legends day one to me more than bridges and i cannot believe the guys of respawn entertainment let a leviathan step on it and ruin it completely bridges was my first main drop on apex i loved it here unfortunately it was also one of the first areas that respawn destroyed along with my hopes and my dreams what replaced it was not that great either it was just gone there was nothing there the loot was bad the buildings were gone i'm not too sure why they had to do this to us but they did and we must live with the consequences rest in peace bridges number three is thunderdome too many people land in school town your jumpmaster jumped out too late and you had to land elsewhere thunderdome is the answer the loot here was surprisingly good you could lose the middle bins then flow up to the zip line to the hanging gondolas i'm not really sure what they're called thunderdome just reminds me of one of my first videos on apex i'm playing mirage i'm tap firing an r301 i'm clueless my teammates are clueless my enemies are clueless no one has any idea what is going on but we are all having the best time of our lives and it is happening at thunderdome i think it deserved more recognition but when you have school town just across the hill it's quite hard to shine i think number three on this list is respectable for thunderdome now coming in at number two the runners-up position this one building at capital city construction i think people called it i think i have maybe 50 videos of me flying into the maps pathfinder saying screw rapid city it is my friends over and over again and i have 50 videos of that think how many times i've had to say that to myself when i've landed there and died off spawn and re-cued and then had to say it again i it honestly might have been 500 times i've said skrapito city's my friends i would always land on the side entrance here at the top floor of construction because there are two good loot piles on opposite sides that would more than likely give you a gun and armor this building was great because there was so much outplay potential especially as pathfinder you could jump out the side of the building and grapple to a higher floor if you're being chased you could climb to a higher floor outside this building as well if you wanted the loot was great the fights were great there was a zip line set up to the other big building in scraptor city if there were more people fighting over there and you wanted a third party many good games started out in this here building and then respawn set it on fire and dropped it into lava and it's gone forever and scraptol city will never be the same now coming in at number one i'm sure you guys could predict this but it is of course leaf leaf was apex legends leaf defined the player base and encapsulated the spirit of apex players all around the world if you didn't land huh which mean leaf is leafy still in the game number one on the apex legends top five areas that i missed list is of course score team if school town didn't come in at number one i'm pretty sure someone would ddos me you talk about iconic apex legends points of interest school town has to be number one on that list the loot here was good but when the whole lobby lands here with you you can't really tell because you get whatever is behind the one door that you chose to land at and that's it oh and you've got a mozam because um that's just what you get oh and there's a ttv wraith naruto running straight over to you with purple and a peacekeeper you're you're dead your teammates are dead you are spectating the ttv wraith now go up and q again so you can go through the same skulltune experience once more i know what you're doing you are chasing the high of that one time you landed here and left with seven kills after getting great loots in your one building will it ever happen again no one knows but it's okay because it's all happening at school team apex is pride and joy until they once again completely destroyed it nothing even replaced the scorcher it literally fell into the ocean so unlucky and there you have it my friends five areas on the apex maps that i miss if you think you could have done a better job than that leave your comments in the comment section with your lists i've got another great game for you here with ragtag i hope you enjoyed the rest of the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends someone valerian and i do mean a lot of time but i know stay tweeted about that the other day not just here but asu was distributing it oh he actually loves that game he's always like that's his mate oh there's two people on me by the way um okay all right that's his main game pretty much i did not know that i thought he was mainly apex yeah he he comes back to every now again he's got his landed here so painful yeah so the path probably has white shields i think he just got thirsted this is great shield those people out here having a piece fight went outside next going on here hey that path has to die matter of honor now yes i killed the whole squad cool yeah yeah that was a little tea bag that race is around somewhere i have no shield cells but i've got two bats do i use one uh age old question this place has loose if i don't see it shield cell i don't even know why good loot is now on the ground i left the scorpions there for future reference if you want it wait this is a full send you're going to try all right i'm going to respond in the middle of the action that's there beautiful that's all i need have a connection i'm gonna dream when i come back they better all be dead they will be did you see how great i was no i will also be dead i like it there's a lot of stuff in here one person's still there so i killed an enemy in that one but oh no door i came in this one we should go this way looks like they jumped off i don't actually know if anyone's oh that was that that was their banner they got they got the banner from that doorway makes a lot of sense faster faster faster where would they have gone i saw them go this way maybe up top oh we can just leave them too right there's no point chasing that it's not even safe oh there's someone on top of this let's start on top might be something good this way get him it's my only spitfire mag that one over there i don't know my grappler for ages i have this though nice job the synergy synchronization and they had a load of heavy oh man he had a uh he had a vault and a terrible charger he was looking for a hammock which i killed him with he's serious i thought i way to go just gonna like karen going this way a little bit because that guy i'm still is still on my mind leave me alone honestly oh you ain't messing around did they shoot you at all no oh i only want to land it on his head and and when i put shots in originally they did a little bit i need something i need some heavy again this before 8 10 70 70 that's not enough to be honest let's go into that place beautiful these let me check for ammo again um i have a rope to get back up oh no dude no i need to i need to put my med kit now we just wrap around we're fine i'm going to take a med kit as well all the way around yeah yeah yeah oh man oh they were waiting yeah okay so i'm gonna go behind this rock check out here that's apparently i have your angles i need to pop this there don't come out yet i've got a feeling they won't i've got a feeling that's going to try and hold this high ground and they'll try and get give us from up here when we're low going but we hook the wall we'll be fine i like it unless they're literally right here which there's a good chance oh i can hear them where's that no no they're up there uh how long till pat a little while i'm sixteen so it won't take long because it does go fast i distract because i'm ahead now you can probably just move you smoke that oh how the gatekeepers are gatekept on the clock further down low once behind i drop like an idiot on the map i'm staying up recharging shield let's see if i can i think i got my kill credit i think i don't think i was on nine uh ten kills before i think that's the box let's go this way i'm oh no sorry i don't i've got the pad i'm honestly i'm happy with that yeah let's just get him get involved the options are running with one bat here we go guys down the hill let's go this way he's pushing that this cryptos in his drone that guy's flesh on you i'm gonna hide into that guy's face 60 on it 60 on him for 38. huge oh someone's on me behind any cracks such an awkward fight we have time they're just stuck in this little cookie hole um just cracked is that someone pushing me i just took some energy what other guns do these guys have because i'll just take i'll drop you this energy and i'll just take whatever they have yeah i'll take this i dropped it in here i can't get my switch back i forgot the 30 30 repeater two times on it there we do you have a zip go or uh 63 i don't that crypto when he's drowning 10 seconds it's good job we got involved when we did he was all kicking off it's your craver again could be imagine you're not fat are you having fun of course gonna let you have it oh nice after here i mean over here is so cracked we are the two champions where if we do a little bit of damage we can just actually false end our button is just full on 100 let's get into their face absolutely you are the apex champion nice good game yeah good game at that moment when you push was the perfect moment because it was like just enough to stop them from healing yeah yeah because they were trying
