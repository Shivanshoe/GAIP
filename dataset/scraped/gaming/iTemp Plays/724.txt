every cigar each welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we just got news from EA play that there is a huge update coming to apex legends these Tuesday that's the 23rd of June we have a new heirloom we have a new map location we have a new item and a new game-mode to cover so let's start off with the heirloom it's for Mirage but you probably knew that because it's the tide of the video let's be honest and it's a trophy of himself and he used to whack people over the head we've it's genius it is the most Mirage heirloom that you could possibly think of it's definitely on character and thankfully they have buffed Mirage to such a good state that I'm looking forward to actually playing him and gave you guys some gameplay with it this Tuesday with the new album the new item is a portable respawn beacon this will be available in the new game mode which is armed and dangerous' evolved which is basically like the old armed and dangerous' which was shotguns and Snipes only but with Evo shields and even if this item is only in the limited time mode at the moment that's also where we first saw the Evo shields too and they were brought into the game through community testing and community feedback as well so this would be great for the pacing of the game as well think of how many times recently you've been playing and within six or seven minutes there are only 15 people left on the map this will not only increase the amount of people it can be brought back but it will also make a response in the late game possible you're going to get to the late game people will have one or two of these in their in their inventory and plays gonna be flying back to the map in the tiniest of circles it's gonna be carnage so next up we have the crypto town take over coming to King's Canyon in a safe East and part of the map no one ever went here I was forced personally to play here in a recent video of mine as it was the last zone but apart from that it's being it's possibly years at this point since I've been here so be great to bring some life to this side of the map and a reason to visit this area again it looks like it's gonna be a ton of fun now the last big news here is that apex is going to be cross play and labeled this autumn and it's also coming to the Nintendo switch so you can play this game on the go which is good news for a lot of apex fans I'm sure in the trailer as well we got a sneak peek at a life line booth she put down the revive he put the shield up and in Bangalore started reviving herself with a lifeline shield automatically if she can automatically revive people as what I'm trying to say and if they've changed live line there good chance they've changed or the legends of guns or the part of the map it's going to be a ton of fun exploring the new update here on Tuesday so thank you guys for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all with some gameplay in five and a half seconds my

came up there you go hey my milega night so I just tried to hang him from here nice oh I saw the ground I saw the little claim you saved it I thought I died oh god my life flashed before my eyes uh there I thought they were still a pathfinder somewhere now pathfinder wiggled his way out of this situation that does not surprise me yeah I don't know where he is or how we go up there but he's around some lighter too like daughter out of here somehow dude whittling giveth this purple slavery way yeah how come we can't land on purple toned uh that's the dream before you ran into that other team at gauntlet I was ready to leave with no armor dancing yeah I was ready to leave with no armor we walk over there and there's like nine Purple's I found blue but it was next to them where they spawned and they already had a purple like it's just I should just follow with the people and still they're Luke's cuz my loot is bad I'll let them open the bins for me over here ya know it's funny there was another blue behind your blue oh my god we're both super e0 Lutz instead big differences this way down here we're all behind someone to that's gonna come back to you in between like four teams there and now that part of me will be raised there's one health if you see a rate she's literally one is never eggs are like four times what ship alarm via Oz game wingman's in that way you good yeah I only knocked it ok Argonian Jenks is a desert octane jump pad here as well we can use to go on the roof if we need to there's also a team this way but this is carnage this is absolute carnage these guys are like thoroughly beneath me one is lucky on one shot I need one damaged Ziva aloo chicken he drinks if a vein comes on your hitch is one way to corner nice good job I know looting showed upon the blue tone scans like what Sinatra used to train him here and bless him he's on a good time I don't even had to use my water my my Mirage ultimate should use it just to engage on them oh I'm such an idiot sometimes man like I walked out challenging this man and I started reloaded like as I was walking out the door like what I decided to check if my goons reloaded as I'm walking over like I just don't think kind of idiot does that I'm gonna stick with the ready but you know I kind of shellbacks you're winning well I have eight kills I'm not the kill leader I mean you do you have nine ten I have a couple eleven okay your way free to go eleven it's just because I used the charged rifle though a lot of those kills were like I hit him for like seven from across the map did they really truly count I do they all came think of all the ones that you've had stolen oh wait there's a lot of those I have a custom called online tonight I've got the old barrel the purple extended in stock and I'm using the circular H cog do you did you see how they are they tease us in the story mode how they let us use a goldarn idea a story yeah and that bright wasn't the revenant one it was in the season 5 trailer - I was like fellas really you're gonna tease us with a gold r99 in this in a pvp firm for shadow fall prowlers it's one of the only guns they haven't had gold yet I can't think of many that I'm in charge rifle I don't think I've had one but that's somewhat noog honest I can't say I mean plenty of had two rotations r3l one Prowler Spitfire or had two rotations thanks that's gotta be the only one I think they'd have to go through it again but I think it is if we had gold alternates that way because I was disrupt surrounds we did with disrupter rounds yup and the gold are a 45 down the chute I'm trying to make al star but that was the care package going for the longest time yeah exactly I mean it's only got a stock yeah yeah that's true I hear it there's a care package that way I'm just gonna forget okay so I'm just running with sickle mode I know the 99 that I'm thinking about it then 99 is the only gold or the only gun that hasn't been gold yet that's sad you have to make your own one but least if you make your own one you can customize it with the different sights right exactly what can you hear a triple take no that crazy don't help me okay now if I just heard I know we were just here Maivia several look have a little look you know scratch at these buildings okay yeah I'm gonna check page you can guarantee to the team on page we're gonna get ambushed yep we're nervous fast luck and ranks I'm good I'm feeling he would sickle mode on me Arkadiy were tripped so maybe was the sky the Bloodhound is crack these guys not blue shield oh my god what am i doing James what am i doing you murdering a man no I'm not I mess it up entirely sometimes I need to just heat fire instead of zooming in at close range my name is Lucy not fast enough to get across there yeah this games actually really really really good like yeah um I actually found myself hip firing a lot more than idiocy I need to do that - Nathan I was a deist we were like three feet apart I'm still trying to lock on with 80s it's so stupid oh no it's annoying you both of them oh yeah the nine I feel like you can get away with it the Prowler the problem or the meg is so big cuz like it's a bigger the mag the easier it is to hit by it's more for ya you can just spam Wes he's not sick you're can ask even in there one last time dream about it could be I've got a scan for it yeah BK you fancy you could take it if you want uh that's gonna be good I got my trusty old charged rifle no people dude you honest to god you know people sleep on is using the charged rifle up close um did I sleep on that check wait 61 seconds ago 76 - they ran this way so someone that wasn't that team right cuz I came in around to you about a minute ago they run away from us do you know lightly maybe they're going around and I'm gonna see them on this side of the choke quite possibly I'm gonna see if they're gonna be over here I'm on the hunt you know they're on me I'm on the flank Goemon uncharged rifle it's good man like you hit for like 80 to 100 every Joss is cranes and use it a club ouessem telling you I hit him for a hundred good shot I'll get a big scam big scam [Music] nice I was there to really say at least I look how I was the one to tracking them and somehow you act smart at them and come after listen if they were still in that choke though you would have been right on their booty that's right thanks champions ya know as I was saying before we were rudely interrupted the charge rifles like and it's a kind of nasty little shotgun - so you wait I had hostile damage that don't matter I was eating a charged rifle but hey I was just like I was just like aimlessly sniping people from across the map peppering him up pack put him up that burn him up
