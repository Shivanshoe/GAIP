every cigar - reach welcome back to another video today we are planes more 8x legends of course and season 5 has been out for nearly two weeks now so I decided to play more Lobo and see how good of a legend she is after playing more with her so my review of her is that she's a great legend which is really fun to play she has a high skill ceiling on her ability and even her ultimate that you wouldn't originally expect and she just remind me of a path wandering in some way they both have a mobility focus tactical which is a highest skill ceiling to be effective Lobos bracele definitely doesn't have the same scenic as path - grapple but it still it takes some getting used to and the more you use it the better suited you are to know when to cancel it when to cut it short and whether it's use it to engage get high ground or just to run away and you have to manage this because it does have a fairly high call down now her ultimate ability also has some amazing usage throughout the game early game it's great to secure the best armor in an area after using one of those charge stations mid game is extremely useful for game gear for your teammates that you've potentially revived which is exactly what happens in the game that happening today and later in this game as well you'll also see me place our ultimate aim right at the end of the game in the tie circle because if it comes to it you can use it as a safe armor switch which is clutch so has more uses than you would originally expect and these my favorite kinds of characters the ones with depth where the more you use them the more ways you figure out how to use their abilities to give yourself be the best advantage possible now when you are reviewing a legend on apex it's definitely always worth mentioning their hitbox Loeb has a fairly small hitbox and doesn't suffer from the low profile debuff which is brutal nowadays since they changed the link shots to do the same damage as body shots you get shredded as those characters so I think Loeb will definitely get a lot of plate on this season and not just because she's a new legend but because she's actually useful she's a good team player and she's really fun to play now I'm not the best louver in the world not by any means I am terrible with her bracelet stop but I'm having fun trying to learn and that's always what keeps you playing games like this it's knowing that you can get better and knowing what you can improve on as well so let me know what you guys think of Lobo down in the comment section also thank you so much for 900 thousand subscribers what ridiculous milestone to hit and now we are on the homestretch of 1 million thank you so much yes thank you for watching I do appreciate an arse even in five and a half seconds my friends home why what it leads to it is contested it always East it's bumpy release me amigos and the unreason I have agreed there is another great to come here is because I've got a corsica's my teammate I don't think these guys have anything Eve that can take that put some trust their friend are you doing keep it up no warning at the amur getting teammate must work like a teleport of the top the mind that gasps disappeared sometimes it does sometimes it isn't not entirely sure why he need to be picked up for thing I know you've got a pretense 20 but I guess we just go 40 not that many all right well I've got two kills I nearly killed the course if there are people here then fight then fight we've got nothing but a bunker is so much fun like sometimes it's horrendous I'll be honest let's go here but sometimes it is fun the only time I'll come here is if I've got a caustic teammate on plain course it myself otherwise it sir it's what is known in the business as a complete waste of your time because you spawning you do a lot of walljump down the corridor and then what happens is you get corny of course I guess and you cook in the toxic nests I think I'm ready to go you know and on to single-shot weapons sniper hour and a sniper stuff here which I do not need one of the days borrowed carried a sniper stock perhaps lutely no reason I've evolved as a looter these girls are scrapping I want to get involved near enough looting friend what okay I mixed let me scroll bad okay focus to teams put a trap down put a track down go oh you don't see that work nice good job teammate she down or did you get away I didn't even all right we get it you've been but you got a long cooldown I understand I mean scan three times this game two separate that's not be two separate oh my word you've got purple shields and you're set back not getting involved this chilling watching with the telescope and I can you make a quick listen who's just one guy I could try and machine is that literally he's asked a number six or is it five I've loved literally lost count it's Varmus which I need arm switch our needs health bunker when it's out with the team huh the finds me my belt alright this wrapping this has been ridiculous why is that why does that protons okay how can they just sit back that much you've got purple shelter the style again you are a tank you're an absolute unit and you decided that the best course of action is to stay back and just keep scanning so you scan me obviously I get bamboozled on average I reckon once again no it's actually it's actually becoming a bit of a problem in this corner I think hey French nice job tonight I really shouldn't I really should not be alive okay at this particular point in time this shouldn't be happening we know what Sheila's in in the low ground in the water absolutely struck me and I have so many white rounds for g-seven skates it's literally by the grace of this team that decided not to push us that we are still breathing here caustic we've been let off so to speak we've been gifted a second chance okay it's quite purple too I was try not to mention the fact that somehow both times my caustic teammate here has had the better armor from both of these engagements but it's okay because he's my hat that bodes well six kills all right there are only 18 people have survived we've been fighting here for the longest time ever reverse enter absolutely popping off funk was such a fun drop if you didn't get there first bunker is a foot drop there is no denying me and as I say if you've got a course kind of team of course love is ultimate actually candy crush very smart with figure with the arm switch I mean to say in the end it didn't matter too much but I'm not sure I would have actually pushed with half health for no shields able to linking the safety of behind a rock so graps free of charge well round one is literally only disclosing and not one person is actually and even don't in the kilt I shoulda stood back teammate to save yourself French I'm over here I think I think what's the other here is stooping denieth them no he's coming over I'll go try and hit them so he doesn't doll he'll answer I was at 2nd squad Oh leave him alone he's got no mobility police oh come and see me I know you down I know you're dead like an Avenger headshot let's stop shooting me I hear four seven two there but I know that she had enough times for one shield salon so I went in thinking I've only here for twenty mr. gold shields you guys stood up there what are these lobbies for something this was last season I'd have been rushed at this like every team so just keep jumping back just let me go a few for free so yeah I should really try and get some more small hills I mean the shield battery's still is it quicker than the shield cell is once your battery quicker than to shield cells I'm not sure cuz after the gold shields the small heels are real good but I guess the best course of action here is to try and stock with the little because I can always give my teammate I feel this your batteries because I vouch doubt that he'll end up with got it somehow they've let me escape why do you use three seconds should have enough time to bring him back I'm not really sure if it's gonna get caught in a storm but he should be able to get out of it he's my detector actually drop down from the ship is it 10 seconds and we'll quite close the edge' disc ed to the rink as well as are the safe son Chris give me some heavy please if it's attached to a gun I won't take it if it's a scene based there we go I know guns McCreight you have to stay close let's go here half my old see but this has been looted and it's a very small lips five previous running through here you go why under his beak Mozambique number two Oh perfect like this loads of energies mark please take this is like a [ __ ] gold gun you're assaulting my friend more energy for you as well there you go she'll back speaking facts Michael make the full stack look the wall hills are bare on me anyway the moment see well back in the action no 15 percent damage reduction Korsak anyway that's an extra one twenty two and a half health from 115 gone flat line name at least what I would consider to be a golf flat line of course that probably gives you some sort of weird valuable stuff alright team I've got a plan I have my ultimate and even though this has already been looted there's a chance that this might make it some like boxes as well what's HAP I don't fancy that real bad not the greatest but at the same time my teammates upgraded to were to blue now at least are they looking oh no what they look and see what I find I really can't see what's going on this has to be the same team as earlier on I'll see him boy if the bullets on the g-seven fire so slow is that your ulti friend that's definitely your Alti that I'm pushing he's fine forget it the g7 has the slowest firing projectiles Phoenix possibly of all time and his team we split up and this guy was crashed he's healing I don't know all heals then another team that one minute until appear my brain closes ups that's a lot more effort than it needs to be considering he had 14 health I've got to get another cheeky armor of gratefulness tell me she'll batteries never a bad one right diving board is safe but it's not safe any longer good there's people up there too let's try and get ahead of them here a containment take the high ground cut them off and then shoot them we don't have to rotate that's what they get on diving board I'm sick of E cancel diving board 2020 stop it get it out of here I've got a rota extremely soon but they were fighting another team so I hope with that for the team didn't rotate too far ahead I could have taken this zip while ready that's what I would have done here we go party I messed up bad that's my fault teammate get out of here he won't run I don't think he's got his ulti do you might don't challenge that they're the last team I need to heal teammate I need heavy ammo do this clutch revive from the teammate better eivol safe I messed up don't know if I can even get your banner here friend baby yes it is been scanned in the 12th time this game I ponder your banner they're going for me see ya [Music] oh my lunch is so bad already inside the ring forget it I did it teammate I gotcha and he cooked up with the with the revived at the end he stuck it straight away instead of late trying it first or blue - anything like that I messed up against that Bank law she has mangled by the way it has a small hitbox I mean I was missing my shots that wasn't the reason I was just missing it I was playing I was playing bad for some reason I was choking shots but she's got a really small he bucks and then she moves really quick because of her passive she can be slippery at close range deceptively difficult to hit shouts out the caustic go one for the close revive and two for being patient and sticking around Vogler feels good you know I'm starting to play are living more and more now obviously I tried to spam her when the when season five came out but it's been a few weeks now coming up to two weeks I think but she feels good thanks for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
