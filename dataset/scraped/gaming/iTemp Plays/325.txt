hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i learned how to tap strafe on controller thanks to all spooky whose video link will be in the description if you want to learn for yourself now if you aren't aware tap strafing is a movement mechanic on apex which only most keyboard players could do before this method came out and elspeak's method to do this on control that just involves loading the steam controller configuration and inputting some cable buttons onto the controller itself it's pretty simple but the effects are crazy now i had to relearn a lot of keybinds on my controller so i'm a bit of a mess in places but it is so much fun and we dropped a big game that i've got for you here today i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's not even a gun here dude there's not even a gun on either of those floors all right that's fine a g7 and a 30 30. wingman eva i really want to get on this yeah i'm on it 42 flash they spotted me somebody else on me i'm missing oh i'm missing two cracks oh my god i don't know how we survived no the box is falling down the as hill as we drop that's crazy uh phoenix anywhere for the boy uh i shall look for you yes phoenix kid here what i'm ass i don't have survived yeah you're doing you're doing the work i saw you running around i was doing okay sure so we weren't around i was indeed running around why are you uh maneuvering around those boxes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's chill him back here what's happening okay just uh just a couple of tap strafing controller players nothing too crazy going on over here i know we were just going we were going wild i was actually tap strafing mid-fight too it's great and once you once you get the hang of it you'll be able to use it like so much and you don't even need to uh you don't even need to um what's it called be like uh in a slide because a lot of times i'll just be like kind of bouncing while i'm standing up and then you can still tap strafe still get big movement i see enough movement i need an extended heavy mag what do you what do you have that on wingman oops oh yeah cargobots are definitely in favor of most keyboard players do you know what that i don't like about this is that i get the ugly xbox um buttons yep everyone everyone is going to think that she switched to uh xbox how about that care package well you can remove that though right that's where there is i haven't even bothered trying to like really i mean i looked into it a little bit and i couldn't find a that's i didn't really care i was like whatever yeah i outside this one dude here like uh i posted a i think it was like that first tap strafing clip that i posted like on controller and what i mean it looked like i was on a xbox controller i like some dude he's just like uh he like retweeted it and quoted it and he's just like hell yeah dude xbox controllers on top y'all been sleeping on the box y'all been sleeping on the box and i just like he was so hype i felt so bad i was like dude i am going to ruin his day like he had he followed me after that and everything else oh his name's lady mate yeah i did i gave him that that was my good deed for the day because i was like i wanted to just like burst his bubble but i was like nah i feel so bad he was so hyped he just loved that you're on xbox someone's close by the way i broke one there's no aim assist on this gun left yes they are grenades i ruined everything damage there's damage there's damage he fell back down nice i could have just jumped off but it looked cooler to tap strafe ah now what's the point what's the point when you can tap straight exactly exactly that's what i'm saying oh eyes are open though feeling bad feeling bad i'm telling you it takes time one more month zombies are definitely coming yeah these guys okay i'm an idiot one right in front of me come in 108. 36. i think it's a lifeline [Music] yes i got it just in time someone's firing me from like down here yeah that was the other team i was still uh right here i'm almost there guys bunch of people here what the heck is happening that was the last one nice work away that guy's just gonna raise his teammate that's fine yeah he just ran away that guy's got a damn teammate on that bridge i need bats i don't have any i got some i dropped one for you thank you he was on those stairs like there yeah broken is on the left i found one didn't hit his teammate yeah there's the other straight i cannot crack that there's no way take this um you should take this oh yeah [Music] one of these did you have energy no fine i've got to go back to you i got one nice i probably should have got more shields i definitely should have got one i'll come up with shields i have six shields fifteen cells i've got six guys okay now we're gonna need it all these lobbies we need everything now yep horizon when a horizon has a good strafe oh no there's no traction 30 30 like what am i doing yes when i got there i thought if i thought i'm probably gonna steal this kill and i fight and she still i chill i thought what the heck is happening here uh yeah i mean i trying to hit fire the 30 30. sometimes it works but against a strafe like that absolutely there's no tracking so you don't have a level four no i've got a fast reload on it so i don't i'm pretty fine thanks well i got an extra level four if you want it oh if he's extra thank you i need a bit of energy do they know we're here i don't know is that someone shooting there it's an explosion i'm just gonna wait till i get out and pop this here's uh i don't have any cells thank you i'm sorry i don't have any syringes do you need bats or anything i have i have six syringes i have one bat and three cells yeah here you go beautiful thank you all right we're good we're good we're good i thought oh no i got my two times yeah i think i swapped it by accident i mean he'll be all right now we'll save it until we actually need it oh yeah i'm not in the train yeah so that one's close to me if you can keep them on the left i can help this might be trailers the ones one's flanking we gotta we gotta go somewhere else this spot i'm going under i'm going under let's go this way punching a tunnel i'm trying to move this yeah it might be i'm trying to get up here bam oh this is when the 30 30 is just not it it's tough recharging my shield less than 30 seconds i don't know why i'm using a wingman when like my mind is on 12 different things because sometimes i'm just i need to i need to use an easier gun i should be using the scout yeah it's it's going to make it harder but i mean we're going to get kills out there yeah are they fighting they're fighting over here mate i think we're fine i think we can honestly take this rope with that one yeah we'll go left we'll go left let's explore this way we need to get behind this team over there yeah i'm going also here i'm quite close here yeah they're fighting from far one one team's pushing towards you aren't you on your own rings i don't know here in front of me they're all on me yeah yeah one's got weiss what's down the other one's got white really white well one shot he's one shot i the other team is coming from uh west everybody it's because everybody's playing so passive it's crazy yeah i think they might be at that care package yeah that's okay that's good though that's distracting hopefully they didn't get a creeper yeah they're pushing he's running up how do we win that that's crazy let's go nice shots thank you not the end no i had to steady him just like wait a second let me just get a head shot here you know did you say you put your settings on steady i put my i had to quickly stop shooting went into the options ready put it on steady to get the head shot just to make sure okay i'll put it back now i'll put it back okay he's okay okay 28. that's good solid solid performance
