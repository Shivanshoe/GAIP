hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back playing with jackson so far and there is only one outcome when you land on purple armor a mastiff and a flatline in scraptor city it doesn't happen often at all but when it does you just have to send it in the full variety you can't hold back you've just got to get involved get in there and start shooting people straight away this is a great game i'm sure you guys are going to enjoy it please drop a sub to the channel if you are new around here and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends he's fun i like playing chicken too goodbye chicken i'm gonna go back oh yeah you're playing watson i yeah i'm not surprised i see play watson all the time really yeah you're a big watson fan right right low-key when if i were to play competitive like if i were to play like would probably be a ferocious uh always be sarcastic i've never seen you play in my entire life but you would be good watson i like playing once or something if you're going to the lobby she's really hard to play with like a really good team because you all just like ape everything and they die uh that's the thing i'll be there for emotional support don't worry i'll just be there bro wait there's a what's never hear me it's one of you she's one of you all right yeah i killed him and then he just kept backing up come not to die to me i landed on purple and massive so i just ran in though it's kind of nice because i'm just going to be a little support guy all game and you're all going to kill everything it's going to be wonderful i'll tell you this if we need to fence up a building i got it oh yeah yeah yeah you're looking down oh how do i not get that stick it's so sad slow down on top of water i believe how do i keep bouncing up wait oh no there's someone else what the heck yeah another team on the on the train track i can't even get an angle on it because it's on fire this room is on fire he's coming up he's on me oh god i'm a phoenix kid in the other building no he's one shot [Music] i wish i could have made it up here i'm gonna go rezzy right now yeah i completely left that building all together i saw way too many people and i was a little a little watson guy that's a fun start having a no bolt mastiff he's kind of rough against purple armor though that was that was a tough fight someone's here on you right someone just slid obviously so far that's my bad something else see jenks you have 12 kills on watson i told you yeah what's in mine do you have 12 in total yeah nice dude you know what's funny those 12 kills are all from algs all of them seriously seriously we uh it was the first round of algs and i played with johnny and kobe how'd you guys do i got 12. 12 kills nigel sounds good yeah it was actually not bad we made it to there was four rounds we made it to the third round if you made it to the fourth round would you then have players would have been on the big screen yeah it would have been considered a professional team really they're on the train you guys are okay yeah i think it's the lifeline you should be dead i'm actually furious with that whole series of events there's no way you actually just downed yourself really wow he was not a bloodhound so that was a different team there's an octane there was an octane and a bloodhound yeah the bloodhound's a teammate and who did you kill i just killed the uh the bloodhound you knocked in here it's actually like halfway man and that's all of it good job components you need to destroy my life for that online the rice should be really weak i have no heavy thank goodness for you guys on my word i have so many shields and so many med kits but so few heavy rounds i have one heavy round and like oh my god uh yeah i feel like the extra i can drive you a little i needed to loot so bad dude i've been running around with no cells at all i have i have 20 cells do you need something i have 20. i've just been hoovering the box now i've i've literally done nothing i've just been kind of existing don't worry about the heavy i've switched it for an r9 because yeah if we're both struggling today this has been a really weird game i can't double jump and shield up at the same time no did you guys know that uh hold on i gotta critique this fence as a as a watson main this is actually a pretty fire fence unfortunately there's lots of ways around it ah you know what this reminds me of have you seen that memories like the baby rhinos are very dangerous and he just walks around the fence yeah that's literally what these fences there's there's a way to improve this fence let's show me what you would do mate show what you would do give me the tips give me the two we would we would go just a tad bit farther and then what we would do is we would crank one oh let me i'm stuck now i'm stuck see that's not tame those drums were really bad mate let me critique those jumps oh nice that's actually huge it's incredibly effective you know and then we put one over here and then i assume they down the storm because there's nothing they can do they're stuck that actually just leaves the game with that nothing you could do you're seeing the fade line in the ring little expenses fellas oh my god you see how i got 12 kills in the lgs now right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i assume with all fences that's the thing man i mean look at me now i probably would have had 24 because they increased the amount of damage the fences do i mean it's just unfortunate the lgs qualifies when yesterday i know right when they come around again you know oh i'm not sure i'm retired oh yeah i'm sorry retired on a good note retired on a good note i'm going to try are you yeah yeah i'm going to put squats together coach you could play watson okay yeah that's actually a good idea are you guys fighting no but there we are and now i mean i've got nothing i've done zero i've been literally done i mean it's such a good start and then i died in such a sad way and then the lifeline got a raise ah what i think oh yeah it was a replicator i heard a lifeline down here i literally can't shoot what i'm seeing are they dead dead no he popped a bat right before i oh he's uh he's boxing fine someone's boxed it hey i think that's this uh i took this but i shouldn't have taken it i'm so sorry level four i don't really want it you guys want you can take it that's an octane yeah just did more it's awesome with an octane dude it's not even about the sim it's about the pad you get a pad every like 30 seconds true it's like i take gold helmets without pain all the time but i don't tell my teammates they wouldn't understand the selfishness behind it you know i mean it makes sense a pat every 30 seconds imagine the plays shield battery here yeah possibly just okay we should probably get safe i'm gonna try and punch this you're getting used to your new sensitivity now that you're on uh the normal response curve oh yeah may i feel good you're good with it oh yeah i will say i tried it on playstation and oh on me i think stop moving when you shoot please i hate them you do that all the way around die charging on my shield i don't like it when people move and shoot the same time why are they moving shoot at the same time no no i don't like it when they do that i'd rather them just stand still it's kind of annoying right it's really frustrating and that's my least favorite thing about this game strengthen i'm gonna set up in our building over here so it's nice and safe nice and cozy oh there's one squad ah they're up there what do you know oh they're on sniper mountain oh don't worry i'll make sure this building is nice and sticky the gibby on sniper mountain with a trouble take i mean i am i'm disgusted they're safe for ages so that's like middle yeah they're safer so long hold on what place can i make with horizon over here it's gonna take you a little while to get up there one has blue shield and i'm joining in i'm joining in uh i'm going to try my best oh they know they're aware oh god they're away i have an idea i'm just i don't know how you got it to do the 35 minutes but i am trying to get there i broke one and i ordered them nice nice nice [Music] like he's trying to be frightened he started blasting he started blasting oh dude though i honestly climbed that whole mountain just with the rising right i don't know how you did that i know what to do you are the apex impressive
