hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the day is nearly upon us season 12 is just two days away now and there are plenty of things that i'm looking forward to one of them is actually the alternator coming back as flawless this gun was massively underappreciated before it went into the care package rotation as it was one of the best guns early game the slightly lower fire rate made it so easy to kill someone without reloading at the start of the game even without an excellent mag and even though it is outclassed for the r9 in the mid to late game the gun is just so consistent that if your emmy makes mistakes you'll almost always win that good fight thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't know why you gave that to me i'll be following you all day i'm used to it i'm on mouse and keyboard are you actually yeah i told you all right controller's already oh you were joking about that part oh it never works when no yes on a sentinel attention shotgun level three i need to address my seating position the ultimate tryout mode yeah i'm in controller uh controller position but i'm gonna have some keywords so see what life it's your chair low yeah it's really low yeah someone makes pink did you do a lot of stuff that i didn't mean to do turn horizon q up top uh about it i press oh my god stop it got the valkyrie who i all played isn't it cracked [ __ ] him he's weak there's 20 mirages over here uh come on come on come on big boy yeah can i get up top i need light ammo bar my cue i think that where the loot was yeah i just remember that i wanted uh i have 43 bullets for no nine oh drop a little bit here 60. okay oh wait i did not make top charging on my shields what am i lagging hmm this is scary kind of scary oh not a play she's at the bottom rampaging there that one i mean if i was on control these guys would have been dead 15 minutes ago what you talking about teammate keeps falling off the edge no i meant to fall there are scaring them what are they doing i don't know i think they're a mess are they getting birdied i think they're baiting i don't bait when i hear it jesus do you need a bat i have to uh i i don't have any but that's what's the worst that is the worst bait ever he's shooting his teammate yay what kind of bait is that because he's got they've got a corset so they want to come down so bad i can literally hear him shooting in the caustic am i dragging this pad works watch on if they take it yeah yeah 100 yeah they'll hit it oh now you need to come in it's baby it's cooking up come on come on come on take the pad take the bag take the fat well may julie imagine if there was voice comms on this mate i need you know when the game plan is up to you this is what we do it's a mess of course if needed cracks he's on the level beneath us what do we do can't really too much one oh man i'm sorry that was so strange the longest that was nice that was actually pointless but if it's anyone other than a core seek yeah i'm gonna have to use two close range guns because we're outnumbered in these gun fights you know yeah and i mean you're kind of on your own in these by the way i don't know if you noticed what do you mean i mean like i'm not the worst but i'm not doing anything so yeah well it's like you playing with me you know oh you know the tables have turned kind of a similar vibe nope didn't mean to do that oh wait actually there's somebody up there level three oh yeah they're coming this way they're going back and traveling you claim igl don't ask me i didn't claim igl were you gonna ask your your your team your igl i don't know which way to go i don't want to get pushed who said that oh my god oh you literally said that i don't know if that's true this is worse punch boost do you oh no because i'm not wasting my money and horizon doesn't have an airline that's a trick question oh she has one wait my controller works hey we got it he's got to escape i'll try and distract them from this way if you want and you can tackle that when i'll follow you after yeah they're on what they're they're over this way i think they're all in the middle right on my head are they there's one here too what is going on man they're doing something they're setting up grapples ziplines come on she's standing in front of the screen mate they're taking a rope yeah i think the other team out there you're in the way what are you doing just trying to see if there's any chick in here there's no chicken look no chicken stock give her some chicken there's no chick i ate the chicken just give her some chicken why are you eating all of the chicken there's a full team home that's been on that uh that other high ground park really oh no both these teams stop beats that guy by the way no not the guy i killed get over there go fine i am igl i'm commanding you to go okay i'm going i'm mom's going 18 18. the team still over there i gotta try and get banner i reckon no there's no way i get banner i wish they would yeah they're joining i don't want him to get banner don't want them to no that's weird that's weird no you don't want them to get better because the weird thing i want because then they can respawn their teammate and as is serious as igl i don't want that to happen you won't understand the tactics is that what that is yes if you didn't know i definitely haven't used that a thousand times on you that's crazy that's weird no you have not i'm ready the fuse a good sniper yeah i'm safe you're safe okay i'm fine did you manage the first or no no i was making sure you don't have a rez i'm pretty sure he doesn't okay he doesn't he doesn't it's fine he had one i thought i heard it still no squad still the other squad yeah keep looking i'm very tempted to craft a bat but i have one can you get to me trying to finish this because they're going to rose are they let me see if i can come on this is the password because if this team behind decides to come this way mate we're screwed what's about 140 140 on them watch outside the rope uh if you want to you can hold that that's a good angle for you too i've got alternator he's behind this i'm gonna i'm gonna jump on him two on me two on me giving any cracks i don't have any bullets i have 21 altenew all
