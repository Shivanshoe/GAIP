hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got our hands on the season eight a gameplay trailer and it looks unreal we get an in-game look at the new obliterated king's kenya with its expansion of the north side of the map we get to see the new legend fuse in action with all of his abilities and his passive as well and we get to see the new gun the 30 30 repeater with a new charge of mechanic in there as well so let's start off with the new legend here fuse we get a look at his abilities which include a cluster grenade launcher and his ultimate which looks like it's going to be one of the most powerful ultimates in the game it looks like a gibby ultimate but it comes down far quicker so you have less time to react and it sets the whole place on fire there's a good chance that he can walk through this fire as well as his passive because we get to see him introduced in the trailer with him walking through the flames from his ultimate so maybe he can just walk through fire and it's not a problem for him he's definitely going to be an aggressive legend and those my favorite ones to play a lot of damage in there you can get some squad wipes i'm sure and i can't wait to play him next up we have a look at the new obliterated kings canyon the updated map that we will be playing on next week and i am so happy that it's not just a complete wasteland from the explosions that were going on in the trailer we got last week it's not just a wasteland it's been rebuilt uh in some areas and it looks really good from this screenshot here it looks like the map has been expanded a little bit at the north side with the mounting cabin being destroyed there's a balloon tower over here as well so you can land loot up and then get out of there and go in third party someone else and here you can actually see the entrance to the new expansion which may help with your bearings a little bit it's where those ropes go across to the back building um but that back building unfortunately has been completely destroyed it's gone it's ruined this appears to be the new slum lakes which we got a teaser for the other day again it's been built up which i'm really happy about because my kind of my favorite kind of fights even are the ones that you can get in cities and buildings just like skrapito city and school town so the fact that more of the map is being built up like this is amazing i can't wait to play it our final teaser for the new updated king's canyon is a gun vault which we have got in uh what is it world's edge there's a little area you can land and it's got like a selection of weapons but this one looks like it's just chilling in the open so it's not somewhere you're going to land if you're passing by and you want to upgrade your uh your alternator to an r9 uh you might want to find one of these also it looked like the doors took a while to open i'm not sure if you're going to have to find something to get inside this place and there's going to be more loot or if it's just going to be a door that you walk up to and press open and it just opens for you i can't really tell next up we have the new 30 30 repeater rifle which can be seen in action here it fires pretty quickly to be honest and it has the ability to charge up a shot if you zoom in and don't shoot for a while if you wanted to do more damage to someone that perhaps doesn't know you're there or you can charge up your shot whilst in cover and then poke up hug your head up and crouch and then pop someone in the head for perhaps 100 damage or so i'm not really sure how much damage it will do but it is an interesting mechanic now i love the skates so i'm glad there's another precision-esque rifle in the game for me to play with i'm sure it's going to rise up in the ranks to be one of my favorite guns in the game and that's my friends is going to be season 8 mayhem if you are excited for this please be sure to sub to the channel because we will be covering all this new content as it gets released and then of course on the actual release date there'll be a few videos on this channel as well and maybe even a live stream but until then i've got some gameplay for you i hope you enjoy and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wasn't really too excited oh your lifeline yeah yeah i got you oh someone's closed what are you trying to say i'm full if you want to wait [Music] oh huge i need a uh i need some cells he's got to find other people now hold on hold on i'm switching that for that i'm going like this all right i'm on the way you see him do you have a patch um where are they oh right below me still another team though i think in a forester okay oh my god that's unfortunate she's just so small why is she so small she was that weak i couldn't eat her because she's just chilling behind the desk she is so tiny okay honestly oh there's a purple right here i honestly don't mind a uh a wraith hitbox uh nerf because she is really dying i didn't realize until i got into pc lobbies how much of a problem it was because you run into these sweaty race that only know how to use a mastiff oh you can't hit them and they're hitting you for 150. they're so difficult to hit with that led strafe come on top of us i'ma chuck in a lot of stuff why would they challenge us is the question um i don't know probably won't next time um that won't have a chance oh yeah um already what's the zip line are they gonna hop on it but i still don't have a bowl oh i have a grey bowl i thought broke a pathfinder oh it's because his body was like being all floppy and stuff and i wanted him to stop oh i see did he work i don't like that yeah he's got he's gone he's done uh how many i have one back four cells that's not that bad um i i dropped yourself yourselves in here if you need anything he's broke isn't it yeah 218 ah okay i probably i could have had a red armor like 15 times but i'm gonna i'm gonna baby i'm gonna see it mine at 750 so i think i feel like my arm switched along the way because i had i don't know i know i i left my purple down low didn't i oh that explains everything i don't know i just swapped so much i don't even look at the numbers anymore would you did you get over there i'm just speedy speedy boy are you killed leader is this [Music] yeah i don't like that i might be going train uh i guess so every time we go this way i feel like it doesn't work out working through here yeah team's gonna rotate through i feel like they're rotating through here right now i just don't know where should i stop shooting oh maybe or did you land on a little platform that was all part of my plan big value i got here fighting that harvester i feel like if we went to train we would have found kills for the first time ever i mean you you convinced me now yeah i didn't mean to can i hear you still could you you're good straight right hello hello yeah i hear you fine you hear me yeah yeah it glitches at the end of that sentence you said the end i think my uh my threshold on my mic is just pretty low so if i if i don't speak at a certain volume it just starts cutting out all my words have a noise guy on crying yeah so you don't like hear all my background noise you're going that way really oh they're fine that sorting yeah this one's white um literally ten times faster than you yeah because you're octane oh yeah exactly i can take any and there's a care package right here for the dub okay it was a purple arm i'm taking the rope good old purple armor this is already involved i'm literally shooting right now oh my god everyone's retreating there's a race behind this one's jumping doesn't matter really weak behind that i'm fighting somebody else i'm sorry okay there's no way he escapes without i'm just flabbergasted just keep in mind he's in the open like immediately yeah just right there somewhere [Music] 27 uh there's a lever on this one and that's i feel like they fell in so this might be someone healing clothes inside okay what are the right he's right here i just stalled on his head really if you can make the top i can help nice good job when you jump and you like stall on their head i don't know you mean oh he's moving i think it might disappear by the time you get there but it's like a clear package in that professor thank you thank you still alive i don't know how that whole series of events is really weird the spitfire is nice but i feel like people just have an opportunity just to get around the corner you know just about it's the dps the dps isn't there so many situations where dps just really doesn't matter yes there's a team that took that road back there and they were shooting at us while we were running yeah i yeah i saw a lot of people back there that just hit in the shadows that was a weird game like everybody's kind of scattering i'm not talking about it yeah yeah yeah yeah right here there's two of them actually on right as well and we just got that i have a gold bag as well here we go we know where their last team was they just revived yeah that's right yeah down here thermal oh they're coming up because she hit me huge punch huge punch maneuvers one trap oh feels bad that was not cinematic at all no it would have been that would have been tremendous nice we kind of rolled that whole lot uh we did we did some good work out there you good work soldier ex-champions very nice i'll take it once i had to stop sitting on the thermite to punch her i was like this is not going to end well you know i ran out because i got scared i was like oh wow and you talked to me about commitments i i got scared i thought we were going to lose i didn't want to cause i i ran through the thermite once and then i was going to have to run through it again in order to get her and i would have died off use the insurance use the insurance package
