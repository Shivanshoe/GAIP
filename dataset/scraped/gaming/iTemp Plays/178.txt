hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today in this game it's probably the best i've played on apex for a very long time and it's not reflected as much in the damage and the kills because i've definitely had bigger numbers but you know when you just you just feel like you can't do anything wrong you know your shot's just on it feels crazy it feels clean and i was using a gun that i don't often use as well today also marks an entire calendar year of daily apex legends uploads and if you've seen any of them while you're watching this one i just want to say a huge thank you for all the support i really do appreciate it i cannot believe i did an entire year so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it have a great new year and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh there are people landing on this side the map i didn't expect that did not expect that yeah yeah get out of here didn't even yoink it i don't know how i need a weapon every first gun i get he says gosh darn mozambique and i'm not even trying to play lifeline for someone someone else is playing lifeline for the first time ever people live there it's all gone you're stuck terrified about an emp oops not so fast so yeah the heck was that extra supplies do you happen to have a shotgun bolt i'm tempted to leave the honest i'm tempted to leave the inside hemlock like this chuck chuckling ball why is that just lit on the floor like this why is there a shield back back there and a med kit on the side of that place i understand significant ground to cover all right find a song i'm gonna put on hemlock but i'm still using it uh well unbelievably there are people dying fragment i just i didn't foresee this event happening to be honest with you we strategized effectively i'm sorry shock of my hemlock abilities i didn't know i i possessed such a thing please just be like a one times in here or something come on we have 30 seconds prepare please no oh my god i'm inside him like it is i have been slapping with it uh let me check this renewed renewed 98 seconds ago 10 seconds the ring's closed 40 seconds can i you know start in here for a while that was a minute this is looted almost certainly because there's a death skull thing on it treasure back the enemy is here i heard recharging [Music] they get a second chance well done extended light magazine here i am going to go get lifeline back i'm not even going to really loot that much and this one's safe than the other one [ __ ] sits up top oh my team was uh reviving i don't think that was the play i think we should have just stuck it but it's okay we got the job done i can't hate on a player for trying to revive their teammate it was just risky that's all can you make it here and then we can choose the watson fences we'll try and utilize them surely you think so anyway oh now that's the most disgusting head glitch i've ever seen stick it you won't stick it i mean that's his teammate recharging shields no we got rid of the fence why do we get rid of the fence gonna hit you for a little bit and then we could have like just come to fear for a little bit moving here follow me let's get out of here and get some loots moving here follow me there's nothing wrong there evil shield here i know i think my team might pick one up yeah there's something up there i think that was the play just readjust lifeline needs loot uh she probably didn't have too many bullets it was a good spot to defend but yeah the time's gone now anyway if you require it no there we go those of my teammates are healthy enough target acquired an enemy there they're going to get shot in the back horrendously these teams going to make their way over oh god my phone's weak i got you 40. grenade another enemy falls recharging shields man i knew we're going to get 30 like that but it was just so difficult to do anything about it until the ring closes coming to retrieve you i'm gonna try 45 seconds can you beat this fight isn't over get up focus do not let them best you again i've secured the banner recharging shields a decent amount reality i damn one of them there's a pathfinder from a separate team with them the heat shield in obviously i don't have any why would i that would be useful i don't think i'll make this out to be honest this is gonna be third ring is it gonna be rough i have two med kits if i can get to this hill i can slide down and do it but it's gonna be tough this i got both banners though let me slide and do it quick i'm i think i'm fine yeah i'm fine i'm not going to press anything i want to finish this meditate the amount of times i accidentally finish or like cancel one of those is ridiculous yeah yeah i hear you perfection i should probably heal first but i've got two minutes to get there is one in the crafter no i'm not going to heal i don't want to waste the time i need to get my teammates back here i have a heat shield or a mobile respawn or anything maybe i could have done that one in the zone but that team of three is gonna rush that i don't know if only i had a i finally have saved my i think if i down that ash there i think there was three of them i think it was three people and the pathfinder if he was just the two i could have used my uh arc star ability but and then throwing a nade in there if i had one that would have been the optimal play i mean i didn't have a nade or anything but it's always good to try and think back you recharging know three small hills here no problem thank you for being patient recharging 45 seconds remain getting your feet cooked i'm gonna try and find some guns in here for him i changed this massive skin to mine r301 here like eva shot shotgun ammo here i've eight shield cells don't need those there's more light rounds here as well i can craft some bats 20 seconds maybe not oh wait the zone's like really close so i probably can i'll probably get away with it 10 seconds until the ring closes move was that one wait where is oh it's up here no please quick i think we're good 40 seconds for it to close in all we need to do is get in here we're fine i wasn't even trying to play ash but she's turned out to be quite the uh quite the legendary of my ultimate save me twice now i've used it to disengage rather than engage on enemies you know that's a nice thing about it you can you can just reposition aggressively defensively other words that rhyme with that that i can't think of all kind of options other 13 people left this never happens on world's edge he's great me heavy ammo and that's going to reach maybe easy if they pushed up but i don't think they did [Music] any heavy boots anywhere we're in silver yeah it's sort of a weird spot this is right in the middle but i can [ __ ] up here let's try and get the loot first and maybe if we walk up we can save we can save it ring's not too far 45 left i don't know if you want to play too aggressive here or maybe we do if we third party they can just take their their whole low dates because they're struggling with flawless at the moment okay i'll miss a lot of shots at the end someone's craving that's not worth me firing don't please don't die i'm nice i'll cover you guys i'll cover you guys i'm here what the heck all right nice job that was honestly huge i got scared when they they were getting shot but they won the gunfight got out of there that's perfect it's mirage surely don't let them slip away i'm just joking on this stupid rock no i should have should have hit my shots but the rock was annoying oh let go okay i'm actually throwing the game nice get him out of here good job teammate i haven't landed a shot in about three hours i think have like good loots you would assume this guy might have a crater we've got the high ground we're safe for a little bit let's make sure these guys don't sneak up on us anyone have any more heavy ammo or heat shields or anything heavy ammo here that's tremendous thank you what a beast i don't know if he's your salute an excellent selection if we down one of these we can just pour to them oh no she's drowning i thought he's an ultimate i need to save this for the final fight pretty much i was going to take any heat shields but the times passed because they died right on the edge look they're really close it sure just for like two seconds maybe pick up some ammo but is what falls we're safe timing you're an absolute demon nice a huge win nice guys thank you for being patient bam i didn't really do too much at the end of that game you know what the start was so good i got too nervous at the end of the game maybe i should have played a little bit more aggressive you know they had the right idea trying a third party that so they can get some bare loot we have to thank you no team effort that was that was huge well played nice i think i've already got the 3k for us so i don't really care about that i'm just happy we won ggs
