hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are getting extremely close to diamond rank where it gets a little bit more serious and i won't be playing solo anymore but we will be teaming up we will be communicating we will be formulating speculating back dating and and creating i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it looks more exciting over there all right countdown it is i've actually landed here a good amount in solar rank just because a lot of time yeah it's uncontested i mean i've got an arthur one or three and i'll throw him with a blue mag and a level one mag power i mean i to be honest with you i'd have been absolutely fine if we were contested here every time i've got good loot here no one lands here every time i've got terrible loot there are four teams and they are all punching me in the back of the head just the way it works but it's okay when you land uncontested in ranks obviously you loot up and you find someone to third party it's the ultimate rp gainer it's the way to play big scrap i've been fighting here for quite a while actually i don't know if octane's got jump pad i've got ultimate is ready i think i need to throw down my ultimate before he throws down his jump pad just because it's the pad is more versatile than the rope you know the rope guesses here when there's no one arranged but the pad can be used to escape and stuff and chase a lot easier in my opinion oh i want to grapple in so bad i'm going to save it i don't want to die hey young my kill and i didn't even touch that guy either this is a disaster i've been scammed 0kp that guy's a little bit injured but that box is one shot i hate it at least 10 times all right i'm leaving too that guy solo i'm pretty sure my teammates getting rushed why is there a pad in there does anyone know and these guys got friends i think we'd go and help the octane i don't think this team is going to push we got the high ground on them and our octane i don't know if this guy actually had teammates or not i thought he was solo but mean even if he's just him if he popped a bat it's like a fair 1v1 all of a sudden you know it's going to help him zero light rains and i am spraying oh my god i'm having an out of body experience here there we go i missed we should just dive in his forehead just get him just whack him one did you not see what happened to you the guy that tried that and on the service on this guy he would be weak teammate but i suffered unfortunately and he's got friends there's a few more death boxes around here though no one is using it well that guy was he had an re but some must have got his box still kind of struggling though level three as well i'm coming i'm not coming forget it i'll just leave it there all right that was perfect i feel like we played that really well i don't know if you guys have realized this recently but the two times the r301 is probably my favorite gun in the game now like i'm just i don't know it's it's so good i don't know how i didn't like the two times before in my defense it is a little bit weird on my controller sayings it's like the sensitivity is just a little bit slow you just need to make sure that you always sort of next like when you zoom in you have to be right on target otherwise it's a waste of time it's a little awkward but once you're on target it's very hard to miss does that make sense hopefully someone out there knows what i'm talking about it's just a bit weird all right scrapping scrap it all the scrap capital of the entire world of course world renowned i've got to try and enjoy these flat lobbies a little while longer because once we get to diamond i don't actually know if i'm going to bother with solo queue because diamond lobbies are tough they are real tough that was kkk she definitely does not love me nor did these guys apparently um if they absolutely come on i'm never going to kill this guy but if i just put some shots down so it doesn't shoot my teammates sometimes you've got to fight your way out of a bad situation and when you're playing pathfinder that's why i love them so much you just you grapple to each bit of cover and then when you're waiting for your grapple cooldown you just put a few shots down in fact teammates aren't going to check this i i'm going to use all of this light ammo there we go i'm going to use all this light ammo so quickly okay okay grapple to cover and then between with like when you're waiting for your grapple to come back you just put a few shots down let's see they're having a massive scrap day there we go this guy's gonna get pushed by the zone two in 40 seconds so we loot up we prepare for it we put them off we get three kills these guys are safe though annoyingly their fight's over by the look of it nice that's our backup plan attention i want to try and get this gunfight over with if you can i'm scared of a third party from whoever point of construction oh friend oh your teammates just got the weirdest angle ever apparently and i guess you could only see me that's fair enough a little bit a little bit too eager you guys can just you guys could just shoot them you guys you guys are winning that gunfight 100 but i guess it's nice i'm getting bored there can't complain about that was a little bit of an ego challenge but because my teammates were also challenging i was just hoping that okay i'm good i was just hoping that i wasn't the center of attention you know i should just batted to be honest back here somewhere i don't know if c can oh we don't have us here this way oh octane what kind of jump was that teammates crafting uh the plan was to go across the road but i'm not gonna because that wraith might go back for banners there you go i'm a tactical genius i don't think this guy's going to get too aggressive yeah they're running we'll just go back up top even if they get a respawn off they're going to get brushed in this tiny circle absolutely fine yeah yeah he definitely did he wasn't looking for a scrap he probably was just hiding in a corner in one of those buildings waiting for us to leave we could have camped the banners but i mean it's not i mean who cares this is the wraith though can we even kill this guy maybe if he gets weak he can die in the zone or something i don't know how successful this is going to be team but there's no one else to shoot so i'm done i mean it wasn't a smart player but i knew it wasn't a smart play and i talked myself into it careful okay they're not coming for some reason i thought they were trying to further yeah let's go for the drop and okay there we go pathfinder main by the way all right what we reckon i reckon this could be a spitfire i don't mind a spitfire i've been struggling with light the entire time gold bag we're going to get stuck between teams here there's got this team down the hill and this team that was flanking left this safe might be something this way cancel that this is kind of rough we're in a bad spot we're gonna kill him we need to do now teammates just kill them and take their position right the other team isn't really pushing they're on the hill back there right okay they're getting rushed actually yeah i've been moved for too long here i'm gonna get back up top you can rez others will never get out of this place i've just got a delay until my teammates can come up let's put downs oh come on bloodhead i just wanted to punch you i tell what i think once that game there like i sort of threw by loon for too long but i thought they were on the mountain so my teammates really held up well but me going straight back up the rope and like grappling up top just to buy some time we'd have been stuck underneath there and i don't know how we'd have got up i'm pretty sure the tunnel was like blocked off from the zone or whatever maybe we could have ported around and we would have been okay but oh my god i dropped nearly 3000 damage i just had to get up there and just take that team's eyes off my off my teammates for a second uh worked out well i got saved a few times teammates are real good nearly 3000 damage platinum is coming to the end my friends but it was a gg
