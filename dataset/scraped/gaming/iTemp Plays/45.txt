hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i think the flatline is going to be my most used weapon this season especially with it being in the crafter in season 12 i didn't really get to use it too much three of my favorite weapons are currently in the care package as well the vault the g7 scout of course and the mastiff which just entered there this season and i'd probably put the flatline as my fourth favorite and it's just so versatile as well it's good close range and medium range a little bit tricky long range i will admit but as a controller player long range is always going to be a little bit more difficult and it's amazing right the way through the game from the start to the end it doesn't matter how many attachments you have on this thing it's just so good i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds let's see what we migos over here pick your controller we're going in i'm here i'm here i'm here i'm here i'm here what the heck am i building me dumb building get the heck out of here oh that's not you that's chief how's the chief sorry here we go don't be afraid to fight i'm here with you no you're not i'm alone broke one cracked one shattered an enemy shield it will crack well done i missed all my shots on the bloodhound i don't even hear anyone firing what don't drive out because i have a ball oh that makes sense look out enemy here there's a team there's a team to your face careful looking too hot oh they get involved in that scene i'm not gonna be an idiot i'm gonna drop this down here so you guys can use it it's ready what a guy don't mind if i do yes they're in here oh are they oh okay i don't know there's a team here is a come on man i'm supposed to get out of here that thing is so busted why do they have to have it's like stunting yeah like i don't understand the the electrocution part that's so that doesn't tie into his kid no they're just like that's definitely like a meeting they had and some guy was just like yeah have it charged up i mean 100 they just have a hat and they just have about a hundred different abilities in the hat and they just pick them they just did they just did a randomizer give me a second generally easy so they can like they can release in powerful and one of the nerfs is gonna be like oh we no longer stung you i mean it makes sense they don't want to rather release a legend that's busted in the beginning than underwhelming yeah me too gotta be excited to play him this powerpoint isn't going no no no what were you gonna what were you gonna ask if the hammer points went on l-star on the l-star i was joking i looked at the alternator dumb question i was looking at the alternates everything i remembered it what a dumb stupid question you were dumb for asking that look i want to know how bad that gun is there that comes gotta be so terrible it was already so hot trash yeah it's pretty bad it's gonna be top top five worst guns ever i'd rather punch than have that gun nah that's crazy no i'm getting the range if you have the all-star and i'm punching i reckon i win whoa whoa whoa no honestly uh [Music] uh might on my teammate i'm not with you okay i'm going through it break on me come on come on i still need you that was the end of that squad yeah she poured on me so i i had to take her back and come on you know the rest still need you one second let's do some shopping out of culture there's nothing in here i've never been so disappointed yes this is this is probably the worst lollipop her ultimates are always very questionable my ultimate question all but my my rhymes are incredible oh my gosh and again and again and again they release the second one yeah it's the one that's in the crafty oh my god 2.0 external light mic here level three watching me loose and he's like oh that's why he hit me for 201 sprays on controller and i'll tell you what it's fair enough true it's fair enough it's a good point sure it's a good point it's a good point he's made oh my god let me know i was way close to them but they were not interested i can't see i know it's kind of tough as soon as you fire oh i'm an idiot recharging shields they're shooting like a singular pixel no i'm tempted to go there oh okay i'm gonna cut all that out and everyone's gonna be wondering why i've got a hundred fewer bullets and like 20 more damage 20 more damage i think i hit one bullet i hit one bullet i mean i definitely hit more than one bullet hundred percent i don't know i hit at least a minimum of five what goes later oh there you go then what do you mean there you go you've got way less recall than a flat line oh you know you just bow with the fly no i just couldn't see him i couldn't see him not looking at your problem there's bow joint [Laughter] jesus christ spit it out beaujon why is this rock so bad i typed in the chat but he didn't reply shield battery here 154 please chill please chill please check there just oh yeah i just got beat i'm charging my shield i've literally not thrown one game today and you're playing at least man it's really cringe banner activating jump drive recharging shields okay i'm gonna revive you right here teammates uh so sir i'm gonna respawn straight away hold on 45 seconds until the ring closes we've got time but not much oh 40 seconds that's enough time right uh don't die for it i need you don't foreign that happens happens see someone out there he's uh mark the respawn ship is an enemy i think he might shoot you when you come down okay oh that would help would you want it like here without reaching anywhere i'll probably hit here probably won't be able to get my box here so they can't destroy we've got one minute for this zone by the way we should probably go yeah there's nothing in here yeah i wasn't close enough to the boxes oh my god he's down one of them shields come on come on chief queef i've got to stop saying that man i've zero i was terrible there was nothing yeah i'm sorry if you pad we can get ahead of him this way i'm scanned man i cracked an enemy's shield nice i'm just running i don't really have anything okay so i'm just arrived are you right behind me i'm taking the rope nice nice they have alcohol in healing yeah i don't have much heavy but i can drop you a little bit of light uh i'm gonna i'm doing all right right now okay i found some uh some stuff replicator incoming let's make ourselves something nice no i have one syringe i'm not playing a legend that's good at looting me i don't know what you want from me like i don't understand it's kind of crazy i mean i put my ultimate down there there were a ton of stuff available hold on i have uh i have ultimate excellent come on come on i'm on 93. i might craft a med kill to appear what are you looking for anything in particular uh no not really or a backpack actually i can put my ultimate i don't think this place is even losing a beer let me put my ultimate down though flat line here i keep thinking i hear someone someone's gonna pop out of one of these trees got 30 seconds it covers mostly remember who hooked you up six bats i've got your back don't mind if i do oh it's thank you hold on let's go let's go let's go i took some of the bats but because like he dropped one on the floor and then when you took the bat they picked that one up oh okay well yeah that's kind of your fault no it is my fault completely but i was still devastated it didn't change that outside the ring i didn't top up activating jump drive another team after this one somewhere i think they're at this care package yeah they're waiting for this care package all three of them are just chilling right there okay yeah
