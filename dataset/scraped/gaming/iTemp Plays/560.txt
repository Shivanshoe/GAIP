hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i am going to be showing you something a little bit different i actually got this idea from so far who has uploaded a few videos showing games which didn't quite work out games that you wouldn't usually see these are the games that are in between the ones that we win and then post on youtube sometimes you get third partied and you can't handle it sometimes your aim is just really bad and you throw the game because of it sometimes it's a mixture of the two and more but i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends everything should be live i think it is i was so efficient i was making a thumbnail whilst watching the game back and when there was a bit of a dry spell i quickly edited it nice i'm trying to be more efficient i feel like i'm not efficient enough it is it's hard to find enough time in the day to do all this stuff it is i'm going to use the triple take cause i never use it i literally landed on one too so um i have a two snipers by the way will we triple take note yes i will drop this lambo cause i'm not about it someone's out there it's not funny lava they're over there see someone else stop in this whole beach i've been lagging a lot today i don't know why even earlier i'll get my pad soon so ah tom the bloodhound's just acts absolutely the best no there's no discussion full agreement i have my pad oh she jumped out broken uh almost broken oh my god how does that go everyone i don't know gotta close it come [ __ ] there's multiple things up i here this course how is this trap still here there's a few teams here sir it's anywhere safe up here let's just go let's just i'm phoenix hmm this doesn't work vayner's uh one i don't know if you're able to i can't believe i'm standing still i'm gonna just hold this door yep i'll protect you i'll either oh my god i open the door quick service in the head for 92. nice i needed that extended shotgun by the way we could find anybody maybe we would be anymore he's just leaving his friend oh that's definitely the place another team here i think now with you okay they're just all tuning in here oh my god got him the uh the lifeline hold the drone name and i shot the drone so he tanked it all which was not good for me that's not ideal it was not throwballs came in glitch there i think i have top his hemlock was going to be way harder but yeah i don't have a cytonic and it is a sniper so just got two two to four time not that i kind of like the two to four time on the uh on the triple take very nice i like the iron sights oh close close i think maybe five four great it's any cracks so i can't oh he dodged every single ability every single shot no i might go down here i don't think he buy it i think every time he changed his straight path i shot a triple take shot like he got into the room uh i thought i honestly went for the other one because i was like you should be able to get that one i should have if i'm arthur i wanna i was fine i almost died there that was kind of scary uh i'm raising my sense i'm going to raise my sense and i'm going to go through like probably not today but probably tomorrow more oh god broke him crack yes another team another team they're both celebrating i know they're corsic yeah i die here last team last team yep like b20 p20 nice i got an re an r 301 how's it not more people here uh i don't know did you scan rage up top or is there literally um no one cares about that over here first okay i don't know if there's anybody over there i don't hear anyone yeah if i get shot on my screen i'm definitely gonna get shot before i find armor happens every game i'm freaking out yeah it sounds like a call stick inside this one all right oh my god i gotta find armor first let me tell i'm not i'm not trying to fight him yeah me tape yeah i'm watching from here from here if i go here then purple because why i'm not you in a sec scanning the area i can't see this dude yeah she's really weak come on nice nice champion another team other team be careful oh god mate oh they have m locks too mate they have hemlocks as well careful yeah throw gibby what kind of both chin in the same uh same building wait there's someone posting me there's another one alive right yeah yeah that team yeah okay i'm gonna scan in a second this is the core stick i think it's called hearing one's down on this one stand over here i'm going i'm going again did we finish the kill on that guy um yeah i finished i finished his teammates they are having a google thinking that we're not going to rush him after they've uh revived like this respawn i think he's going to get away with it trying to get up the hill me too i might die here i'll turn off some covering fire i'm here i'm good i'm good i'm good okay oh my god that position is compromised i'm gonna go left and try and get an angle on honestly we need to flip by someone so yeah we just can't be like the first ones to engage yep big drop back i don't see him oh yeah here here down low okay oh my gosh right here someone's right here on me purple okay right down enemy take him down the one's on me like i think maybe around here yeah i don't know where he's here she tries to climb now cracks oh my god if we would have pushed that team down there we would have been dead already it would have been 14 teams him can i get to an angle so you can also hit him right he's packed on me i think i'm almost there give his crack behind you as well breathe play stan corsick i guess oh my god cracked oh my word mate look at my health how did you survive there literally did nothing i was trying to get inside of my raffle and as i came as i was like swinging around the whole place was filled with toxic gas i'm coming that's they're fine up top right yeah i think that's them up top oh my god i'm going near a row yep oh wait oh no i think we can't take it we can't no we can't we can uh they're right there though so be careful they padded in they padded in 50 on octane uh horizon's literally one she's actually one hp she's popping a bat though in her tactical did we kill an octane there's an octane around here don't worry i'm here i don't think i'm listening i'll scan in a second you might have gotten killed by uh one of the other teams maybe he could have there's no way you actually got away i don't know how okay well we can definitely kill this team that's what i learned from that engagement i can right on top of that thing is there all right is it one of them horizon yeah yeah horizon octane i didn't know they were the same team 22 on the octane bench on the back by the original gibby core six squad i got a drawback oh right on me coming i want to kill these guys so bad me too i don't know where they're at like this way over there okay i don't know my rope yet yeah i was very close i felt like i did there and i was like i don't know where is this give me corsic team angles cracked on me almost there a scanning here will be outrageous because that's this is where they are i think i'm gonna go down i'm gonna go down i'm literally gonna go down to this nade this is gonna be giving i think it's one guy no it's two hold the door hold it up okay i'm almost positive i thought yes of
