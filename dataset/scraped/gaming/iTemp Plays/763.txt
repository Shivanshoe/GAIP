a viscosity twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I've got a double whammy here for you on at Kings Canyon something that I've don't know if it's the jurors playlist office Kings Canyon or if it's just a text legends of the moments but the games are ridiculously flat so it's always nice to have two double whammy things so stick around after the first game because there is a second one coming so I think you're watching I do preciate and I'll see you all in five and 1/2 seconds my friends all right containment tease my friends someone is landing where I wants the lands I'll take this I'll start your hands back recharge not it back it's my dolly not bad good at the star the game that's left the game so they never to waste any bullets thank you very much you very much like teammate but I guess he didn't know what I was trying there can't really see where I'm firing out he worked out though half understood right they'll have a caption here you have a friend his lifeline might be gone internet feed yet oh my favorite items on this game that isn't like a legendary of course because the gold shields would come in top gold tell me possibly seconds it's so tense to take the the Peacekeeper book when you've got an Evo shields I think you just have to have some poke weapon you have to have some long range poke weaponry when the peacekeeper is not a long range poke weapon unless you've got the position champion of course in which case it is 99 I might just keep the Duvall by ourselves today why fine they they haven't used the respawn beacon up top but there's one Oh lovely further into the slums such ocean she would have definitely scrapped pretty pointless then extend it around till nineteen ninety one says and what do you say I'm beak I'm a big I'm a big fan bats is that was me being conceited fine I'll take it as a sign maybe this is the better option I've helped the thinker's with the Evo shells now Ysabel ludicrous getting one gunfights you've got ready book yeah we've been absolute beta T in my friends hair kappa care to be here we go spends fine as many trains okay worth picking up we can focus on something everyone Eve I'm on what LZ I'm just trying to poke by even the Bluth my friends is a guy over this way some way you got another one even you - lilo be careful okay speak tape I have killed one person and my evo I will do it's basically a free purple shield is it's actually unbelievable next fire as well I'll be taking that off your hands people were scrapped in this way still we can come back to the care package scrapping and no one site there either okay sniped that might be they'll be far away I'll look over that's come full circle here it's all lit up what you got for me as indecent or back to be left behind yeah these if these right girls from well you're on get icon messed up big scan it's going by five the the best on the game I've done how anyone can help you you could literally use this gun without any attachments yourself you know you don't need this neck white hat or you don't need a scion II think doesn't come with it an extended mag and what the stocks even do I don't even know what a stop this you're playing this game for a year and a half and I'm still none the wiser what a stock I think it switches the weapon quicker I need something with like that angel but apart from that you know it's a Gold's gone from the floor that's what I'm trying to say it's too good let's go get our care package is gonna have our gold shields two gold shields a devotion and three masters in this one care packages as now rewarding eleven people left good grief okay not bad as your friend please keep your scary okay I didn't actually lose any health whatsoever mmm but still terrifying there are times I've been double peak age from full health all right eight kills that's not too bad these games have been going so quick recently that as long as you get a decent load of kills at start you should be good I don't need your threats my tomato blue tones it's not a bangle or my healer boys are actually outrageous I have six your batteries yeah I've got I've got loads went minimize I've taken percent shield cells I guess since I've got red shields don't you see I told you to select files ridiculous wait where did I even kill him I can't remember I think it was around there French just keep your eyes peeled track his bats entice let their fates I mean I did just a head shot this guy at the sky though so I can't complain too much I have ten shield batteries what he's going on don't say breakfast okay I've got ten chill batteries thermite grenades have you got any throwables that isn't a thermal great Frank okay no do you need it I've I just got the world supply of these or something like the u n-- a face shield battery here my tech to you guys i'll take a stack there you go free of charge my friend i could have picked up that firm i grade here we go big scrap please don't give it to her just yet we managed to third-party ourselves there I think we went a little bit too deep I think we went a little bit too ham sandwich eBay when the last two teams are fighting you have to have someone to go down or you try and poke them at a range if you try to push that build and that I mean look what happened to us we've got absolutely box ten minutes that's double whammy these who is driving the supply ship was it keep turning everywhere is that purple shell two fronts it's always purple shoes or hands okay hey stomach bullets the man stole my bullets under Needham floozies I've got myself a little water lady or golden barrel stabilizer what'd you do what'd he do why you moonwalking were you the revenant that had my okay how on earth how on earth does that actually hit me what is the heat box and that silence maybe the revenant better than I even realized and I think revenants actually pretty good been here it's not that you do this as well unbelievable scenes all right well purple shields when the supply ship I think the supply ship is so much better than the Train by the way unfairly use I have 36 bullets in an alternator it's give me one sec here we go place those independent variables friends astrid of arms which so much here is there any way complaint you pretty would it started from me if I if I did I charge it actually means press that here we are why can't you drop stuff when you're healing by the way but the perfect time to do you in factory manager Scott semi stall absolutely popping off the people I land in a score ten even one usual because it's not here for long no six more days of school time we have it's gonna be weird someone left a comment on my video yesterday where I said the schools haven't came destroyed and they said they said school Tony isn't Jewish which I thought was Venus I don't need to go on that he's down there so we just stop either we don't need the high ground here we've got caustic and I've seen shielding someone some of the slides okay [Music] all right hit it on it I I honestly can't send invites of that close range I can't deal with it I feel like I'm a good player that's somewhat like sure I'm medium short range you know but if that up faint for my face like that I can't aim properly I'm just panicking I just try and spin my thumb step and you can rely on a me sister difference for me that's what 19 people left we should be punished out of London here now with we came from we camped in surplice you've never mind if I should there's a fun job anyway I am gonna take that usually I'll leave you behind on the Prowler but when your teammate is a Bangalore or a caustic it's definitely worth it selects fire I am gonna leave that off the amount of comments I've got recently about the digital threat and the select player on the pro now I just think it works Miriam first mode it actually kills faster the dps is higher but you could save rich why don't you just leave behind men or the reason is if they're a little bit further away this next fight helps it doesn't picking up these people find each other by the way scrap a barrier no it's not there I shoot that French yes I need to force them off it before I use my ulti I was famous careful friends I'm nice here we go just the right though is there another God waiting for the portal my vision is clear everything timing I'm Jason I think it might just be this right I don't want further like trying to save it right here you've been through a lot you know of course it came in with a right hook of the century Genevan I was airborne you good got some traps I hate the two times I can't stand it nice job kingly I'm getting rid of this thing priorities obviously gonna be 19 in here mighty no need to medicate till I believe I have to them there you go at this point I can't use it first range but I'm gonna try and increase my sense seems to be live again and going the firing range this is not the time to test it I'd rather have the iron sight at the moment it's just whenever I increase it beforehand I felt like it was way too much of an increase for the two times connects the one time and my aim is going way too fast it's like the opposite couldn't really find much of a balance I wish these sensitivities went in small increments rather than like 1 to 10 oh she was like a one to a hundred I wonder if we could just dominate bunka whenever you've got a cause upon your team you've always got to think ahead it was going to try and lock down a building go to bunker lock down a room get a ready click you know these sorts of these sort of thought processes it goes flying this is unlooted which is kind of strange Bunco is like I've got a soft spot for this place because this was like the first place that I love to learn that when I'm on I saw a Chinese game well that's cracking right now indeed that's through Volker that's quite the distance you could say if it was it was bunker an airfield I'm so happy that both him is still standing today some good memories even though I was absolutely atrocious where's the scrap why is he not going on are we be invited no one's hiring a single buddy making me uneasy huge that's why you pick of this digital threat what I sources have been outstanding game oh nice I don't actually didn't even realize you damn it okay such a shooter that's two massive Ultimates my teammate here beautiful okay I missed I missed the gotcha line in there [Music] he didn't even let me use the finishing move i baited out the revive there because I was full health I trust myself to win the 1v1 I mean the easiest way solid is that I believe this party just to start a revised you are the Asics champions this game I thought that was pretty good too what was that 15 kills 11 minutes 50 it's not the quickest way of all time but it's fairly quick yeah if I start the revive fair I'll just get shot a few time you said I don't lose the good fun I trust myself in the ones we want especially with a burst prowler in a building with caustic traps that are friendly easy wins thank you very much for watching I do appreciate it check out the teammates automates what incredible it's not always about how to damage you do it's about dissipating the enemy team they have to run away they had to readjust especially that one on top of like this school town place it just made them shoot out the area so we could take the high ground from them beautiful thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
