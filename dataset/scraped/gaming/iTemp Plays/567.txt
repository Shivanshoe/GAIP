hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some more ranked here as well i've really enjoyed grinding it recently and we are on the cusp we are so close to diamond and we are still going strong i hope you guys enjoy the video if you're new around here be sure to subscribe and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends that's what they call it right that's the minecraft vlogs yeah yeah yeah when i play minecraft i feel like i've completed the game and i get a diamond pickaxe so yeah there's people here oh yeah there's a lot of oh my god what how many people are here okay that's a lot of people i was not only expecting like one or two i didn't okay it's fine uh there wasn't a gun in my place so i'm a little bit worse for wear yeah okay this one might be this one's gonna be rough i'm sorry that's not your fault i don't know people here yeah i didn't know like literally everybody okay yeah that's just all you know yeah i have a p20 mate i'll just try to yeah yeah drop drop down here drop down there's actually all sorts of little on this side really yeah bins look at the bins let's see if i see me there okay whatever let's wrap towards like rift rip dish and we'll go to a power grid we'll go outside and wing man p20 okay but it really could be worse didn't give me the option to thank you but i would have if i could mate just know i found a purple mag for you i grabbed the teammate could thank you i mean yeah there's there's still a lot to do especially ever since the updates now they have the new nether update and now they're about to have a cave update on top of that as well where it actually makes caves uh scary so that'll be that'll be neat when it actually eventually comes that's why everybody's like doing starting minecraft right now because the update's gonna drop like sometime here in the next few months oh and they're trying to prepare for it yeah it's going to be pretty significant go ahead and get the foundation and the basis for it yep i'm going to start minecraft like i'd like to just upload whatever i want i mean everybody wants to yeah that's why that's why i started a second chance oh god they're right on this i'm good okay i'm actually escaping i'm gonna get some high ground yeah let's do that wait are they getting pulled up on i think they are who's throwing all those nights not our teammate i have a triple take so i'll be able to paint the way yep they are struggling look at that get him hit him hit him horizon's bottom you got him i cracked somebody be careful [Music] i need some heavy we're going to get a emp hi no i don't think so fast someone's close yeah they are run run run run run run run down the road this guy didn't hear me once and the bloodhound's down but there's another thing that way i really want my bloodhound kill we're not going to get him where'd the lifelines yeah i'm popping the phoenix do you have any heavy no i have a sniper ammo and light ammo we just need to go yeah we do shoot us back up yeah let's just watch we just need to go we just need to go i got i have one kill and i've done like four people that's stuff yeah i know we can't we can't follow up on anything because the moment that we push the other squad shows up yep and then they don't push they just want us to they just want us to do the damage and then just rock up late yep i'm out it's all been loose there's some armor there's some armor i like how the moment we stopped fighting they stopped everyone stops i like they were so close and do you know what i think it was the team on the bridge i'd damn one of them and then they were trying to loot that box once they got the revive and i cracked them and got them one hit one shot again they didn't want to push i should have just i should just left them alone but if i leave them alone there i think we're fine there you go there's a heavy ammo with the rest where we just came from okay cool so that that heavy was just they're gonna get yeah it's up here isn't that been next to that uh that's what i figured was going to happen we can wrap that barrel stabilizer yeah let's try to wrap that because by the time we go down all the way around it's already late it's already too late it's already been late yeah it's fine we can third because there someone tells me that's just gonna stay a perpetual fight they didn't seem too aggressive this is like the biggest wraparound ever right because by the time because that thing is where they res they rest on the hill the storm closed in so they're going to be going towards rift it's honestly crazy to me too oh no i was looking that way yeah no not here but i mean like they're going to be no no sorry yeah yeah i i get you i thought i thought i heard someone here oh okay replicated my bearings yeah let's see they're still fighting there actually they're kind of close they ran this way yup yup exactly so my brain i trusted my brain and i was right beautiful mate i love it epic scrapping okay cool i got a triple take with a two to four so i'm totally gonna snipe these nerds he was in that one more on the roof one more on the roof i don't have an angle on him physics crack back there i'm gonna thirst this crypto kill no i can't another team i think yeah the other team's here okay the other team the other team there's another squad to the north right now right now hey i have no heavy i have one gun last guys oh no they're fighting someone else heck yeah perfect gives it time just to reset i should not be alive right now i should not be alive did you do some stuff mate oh i did some shenanigans to try to lift that one jesus can i have a can i have a white mag please what for what gun you're looking for uh a uh light mag purple blind knock okay i found a blue there we go that'll be good oh there's a balloon here too after all that time oh my my god they were fine down this way right like west yeah they are yeah they were fighting nothing to the south i had my cave oh was it safe i thought yeah it was it was over this hill somewhere yeah yeah there's a weird zip set up yeah they're down here dang it why did i do that guy there too we could just leave him right we can just wrap around the right if we wrap around by shooting right there that might tempt other people who are already in that area to push forward and then get those guys hmm big brain even though you felt like it was a mistake your brain knew what he was doing yep you trust your instincts exactly are you good on bats i have two if you need one i got four okay should be good dropping some sniper ammo don't need that much especially with five squads left we're already plus 36 rp i'm just 69 mate you got my assists in there nice dude i was getting ready with the quick revive but it never happened the evasive maneuvers for real though i think i hear somebody yeah they're set up knockdown you down one i don't have a dj i can't really see anything yeah i can't see anything either one of those down they're getting the res right now i think it's gone we're getting footprints hopefully he's got a scan here i'm getting shot by mate this is not just a third party isn't like a party or something have you got a scan dude scan he had score scan on cold on the whole time right no he had scanned he had scanned he just didn't uh let's i mean this is probably one of the best places that well one this is one of the best places that we could be right now yeah we're in a good spot okay i can't really offer too much i hate i hate this gimme i hate you give me so much dude if you want a really long scope there's one there i got i got a 2-4 i'm good okay i just don't want to get creeper in the back would you quit it trying to double check behind yeah that's what i'm looking at right now we're good yeah i should be there's three of the squads left and these are two of them fighting so maybe we just run up there right we have to go anyway yeah take a position to the right well yeah take a position to the right let's try to stay in cover because they're going to try to shoot at us a little bit but go from rock to rock back here that way we can avoid getting charged right now they're actually just in a massive scrap of them if you want to send on top of that roof or get a crack at least first oh yeah this would be perfect wait for that wait for that to go away yeah and then we'll go up there okay i have a bounce back we gotta go we're about now he's fine let's go let's go big oh my god any scans going there we you're dying now how are they up there i don't have any throwables on the outside of the other squads here oh really so it's not even just like a third party yeah no no no go up top go up high height okay give me hope move slightly to the right slightly to the right out on the open i'll be open right now not with you brakes for 170 raise one cent right here these guys are on me i'm gonna try and go oh there's no escape there's no escape switching on me did she get that she's getting the revival no she's fine let's go brother oh my god no gibbies were getting away today that was not played you kept that get me distracted i threw the mouse back we tried to get back in there he thought he was fine by the apex champions oh man let's go dude i'll play mate bro that that beginning fight was just absolutely scuffed uh oh my god i remember the one you mean now i wondered where all my damage came from now remember today
