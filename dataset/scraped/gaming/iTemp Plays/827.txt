hamster Gossage which welcome back to another video today we are playing small apex legends of course and today we are playing some bloodhound to these fun to play some different characters it's not very often that I play anyone else other than a pathfinder of course recently I said that I wants to play more caustic an ID to be fair I did a few videos as caustic and I definitely bullet in the future as well I feel like what I do is a play like one game I get like a really good win as a legend that I don't play that often I think this is incredible I'm gonna play this legend for the rest of time and then I load my ps4 it the next day I'm just like Pathfinder I'm just crafting around like a spider-man anyway the reason I'm playing blue-toned is because in season 4 bloodhound was one of the only Legends that got any sort of change so blood hounds ultimate now which is called beast for hunt actually gets a 5 second bonus if you dam someone and it is great because it rewards the aggressive player storm that the ultimate is intended for what I will say is though it's not an incredible book because you're still extremely loud but there's nothing more fun than increased movement speed on games like this series my favorite so hopefully you enjoy this if you do be sure to your like rate and I'll see you all in 5 5 seconds my friends train your daddy's my friends fortunately this is not the hot shop because if it was the hot chocolate would be a fairly make I'm sure it seems which of relax the nose hey who is that thought was trying to rush me there for a second I think it offended speaking though don't whine set me on fire hey Vick Tamra don't think they have a good no last shot headshot thank goodness for that I am struggling police say you just picked up some nerve for Jones and I'm not using a for eight times variable sniper scope for a longbow either I'm struggling here someone comes across here all I've got is a long bud I'm not that great with a long book I'm gonna be honest with you my crayons that's fine though I don't think anyone else is actually here it was actually fairly far away from the dropship so hasn't been the busiest of drops here sorry friend I know you got like ammunition gun since you wanted the extended light mag that's yours though you see I found that for you I said it's not trade it's all these I sweat these over I don't know what you call these these little rooms here always have the best look these three I don't know why we're victory and life so far at least hopefully it's gonna stay that way plane boat owned if you haven't noticed that's been a while since I played put home but they did booth blood herrings ultimate at the start of season four I'm pretty sure it was the only change they made to a legend in the season four patch notes they just made his ultimate a little bit better I'm sure would have explained the the change the difference in the introduction so I'm not gonna go over too much I should take that same night I mean one I'm bad with a longbow and the second thing to consider here is that duo as I said every time oh this one for you as well I said every time but sniping is not the best idea in Joe's in my opinion I mean it depends on your playstyle but with my play style it's not gonna work too long I was to change some orange backup because people were fuming of a legendary Online's and iron skin on you is he ascended pretty far away nevermind if it was this guy she listens yes all my friends getting there get involved I want to scan him yes scans easily bring the scene he's running I have no idea how he didn't die from that there's another team day and we're up to three kills names just even if you fancied you know someone's on four kills ask the kill reader alright already a half a lobby is done that like Joe's has been really fun I've enjoyed it a lot but the only issue is I just went off gold the only issue is the lobbyists I sold fastest it's unreal especially if there's like a proper hot job like let's say this one of a mirage flash everyone be dead by now that'd be about three people left and one of them would not be me guaranteed don't yield please oh I've got back that'll do actually that's not too bad that's a scrap in the distance one of my favorite things of all time top three for sure this has to be the best heirloom on the game by the way I don't think it's close there you go it took him a decision pun off I don't think single parties to play there I do you think single fire would have been the play if I had an Verona he's fleeing the scene he's gone I decide to spam so much that I couldn't actually keep my accuracy I he's good thing gonna land good grief keep in mind that he's at this angle teammate he might try and rush we see could actually have a teammate rush nice now it's long snow one goes a bit busy why we should be okay just because they're so split up I don't need that and I think you had a peacekeeper that's a scrap in the distance that maybe the caustic name I mean I have for sure battery such a body drop one a doubt rife has any of them as soon as they're pretty hard to find they're still scrapping that's good news just if you find one if you happen to come across one that's off this is where I wish I was playing Pathfinder though it's gone over quite well though I don't know whether to pop my ultimate or not problemis are there lutein it's go time friends his teammates running away for some reason that's nectar five seconds sorry your kneecap is highlighted I don't think I did see anyone that wasn't in the bullet endorsement there because we've got to damage their head that's an extra ten seconds on the ultimate so if anyone comes along and they're showing us in the back we can flee the scene or that tell me thank you very much sir our press decks I want to try and use the ultimate whenever I can if I remember too the only issue is because I play so much Pathfinder my immediate thought doesn't go to using ultimate in good fights I need to try and train my brain whenever I play other characters it just took me a little while to get used to my f6 medkits John's release well thanks friend you've got all the line munition on the game thanks there we go she'll be good name alright storms coming in it's only the first ring note uh that isn't safe so we're gonna take a little bit of damage but it's worth it you know correct I have to rotate back to train yard here well maybe we could just go home sir train yards put you dead and then we'd have to go through the train tunnel which is a horrendous choke points and then we'd have to go through the toll to get to oh my word that was beautiful timing another reason to play boat on there and yeah and then we'd have to we'd have to go through to two trout points to get two scraps or cc and it's not worth it I'd rather avoid them if I could who is he this man's flying these fans fleeing the scene I'm not sure if he saw us it was only one guy though lovelies teammate doesn't land behind us where's he going there Easy's running you know you're going scraps off the good news is if I can get a little bit closer I can utilize blue towns passive here we go we're tracking him this one's getting tracked did you go scrap itself looks like it alright twelve seconds we're going to try and be more efficient than him in our pattern here to close the distance good some corners ten seconds eight seconds every is what are called passive daddies you've just been hunted my friend me amigo what are you doing no no okay you're supposed to run away in that situation when you'll shield this in Seattle and you'll being shot in the back turning around on phone is not the plate maybe he thought he was in that stasis and he was gonna teleport back I wish I had that self-confidence to turn around a fire in that situation don't know okay this is why I don't have the self-confidence to to turn and find a situation some a gosh darn fool who does gosh darn foolish things Sondra fighting me as well oh my god hey Sal top like a decorative gargoyle now to stand here so I can actually ping it the fact that you can't ping was healing is horrendous for some reason I don't know why you can't do that teammates a little bit far away people are healing right here might be no idea to get some high ground here play low be slow in to my teammates right right near me I don't really have an escape like that mine it is I wanna pop my ultimate now divided five seconds then oh one of the smell stomach killed wasn't even my teammate he's an enemy I just got spooked out by my own croak sorry about that see me our firma toes in us nope sorry teammate firing down on people like that at that angle is the most difficult thing of all time I don't know why so difficult but I could never actually land a shot are you good teammate I'm here simplify hemlock it's absolutely shredding me okay that's a hedgehog apparently that was my precision accuracy wait okay they've got us all not then unless it was the guy that was closer but my teammates going over there no he's not I replace these guys trying to crawl to safety look at him there we go my suspicions were correct yep yeah Hatchin you just got hatching did I think I nice ring to it at all okay well that's good news because one of them stole my kill and I am still what a few in a berry are this guy only had every ammunition and that my friends is the beautiful sound of a scrap in the distance I don't know I don't know how I've landed two shots there I should have kept the two times sight oh my gosh games mode keep hugging me something need to make sure my teammates got a decent supply as well are we got two choices teammate we've this sit on here and try and kill them and they have to rotate this dorm which is a bit risky to be on to you the more I think about it but worsen idea it sails the reason he's had like a terrible idea because they can just get up top and they can fire down a nurse with the high ground on it and they're going up top this is a terrible spot teammate let's back up they're both going up there this is a really bad spot being delivered I'll just reach to my own 99 as a draughtsman I was gonna sweet-talk my are not snowing but I thought they were just gonna face it odd thought it was a waste I'm struggling Oh 50 spare I need to be careful I need to fire only if I'm gonna get a kill I guess this is T my effects he's not finishing the kill and it's only one person and Stephanie's teammate has to reload quick there we go we're enough to do the team gun that's the question we need to be asking ourselves that's a must if I don't want it though do that all three of us were here all three teams were here and all of a sudden wait did you take the lie on mission yes I've got loads anyway it's fine oh look who's back after fleeing the scene I've been are you going up there teammate that's a bad challenge I give you five pounds of you hear me five pounds paper evasive maneuvers it's absolutely shortcuts doggone it they might do an absolute lunatic but if you're going in so am I [Music] where are these guys going where are you going with the last team there's nowhere to go now twelve damaged what you're getting a finish your movement oh my gosh on blue and that was the champion - where were they going I'm so confused I feel like they're to fight a free victory there it would have been it would have been a free win if if they stayed involved Germany's like three teams left and we were trapped between the team that was up top and that team that just they were firing us from behind I mean I'm confused by that one but 12 kills 2,400 damage I'll tell you what even though I feel like that game would have went exactly the same before he's birth I don't think I've really benefited from the extension of time that you get from knocking someone down however whilst will say maybe that is better in the regular game mode where there's three people per team and you get more of a chance to get those kills and if you get ferb partied your ultimate still up so you can run away quicker I don't know I'd say what though it's fun playing different champions and I hope you enjoyed the variety - thank you for watching and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
