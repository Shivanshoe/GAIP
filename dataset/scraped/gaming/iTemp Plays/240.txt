a huge thank you to ea for inviting me to this early capture event of apex legend season 11. hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have some g7 scout gameplay for you but not just a regular g7 scope game well the second game plays just regular but the first game is early season 11 footage where the g7 is actually a care package weapon that has double tap activated on it once again if you guys weren't playing when the double tap g7 was around it absolutely ran the meta it was completely broken it was my favorite gun before that meta and it was still my favorite gun after that meta have passed so on one hand i'm really sad that i won't be able to use it as much as i usually do but on the other hand i'm really excited to make use of the double tap g7 scout once again thank you guys for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends this place barely has any loot oh he's got four beans that's not too bad do the beans have anything he's the question do you know what i'm gonna stick with the mosem we're inside the next one superior positioning oh my word cut down an enemy three hour bank smoke recharging that's just the way it works all right so i got one and my team i've got one hello friend enemy killed reloading enemy that's supposed to be a slide around the corner i messed that up this guy's got two car smg's i've got a very close range set up at the moment car massive but i've got a purple shotgun ball and sometimes having a shotgun it's just i don't know it means you come over to so much easier the only new weapon in the care package and there it is g7 scouts goodbye mastiff shotgun bolt here makes me sad to leave it behind extended light magazine i'm happy to have this level three mozambique the enemy stands before us he was altered why could i not hear the bloodhound ultimate that makes no sense i could hear that one i mean i think you're a little bit late unless there's another team here that i don't know about this guy's got me nervous bangalore ultimate as well i mean those guys we didn't have to thirst or anything they were they were down notes there was screw magrude shield battery here i'm so happy you can change the uh backpack here the sights so much better than two times compared to a two to four weirdly enough see opening fire pick it again enemy here pretty sure he ran off reloading recharging less than he gets for peaking has he not heard about high temperature on the g7 scope i mean it's world famous at this point i mean he's lucky i didn't have a one times hollow on it to be honest with you he probably would have died ah he's pretty wrapped around got another squad up here zone's going to push us back this way anyway i think we're just going to steal the top follow me danger oh they're close close they went up top we should have no we should have bunkered up top uh sorry inside two teams here this is reloading this is messy another squad is on us superior this fight isn't over i'm really feeling these 130 ping shields are depleted i should go back to the eu servers it crossed kind of far i can't leave without the blue hands banner though what am i listening to i've secured the banner they get a second chance uh please climb replicator incoming left focus plan move 30 seconds what's going on either got the respawned or the respawn e i got time to find out oh my stupid trigger button's broken okay i was trying to halt nice we're good she got my scout as well oh there you go she could have dropped me a health journey she come on yeah she could have i can still see the drop ship we've already killed the team and it's still going oh yeah i've actually never noticed that before are they over there whoa hello i i'm missing everything i'm trying to put some pressure down on it arm switch i just did what he did okay they've all got purple yeah literally every single one of them that's yours did you see that do you see that mirage yeah what a lunatic dude he wall jumped over the fire and then like oh like that honestly that was sick i respect it what was um what did he like because i can tell which one was going oh is it going on me hello amigo yeah that's good it's because it glitched out when he like landed yeah oh i'm being flammable too yeah oh my god i've got eight bullets i got hey i've only got a g7 basically i'm missing a lot oh me too it's terrible i just know scoped a g7 in someone's face like eight times and missed every shot oh no teammate oh now i'm a mess i'm a mess right now i can't hit anything this is so bad like my brain is not working my ring's closing i'm trying to think of an excuse but i think i'm just no come on come on what no no that was a good one yeah yeah yeah freezing did you see my tweet i knew i knew i was right um oh yeah yeah yeah i saw your tweet yesterday i was i had to i had to stop myself from commenting on it no but that's that was a factual statement ah i was reaching i don't know why it's kind of reaching no when you're playing a linear steady player your opinion already doesn't matter well not steady play though yeah but at heart you kind of are yeah oh no uh uh purple extended light mag or stock stocks are actually so important stocks are so good get the reload speed on there too now people underestimate stocks that can be my next ah wait i've got a good one what i'm doing right now i got a good one people people are buying people are buying bitcoin but missing all their shots they're worried about the wrong kind of stock am i right is this a title to a youtube video no no it's just it's like a really funny tweet or something yeah that may be that might work as a tweak i know crypto isn't a stock whatever i don't care okay yeah that's not gonna go very well okay i'll i'll i'll refine the joke and you'll see within the next few weeks it'd be part of my standard routine they're scrapping on notebook your tweets are way too edgy for me uh yeah understandable i'm an edge i'm a legit kind of guy very edgy oh they're big scrapping over here by the way yeah you've never seen anything like it on my way how did you guys take that long to loot i've never seen you loot that long grenade because you decided to put an ult at the highest point and i jumped off so i had to go all the way back up jumped off that's when there was nothing in there and then i had to figure out i had to figure out what i needed more a stock or a light bag and i came to the conclusion that i had a blue stalk already but i had another bag it's like easy decision right yeah are you dead i don't know what these guys are doing nah but they do have good high ground on us though yeah they're all up there yeah i broke horizon i hate the rampage importance she's really well you can hear a load too horizon's back in the air again once again cracked there but she's popping him back pack that guy don't worry i'll take all the damage for us i've been tanking oh no i'm on the main tank please i have no bass i'm scared to push up way better [Music] horizon this entire game oh nice hey i got two batorinos that's huge but it has nothing to do with your skin i shouldn't even be saying i'm better i'm so bad right now i'm actually the worst terrible that was my name just then you know they're squadron he's actually though i said no no but i think that line i don't think so ladies and gentlemen i need that extended life here number four oh my god decoy wait where'd my two time go oh i started punching her she was spinning up a divo this is a huge value phoenix kit right here the biggest i think i was one hp right now too my last fight yeah you were i'm stuck in here i cancelled my phoenix oh i'm stuck [Music] i i think i've had one bat this whole game yeah i've i've got three now go on uh stop the bat thank you i got my lt2 and there's a load of loot in there let's go drop it in here if needed but he's the same team they must be i think so that's all healing is the worse [Music] to be fair it's working it's a genie strategy you know i'm just i'm actually kind of jealous he ran that way there uh they they just religious zip over here okay do we switch off focus no this is a full team is a full team this is a different path these people are i just put so much bullets he's got so many thermos this pathfinder i killed the wraith or at least i've done one all right i'm not using this 30 30. i'm dropping it okay nice controller ttv guy okay that's specific come here oh my god guy i hate you guy we have 45 seconds and the next ring is right there don't leave anything get back here he's so he's never never gonna stop how many i swear i just saw him he's like four grapples right there i think he filed a few of them dude i am so bad how do i have 2400 damage this is one of the worst games i've ever played in my life and i have like 600 heavy rounds for my gun that i'm hungry everyone's got a rampage by the way i broke two of them back there but they have a gen i heard that come as i was throwing the ark i should have said that first hey don't worry about it yeah that is all good that's one of the goods i'll constantly i'll do it that's i mean that's on you so probably look for some um medicates but i really can't be bothered my inventory is so bad like even my brain like nothing is working today i don't know what's going on like brain isn't working thumbs are not working but we still have 3 000 damage somehow you are in shambles but you're not in shambles i thought games like you're having at the moment when i watch them back they're not as bad as i thought at the time it's pretty bad i heard a row i heard it right yeah on the other side what's happening what are these guys doing they're feeding those kills [Music] i'm pretty sure he fell off me the last guy the last guy fell was that off first fight of the game uh they had an alternator i i don't like the valk had no armor and she was trying to use her ability not sure why her abilities real bad yeah i don't know what that was i'm debating if i should even post that it's hard to watch ah we desperate out here oh yeah yeah we desperate desperate yeah posting everything
