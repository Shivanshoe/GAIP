hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some wild edge and i am loving the three map rotation on apex at the moment i think it brings so much variety especially towards the end of the season when we need that the most and i would say out of the three that world's edge is my favorite map and it's because of scrapital city and i don't care what anyone says scraptor city is far superior to school team take off the nostalgia glasses that place had zero loot and was placed in the corner of the map so the fights dried out fairly quickly and out of world's edge four story is my favorite building because of the action here you will see in this gameplay i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm landing for story okay i'm landing download for story i literally have nothing okay [Applause] yes say that that was fun they all fell down well having a good gun would be cool let me tell you this is good these sounds [Music] do you have any heavy body chance um i have 113 i'm about to drop it hey what's up i'm going to grapple up

where's their loot where's that bloodhound sleep i'm so stressed out right now dude i need some better stuff i have nothing heavy hemlock i need shield shield tail here oh my god i have stuff i have stuff damn recharging that team's still in there right like that actually i haven't heard anything yet they have been this is why i'm so triggered right now they have been shooting me for the past 10 minutes i love celebrating with my business mouth i'm coming okay it's just one guy if he third pirates i think we might be dead okay he's dead nice all right in his face where'd i drop my flatline i just don't remember this is just the biggest scrap i've ever been a part of oh yeah oh man i can't i cannot believe we're alive do you have any big hails um i have two bats one medicate do you mind if i have one bat please yeah you know what they call me so uh i do know what they call you you don't have to remind me at least that guy didn't push us i was i think that was the soul he was the sole reason behind my anger that's uh same oh she's weak oh that's ours isn't it thank you thanks come on come on that was the last one i might turn around for some weight should be good i need an extended light so bad there we go that's fine i left my purple over there but whatever it's fine yeah yeah but like they could have you know timmy could have learned it if he just sat there for longer than five minutes and actually practiced rather than going in my chat and saying i suck because he doesn't practice that's that's my tactic i don't practice at all john long took me to learn how to wardrobe i just didn't even look it up i didn't look it up yeah but you but see you're in a position where you don't have to thank you yeah because it's not like you're you're playing for any end game you're playing for content you mean you got your content you're off the scene you're doing well why not and also it's probably been a detriment to my game since i learned because i will see a wall and i will jump off it and it is not healthy at the time it just doesn't work right half the time the two attends i'm going to craft the bats is what i'm going to do i'm going to use the rep the replicators that i made fun of that um you have fun can we make one i need it that's all i mean they do call you the they come in replica of reach that's what they call me yeah yeah i'm i am in it should be scrapping you i'm still furious at that course you've been lifeline race twice oh big red's behind there too by the rocket i'm still over there about my lucky mate i'll write sorry i know you're talking to me but i was kind of focused yeah it's okay i never write on you i'm just fine you are i saw a bloodhound somewhere i don't know where he went though oh my god this is taking too long that's why this game gives me ptsd why i'm just like i'm still not over what um the the scraps i'll see fight yeah i was kind of uh i was kind of stressed out i feel like if anything call of duty gives me way more anxiety do you reckon yeah just because there's like no there's no outplay so like if somebody shoots me in the back i can turn around and destroy them an apex but if somebody shoots me in the back in warzone i mean you're grind the line detector so i wonder if that's actually linux could be him he likes to build pcs and he was crafting so makes sense ah so i only saw that perhaps it's cracked once again i'm beach on the back that's another squad under the squad in the squad oh you can just see me oh just sleep mate on what am i doing what are you doing playing real bad mate big planes big brain stuff i'm stalker i did not get it off only the baldist oh you're insane oh dude how do you peek here oh my god i bumped into him tango near me tried rises tried dresses come on now worth it that's your kill i'm a jason punch him in the face nice let him raise and then punch him i don't think he might have done i might have his own zone oh no please nice oh my god the entire game was so stressful dude i was just i was just frustrated i'm sorry i made the late game i was just shouting i had about three times because i just i was trying to heal in the open and i don't know what i was doing yeah i was throwing a lot i was angry there was just a lot of stuff going on that game not happy i'm not happy with my performance are you happy with the outcome yeah but i'm just
