hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some solo queue in public games and i was having a barnstormer i was 1v2 in teams i was beaming i was landing sentinel headshots and right at the end of the game we just messed up i'd like to say at the start here in the introduction that my teammate that was playing with randomly here was completely new to this game he was level five but when you watch it back you can't really tell the guy is making some great plays despite being a new player to apex and i didn't realize he was such a low level at the time of playing so shout out to him for keeping up and also always being there in the fight that we're going to as well it was still such a good game and i'm sure you will enjoy it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends closed door over there i've got a team lantern up top so got to keep that in mind might just face plants at the wall bless him oh there's a team on us as well i'm sorry i've only got a central here i've got a sensor and a bow here we inside the go ring i love this is ridiculous how fast does this man get his arm shell back like you think he's weak you think you're going to kill him and then no he zooms in again and he gets a free white shield with 15 reduced damage that's an absolute unit oh there's that team i forgot about them i have two smgs picked up our friends banner we can bring them back they have high ground i think i'll just run i mean if i can draw them in i can definitely kill them this guy's got a p20 please chase i think they want to lose okay i haven't got a bowel stabilizer i've got nothing on this on this weapon that's not good there we go i can just respawn my teammate here as well man i'm gonna leave one of the boxes for him i'll get your teammate there's people fighting at the uh whatever that place is called what's it called containment i can just hoover up one of the boxes i mean i need i don't actually know why i'm thinking that someone's here as well i might say he's sent now i'm going to start quick scoping what did i think the heavy ammo a lot easier he rebel theater you've got no shield mate oh i don't think so giving my shields a recharger yeah i don't know what any of these teams are doing i have no idea what's going on that's why he tried to stick the reds i'm gonna save the hemlock i've gotta uh teammate there's a scrap that way oh i wanted my trailer back i don't actually know if we can go back this way now might be something good this way let's just leave it there people fighting this way so you might be able to just kill them ted they'll lose when there's a care package landed here too yeah i'll get it nice he's pretty confused how i've got red armor because everyone i've come across so far has been charging a big noob i'm gonna go for this though people can claim it so someone might come for this as well looks free give me a gun please there you go teammate level two got bags isn't bad give me a problem here or i'll take a flat line i can't i can't run him like r3 makes no sense these guys pushed up i'm going back my prowess i actually don't care here i go i don't mind forget it these guys are fighting i mean i've got six kills here there's still a good amount of people i for some reason i can't stop thinking about me asking for heavy hammer whilst my teammates getting respawned donny i should have stayed on the rope get him teammate mess them up i mean we're gonna see ultimate but who cares they're all running anyway they're all fleeing the scene look at him rampage that's big rampage jackson let's go this way i'll try and cover you though giving my shields a recharge oh they'll drop this is great this way we'll just get high ground we just shoot down on them for free these little legs okay the man's got maximum three health the benefit of being on this side as well is that we know a team at us from containment so they could just come down and try and third party as well and this way we won't get shot in the back you know guy down this guy is trying to first someone i want kill credit where'd he crawl off to there you are yes i got killed credit for that i'm scamming the system i'm going to drop a 20 bomb and it's going to be because of that first i reckon he's gone on top you follow him i mean that's the building you want to sit on right here we go flatline i mean it's not a proud there we go finally this is what king's canyon is honestly if you if you are the one to find someone and start shooting with like a two squad fight then i just feel like you're screwed what you've got to do is you've got to wait until you use one else fight this is just how king's canyon works it's how all the maps work to be honest with you but especially kings canyon look at these guys okay they did know i was gonna say they're clueless but they hurt i mean it's the most awkwardly place shield of all time i'm supposed to use this shield is that both of them nice teammate because you've got a 4k i got a life i mean he's got me there i've actually been in 10 seconds let's go this way this man's name is just i embarrassing at least the rumors are true you know i do have a 4k badge on pathfinder you know how how did he know is what i want to know yeah our third party strategy next third party this so this is how this game is played this is the safe way to play look clueless we've actually got pretty far to go there's no way he's going to revive his teammate i said we don't get greedy here because they were finding someone up up the hill as well that's how we died that's how we lose this game that's not a heat shield i'm looking good though nine kills 2600 damage saw farming a little bit i could have got those two kills but i was really trying to use the rampage shield to my advantage there and it was really awkwardly placed so many so much inventory space give me all this stuff there we go it's the tweed machine back at it again myself i'm not sure if it's because they're close and he doesn't want them to hear him hello how did you get here yeah i need to shield that i can't challenge that it's pointless this guy doesn't have red so if we're both he's trying to revive oh wait he just have registered in mind self-raising he had a gold bag as well so we're good beautiful teammate i didn't get killcrate for that guy down before they must have just ran from the zone yeah they definitely didn't come this way because we'd have a third party those guys in the back you'd have thought there's people over here there's three squads left i'm not gonna rush these guys i was gonna try and keep an eye on them we're in a good decent spot here there's nothing the craft is there i've got a lot of i mean there's a purple helmet i may as well right i've got scientific crafting material put that in the oven you don't know that could actually save my life oh there we go that's the other team playing over there you know where both teams are now got my purple helmet thank you very much all right we need to stay in third party distance if these guys are kicking off we need to be able to get there pretty quickly so i'm going to move up and they are kicking off we just need to get over there third parties win games okay that's a lower ultimate i don't think that's cereal to it yeah i was going to say that's the ultimate is not an indication of where these people are they are nowhere near it sorry friend that sucks shouldn't a challenge at this angle though do you not know that we were here i don't understand friends should have went to the other side of the mountain to put the other team in the middle do you know what i mean like don't don't run up this side of the hill you're gonna get shot in the back all right the plan of action now is to make the duo up top these guys are in the best position i mean they've got blue armor though we need we need to put the solo we need to try and help the silhouette a little bit so i'm going to try and rotate around the right side here if i can these guys are our biggest competition we need to poke away at them all right blue and purple i need to crack one of them i'm honestly i'm not opposed to taking a risk here and rushing them solo or party use is an opportunity but i mean with the bangalore ultimate coming in he's just some room to move up that they both drop or just one there's not much we can do about this we need to be careful here because now we're the ones that will get walked upon why did i try okay so at the time i was actually pretty fuming at this situation but even with my teammate dropping down why did i try and salvage the situation like that it's the sunker cost fallacy i thought maybe i could kill them and respawn my teammate with the mobile respawn i had but it's a tight building against two people with an armor swap on my teammate i should never have taken that fight at the time i didn't realize that my teammate was actually level five blessing when you watch his back realizing he's completely new to the game you actually realize as well that he did a great job of keeping up and dropped a good amount of damage considering when i was level five i was terrible at apex and i was playing against other people that were also new to the game because i played when the game first came there so shout out to my teammate here he's level five and he put on a good performance considering the circumstances it's always good to learn from a death so let's all learn a lesson from this sometimes the situation is unsalvageable my teammates dead i can't help they're gonna get pushed out from this piece of cover anyway i should have backed up and tried to work with the other solo in the lobby to kill this team i could have easily won this game with four and a half thousand damage or more if i'd done that so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
