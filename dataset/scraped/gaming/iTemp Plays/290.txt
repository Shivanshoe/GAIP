another full team coming up oh yeah i tried cracked on the car cracked on the car they're all one they're all one look at the rope bridge right weak my god well played bro what in the hell was that hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are getting our octane games in before respawn takes them down a notch both of my favorite reasons to play octane are getting nerfed that being his horizontal pad distance which is being reduced by about 15 percent and his passive health regeneration which is going from 1.5 to 1 health per second now these are the best reasons to play octane and he definitely he was definitely punished for it because of how much health he takes her stim use i do think he's a little bit powerful and he was contributing to a lot of third parties on apex but so he's been able to hear gunfights from two points of interest away and that's never been changed i have three games here for you today i hope you enjoy them thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i mean i think i'm decent in like those lower level lobbies but i feel like once we get to pred i'm not gonna know what to do yeah it's a different kind of game though isn't it are you landing up top uh i'm not i never lined up tonight no i'm landing on bottom like below of uh left building okay signing off top never works no he doesn't my rng isn't good enough i'm getting punched out i'm ready it's uh horizons one she's rising this is damn one and then yeah she's gonna they're both going to be like 20 hp 30 hp horizon and a lobo 17 hold on they just lose good job she was 17. i did 80 damage in total so that's some pretty good calls okay well if you just hit all your shots then that wouldn't be an issue but geez i was behaving extended energy back here level two uh i have think see i do need that i'm a good teammate thank you are you yeah run over drop you a feeny got two kills lady that means you know debatable i'm gonna leave you to show about me i've won i have two guys on me it's got purple oh there's two over here like where they respawned on my way practice one of them pretty much he cracked me the nine from there so i'm scared of the octane so we should be all right wait i just killed oh that was ratchet oh was it was it the octane mate because he he cracked me from miles away with an r9 that's why i skipped the that's why i said the octane is scaring me i think i think i three attacked him with the wind man i'm surprised like i was shooting when he was down because i didn't even realize you you downed him at that angle it was weird this one isn't aesthetically pleasing it's just cool just just awesome but like race is just so clean and just satisfying i know somewhat i agree i'm probably second or third you know that's the classic originals out there they're far nice climb god start what's happening mate why did they put the lips on the edge i would have made it if there wasn't a lip on the edge maybe you're not meant to climb it from that angle no i have a point uh that just chin at the bottom of the rope i don't know what's going on i am opening this car package i really want to protect your perfect armament yeah huge get rolled what we'll do is we'll bam over here and then we'll have uh we'll have an armistice you know again oh we jumped on that how do i get shot there when you look like he's literally fighting him i don't understand there's no way i get this off i think rosie hopped off onto that has been thing no i was a teammate i think oh no um maybe not i don't know this guy's only rezzing no that's what i wanted to do this is gonna rose again oh now he's challenging i should have yeah the third was on this thing here i saw them going up the ropes i was going to chase and then i didn't see him and they must have hopped over my head if that guy let you just shot me worried about me like if the mirage was just focused on shooting at me i'd died he's trying to crank those roses he's got the tracker on yeah number one where's any i'm gonna leave your purple on the way mate and now i'm gonna pad the pad right on it uh don't dive right please oh my god i have the i have the theme where i don't have my crosshairs oh really your hood's gone yeah it always happens when i when i when like if i die and then you res me i just got shot from behind over here any bats or anything oh my gosh shots mate oh my god the strongest blue shield i've ever seen i know i might i shot that a few times too yeah i shot it
