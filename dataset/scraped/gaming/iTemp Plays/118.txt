hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video we are playing some more apex legends here of course i've messed up the intro i don't care i'm sticking with it today i dropped 5 000 damage well it was 4960 but i'm counting that as a 5k game okay and if you don't like it what are you gonna do about it huh nothing nothing and we are playing valkyrie and when valkyrie was released i remember reading her keys and thinking all right she's just an ultimate boss you're gonna wanna carry ultimate accelerant in rank she's gonna be useful in competitive but not as much in public games i just missed her passive and her ability as small additions to her kit but it turns out valkyrie's q or valkyrie's regular ability is one of the best abilities in the game especially on olympus just because there are so many rocks that aren't big and you can easily get the missiles to hit everyone behind them now i've uploaded valkyrie games before where i literally haven't used my ability once but that is not the case in today's video i finally figured out how to play this legend and we went on a bit of a tear so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh wow i'm gonna stand at this one we can scan this area so this guy damn it is see it um i don't know i wasn't even looking i wasn't paying attention wings up i don't think so let's see some golf step down though got a gold brawler look at my uh oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what you got here nice alarm i mean i saw that up and i and i claimed it but it's okay you definitely didn't you mentioned that it was there and you i saw nothing other than mentioning it no that was me claiming it does where i'm from tries to give me purple armor bless him i must protect this man right i guess i'm doing brawler mastiff i don't know i'm not really too happy with this but i don't think i have a choice what are the stuff getting in their face i need a line mag crafter ah missile off the rails okay well this is just a dumb decision what am i stuck on oh it's a rock here i'll do it wings out hello i guess he thought i will revive my teammate and then they can use it to get up there maybe i don't know well to be fair if you saw my shots on him i would have had that level of confidence as well i would have res right in front of his face [Music] so you said this is a bad idea i think it was a good idea you know it turned out well coming here or maybe you meant driving i thought you did i thought you're mocking me what are you even saying right now okay well this is just a dumb decision all right wings out oh yeah i forgot on two of them big stars wait which one was it i will say i will i will say say it i will say it i'm going to say it i don't care that you broke your word i think it's in reference to that meaning what are you even saying right now what is it what have you never heard that you've never heard i don't care that you broke your album i haven't i haven't i can't even speak right now the conversation's over i'm so confused there's a there's a fight there's a trident dalian bandit here i ran all the way around i don't know why oh they're coming towards us not bad i mean i am useless and 99 of these fights i need to just barrel stuff i can't run up that either that's not going to work the good news is your mirage right so you can cut the distance a little bit just pop your own start running in circles or something like crazy that's one of the worst falcons you'll ever see i don't want to talk about it that's interesting oh they're getting they're getting birdied um i'm trying to reload give me a run yeah this is the team went this way so i don't know although the guy's an absolute dean with the triple take i stunned him there is that one all those one's on the lefty somewhere oh she went now with them okay i'll show that chill one jumped off the back all right one's what's up topsail okay oh yeah i'm climbing up on him hit these other ones a little bit too with a decoy there's somewhere out of nowhere but they are shooting us did we even kill the first team oh i rings just a little further 45 on the clock you're on this fight oh that level is gone i'm not even going to chase her who's this one this is the path right with my flash got octane and she dipped okay she's gonna rise out of states maybe i've got alter if you want this one to hold there might be fun uh five valkyrie on station we are go for burn recharging shields please look at the sensitivity oh the states ball robert lund reiner facing kicker wings i said for that you're going you're going three rounds of the undertaker and then i locked him in there with you by the undertaker yes in this situation compared to him white shield no gun anyone's gonna take it i was actually my uh my favorite wrestler when i was younger oh i mean i wasn't that big interesting but when it went dark and like the little bell went off wrestling back in the day was crazy yeah it was pain it's so different from how it is now steam brain stereo oh that was so good the wrestling games were great as well the ones on the playstation 2. i used to like the uh oh what was it called it was it was like wrestling or like a like they were like in the ring but what was it called def jam was it def jam vendetta def jam vendetta that was one of my favorite games of all time it's so good my uh my friend's older brother had it yeah this is a bad spot for the boy oh yeah oh the building whoever they are yeah how many bats you have i have one i have six thank you i'll leave one for teammates uh we can go inside and wings out i've got r in my lap and it's restricting my range of motion one minute the ring is a is [Music] okay i missed him it's fast all right okay she's leaning on my hands it's really weird to explain the plutons come back round yeah i'm watching this other thing make sure they're not pushing okay box three launching missiles enemy shield crashes what happened they all just fall off the map hold on don't die please [Laughter] come on there you go they are screaming i collated them out of the box oh did you actually they fell into just an abyss of death the abyss of death you know that's a great game attack piece of death yeah oh oh don't worry about me i need 70 damage for a 4k come on shields can i res them i don't know i don't think so it might be tough give me a sec oh they're trying to first mate we're going to get caught in between these teams lifeline here okay yeah yeah i've cracked my lifeline you should be okay i think i don't know if i'm gonna be able to get back up from here though i have alcohol but it seems to be and we can find the winning climate get down running out of bullets down there is that the same this is a new team three 45 seconds we got another squad here ladies and gentlemen i'm just gonna shoot my last one yeah where are they okay uh down here oh god do we do try and stay inside and try and help teammates i have no bullets i need to i need to lose i think nice nice i told you randy's nice and cheap i don't know we all had a gold bag at the end oh my god that team dude that was so funny like i knew they oh just fall into the other map that's great that was hilarious ah nice you're popping off oh 40 damage on my close range guns on us uh olympus is not only ranked
