here we sigasi to each welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and before the gameplay starts I want to show you a few tweets of mine please follow me on twitter comm by the way there's a link in the description so the fees of August I tweeted that the gold bag and a gold armor should have their passives switched and men in season three eight bucks legends gave the gold armor the passive of the old gold back which was fast heals bit of a coincidence however fast forward a few months I tweeted again that a double tapped g7 is not a sniper this was in the arms race no to time mode where I was trying to use actual snipers but we gained shredded in half a second by a duo of DoubleTap g7 escapes and respawn Entertainment's have read this tweet too because what change did they make they moved the g7 into the assault rifle category you can no longer use sniper optics on the g7 Scouts and the question is what does this mean you know my a game designer probably not am i psychic no genius perhaps I'm not sure anyway the game planner I've got for you today is with the g7 assault rifle and it's the most damage I've done you can season for so far and I hope you enjoy thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right Mirage avoid I should ease my friends one of my favorite drops actually I'm glad they kept this ship in I hope I might have taken it oh my god there's a lot of people this is why it's a fun job though hey Noel stars on the trip I mean I have a have a be sold at the side of the game because you don't even have any mac for you I got you I got you friend house I've ever avoided no the L star cause he jumped up Tommy he might be weak I think he might have been the one that I'll revive I've been truly bamboozled here this'll do this no he might give me a second I'm gonna get pot College I was gonna get bucked where's the where is the lifeline nice where I'll she'd that whole time I don't even know where my teammate went down I was so preoccupied and trying to take that teammate it works out for the best though don't feud I don't know I don't think it's use the little health drone named a poor teammates time down I have no health as well I have to try and live some people before other people come along because of my team I can just revive oh so next fight and the level three extended heavy mouth this is looking like a prowler game if we can get our hands on one cannot believe well was she the whole time I think she might have landed down low or something tim is responding I can't drop beats did you even have a prowler no I haven't been checking that's not good give me a sec you boy has to heal up I think if thank Christ teammates none the wiser I should have gone not down she may have actually been by yourself I've really good gosh darn sight on this thing that may have been the teammate if you give it a second Hey look they may just go and try and get the banner there you go thanks Brian you have a site for me now no no you do not good come on that's nine though I love the I'll start but I like it at the start of the game it's one of those good I think that L star in the hover are both incredibly good at the start of the game because you don't need extending max for them so you can just keep spraying people that my friends is a pro oh that is what we have been looking for nice extremely sad there you go friends the world's greatest priority ments I hope you appreciate him Alessi appreciates at least they're in appreciated hands even though revenant doesn't sound appreciative at all I'm into pink blue sent him at Rosalie I mean the optic as well of course that's already looted I think the Lifeline is actually getting involved in the loop volts because I think he'd get guaranteed luke funky from Mirage boy harsh this on I'm getting I'm getting involved I don't mind seen him looting his fault I had seven kills and rise fire I don't think we're to survive to that be heroics on the ship as it will be no known as I wish I had that problem oh there we go I'm keeping on the g7 someone's gonna home in the comments but you get five extra bullets my level one accent mark on a dream seven and I think you get to a 99 it is not in the same ballpark there isn't that isn't even comparable to each other one is clearly the better choice what have we got a spike teammate golf helmet perfect for a pathfinder and keep reduce it down to like a level sorry like an 11-second called aim it's got soluti name nice anything I did not have and I may be a little bit useless until I get one especially a train yard if you up top firing down on people and have nice a lot of people flying here yeah so at this close it was just in the distance Oh what the heck's that fine I'll leave these boxes if you want me to he's gonna have a two x bruiser here no he's not it's not gonna one time sage my friends no no it's not I don't have to use shield battery foxy wanna shoot at someone's clothes my friend do you have a site for me in every non-indian I guess this is that teammate are they for you mean definitely fuming nice 14 down and even ought to draw for this I mean I've got three things kits I could potentially drop him really holding out for gold shields that if I get got chilled please Phoenix this will be incredible but the only problem is I hate Phoenix kits when I don't have God shields I really do I feel like they're pointless Laser storm I would pretty much safe anyway tickled him and even was that the last person I wanted it to be caustic charging there's another squad behind this water how's the first guy here as well our harvester did I get one kill from all of that I could have easily had like three or four kills there I mean maybe it's be greedy but I've had a 20 kill game in a while I did damage in my life I mean share the look you know I've got double digits already there are still 15 people left that is actually kind of a lot hope my teammates don't over loot here cuz the storm I mean it's not too far away oh no the team another team in the distance oh my god this guy's toying with me it's like a whack-a-mole they take that much though he's more friends to the game okay I think we need to go this way this way one has already gone this way my teammates are pushing up little bit we might be able to pinch them blue comes this way I mean it doesn't actually it doesn't matter that much I'm not gonna waste my grapple to engage I leave it as an escape route look it's pretty loud it's maybe angry now straight over the top good did your threats worthwhile fine I won't take the I guess I guess that was the only one that wasn't my kill someone else Ted the gold bow stabilizer we're all choking to death here it's not good we could get fur partied ready the Crypt I'll go is the scene on the hill still all right look they're successful rush they're only three spots left we have successfully run through this Lobby I didn't find my gold shield so I'm not gonna carry around three Phoenix kits that I don't even want to use a care package this is gonna have a devotion or maybe gold shields if it's gold shows I'm going to turn around and I'm going to get it's gonna turn around not gonna get those Phoenix boots back but not worthy some people may argue I should give this gold bank to the Lifeline it's each waiving the god back though because you don't actually benefit from it yourself unless you have a god knockdown shot that's too far it's like it's only beneficial really for your teammates assume that you've already had a purple back beforehand I'm only going through the Jim town I'm only doing a bit of recon a bit of reconnaissance and I like lifeline I think she heals quicker I provides quicker or even and of course she has like the revive shield and stuff I just fell like I trust myself more to make use of it John I mean like I I don't know I'm not saying I'm bending then I'm just saying I trust myself more and the people are matched up please famous last words watch me go down now where are these people this is the problem when you're going through a lobby there I think you're just struggling to find people it's going in my god shields I can feel it gold shields and Cramer another god bag here oh there we go the whole discussion about who gets the gold bag is null and void because now that should be done I really I guess now we just wait for people to show up hey two pieces of good news one we found an enemy team and two they didn't have a Craver because I don't mean okay I mean what is commonly known as screaming rude in a situation but any single find my friends I'll anyone I'll take it as we better crack shields I'm tempted as well life lane if they don't peek I say we just do it I'll tell you why only one of them should be like him behind he'll in here I can do the two may even just run off was it a Watson was the third person of Watson I reckon they will be closing the other two my phone's going for the Carlton and uppers on the cover if I hear I'm never gonna down those two but it just offers my lifeline a bit it makes it so they can't really shoot the Lifeline without taking loads of damage themselves you know and it's work tape she got the kiln at least the down maybe my lifeline hearing up there where'd your friends go what they've really not so far they've really run off into the sunset didn't they my prediction was right there was one guy was lagging behind a little bit because that's what shield sells on impress did you see that I'm only joking don't worry oh yeah absolutely one shot my friends we know there's only two of them and I haven't heard a peep from other Tina's left that's exactly what I need mom SWAT SWAT that's there if we need it worth remembering there's actually two level three body shoulders our missile armor swaps here sometimes armor socks can be like a free gun fight victory and they've got a lovely - five lucky us we are already inside the ring tonight's gonna need nada teamate please on my Clyde I needed covering fire back there from the lifeline and she has left me for dead I absolutely shredded those guys they all know time that is your threat I've never landed somebody shots how many people up here - I think it's to g7 escapes Hugh Isaac in absolutely bullied what is this okay there's three of them up there I think that's a terrible decisions with the also at Dane see nice going for a bit of a wait flanking maneuver it's bit of a standoff the good news is we're the ones that are safe the bad news is I put my ultimate fallin she's gonna take them to safety all right rings closed if this is what we need to do damage hopping all over the place but that guy's running into my revenue teammate who's going in for the flank I believe in you teammate I'm trustees gonna win that gunfight he did when the gunfight absolutely destroyed my friends it'll not be toxic but I will just chin up top tea time nice job teammate I mean the lifeline adds some questionable teamplay elements I mean you could produce a the same bat mitzva list that the Reviver to start or black off and oh my god nearly 4,000 damage to be fair though I think about a thousand of that damage was just right the end farming up with the g7 Scout two times bruiser absolutely dismantle that team 2,100 damage from out the life own innate kills and four kills from the revenant Reverend actually played that so smart the end I kept thinking that which a party group up because if they rush were screwed but he came in with the flank and just shot one of them from behind and he made a 3v2 Jeanie is played by the revenant 26 kills a man Mirage Mirage is such a fun drop because you get a guaranteed Luke funky I think it's I think is guaranteed if it's not it's like 90% and you've rotate to the vault and you got to train the object like don't shields whatever such a fun drop I hope you guys enjoyed that one it's the most damage I've done in season four as a fun game thanks for watching I'll see you on the next one [Music]
