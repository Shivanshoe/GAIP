thank you to ea for sponsoring today's video hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing the new apex legends arena map called overflow that came out today as part of the thrill seekers event this map has huge walls edge vibes and it's such a great close quarters map i would suggest investing in some grenades because the biggest power spot that i found is the middle building that you'll see us fighting for over and over again here with three open windows get those nades get control of the middle building and you are in a great position to win the game hopefully i'm playing today with ragtag himself whose link is in the description for you guys make sure you are checking out the new arenas map here on apex it's a ton of fun to play thank you once more to ea for sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh that would be something uh just as a word of warning i changed to like advanced controls which is like fully customized scenes and i played on that for like three days but then earlier i was playing i was playing really bad so i blamed alc so i'm back so if i'm bad it's because i keep changing my controller saying so there's nothing i can do about it so that's my excuse i'm getting it in there early and no one can ever question that anything else have you got uh a sprained wrist and my head hurts yeah your head hurts your sunburn okay so we've got some skin damage yes um yes we've got some headaches and we've got some control problems exactly it's a recipe for disaster if i drop 50 damage this game is a success right okay so have you got any excuses lined up or you're just ready to beam i'm just bad to be honest with you well this is is this is bad news i'm gonna be honest with you i didn't scan i forgot i was behind i thought you were dude that was not me he got full sent by two people i was trying to help him but i just couldn't they're already celebrating it's like fireworks night over there what's up man they think they've already won this game yeah and they may have you heard that excuses there you go take all that oh i think they might be coming for me i'll put some shots in if i can they're getting angles one last cell there's a vault down here getting rest [Music] all right not bad not bad you know what i'm back i've played a not a good amount of arena a decent amount of arena and it's only until today i realize that mozambique is free well do you know what i have nothing to say because i usually don't even pick a second weapon and then they just give me one oh do they do they give it to you um do they yeah if you take if you take a light i think they'll give you the mozam oh a shotgun i think they'll give you the p2020 i'm gonna experiment now i have the r9 so let's see what they give me uh i'm lying they gave me a p2020 yeah it might be random oh my god i needed that mozam i am so sorry it's for science so now we know pick your mozam and it's free just hit yep i don't know why i'm not scanning why am i not scanning no that guy's on that come he was really far back so we just got pinched yeah i i lost to someone like who just went devotion spitfire um okay wow okay and uh yeah that's not a loss i mean i felt something leaking away from my soul they're like this right side yeah three house dolls wrecked i don't know what to do for him should we help him gotta try he's getting rushed by three i'm barely hitting that dude oh brother i'm on my way behind you now you're good nice have i got someone behind me got res off she's weak i'll play you came in there the right time now you could were you trying to punch her no no no i was trying to reload okay look it's it's that feeling when you play one legend all the time and there's a path like when i'm shooting or not that's like when you think you can hear someone that's never really when you grapple like you need to wait till you know and then you grab on their forehead you know it's not ingrained in me it's okay you're wondering why they're getting point-blank scanned nice i can't help them i try to i'm gonna try and get them for the rest i've gotta go back but no dude it's trying to hold this having a back so i've got there my head okay man i i've got separated here um oh come on so this sunburn is really affecting me oh i mean it's it's not pleasant it's on the top of your head uh it's it's everywhere it's real bad i'm like a lobster dude nice already turned up can't even see her this whole screen shaking there we go the whole screen was shaking i missed like two full clips before that was that the uh package coming down that did that yeah i think so living on the san andreas fault when i was trying to shoot um what do you think devotion or level four backpack oh my god never fall back never fall back are you sure man i'm pretty sure ah just divo who needs that who needs a bag when you can just do that i took the bag it's the only reason you play lifeline isn't it i feel like whenever i play life and you just have to be yeah that's the worth then they come around and they know they have to first and then you just shoot them it's great that's it it's all broken to be honest with you come on line's nearly cracked that's cracked no suit i'll play it oh she's getting a res dude that's all right neither cracks on that i can't reload i can't relate she's really weak you did not get that off dude she got the bat off at the last second oh my god uh i may have went for a wall bounce missed the walls it looked like i did the slowest 360 ever i was going for a trick shot all right we do this all right it's the first time we're at wait we're ahead now right we're having are we it's match point it is match oh we can we go in come on pathfinder we got this feeling it the whole i think we're a good a cohesive unit now we've sussed each other out you know that's it pathfinder is the bait and then we're the cleanup crew yeah he does a good job surviving on the left and we're just firing from the windows free of charge that's it that's every round so far quality content has his door open hey broken man got a nice egg with chair all they can see is your sunburn head exactly just beaming at them oh man it's like a tournament final positioning here you hurting them ah a lot tickle nothing major let me try him about it was a lot of bullets mate it was a lot of bullets so i understand why you may have thought that i really need to as well right uh like really weak weaker than me at least oh no oh that sucks man i got the door finished that's horrendous the broken door you got a prowler oh my god that hurts i just finished my back too so i would be able to shoot in the back as she was rushing over but this is a close game it needs oil that door i'm telling you oh guys it's the final final round sudden wait oh no i'm mixing it up mate i'm going for a wingman because these ranges i don't know all right okay let's mix it up i'm going charge rifle i'm doing it oh dude i didn't take the level four back back this time oh it's okay it's okay this is the ninth round it's an absolute barn storm is what it is i've got two on the left 5.54 a vengeance should put more scans they're going more that routine right here i need a cracker hey for 96 i might try and teammate i gotta get back how's that not here in what do they have fraber 90 cracked one i think it was foul 26 in there they got back then they have to push away i have no i have no wingman bullets i only have an r9 that's fine i've got it i've got a triple take they didn't take it okay nice we have to move into this ring right 23. oh just one practice i like you just wait she's weak evading me i am one dude i'm coming in yes i wasn't sure if that was one down or two down so then i realized that i ran over hey that was so messy oh well played me well played that voice line lined up with the pathfinder remote for me like he was charging it up and then she went impressive as he like punched upwards it's great yeah yeah it was tremendous
