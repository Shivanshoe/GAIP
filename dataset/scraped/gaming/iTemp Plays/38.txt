hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i always make the same mistake when i record my first impressions video of the new legend whoever i'm playing i never fully utilize the kit my first instinct in apex is to just shoot my gun and that is why i'm not the best fuse in the world most of the time i feel like i could have just done more damage if i was shooting instead of using my knucklebuster now when i recorded my new castle video we were getting rushed by so many different teams from minutes on end and i didn't use my ultimate a single time it takes me a little while to get used to the new legend and to figure out how best to use their kit now unfortunately in this video i did make a mistake for the first time in seven months i had the wrong audio source for the gameplay on obs now the good news is i fix it halfway through so it's only about six or seven minutes i've replaced it with music i've watched it back and it's pretty chill but if you don't like it remember you can skip to halfway through the video and you can watch the end game with regular audio i got my most damage so far this season so it's well worth watching i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i've said it before and i will continue to keep saying it until the end of time well until they fix it there is one ship on olympus and it always passes over like this side of the map i've never seen that sign before in my entire life is this is this place unlooted oh i guess they just went finite because we did have to come over the top to get here so it could be worse here we go just sat there with an arc star if he stuck me i've been raging what's he doing in there could be two separate teams oh my god oh my god he's a whole family it's the whole gang we literally hear one set of footsteps and the whole squadron's just that's like a clown car they've disappeared they've just multiplied just sat in a corner behind his [Music] the shields wasn't even down i guess i can drop these i've got my set up pk flatline [Music] can you set the shield down because because they would have made a noise and they were trying to be as stealthy as possible this is a bad bush that is a really really bad shield oh my god i hit someone with a nade i don't know where that came from careful you play like a loony [Music] i have to use the pico here but i haven't got a shotgun vault okay she's gone there is nothing she can do there you go squat wipe into squat wipe six out of six the last two two teams that's not bad going whatsoever any shotgun bots for the boy i mean that's at least this this could be three teams [Music] that is the saddest thing i've ever done oh god i feel like i've just lost a child [Music] come back to me he's gonna order it to come back to me he's just gonna float up from the depths this is a lot of death boxes [Music] a lot of death boxes no shotgun bolts there we go it's crap someone's got a dweeb machine [Music] oh they're not gonna hop are they just gonna keep going i mean it's just it's the smart play for a second i was scared that i was too isolated and they're all going to hop out the week on me but i looked up and gibby who's there protecting me burning shot is that low broad smooth hello i mean that's not the original team there's a guy behind us here too careful team don't get flanked my shell bounced off a traffic cone i see you that is not how you play crypto can i just say not like i'm so so not like i am some sort of crypto expert but i wouldn't really choose him as as my flanking legend i would see the back i'd pop empties i'd annoy everyone okay i can't shoot there are too many teams here i'm backing up i swear these guys have been fighting the entire time someone's just going crazy with a charge rifle here oh my god there's a guy close i can't even see him i see you i see you sean okay i had two shots well careful team what is with all these people with blue armor i swear you guys been fighting for the last three millennia [Music] this guy wasn't the charge rifle the tweed machine man someone over here has got a dread machine i heard it going off the entire time absolutely no way can't get away with this there's only two in here then if one's going that way [Music] let me pop a finisher okay didn't let me found the twee machine man okay their teammates are live somewhere already just a little solo guy running the base [Music] i mean that is an impressive shot bow and arrow on a gun in midair mind you i am newcastle can't have a big hitbox [Music] they say use the shield look at this slow progress [Music] i beamed him i'm pushing he's cracked [Music] they're going to beat me there we are in a bad spot we need to slide down here asap i could also up there but i'd be so low my teammates can't get up there at all there's a team down here as well guys blue gaming these guys are griefing us the guy with the baron arrow behind us is an absolute menace to society or at least a man is to me it's my last shield cell you guys good i'll put some shots in for you [Music] that's so stupid that is so tilting if you're a content creator and you use like obs or if you even just talk to people on pc if your windows updates just double check your audio sources because it's every time i do a windows update these guys gatekeepers actually were in the zone we're fine every time i updated changes by itself it's so annoying the guy the burnout is shifted his target sorry the drill give me more yeah let's get out of there where are they going though zone's going to push them out if they go all the way around we got another squad look over us mean we can hold them we just have to hold them from further this way so we don't get shot on the side okay i thought that was an octane i'm dying i'm getting absolutely murdered by this zone okay [Music] it i got a shield for you this guy with the bone our arrow shield he's coming up as well at least we've sort of forced our way through here that's a really good job from the mad maggie we wouldn't have really had a safe place to push without taking our teammates good grief was everyone in this love is so annoying bows and charge rifles and i mean this is the team that could have third of the other guys in the back really easy to get three kills but they decided to sit on top of these two buildings instead which is sort of a good sign for two reasons one they're not too aggressive and they sort of let us leave and two how many arrows could they possibly have if they've used all of them okay this isn't bad i've got gold bags but he's so phrasing as long as they don't push we're okay back down they're safe behind that too oh this sucks i'm recharging my evil shield we need an astronaut i would seem so bad oh they're rotating i don't need to that's sort of left less off the hook that's on me i'm recharging my ego shield that's not the one on my back i'm literally about to report all of you guys okay for being annoying yes it's a thing okay rules rule 18 don't be annoying reportable offense yeah you get the crafter going ring's closing in one minute mad maggie old somewhere safe oh god was that worthy i could jump on them okay [Music] how many arrows do you have we've just got to push this team this is actually kind of safe this little courtyard there we go that's much towards this part timmy's pushing him though i mean sat here the entire game and you've still got blue shield i'm going to stick it stay alive gibster big gibbo old bag rez they're gay footage got a two times on my pk why did no one tell me she's in the she's in the fern shoot the fern phone cotton did are you the guy's homeless with a bow you work sorry so yeah okay there's still a team it's as simple as that i mean i don't know what's more annoying getting shots getting shot by eight bow tracks three charge rifles and a charged sentinel for the last half of the game all the fact that my audio was on the wrong source so i missed out on the game audio for half that game as well i made 13 kills i got my 3k badge on newcastle i've not even played him that much i got the goldbag rez at the end that was a sensational game that was a tremendous game i'm going to go have a nap i'm exhausted gg that's why i'm talking like this
