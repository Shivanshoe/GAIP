hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're actually playing some more solo ranked i think i said this in a previous game but i'm basically soloing of the diamond where i will find me a team to grind to masters with ranked is pretty funny split and platinum is proven to be fairly simple to play through by myself so i'm just having some fun with it i have two games for you here today both of which feature the kreber a gun i don't use too often here on apex but here we are so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh we got a team here and i've got a sentinel oh i don't got a sentinel because i missed it give me that oh please please thank you hello he's going to run off he's got he's got smoke and everything i don't care his teammates above me even if i down him i'm not getting the kill credit that's i i'm pretty much weaponless i mean i can i can try and quickscope but i'm not too effective i'll give it my best go though i need half the damage to him so this this is a dual effort you know i have one kill somehow how do i have one kill i mean i need to heal okay they are sort of kicking off nearby thanks amigo hey i'm actually so useful mate oh they're even better unbelievable upgrades are they still kicking off over there we might as well just go over this is all rooted uh i really would like a vault do i carry the ammo i think the vault center now is such a good combo the vault is like such a jack of all trades it's it's obviously an smg so it's good close range but medium range it's not too bad either it's a sort of gun that really suits the sense now i guess i guess the flatline is another one you can just hit by the flatline close range i'm never gonna have any shots let's get over there oops shuffle melty giving my shields a recharge anyway it's got him it's nice he got him as well my teammates are actually the world's greatest players here we go this is the combination this is the combo we were looking for so many energy bullets actually is it's fine than heavy brains this isn't good i've got two shield cells please don't hit my shield i can't even really like charge up my sense now i can't even i can't grapple apparently there's many things i'm incapable of apparently that missed i can't see there's a lot going on i know i'm using them both you need them as well i mean we're all struggling then that's not good i've played boys yeah my team seems really good i've got two kills but i got full kp nearly a thousand damage running around with a sense now i'll take it uh half the lobbies left there's a crafter actually in fragment i'm just going to get some bats you don't really need cells if you can craft like cells are nice though aren't they if you want to get hit for like 20 you need to pop a cell dilute these probably worth my time it's kicking off in scrap at all chill please no i always take light rains there we go it's just a it's just a reaction i can't not take light ammunition nine times out of ten i'm using a light gun in one of the in a game i'm playing you know just muscle memory at this point i can't even charge this thing up i've got one shield cell this is an absolute tragedy i don't want to get hit team you guys going first i'll throw some nades or something i don't know is there no one outside is it okay the audio sound like someone's outside sorry i'm coming down shields red armor here we go i try and carry more shells because i'm using a center now and i would like to uh i would like to charge all right tremendous great work team actually looted now too don't know if i heard someone in here black market careful there's an enemy black market right here that is something i never really utilize the dead eyes but may as well pick it up nothing else to take from this thing oh i'm gonna top and my teammates are trying to set a new kill record which i can appreciate i'm coming get me involved i want to be part of history i still don't have an extender mag for my sniper jump pad chances are i've missed them i like my brain still it doesn't scan for extended uh sniper mags it just doesn't i'm not interested most of the time confirmed i mean i am the cis king but it's ranked who cares i've got kp reloading that octane is just run off into the sunset it's probably an uh it's probably made it to skyhook bunny no one is using this knife no one is using sniper i don't need ammo but if they don't have sniper ammo i'm not even gonna bother to check if they have an extended sniper mag because i'm the only person on the planet who carries sniper stocks when i'm using an r301 and the vault you know it's literally no one else does that it's just me oh thanks did you see how great i was i did all kinds of trying to punch me along to keep me action i could appreciate that it's a good teammate right there that's a nice little combo if we can time well the horizon up with the bangalore ultimate bangalore ultimate hurts so difficult to damage anyone with it apart from me i'm always running into it here we go this is an upgrade upgrade of the century some may say get me involved two squads left there's a gun my team i'm not going to get left behind i want to sit in the back and just take someone's head off that's the plan here i mean i i executed half the plan there to sit back but they're taking someone's head off was uh wasn't completed mission failed making contact oh that's the damn guy i quick sculpted down guy i got 100 damage void though i'm not sure i need this many bullets for one team left but i don't know what to replace it with in fact i wouldn't mind if they were because we're ready we barely got hit here we go [Music] enemy down sometimes the audacious it just might work yeah i'm going left side got timo here as well which is fine we'll just loop like the other half both of them oh my god rest in peace in this squad i've used upon my energy that is not good this is a separate teams latinos landing east i assume this is the solo assume this is their teammate they say it was a new team so sorry team it's okay i've got my two energy bullets recharging my shields that guy had a pk didn't they i guess i just switched the pk for now the nice thing uh nice things about shotguns especially the stars that you don't really need too many bullets you don't need to keep finding them but i am struggling with the volt smg r99 combination okay you guys need right as well i don't have all the bullets in the world if we're gonna do this i think we just rush him it's running i'll forget it i'm not getting this guy and there's a load back here i'm gonna i was gonna chill i think we'll just be scrapping he's going down the top we can commit to these i don't mind i mean my guns are my guns are fine my attachments are sort of scuffed but my guns are fine that guy's literally one shot one had literally one health unfortunately he's got some teammates here i already see the whole place is on fire we go i got your teammate i'm hoping we can go and craft i really want a purple extended energy mag i mean i've got a blue one but there's a lot of downtime in ranked oh here we go this guy this guy had the loot great where did he land heavy ammo here this is tremendous stuff i mean we've got to go this way anyway right i don't want to go all the way around harvester just seems atrocious i might be able to crash still is it worth it for a purple mag these guys gonna make the decision for me can't craft when these guys are here hello are you doing like a pacifist challenge or something this guy's trying to get a dime without firing a bullet i think which is extremely sad here we go third party as always i mean it's fine once you once you've finished the fight and you're healthy it's fine at least we've got a next fight hello i don't know i don't actually know when my bullets are going there i think because i was pressing forward i think the game thought i was like mid-air or something because that was not precision accuracy i agree we're just going to get held i've got 7kp already and i have seven if anyone fancies one okay already i grappled away these guys just chased us for some reason it's weird it's absolutely destroyed the season 10 the season 10 care packages even but it's too good not to check spitfire craiber alternator as long as they're not coming to try and steal this gear back as promise i'm fine with with their presence right give us a gun i mean i'd even take the triple take all right never mind it's the worst care package ever this could just be a solo there are four squads left and there are fewer than 10 players and we are a three so i think there are a fair few rats in this lobby hello friends i probably should have zoomed in would have made it a little bit easier i was going to see if he wants to be friends and he absolutely did not start kicking off they are not safe as well they need to come up this hill they've got a good spot 15 seconds left it doesn't really matter if they know we're here or not they're not going to have too much time to change their plans so target over there he's one one shot and by one shot i mean i connected one shot force excluded i got a teammate hello how am i still in the gas there's no chance i was in the gas there what i think my talents might clear him up though nice job team i can't actually nearly through the game because the game thought i was in the gas and i wasn't that's crazy here we go well i'm not sure if there are many people in this lobby i don't think they're squads i've got a feeling they're two solos because we just killed the full team we killed that lobe earlier on who had a team somewhere and he said four squads with a question mark so there's a good chance this is either i think it might be a solo and a jar of solo and a sober might as well have some fun with the crater i don't know how that's mixed you guys okay i'm in a bit of a sniper fight here think it again i'm giving my shields a recharge i think it's a cello i shouldn't have shot the no scope was close it was it was a close scope it was a close scope good game team it's i mean i saw i sort of ruined the vibes of the craver i mean i landed i landed a shot i only took a few at the end one of them was a no scope you know you can't really expect too much that's a weird game my teammates were were too good almost i that didn't feel like a platinum lobby we just sort of rolled through the competition good work team sensational
