hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we actually just got a trailer for apex legends newest event called the thrill seekers event uh with it comes a new arena's map uh limited time cosmetics and maybe we will see a few meta changes in the form of some patch notes as well now the big thing here for me is the new map it looks unbelievable i love the close quarters feel that this map has especially as a few of the arenas maps that we have at the moment definitely favored that assault rifle meta in my opinion now on this new map called overflow pull out the r9s the e48 the vault and go to work with your aim assist my friends make it happen the interesting thing here for me is that this new arena map isn't actually based on any of the points of interest that we have in the three base battle rail maps on apex now this is exciting because this could be a new point of interest that we will see in future on one of the br maps whether that turns out to be king's canyon world's edge or of course olympus the cosmetics look great as always we have mirage as a clown and revenant skin looks pretty cool as well but my personal favorite of the lot is definitely pathfinder skin just look at him looks great now because this event doesn't have its own heirloom there is a chance that it will come with the possibility of getting shards for those of you who would like to choose which heirloom to buy though this hasn't been confirmed just yet now this is all coming on the 13th of july so not long now at all it's just next tuesday i actually have my driving test that day so it's a pretty busy schedule for me if i failed my driving test i may sound completely depressed in the video on this event we'll see we'll see what happens today i have a full gameplay for you of course so i hope you enjoy that thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh what are these weapons they suck where's everyone uh big building over here right on the way people to the right yeah i'm half health from my own steam this can't be good i hate this building i don't like the mountain keeper players on the rope i'll be honest there's about 12 people just flying around reloading a blockchain like this one i hate this place was the last of that squad okay forget it oh she's so laggy so laggy yeah if you don't have a shotgun there's no point it doesn't matter yeah they don't have a shotgun and you can't like flick on them or something like there's no point at all just lose so wasted time i think no one can track that fast it's ridiculous it will teleport you to the rope that's the thing yeah it's pretty crazy today what the heck's this yeah i wonder if i don't think it's the people i think the servers are just bad because there's so many laggy people today but shorty everyone be lagging why am i supposed i am taking a moment to recharge stoked i only have a 30 30. come on [Applause] oh my god you get that kill i don't get this kill it's an absolute tragedy i'm telling you he's on me trying to kill me rich oh thank goodness i've got one of them i'd have been really sad if i would have gotten that kill too having in the previous fight too oh i have four light rounds even after all this i have 150 yeah he's looking at me i have a pass i think it's a rev team but he just found it towards us not sure what was going on there like was that an octane rev and they just didn't have any sort of coordination at all charging on my shields uh i have a 300 like 500 like what can you do with that gun awful dude it's so bad such a bad gun no no no no no no no entrance for this gun sorry that's it i have another 99 now okay that's such a bad gun there's like no upside to it no whatsoever g7 is bearing every way in my opinion the only once you get attachments i don't mind it like once you get a decent mag and a side and stuff but it's okay but even then that's not the best i'm getting health back i have no idea it's fine people do we took south or what yeah i don't know either i mean maybe towards like fuel we all thought it was just gonna be the best gun ever it was gonna be the new uh 67 oh my god i need a heavy mag on this thing oh this i'm gonna phoenix i'm just gonna run a phoenix thank you so much i died about a second after i went in cover he just sent into that into that team so hard i i thought i was cutting that one player off and their teammates were already up there thank you wanna one's got blue over there and one with an eight dog cruise broken and i've got a pad there for him too oh my god are almost broken too what's that no one broke the pad he's blonde i'm stunned oh my god will we find everyone squad that was kind of fun come on come on that was a lot better considering i was on the ground behalf of it a lot better than i expected i don't know i mean the fact that that other team pushed was perfect because yeah plus pull that other team off we need that my god what's going on my inventory there we go on the back i think they're going padded away yeah i'm not being away i think i was just running just so fast oh claims more to the left there yeah almost broken i don't chase this bang if i can bang on you broken oh my god she came around the side man i didn't hear or see or anything she's uh team just
