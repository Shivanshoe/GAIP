fight at river center which was amazing because you didn't have to go hunting for the next fight also an update here on the meet market sign mystery which is an ongoing theme on the channel if you've seen recent videos here uh you'll know that i am currently bamboozled because of a mysterious sign that i think appeared out of nowhere just outside the market location on king's canyon well thanks to you guys and nathaniel specifically for looking back it turns out that well the sign has always been there here is a clip from a video that is over a year old now already got six bandijos i don't know what the word for six is in spanish but i know the word for bandage andy joe as we all know that sounds like skulltown believe it or not so who knew not me i'm but i'm no longer bamboozled but i am

time yeah that that full team i was fighting up there just did not care that i was killing all of them they just kept shooting you guys seems to be a common occurrence today yeah people just don't care about them yeah i just want to shoot you guys someone's head popping off there are two teams on me uh there's a lot of people in here bro oh my god dude where's the audio from that's you guys they are here as long as she's dead if he's a pan yeah we're kind of stuck he altered us and there's the next team nice one of these guns out here i know she missed every shot backing up i got a nine

three here a sec good stuff i was so close to dying that whole fight jesus so cut myself off with my own grenades i couldn't even come to hell because i just launched names again i didn't see the i thought the totem was on the other side i didn't realize that totem was there they got sent back and they were literally right in front of me like oh god oh like that i should have actually known when i had nine it wasn't kill either i should have said something i had no clue i didn't even think about it i didn't think about it either to be honest i don't think it was like the war like i don't know the end was so messy yeah there was so much fighting at the end
