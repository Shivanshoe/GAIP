guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and we are playing some pathfinder uh listen okay despite the nerfs the pathfinder has had i still love this little robot man he still has a place in the game he's just not that good nothing feels worse in apex than a little floppy grapple it's horrendous you see your team speeding off without you whilst you are trying to run as fast as a fridge freezer with legs canvas behind them for the next three hours without your grapple fortunately though we have some hints here from a producer of respawn that he's going to get some love pretty soon but before we get into it i'm happy to say that today's video is sponsored by opera gx opera gx is the first browser built for gamers with a ton of useful features on a gx control jigs control allows you to adjust and limit the opera browser's usage of your pc's ram uh your cpu and also your internet connection to make sure that it's not eating into the resources that you need to play games without lagging i myself have had so many occasions where i've had to close my browser because of ram usage alone closing it completely can be a huge inconvenience if you're still using it on your other monitor perhaps you're listening to music or even watching a walkthrough guide at the same time or maybe you just don't want to lose the tabs that you have open you know that with opera it won't be taking up all of your pc's power because you control it yourself upper gx also has the gx corner which keeps you up to date with the latest free

just say as well that this is one beautiful browser the theme can be consistent with every website you visit because you can have a forced dark mode which is really easy to find in the settings and

yourself if you're on your phone you can still click the link and type your email in and you'll receive an email to download opera once you made it back to your pc so let me give you some background on how this started so someone started a fake twitter account uh impersonating an apex legends producer josh medina and he tweeted out saying i had to play apex legends we have been listening to your feedback and i've realized we have heard pathfinder a little more than intended to combat this we have decided to take low profile off reduce grapple cooldown to 25 seconds from 35 seconds since this tweet it is worth noting that he has changed his account name uh his profile picture and he no longer looks like josh medina in any way shape or form but when he was impersonating him it was actually pretty convincing and then what happened was the actual josh medina replied to this tweet saying that it was funny altouch then replies to that tweet saying that he did raise some value points and then finally the real josh medina responded once more saying that he's going to get some love soon there we go that is what us pathfinder mates have to hang on to here in terms of hope and i know what you are thinking rich are you really making an entire intro about one tweet no the joke is on you it was four tweets and also your boy is struggling here as a pathway to maine this is actually pretty exciting okay let me have this one this could be buffs to his ultimate or maybe just getting rid of low profile but i wouldn't mind if he kept low profile and his ultimate way is if his grapple cooldown just got i mean imagine just five seconds the amount of times i've died i've looked down at my grapple cooldown and i like three seconds i was so close to grappling to safety like spider-man like five seconds would be huge also if you guys could please show some love so far down in the description not only did he make this video first he's actually really close to a hundred thousand subs and we play with him in today's game janks too of course so be sure to check him out as well but so far it's close to 100k yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the full team over here got purple fellas i'm not even on the side of the map i'm on my way good i can try and pull you hold on if you fall back i got you just cracks let's crack on purple i think there's a wraith i'm about to scan in a second i'm just gonna shield okay she's literally like 12 health let me know if you go outside let me know if they go outside i don't think they will found one yeah see ya nice job fellas that was a weird that was a weird little fight that was a strange one it was a 2v2 on both sides like a symmetrical like symmetrical porsche

grapple i was uh i mean i down the octane but there's a lot of blue armor up there okay that guy's still up there don't mind him man there's a wall so yeah okay the blue blonde one guy had the sniper

dranks off when he took so long from together why would you do that funny i'm having a blast here fellas i'm telling you doing bare minimal but like the bare minimal that i'm doing is so satisfying what do you have on the uh rifle no no no no i know but like what's going on uh three times now it was a 48. i was trying to cancel it it was you i heard oh it scared me there's people here though oh

eight bullets but it's only four bullets you know what i mean ah i didn't know that oh we both got bamboozled to be fair i accidentally climbed up on a railing halfway through a gunfight i mean i'm gonna be honest like i was very sold that my alt was gonna destroy their life i didn't get a single hit you remember your angle that's a bangalore all for you i don't know what they got to do to it to make it better but like they're they got to do a little something bang me some love it man it's bloodhound if they don't do something uh if bloodhound stays the way bloodhound is then i don't think
