hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some more ranked as well with so far and vickstar we had won our previous two ranked games so we are trying to make it three in a row in the game that i have for you here today and we were also using the tier 110 battle pass skin for the scout in season six called hypersonic it has beautiful iron sights which make it usable without a sight and if you've used the scout beforehand you'll know that that is uh not something you would have said about the scouts and that explains why i wasn't picking the site up it's because i was trying to showcase the skin a little bit uh but it's also broken and not in a good way i don't know if it's the reactive camera part of the skin but when you're using the iron sights you get these balls of plasma floating right where you're trying to aim i don't think it's a problem if you do have a sight on the weapon i'm not sure they expected any lunatics out there to uh to avoid them but i was i was that lunatic but anyway thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm zooming the fact that octane runs with a gun finger out will never get old what an icon gun finger ready oh they have spotted your boy oh boy come on sir you moved fast you got on the zipper oh you guys are here that's uh yeah i went on the big big potential they're just like in this building somewhere oh they're next to me next to me two of them i'm not pushing that um there's one shooting from behind i'm going to focus on him yeah i got another one way back crack nice mirage in here on me open the door what's happening he's probably gonna go for the rest of his teammate yeah

charger that was great that was the best support ever season three vibes yeah yeah honestly it feels like i'm back in season three charge rifle undefeated uh when you get when you get shot by a charge rifle there's just all you can do is just panic yeah it warns you it's like you're about to get hit with damage i'm just a little bit either it's like 70 or 80. yeah so oh you think this is damaged get ready for some more uh sniper uh yeah should we just go straight out i'm landing by the top all right i'm coming through this guy i'm on his head nice i'm here with you but oh i did not have a good time there that nearly didn't go well i was like i was only trying to get up top and then the game was like no you can't go there it's cheating where was that reza was that over here uh yeah
