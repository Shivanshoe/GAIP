there was guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more warm sound of course so yesterday they dropped at the solos game mode which is great for me because usually I play solo but the scary thing jeez war zone is quite a defensive game as a lot of high ground that has a lot of tactical gameplay and if you're not careful you're gonna get eliminated from someone they set up so solos it's even scarier than them playing the regular game mode versus trios but again that I've got for you today is both tactical and slightly aggressive at the same time we drop a decent amount of kills so I hope you enjoyed if you do and you're new around here be sure to subscribe to join the ayat' empire and RC war in five more seconds my friends all right team this may be a little bit of a hot drop especially near the hangars but hopefully okay leave my search contract alone people i've got a shotgun a dream and the dream means that I get a different gun other than the shotgun okay fantastic they need to do something about these weapons people definitely learnt in that building people are fighting their hand cuz I told you this was gonna be a little bit of a hot drop [Applause] they're not gonna change me all right the genius idea has backfired once more assertion such a good opportunity day with an LMG just a live Pro and fire people in the hangars and this guy's on a rooftop then doesn't even challenge when I shoot twice for some reason he didn't look the ground floor he could have easily just hopped off the roof or something but I've got to try and get the search contract completed this is the tactic though I never really used to do contracts until I saw a plane with like a vacant in samya --less it's just for its free money and and the search contracts low loot limited supply beans actually having some stuff English you get a higher chance of meow - dragon up I'm not going to take that I've got to go in the building where people were fighting and I saw about four people landing fantastic sorry friend I thought I heard someone miss man just when he's gun fight when salute and now he's now he's gulag man half man half GU light of course right p90 is a solid weapon in this they definitely need to fix some of the for-loop something is literally just useless I mean I've got a shield Tori's as well not interesting now I don't want to accidentally use it so it's gonna pop on the floor if I accidentally pull that out in a gunfight I'm gonna be well I would have been absolutely fuming so get ready now as a tactic now this is a little bit of bird a flashbang I don't actually have a tactical there we go could easily beast 1 this is why solos are so scary we good we're good absolutely not not a soul around here well max our plates already we've got a good close range a good long range and as soon as we complete these contracts well we have enough already for our loadout drop that's how good this is good this tactic is believable seems here little bit more maybe I'll gain before 10,000 us in afro though that drop and a UAV I'm not a big fan of the a K but to be honest I'm not a big fan of the MK 2 I say it's a good long-range good it's not really it's good on multiplayer but I'm not a big fan on on warzone I don't like the sights I can't hate anyone with that size I don't go for the storage down here this close this close wants to go to put on their hot drops and if I'm cornered a loadout drop I'm even more of a target in that area I might have to just run across the field in the distance it's the odds storage tanks crap as it's known it's under my right to book the p90 this is probably the fight that I want to take I assume it's over by now their thoughts on flying might have popped my stop and bow here hopefully just respawn from they do like okay please drop shine all right knowingly he didn't have a suppressor on because when either someone else here that when the gun fight and you would have seen on the radar hey friend sorry about that oh you were loading - okay we have 13,000 smackaroos here actually see the person he killed this must be the other person he killed all right this man was popping off that is a epic SMG I don't think he's got the right site no the site's not that good though I'm not a big fan of the site this one's so much cleaner okay it's slated for dropping an epic SMG or slight either day for dropping a blue mp7 for a common mp7 but the blue mp7 has like this weird tiny little red dots on it that I do not like and the iron sights are not gonna clean as soon as I get my load outs and a UAV I'll be laughing because then I'll have the confidence of known whenever I hear enemy UAV airborne I was okay I'm being tracked by three minutes I've got to survive okay well the threats real low so I'm still going to call this loadout in and then I'm just gonna I don't have to try and rush this I reckon call it in instantly I have to pop this UAV straight away I assume that's the menu no threats gone up as well hey Ralph careful that friend yes he's definitely him threats gone max oh my god my shadows long as he doesn't see my shadow okay it's not gonna see is it up sneak right he's only but it wasn't my shadow that it wasn't the shadow that he's he wheezed this man shopping here too I have a claim war of one of the entrances but I'm pretty sure there's another entrance that's like like in an inside light up I think there you go Sheila's he's challenging that he must have not had any armor place left because there's no way these man challenges that unless he just got extremely cocky I mean he was an aggressive player I get even more money for that name 9200 all right where are the lad is then how did this man get up because this is the building I don't know if you guys played much more player but this is the building from port for dansk in ground war and there's like inside ladders I find it's gonna got the ladders the arming up cuz he got up there without I didn't hear my Claymore explode took off 4200 home for this guy I had a bit of monies to his name as well when he was rushing me for a bounty so I would assume he's got a bit of a bit of Mulan here for me or at least that's the dream okay I'm 13 I mean it I like my loadout but the thing is I'm max level on the kilo already so amazing I'll take this opportunity to try and level up the n13 a little bit as well storms closing in and a few more things here I should have bought on the place I knew this guy didn't have a home plates I didn't buy anything but I guess r45 as well we've got $300 we've spent well here spare UAV two good weapons we've got ghosts we have amped and a good lot of spots we hasn't moved hey get some every time I had to try and make a play because the storms pushing me in here you just thought he was gonna get flanked that's the tactic you have to wait a little bit oh he left the games well he already goo that up alright someone okay he's not going for the buy station I was coming through here [Applause] you think that these search contract as well is that late-game it replenishes the supply beans they've already been looted so it's a good even though even if you know even if you don't give it opportunity to to finish the contractor you still get a decent lucky pollutant there's real good look that fresh gas mask more armored plates storms pushing us here I'm not sure about to complete this hopefully the next one he's more towards the safe zone it's not worth it I don't need the money for it to be honest I know I've only got 900 I'm not about to put myself a worse position just to try and complete the contract it's not worth it people that I kill from now on should have a decent amount of cash I would hope because the pay stations they'll buy stations become less and less available you can't climb up this okay there we go I'm an expert just an update I'll barely smashing a glass there we go a little bit of supervised on the go as well I don't think you okay I was let you back to update you on the situation this guy was set up top and he was fired someone else and I couldn't push like there's no way pushing there is a smart idea so I thought baiting out the pie station get out of the chopper took a news chopper flown about the place where he was firing someone I'm not sure he actually killed them and she's nerve-racking because I she in there fairly close God solos he's terrifying doors are closed I don't want to open them in case anyone's nearby these buildings are game pushed honestly I'm gonna wait again I know this I know I'm camping here but if someone is on this rooftop and over now I'm dead that's the only shoe this looks fairly open there's like two-and-a-half buildings but I gotta wait he's 20 seconds I see it's not worth II think if they were in there I'd hear coughing this might be the time to play looking more aggressive I think we need to try and clear some people out if there's too many people left in a circle I'll put an end up getting shot from different angles these guys have to get pushed out yeah keep snapping news choppers dawn here everyone's watching it's just looking fine without suppressing the storm though or at least not in a safe zone hello friends what we doing my name's get out a chocolate there we go this guy had a UAV eleven squeak wheelchair oops nervous shooting 1v1 listen um I know that I played offensive there cookies I'm hot off a second-place win us the second place we like it felt like a win I'll be honest with you surviving that long in solos felt like a victory fresh off a second place I needed that win good you have to be so tactical you have to look at every building and I think this party songs sound on top of that look at me I think these are all the names on the left all these people that's on my third game you solos a second place and then we've won first place how many kills perhaps you proceed 12 43,000 XP I mean that's outrageous all right 11 kills 2650 damage done that's my friends is what is known in the business as a solid game my first solo win on warzone I hope you enjoyed that if you did be sure to leave a like rating RC war in the next one [Music]
