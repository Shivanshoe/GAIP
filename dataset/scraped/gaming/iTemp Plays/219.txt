hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't know if you guys remember but back in the day lifeline was the legend to play for some of the top solo queuing players in apex and it was basically just because of her passive fast healing mechanic now fast heels were so broken in the game apex got rid of it entirely you could pop a bat in two and a half seconds with the original gold bag for example and even though gold shields these days is sort of fast healing it's still quicker to pop a battery than it is to pop two small shield cells necessary to fully heal you with gold shields now since three spawn nerf fast hills lifeline can actually be kind of tricky to play while solo queuing but i had a great game here for you today i hope you enjoyed thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right we're landing somewhere other than scraptor because this is my i mean technically second game back wait hold on help shield that's mine every day of the week second game back since i've played a lot of halo and my sensitivity seems so unbelievably high and i didn't fancy landing scraps again oh purple get him teammate i don't know where the fuse is timmy can first the kill get that guy's purple i'm pretty sure he didn't have where did he go and didn't get a gun that's unfortunate does anyone see the fuse please leave a comment if anyone knows where that guy went there you go is it a fuse so i just i've been enjoying just showing bam when i kill people so much recently i i don't know why it just it just adds a lot of power it makes me feel like a i don't know i don't know how to explain it you've got to try it out yourself sometime if you're just sitting there playing not speaking to anyone when you're loading up that snipe when you're aiming when you when you're quick scoping that last guy try believe me okay just scream bam careful squad i went from the headshot the only way i could have killed him there so he's in a very precarious position we need to try and overlook for him off the backboard off the backboard again what's going on here uh we have much better armor in this team i think well one time blue one of us has got blue i won't say much better but i think we've got better armor like no light ammo as long as you don't fire and talk or actually can't kill them nice job please oh my god i suck like what's wrong with it i'm also challenging this absolutely i can start the revived one i gotcha oh i can do both at once i was i was looting because i thought it was going to take a while for him to yeah you can do two points we need to run i don't have my i already used it no please please thank you administering medically i was even in there i don't have my drone they're probably wondering why i haven't got it drone drone is on way pop cooldown syringes all right nice reduced by 50 i missed a lot of snipes there it's a lot of snipes i'll tell you what it was i didn't have the confidence to load up like a sniper with the bam you know this is good i think the valkyrie's got the self-risk because she had the gold shield so i assume he's the same person as he ah she did i have so many of those bad boys nice on a bit of a rampage am i recording gotta double check these days you don't know what's going on okay there's people out there that don't want to see you succeed i am recording i'm back with my controls not working there we go oh that's huge energy shield i have three bats reckon these boys need one shield yeah feel like you don't need to carry syringes as a lifeline but i'm going to hold on to them because i've got half my bags empty oh that's a mistake i know amy's just through this yeah we need to sit up top if we can we'll tim is in a bad spot he's in a really bad spot two teams here they were like reviving someone let's get thirsty go back when he pushed there wait there's two squads left what do you mean all we've done is sit here i mean i tell you what i've had a good time though anyone got any of these if not i'll probably have to take a flatline i'm enjoying using the longbow recently i feel like i'm i feel like i'm feeling a bit loose on this game at the moment too it's gonna be better than usual you know  playing a little bit more recently too that's probably why i'll take these take these don't need this many of these no one's got any light rains it's so sad did i say light rains i meant sniper brains you have literally zero here drop your next i guess it's not my main goal anymore but there should be loads in the death boxes around here i think we checked everything i just went way too far a bit more heavy uh would you leave me a comment what would you drop or would you leave it like this 120 i reckon my flat lines gonna be my main gun and i could use it close range and 60 heavy i think is worth more than 60 like because the flat line fires slower so it lasts longer you know that's my thought process and i've still got 180 in this as well so i think that's a good good decision i mean i missed the longbow especially because this is going to be look it's a giant circle and we might get into some pretty long lines of engagement maybe i could have crafted some but there wasn't a crafter there i don't know i don't know i'll just miss the longbow okay two teams are fine okay sounds that way sounds like that's probably just harvester this way one minute rings nearby yes ralph yeah my ultimate is ready yes raphael experiment to begin i hope you guys can hear me just sound like i'm talking to myself come over here ralph come talk to the people i wanna hear what you gotta say the rings close 45 seconds the pressure is accelerating i'll have tonight with ralph because he oh they're gonna push this now generally was it's because it's not my flatline skin because my flatline skin on this bad boy would be fine oh look it's the long line of engagement that i was fully expecting if only i had some sniper rings funny they spawned in on this game let's get over there team the last two teams like how do they be split one of these shoes let's get over here how did you die you got cratered oh god that's why they left it behind i guess me imagine the scenes that's the last team they're down a player whack them whack someone this is huge nice job nice human escape huge game gg my second game back since playing halo and i feel like i was better than when i was grinding this game i don't know i thought it was loose on the sticks john i mean you just jump on some days and you're thinking this is this is the one you know i'm playing well i'm having a great time i've got two of the best guys ever look at these guys that was 12 minutes long gg guys well played four revives the gold bag came in clutch as well in one of those engagements when we were getting third partied nice
