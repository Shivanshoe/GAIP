hey what's up guys it's freech welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are returning to the solo to masters video series now just for clarification by the way if you've been watching rank this season i have played with people in ranked this split however i haven't played with anyone seem to be plat one so all of diamond i've soloed through which let's be honest is the only challenging part about this so i guess you could say oh technically it wasn't a solo to masters because i played with so far for three games in plat two but come on now the biggest tip i can give you if you're trying to do this challenge is that you need to try and adjust to the way your teammates are playing it is far better to have three people on the same wavelength on the same page with the same tactics than it is having one guy that's trying to play defensive and two guys aggressive or vice versa now different play styles is fine but sometimes you just have to deal with some people that i mean i don't know what's going on with them i don't know what's happening they're just trying to grief you and it happens but i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i finished that with you the only team here i need a secondary gun cracked an enemy shield taken down i may not be heard with it it's not one of us so that was the last one darn it oh my god okay the good news we are live and we got three kp bad news i don't really have anything these guys are shambles the best place to lose is definitely this backside because you get the high ground you can head glitch people it's so easy to defend back here shotgun ammo here let's go this way so it's a good job my teammate decided to go that way you know whatever the jumpmaster was i got good news and bad news the good news one on our team has gold armor the bad news is he's disconnected okay and he's gone no get his golf get his gold armor i mean i've got so many bats oh what is this game man this game today doesn't want me to get masters i'm i'm telling you 10 seconds and this is where it got pretty difficult and i'm speaking in the past tense here this is me sat on my pc editing my wraith teammate um he pinged that there was a squad there and i just thought okay there's a team there i didn't realize he meant i'm gonna go over there and challenge the 1v3 he did take one of them down i got his banner fortunately he had a mobile respawn beacon unfortunately there were two teams fighting pretty much on his back so i had to run away in the process of running away of course i ran into another team i managed to heal up sort of get out of there and i'm not blaming my race teammate for pushing that by the way because our caustic teammate left we wouldn't have lost any rp but the thing is i have three kp that's pretty good if you finish like top five whatever that's free rp all you've got to do is sort of sit in a corner so i wasn't giving up on this game i went past some other squads i respawned him near the wraith portal with my two times flatline i was trying to mix things up and i realized there was a squad on top of us so we had to flee the scene we had to get the hecking freak out of there after a little grapple lobbed a little fire and we retreated i mean this session that i had today on ranked was one of the tougher sessions i think in the first hour and a half i may have got like seven rp in total my my net total was maybe plus seven rp but here we are we made it we were safe and i wasn't giving up i'm here great already inside the ring getting hit over here shield battery here ah do you have a shotgun bolt one of these must have had something nice we're kind of chilling here a little bit but they're low being there contact with targets is i don't know if this team knows there's a team down low for the boys right here 30 seconds until close this is very exciting so this game is unlucky but we still got 100 rp sometimes you just gotta grind that out can we get this guy over here are they do you think they land is separate there are two blues in the center contact with the hostile i damn one is this one one last guy he's got smoke and a nade out there watch out he's not reviving yet he's just healing he started the revive he stopped the revive 2v1 thank god i played nailed that whole squad yeah we got split from that gas i couldn't shoot the corsi through that gas man it was just impossible okay is he gonna revive or not if i don't get like this is mental come on what am i dealing with here i can't immune them because you can't like go back to that screen to mute i don't know what they were saying anyway they were in spanish let's all celebrate and have a good time i got a celebration that was hilarious man i'm i'm nearly in tears that was that was great i thought he wasn't going to revive and then he did revive whoa this guy's a comedic genius watch my back and now i've got nothing hostile over there faster faster faster one i thought i could do an octane then i thought wait has knocked out my team i was like wait no his footsteps are too loud nice so is so high ground now the enemies are shooting at me yes giving my shields a recharge yeah the guy the bow is slightly annoying i don't have any med kits i only got four syringes we've got an assist on that guy too six kb oh man all right great not in the worst spot ever can we take the rope here replicator let's go this way i reckon they went i'm in the thick of it here where did this bangalore come from the annoying thing is my teammates weren't that far behind i could have just stayed back there oh my god i'm back i didn't expect this to happen machines myself they're dropping i down believe i'm standing still the enemies are shooting at me arcstar out hostile spotted give me a sec recharging shield blue armor as well even if this is just a purple armor wait i think i see a purple armor on that please be good using grapple piece of purple armor someone's using a shotgun might need that okay we're back i really didn't think i was gonna get a respawn from these guys you know i don't think that was gonna happen where is my dj give me the dj don't worry about me i'm looted i don't even know if you want to go in there it'd be hard to get out again i can hear there are footsteps i can hear right locking position here okay i'm coming here already in the ring forget i said anything contact with hostile i think he was doing that to to make it so i didn't try and get the care package but i wasn't trying to get it anyway like i got this one i'm fine with the spitfire in a car like i'm sorted i just need shields like i think he thought i was really trying to get that care package from them what's all the things man i forget i said anything oh look someone wandered into our safe space there we go peace and quiet i'll know if someone's come behind because they'll start shooting why did they disconnect what's going on no they're still there he's just punching his mates boy recharging shields got the banner what do you mean got the banner she was only down wasn't did she die in the zone that sucks it's kind of funny but it sucks so i'd very much like to win this game what is this fault again good grief there we go uh might won the two times i'm down to stick it opening fire on the enemy recharging shields faster faster faster okay thank you she's kind of nasty i killed the solo just against them this guy does not strike back into cover giving my shields a recharge that like when you usually when you shoot someone like that they strafe a little bit closer to cover so they can pop back into it this guy's like no he refuses to do so need to the thing is we need to smoke someone we need to isolate someone with the smoke and then go through the ones that's all we need to do but it's hard to convey that to my team are we safe behind this like do we want to be here [Music] against no i can't finish him somebody made his misery i felt bad that it was one guy the guy needed actually destroyed us don't shoot his box oh you're not man i cannot believe we won that game i cannot believe it that was like a 1v2 at the end i'm not sure if the bangalore had like i don't know if she had anything she had a blue armor but the guy was landing shots i thought it was at least two people like yeah no no problem guys no problem okay
