hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the hammer point p2020 this is the only reason to ever use this gun it's if you find hammer points off spawn and this is also one of the reasons i enjoy running with the team at the moment as well is because it allows me to use different weapon combinations without just throwing the game entirely also my g field code is 30 off at the moment if you'd like to grab yourself a tub of tropical rain which is proven by me to be the best and most refreshing flavor uh then you can follow the link in the description my code is item that's 30 off but yes thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh god i'm not making it oh my god there's so many people going to this door i'm lying at the door with you good luck have fun i said we might never feel i'm delicious going straight in here they didn't actually come to the door attention first blood huh first blood and it's nice excuse me thank you they're both one they're both one so far oh you're gonna regret it so if anyone needs one and i have no shield cells sick i don't have any cells i do have one bad though um anyone got a med kit uh yes yes thank you oh okay take them both i will i need regular you guys attachments let me know what you're looking for man uh yeah megan uh classic where's dj honestly i've kind of been getting into the digi i grew up here i think okay there's a lifeline of talk with it wingman i don't know if she helped everything by the way let's jump rich i hit him three times with my wing man nice man who are you trying to bamboozle stop it i need a sight on this scale i can't hit anything that's like oh oh they're both on me oh nice oh boy no i'm defense uh shields possibly i think some extended line max but apart from that i'm good going crazy another fight on the side i think this team is going to back up into here i'm going to try to shoot them in the back you damn want me that i killed them i don't know i gotta call the crossfire he shot me he was aiming at the other guy and he accidentally hit me charging i'm going all the way around oh your armor please friends where'd she go oh nice oh they're they're dead well that backfired i was gonna punch you off the box and then yeah [Laughter] it would have sealed the deal real pleasantly should we need some shield cells oh oh you got a few of those huh yeah all right now we were on route to go to the vault shall we keep here it's it doesn't get old it doesn't get old oh my god it's just crazy i use my grappling to that so smooth yeah i wish i had mobility yeah you can we smoke right i swear you run through smoke that fast level three like your own smoke yeah i think if you smoke does that not happen was that just a suggestion that i've got mixed up it might have just been a suggestion i don't think that's a thing it's definitely not a thing at least i've never heard of that being a thing i think i might have just misheard it yeah i heard a suggestion fragment that would be a sick thing though just imagine if you you oh there's a guy in front of me oh he grappled real quick i got sniped he's low shield oh my god dude my gun was just hitting every bullet i literally just selected my healable with my face i was holding square selecting my phoenix skin i had to use my chin to push up on the armpit right thumbstick and i wasn't even looking at my screen i was just like holding left i'm looking at my computer and there was a pathfinder looking at me that entire time i don't know what he was looking at oh look at this beautiful three rope combo and then when we're at the end ark and four rope big rotation here we go we're gonna go on a train stay over here every time he's on the res beacon i know rigged them twice is that him dead hit him once oh he shot me out of the air he's going to take my pad probably actually i aim once him once again my heroes charging up my shields what am i doing i don't have a close range gun i'm a lunatic i'm actually so street reloading we killed the last viewers good work team if they're stupid and if you're stupid and they're dead then what does that make you mean for him i think he might go confuse that drink 30 seconds remain the ring is nearby i've got an idea to give so far a bit more mobility i can phone around just punch in just kick in the kicking double time real quick that was actually a thing only those friendly fire just for that specific reason it was a friendly phone call oh yeah there was i'm a fan of friendly fire yeah me too um i am and then i'm not i guess it depends on the game in blackout there was and if you died you couldn't respawn so like it was it's kind of sometimes yeah yeah little wiener's grief in your game i feel like fortnight needed uh um friendly fire i feel like that was one game that needed it especially because you'd have those times where people just be shooting like uh like explosives at you fighting your teammate i have a feeling yeah they they did it they did at the very start and then i think i don't know they got rid of it really quick i think i loved it dude i loved it back in the day when nobody knew how to build yeah oh yeah when it was just pure everyone was just terrible just god-awful at the game yeah it was nice wasn't it that's a care pack hold up it didn't even matter if you had gun skill at that game literally just such a weird game dude this was fun you know i mean the aim is so stupid yeah he missed this was crazy i hated it they just nerfed it didn't they yeah really hard devotion see it's like i don't know what else to say here boys i haven't opened a pack for you i gotta open one maybe maybe uh maybe i got the juice like how many times have i opened a pack today and not gotten anything worth it yeah oh uh pack just landed over there i hate people finding it fine somewhere uh 20. i've got four can i have like two shields just in case i missed one ah i wish i had mobility get fried oh they're right here i'm a point yes thank god you did that i was trying to use a finishing move that's purple evil on that one guy on the bangalore oh thank you hold on leave him leave him leave him leave him great the ring is closed where you going oh god this has a silent evo how is that there over this way oh god wait that's illegal i see him back to it he's down though oh my god but i'm sure i've got to take his shield off sometimes only one other squad left bro i'm just having so much fun bouncing around this is one character it's not getting old this guy didn't even have any cells he was carrying bats that guy was made of it you know when they use revenant knots i thought if i use hammer points this is a genius tactic and i'm just heating for 12. no it's okay yeah it should it should why doesn't that work that's so weird it definitely should shield us exactly especially right now with the rev or with uh with the meta or um hammer points would be so good yeah big deal i don't know why it doesn't all right so far look what's happening right in front of us here is this it oh i got i got i ha i have the juice give it to me okay this is that's what you gotta do this is what you gotta do if there is a time for me to get a craver it is now when there's only one team left favorite craver crater crabber one two three yeah oh god over here that's a craver oh does jenks win those poor guy movement wins gunfights just like that um octane maybe hello octane oh he has a doctrine of the blue hey hey there you go rest in peace poor little fella points are so fun bro i'm i'm having a blast i started playing octane vibes completely flip-flop for me sometimes you
