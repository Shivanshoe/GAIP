hey wassup guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex and legends of course and we have playing some lifeline today now life loan is in a fleet of the weed spot at the moment because I'm on one hand she's been indirectly buffed to be the nerf to the fast healed gold body shield by the other hand two of the legends have had their revives buffed the obvious one is Mirage Returns himself and his teammates invisible while surviving which is outrageous to say the least and caustic whose gas no longer negatively affects his teammates there is no disadvantage to gas and gates in entire building and reviving your teammate untouched even Gibraltar has a better revive in my flame and that's important to note because that's sort of what she's supposed to be no no I'm going in on life line a little bit too much here but I never liked it so much to begin with because there were easy ways to add class her fast heal what passive by just having a gold bag or more recently the gold shield but that isn't a problem named sand as they removed this book another benefit to her this season in fact even how long her ultimate core nannies she benefits greatly from the charge stations you can top your team or purple shields in many different locations now well that's what I mean when I say what she's in like a weed spy moment she's been indirectly buffed but she's been slowly getting outclassed by others in in different areas one thing is for certain though her passive 25% faster heals makes her so much fun to play she can excel now with both the red Evo and the gold shields as well and had a lot of fun planar today for these gameplay so hopefully you like it if you do it's your teeth the subscribe button to join the i-10 find RC ball in five my half seconds my friends unfortunately absolutely nobody has decided to land here with me which is a complete shame because I thought this area was going to be the new school town I thought I had the potential when season five dropped just because it's Ryan the edge of the map just like a school town was there was a new area people are gonna be interested in the loop here interesting how the the fight fires going apparently nobody cares no is a bit of shame however I mean this was at the end of the the dropship cycle you know you know when people are dying in the feed before you've dropped then you're not really a hot drop the charge station it's not a chance I can get up that rope it's just too loud my teammates cycling so as long as he keeps his distance and maybe distracts them in Lobby oh my god to get a fight huh love is heliport as this is 1v1 name friend okay I'm gonna have to use a finishing move best thing to do when they're invisible I need your Blue Shield's stand Oh max what a beautiful bin loot this guy had don't don't leave teammate listen have some faith French I'm coming for you this is gonna challenge whatsoever does he care about his teammate that's the question okay singing team I can you straight away you've been incredibly patient and I don't know how to make you watch me loose when you could be looting alongside me which makes people leave a lot of the time I'd rather have a teammate to be fair if there are more people here obviously I'd lose but I think we're fine I thought if you saw what I did there took one shot pugs back into cover because what a lot of people do is they just don't stop firing they think you're gonna reapeaks right away and as soon as you realize they've continuously fired you putt back out cuz then they need to reload or change weapon ever ready to do unscathed really it's not like a 72 damage not too bad we're back in the action feeling good I'm feeling positive about this oh this is the tier 110 wingman skin by the way honestly I don't think is as good as the T 101 the only reason I'm using it is because it's somewhat new and even fewer people have this than the T 100 skin so I guess it's rare I literally nearly do to myself off the edge here by the way she's a good job I check the map you've gotta check a map before you hop over those fences the amount of people I've seen just completely I don't know just throwing themselves off the edge where that realize and what's going on I've done I don't like this by the way teammate I want to find an ex scrap and loot is actually pretty good okay my team that hasn't healed himself up yet but I'm hoping he's got some shield cells and they're only 28 other people left other reason I play lifeline by the way is that she's actually feeling pretty good at the moments with the nerves to the gold shields and I definitely consider it a nurse that dog shield was completely out of pad beforehand it was a shame because the iPhone has one of the best passes in the game where hop they just use this I'll try and get some parmesan but if you had the God shield it were completely nullified one of the best passives in the game on lifeline and she wasn't too useful variety I mean officer she's got how much people arrived and all that kind of stuff the characters provide faster than life lane but now that they've got rid of the fast hills passive on the gold shields and lifeline can run around with gold shields and feel good about it just like a Disney character and also these charged atoms are extremely useful for life length because they're ultimately so slow my teammates got purple and this one landed on my forehead did they see me that's the question you know what I don't think they would see me I'll tell how close you are team it but I'm fun no they're coming towards me they may not have seen me but they probably heard me teammates are hit hey careful teammate look top and they're looking a major high ground on us see unfortunately white shields again for party t my we should just richard is running our cheese dome was getting there it's popping off with a single fire hemlock someone's got a massive as well which is not good that no wreck hit this guy might be dead good news is he can't grapple for the next half century so we should be able to catch up with me especially that you might be closer I'm trying to bamboozle what's here nice job teammate beautiful sir all right that was beautiful those guys helped us out so much there we were getting gate caps didn't have as good shields us but doesn't really matter when you've got a g7 scale you know SATs on high ground like this they can just choose when to engage it's very difficult for us to even heat them but these guys did us a solid there's the massive favor I'd say oh it's a very much a pretty obvious use artery he's one of the ones that is popping off there's someone here I don't know if this is a fourth party was this guy trying to get his friends banner but there is definitely someone over hoping there's a chance that this is one guy coming over for Archie's banners I think Archer was that was the third party can you die please one of them is one shot and I hit the other one on Blue Shield's nice I genuinely think he might be one of the best characters on the game Lois wait I've got a doc heal here you go this is what happens but I don't play cards that often like I'm switching somewhat recently I use clover though I just forget what abilities they have don't be surprised if that's the only duck here like I remember to use this entire game I'm just game Mike's new surname I've been playing a lot of characters recently and in the heat of battle you don't just shoot people there's a scrap someone described this is in the distance - the good news is there is a distance closing balloon yeah I don't know where it is all right let's go that way only started you brought a map this guy means business it's absolutely kicking off he's cooking there's no fear cooking you take you out of the team I think they must have don't whine there are two more teams here that's not even at us that's light oh they sold me that soap set sounds close to so yeah I have 9 batteries it mazey utility for 50 health ok it's cost about every grave in the book ok those guys are fighting - I'm not I'm actually not is that is that or are there even any score pieces on this map whatsoever the sad news is they nerf the wingman if you don't have the Scorpius run it because the the headshot multiplies lower but it's higher if you have the wingman it's of a weird sort of situation by 55s back last mistake she doesn't know yet no she does for Marcel silo boots so tough sometimes such a telegraphed teleport rains 90 our nose has no erector and the ROG decoy bamboozled please sir please back on my word what do you know I'm ready to pierce some scores now with two of the squads left it's taken me at least on to find in people are grabbing of that makes a lot of sense if I have ups and they have high ground and we have to push past them we have to try and damage them so they have to heal every time I hit them on by myself some more time here hila what you do you're not gonna now line the shop friend come on if you're gonna sit up there with a have a chronic gatekeepers you're gonna try and connect me some bullets come on friend I mean I'm peppered him up I've been a little bit toxic but should be fine I we need to know what the other last squad is because we don't want to get fell apart adhere my 5 shield batteries more than her for two squads left I would think 25% faster heals with a red evil shield as well he's gonna sound so much where we score peace right so the hood souped-up Kramer after they don't got the he'll have you know Hayes on so we need to we need to go up the hill let's go this way reason being that other team has to come that direction to or probably ball so if we get up top here while we get high ground on this team but to we stop with third party these guys gonna be the one that gets pinched she's weak no okay these guys spent all way around gravity okay my fault I actually landed on top of the rock so my aim is like three feet of booking the whole time I thought I was lower than that they still I'm not so concerned about they have blue shields and they keep running they're not someone is it just me reach visibility harder I like the way that made the map look no long range I find it difficult to spot people careful that's a crater by since when is a headshot with a scorpion wingman 79 damage it's got two purple helmets on this man and they're gonna try that and a long but I very much down to the same person so I rotate that's not good I am absolutely nowhere near that that's an absolute travesty that's a modern-day tragedy right there I had no idea the radius would be Reverend Sophie oh my god that's a drawing line to shot yeah it'll be revenant with your massive silence that you can just love on the floor nice job teammate are we played that perfectly' acquisition there it was absolutely it was pristine it was absolutely stupendous 17 total weight IT 3,100 term each when when did I through three thousand one inch damage my dream I don't know I D without noise by the way well that's mine drumsticks don't mention in the background I think he must be I was kind of farm a bit of damage on those people again I wasn't I wasn't meaning to they they had to push us you know we had the high ground there's no reason to push them product lead an extra sort 304 into damage but even so I could have dropped in a before K I've already got the fork a batch for lifeline but if I know I was that close I could have I don't know I don't know what I would have done different to be they don't talk men thanks for watching her I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next [Music]
