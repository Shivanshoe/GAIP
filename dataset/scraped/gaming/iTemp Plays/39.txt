hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing a broken legend and when i say broken i don't mean you gotta rush out and play this particular character because it's three wins i mean actually broken i did a video a few days ago and i was playing loba and i noticed that her bracelet was busted yet again i don't know how this happens it was broken onwards edge for what felt like months sometime in 2021 and you can tell that this is just a coding headache for respawn entertainment at this point just something about the way her bracelet works really messes with the game now i'm not a game designer so i don't know what i'm talking about but it happens all the time so it must be a problem fortunately in the video today the bracelet worked every time i called upon it so i do think they hotfixed it but i still throw it and half expect it not to work and it made me wonder if respawn should just sit down and rework her q into something else does loba need the mobility i don't think she does i mean it is a shame because it really fits her law and her backstory and the stories from the outlands that we had when she came out as well but it's not the best ability and it's busted half the time let me know if you guys have any ideas for mixing it up with her q i'd love to hear your ideas thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds maybe goes sorry i'm here hello controller there we go god it's busted i mean the good news is i've got four bins just what i needed i was looking for a pk that's actually the reason i'm playing lobo so trying to waste my time could have been playing path okay at least i won't run out of ammo i can actually find a shotgun bolt perhaps nothing worse than running a shotgun with no shotgun bot an egs i forgot how much health our shields have okay 70 damage didn't miss a shot i didn't need to run away i mean i hit him for 92 i could have stayed there it's okay i got one down the other two are messed up i'm kind of messed up there you go where's the other one gone was that one shield cell that's corner depressing hold on okay i have no kills here somehow they are underneath the rampart hello can i have any shield i don't have any shells i tried i mean that's the kind of thing that'll get us third-party and killed you know i should have just popped on a few shield cells instead of he said i'm messing about thank you watson and i did land a decent amount of damage with the punt shotgun there we go that's the kind of decision making where you get third party and you think why did i push that with no shield and you'll just die another enthusiast that gonna work oh i'd hoped it was gonna glitch out so there are two that that way there could be one behind me here but i hit the low bar enough we'll just try and get these guys out here pat on them i'm actually using shields this time don't worry this is one of those engagements where you think if my graphic settings were lower would i have an advantage because the foliage wouldn't be there you know does the grass disappear if you're on low settings i i'm not sure how it works if he does it it's a humongous scam i feel good about this care package shall we enemy here here we go round three tossing thermite tossing an that's why i don't like arcs i love them in the air and they are completely pointless i'm never going to stick anyone like that i don't like stars that could easily just kill me from it you know your strafe is way too quick see if there's any in these buildings i'm lucky mate 12 although to be fair i think he took some okay not bad not bad i didn't expect that long spot to have so many people around i never landed personally but you know i'd rate that like a seven and a half out of 10 drop there's someone here yes jump driving position get the high ground let's go see if i was too busted that was so greedy i should have just dropped and batted that's two down quick raise perhaps you can stick it if you've got a sticker you should stick it you're lucky i like you okay come on come on come on recharging my shields all right i've been down three times this game if i go down once more it's officially categorized as an absolute embarrassment so the only way i'm going down here is if we all die and we get squad white i can't be revived again i feel like i'm dragging the team down here just some stupid decisions that's all two showbacks there we go that's the nice thing about loba getting shocked those those little attachments that you need extending mags shotgun bolts that's so necessary otherwise the gun just kind of sucks jump drive in position replicator incoming yes there are only four of the squads this could be two but it could be more than two squads that is obviously more than two people and i don't think they're selling cookies we hate to scrap [Music] you don't realize how fast bangalore is until you try and fight one is the bangalore dead hello i mean i'm pretty sure your teammates fighting right behind you but you can look at me if you want tossing thermite recharging he's still looking i mean to be fair there's no shooting going on anymore maybe they kill that guy and there are people up the hill recharging my shield do you reckon i can reach up top with a logo bracelet absolutely not come on come on let's go run someone's out there they're far this team's not pushing recharging oh he respawned okay get a little bit desperate for the damn there but i don't care have my braces still up i could have just taken the port to be honest dude oh god i suck him over here that's the guy that's got respawned probably got nothing poor guy let's go here why haven't you the team up the hill are we getting further yet oh my god i suck just punch if you can't add your shots to start boxing to start throwing hands honestly it's way more consistent dps than me trying to land a shot with the pk oh god it's a fuse please leave me alone uh okay i have two syringes i'm gonna have to go back i need help give me a second oh please don't say you can see this i think i'm okay no challenge i've done 30 damage making uh definitely wouldn't have survived a medkit i don't think perhaps i would have don't want to take the risk low becoming closer to the ultimate and to be fair we might go and enter around here with my bracelet working i didn't i don't know if they patched it it would have been so because it hasn't it hasn't been broken today you have zero shotgun ammo activating jump driver me amigos let me heal up and i gotcha where is he just a solo fuse there's no way it's just him i thought i shot a blue tank i bet we'll find something good here there's nine mercy only the best for my friends mozambique honestly khan attempting to switch out the pka is this worth risking my life for a gold helmet yeah i'm fine don't drive out i see someone over there big scrap oh wait they're probably shooting robots that's two people right that's there's a pecan in our knife what did the robot shoot does the robot shoot guns i can't remember is that a beacon i don't know i've seen the trip sorry the trip i've seen the trick you can do with the car hello friend is that the bloodhound i shot so this isn't the fuse team could just be one guy i've seen the trick that you can do with the car but i mean i don't want to go into the third zone or fourth zone whatever this is i'll probably die kind of pointless lucky us i'm gonna spook him out make him think we're respawning they want to come out sooner oh you got yourself there welcome to the shop we'll go back back here in the bag level four only the best smart loot what do you mean i'm a loba i'm a professional thief if i can't steal their loot what am i no that that was me they're covered in i mean they might use to be honest they might smart are you telling me i can steal from a vault a vault but i can't steal from some some robots well aren't you impressive i might have to add you to my collection that was lovely let's do it again sometime this guy's not moving the good news is we're safe up here and it's actually a decent bit of high ground here we go you've done one nice unfortunately i've set the place on fire this guy seems to be avoiding it okay get involved are we pushing this is okay get me back in here somehow we have switched positions with this guy now we're the ones being camped oh look it's this blood out it's all good positioning on this but i can tap straight there there we go 36 right to his shin bone i think he might just be the fuse and if you take the gravity cannon you're going to die 23. i mean there's no way that doesn't take you into the zone look how far you're going look here was that my peak at no i think you died in the zone we have 45 seconds recharging my shields watches to sell a fuse no no he had a team i didn't gg well played amigos i went down three times that game each one of them was 100 avoidable champions but it's okay my squad weights were there we actually got a good amount of damage with a ton of gunfights towards the end of that game 18 total kills 2500 damage i will take it gg's me migos i was the only guy to get knocked kind of embarrassing but it's okay we did our best that was a fun game
