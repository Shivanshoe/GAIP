hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are using the prowler because we unlocked the tier 110 battlecast skin for it which is reactive and we need more skins like this in apex available for purchase now you guys know that i don't cover leaks on the channel but this doesn't really spoil anything there were rumors circulating around the community that a new rarity of skin was coming to apex above goal so hopefully that means we get to see more reactive skins like this one there are so many things that they could do with it imagine a reactive sniper skin that is triggered by headshots it would just be amazing so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm up there i'm up there with the best okay yeah there's like nine beans around here just yeah any trouble where i pinged i don't know i'm lining up those okay i've got a vault um

up close yeah yeah well one of those i'm ready right nearly cracked i'm just trying to describe them inside popping about yeah for a little about octane a little bit more he was getting banned bless him he was i think he's trying to arm his teammate but getting banner just oh yeah that's the worst dude the pk actually feels good now really what yeah have you not used it either no yeah it actually feels good now it's crazy i think this is my first time actually using it i've used it to start with like no bolts but no shotgun it feels good no belts you know what if they're like trying to follow us every time they hear a street and we just i was getting tired of walking just running in circles oh god gonna throw up i'm actually gonna throw up wait i bet you they were i bet you they were following us maybe all that he's safe there too oh god this is my recharging shield this is the boat i've seen shots so far i have a prowler and a vault oh no i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die oh recharging field i said it right too much too much oh that's kind of a waste that was a huge waste oh god never mind she means chances they drop on me minimal i might get an angle in one second it might drop on me no my ultimate's bad i still up there i don't think you can go up here without a rope it doesn't go all the way up top oh no teammate drop there they're gonna drop on him did they drop never mind he's one hp i just assumed i'm one just thinking he's just focused he's in the hyper focus over here give me spawn oh there's three i thought it was like yeah uh nor did i but i wasn't looking i was so distracted i was i was looking and i didn't see anything i have priority 45 this might be tough i've triple take uh fly line nike probably you know i don't know i have a flat line i have a 30 30. huge they're on it almost program 69 that's two teams here i'm watching the finder is broken yeah i'm twenty-eight i'm needing uh actually spawn yeah getting shot by the other team i'm behind me there's so many people here i have to go get cells um our heels for my you good i'm nothing i'm gonna try and get a phoenix phoenix oh nice don't mind if i do okay wait what did i get the best prizes present company including what did you get oh no i got a bat okay i'm not gonna leave you for a second oh my god i don't know pretty far um there's one there like an alt they're going up top you can ultimately spawn he's being patient yeah i don't even know where to go from like this side of the map anyways nice imagine he's just like roasting us you know he might be these aircraft he said uh at the start he said uh ping where you're going right oh my god oh god i'm landing up top on my tongue oh it's forced me down mate on me there's three of them don't drive from safe are you good yeah i'm good um i think i can recharging shields i mean that wastes their course to call that's good news i'm thinking i'm sticking around okay five lines up there just charge that up i don't i don't like that nice job and the other one's broken down she did it oh boys yeah i'm using it three times on my arthro-1 it's not the worst it's just kind of kind of weird sometimes on controllers yeah it is worse though if they're far away i mean obviously if they're far away it helps but if they're close you literally can't move your own quick enough uh it's my nerd voice well why it's because i'm i sound nothing like a there's a guy for me by the way i say nothing like a nerd so when i do that you know what i'm trying to do you know i completely understand you know the vibe for claire that's the sentence where are they he took the rope left to right okay he's pretty slow he slid all the way down the hill he's a slider hold on i need to heal the team are so low i just saw one but he he went he's gone and let him live he was so far away by the time i got over this hill there's a ton of teams over there like when we were originally fighting kind of sucks that we had to leave but worked out yeah it's all good saw 24 people left regress it's just so loud just for nothing there's no reason just loud sounds just like other things too yeah it sounds like everything in the game sounds like a spawn that was zero seconds ago uh where even is that oh right right down here right not too far i have alt but we might as well just slide down this hill is this going to take us too far pretty well right doesn't matter taking it got a better idea yeah they're here they're right on either side of it he's going to maybe take pad up out west anyone on the left oh god yeah he poured it into another team like up the hill yeah i see him oh my god just cracks on you oh that's not you nice i will give you this one guy who's the right that was the original raid that was running a noise that's actually pretty fun yeah this loadout so much fun i don't have to like risk anything i just stay behind safety and just shoot at everybody is it triple take 33 yeah i'm using two marksmen right okay so good actually so good on this map yeah you don't have to leave cover well that says zero second i was it's the death box that yeah we cut them i think why'd it say 0 seconds then that's a scam is any energy some energies uh there's a low broth like here we could cruise them oh yeah who decided this i think yeah there is delivery oh there's another one over this way there's two then i got the gold bag because i'm a good guy you know nice energy ammo here i think somebody may have just taken that that gravity on the other side of this uh i saw one for sure kill leader lifeline 18 kills do you have 18 kills are you serious no no i don't that has to be a glitch he's farming no i'm not killing you i have eight i thought inside of this oh yeah okay well i know be careful there might be a demon team one two oh my god there's one team left and he's probably the lifeline with 18 kills oh god oh god oh what the broken thanks she's dumb she's not there's no way she has eaten kills that must have been a visual glitch or something is that cracked oh let's go there's no way she had 18 kills i think it was a glitch yeah she was uh she stood still and shot about 18 uh bullets and just in the open it could have been someone that died already because it's not necessarily something that's already like still alive right it had to have been a bug that's so many people like and they were still they're still decent like a lobby oh bed oh that was actually so much fun did we use one velcro oh yeah we did yeah we did how dare you
