I was a guy touch which welcome back to the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are back once again playing Lobo this is only my second game on Lobo on console and my first time finding that the gold is speak fire this thing used to be my favorite gun on the game until they nerfed into oblivion the issue with this before is that at close range it just can't kill as quickly as a peacekeeper that's a care package weapon now as a mass t4 they are not annoying and you just sat there sprained your just sprained you holding down the trigger waiting for them to drop it takes ages but I do like finding god ones because it forces me to use a different kind of weapon that I wouldn't usually pick up I still think that the gold guns should have some sort of fact he doesn't necessarily have to be a better version of the weapon why he was a cosmetic difference where even shot like a fireball imagine that modernist Spitfire firing a fireball if it was a legendary one base but when you killed someone they turn into like a shadow and they just melted I don't know something crazy I'm just throwing ideas around but I hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching it please please please hit the subscribe button if you haven't already I can't even bed Salus but we are kind of behind it getting quotes from close to a million gain close to 900,000 and then as soon as we hit 900 we're on the road and my friends on the road so thanks watching I'll see you only five and a half seconds my friends marketís me amigos this isn't by far the best place a job on a try job market always come at the side door got myself a public said live make it just come in the same room as me Frank why not take the only good I'm defenseless now I got nothing alternate that all right I'm not so much anymore alternating with a perfect headline that they increase them out but it's if these two goons actually I've got the RF we fight as well increase the ammo capacity of each one given the chimney friend give me a second as well are you got chase traced that's my bad that was the apex predator landed with us and I believe that is everyone but even landed here I'll look the person with you've got your leader had a havoc I know I've got one there's a very good reason for that I'd like to wage that 50% of people don't kill me during the start actually I did get a sure battery land on a hover because it's it's pretty much a gold gun right from the get-go and I will drop mine when I get a decent backup gun here don't worry you could I'm sure it's nice see some syringes for you should take you up to fall I spice Mikey wasn't more popping off now which said one solo apex predator for some reason looking for a massive okay so a respawn outside got some free kills a friend to at least one freak girl not sure about you the guy could have gone chills Bryner oh and you've got Ark starred as well a beautiful tiny why are you going you nearly got directly impacted by a migraine like this guy didn't have any decently whatsoever oh you've reached mourning someone and you don't have any good lit yourself I do look at that respawn all right another respawn going on we're just gonna keep farming these people to keep dropping from the sky here that's the plan defenseless people yes it's demon doctor oh now you may cause I didn't mean to I was just shooting I realize use one shot my deepest apologies that's what that's the trade-off for a skinning my parents die the game the same room for some reason it's all worth tank you know let me try and switch out these happen what did you have L do Mastiff we need to try this out a little bit more 10 seconds until the ring closes grab what you need and let's go soon as least an opposite be a care package weapon just like well I should do a video where I use only weapons that used to be care package weapons I believe there are only two right it something else on the Mastiff [Music] I'd be supreme and I'm still yet to find an actual peacekeeper in a care package I need to open more of those as well that's my plan for content in the coming days all right rice heavies now the team lead it off you runs I'd rather try and say close because I've got a decent motive early game kills here there's still 30 people at which is a good amount I need 39 damage to rank up to purple shield so if we get there then we're absolute laughing you got blue shield now we got off on the wrong foot here but we can we can make amends I feel good about this care package shall we another one of these I assume using a light ammunition gun because most people do eyelets 9 are 301 if he's not gonna have a wingman potentially enemy here that was a new stomping about what the TV maybe was you stomping about I've been bamboozled by my own teammate here here we go if you are indeed you doing man this is what you'll need here what's cool piece of oil for my friends you've made a men's name for you I think we did get off on the wrong foot you know there's a bit of tension going on about to me more tension going on because there's a lumber brace the thing around the place recklessly over batter a ruin her day I'm really trying to be disciplined with my guard over this way with my bracelet because it's not as aggressive as I thought it was going to be and it makes her like oh my word he's a gold gun give me that Rafa thank you very much no what I wanna make a separate video right focus on the mastic give it a proper review so for now even though this is probably suboptimal I'm gonna rock the r31 alongside the speak fine to fair though the are thrown is better a long range done this be fine they sing he's lacking in us in in the close range and long range departs makes you just medium range to careful friend Wayne for me to push the second Navy yeah I heard you the arcs are back now hold on just yet okay I've been massive in the Chilton doesn't that make it harder for us to push him do we leave this alone or do we go in I feel like I haven't heard anyone else fire so if you're looking for a scrap I think this is our best bet to be risky though are you going in how could you sorry listen did a good amount down except one first one I saw it start again I'm not trying to I'm Richard I'm not trying to steal these I'm shooting and whatever happens happens that's the philosophy I'm going with you okay oh I'm surprised miss like that Russian a team in there to begin with is extremely risky and then getting third party by oxides when they are looting it's also a bit yes this my actually that's at one time sage  right going it's beautiful are you been booted up night now our best friends look at this we're dropping amaz well pinking school peace of rooms everything this ultimate is so good because it doesn't matter it's down lower above you'd like verticality doesn't matter at all so this is also in range of that stressing me I choose him what to what to actually get though actually stresses me out like sevens a bit excessive I'm not sure you have anyone near seven heavy rains near the party somewhere all right let's get out of here I don't want diving board I don't like seeing down low in diving board unless on my course do you I suppose but even then that's boring I guess now the play is to sit here like decorative gargoyles until we see something interesting going on and then we just join in on the interesting thing that he's going on I'm already thinking that the Spitfire this is the the first time the Spitfire has been thought indeed I thought I've got room but remember if it had been gold before because the honour to know him hasn't and we've thought that it was going to be I don't hear this before has the art fair one has twice okay nicely almost my ability if I'm not mistaken this is actually the first time that we've had a Goldust before you know regs there it's alright go a week anyway I'm here find it maybe I was wrong honestly most range to be fired actually free phone is all you have to do is hold down the fire button that's read the golf one come to the public sending I don't even have to where are you good to go yeah I I have six your batteries I don't really need the cells much especially with a ready bow it's not really that necessary my speed is terrible lighting what is pitch black coffee so it's not the time to be inspecting my god to be fire anyway what we're hoping for from this care package French up what are you doing with level one shields essentially did you just pick up an Evo shields that's where you hadn't evil shield before I'll have to play a little bit more defensive I think after this gold children game so switch out the IVA wears a pink oh oh okay what they send so close oh okay I'm good what did I send so close their party chased me now you might follow me as well this team I believe you to start on top diving board we should be able to climb up this challenge careful how can I help you what does heal myself pay for the two teams to find something containment these are the last three teams she knows e scanning poor friends I for shield batches that I've enough ammo there is nothing in there that I could possibly want unless it's a peacekeeper but I've already left it behind Dale Talde you have mined back my leg straps why they seem so pitiful what's going on here it's like a person in every corner he lost this team person member of the team they wrap around and actually engage in the scrap again or is this just their teammate that's going on a solo mission I can't work it out reloading such a long Cobain I've got you we've got a minute until the ring closes yeah I understand 45 seconds until the ring closes we've got time but not much ain't they dead Tommy if I didn't get a refined let's do the last team I think he might be two solos neighs okay okay this is the system of large or was it the freight a rake ran off to the right when I feel like I'm a large escape during that engagement to get that escape we just need to brush these together the con take us both out it's fine since you don't go down for fine this is the time really I believe to say my teammates to everyone Oh scary all right there we go that was a frisky bracelet right there at the end fortunately she was sticking a shield battery because if she would if she was preemie where I was gonna teleport so I my opinion those good men I feel out what teaming switch next like 14 different Evo's I feel like he he left a trail of purple or gold Evo's I started purple or red Evo's the entire time 13 kills 2322 I did steal a few kills there let's be honest there well into over a thousand more damage but a thousand damage doesn't equate to 10 kills no I wasn't trying to I wasn't trying to stalk I was just shooting that's what I was doing god speed fire actually did some work there that's the first goal to go and why it's not the first one I found but it's the first one I probably had a decent game with in season 5 so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one mm-hmm
