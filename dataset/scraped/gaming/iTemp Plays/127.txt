hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and we are using a setup today that i'm trying my best to not use in every single game that i post on the channel it is the wingman massive combination i don't use it in the first game that i have for you today but i do use it in the second one and i used it in the first game of the corsic video i did recently as well there's just something about this setup i've been absolutely popping off with the wingman recently and the mastiff is so incredibly good if you are down in numbers against an enemy squad and i'm trying to mix up every legend that i'm playing here so we're playing horizon now i'm okay with horizon's q but i don't think i've thrown an effective horizon ultimate since she came out i'm so bad at using karate thank you for watching though guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends no i had no idea i'm back i wait i don't use i don't use premiere pro you don't use uh yeah i use sony vegas thank you man i actually got good luck round one big shooting countdown let's go on there no i think i hurt myself nice job janks oh no there is someone over there i've got gold oh my god nice he went straight down that was two teams i think okay yeah another squads are taken gonna draw there's gerald from burger king oh my god i didn't get my kill credit he's revived someone around here i'm on the outside they're inside on me then one hundred on blood he went straight nice oh you get that i've actually got the kinetics dude nice it's been over a week oh i'm outside i have to charge myself i am good i'm gonna keep to the roof it's an octane he's going out back this way oh he knows he messed up oh he ran mate do you mind dropping one cell i mean i have zero but i've got gold rejuvenation dude i'll drop you a bunch i was gonna look but i didn't have the chance thank you and i have no in my inventory i have 17 heavy bullets and and one syringe or two syringes i have itself still i hear them in there okay i mean i'm horizon you know you could do a little cheeky cue like that you know the vibes i like it when you say that [Laughter] i'm gonna kill this guy first i like the confidence this past week there's no way red there's something i try and help you put these guys on me you got this i barely have any heavy i'm going to try and get to you i'm just going to disengage and just wrap around they're still fighting each other like i'm safe okay i'll come get you it's just a wee scratch deer i have two bats i'll drop you one thank you i'll drop you too thank you rejuvenating a couple cells for you uh i thank you they're respawning behind him oh some random barrage decoy here if we can get close we can queue up yes wait they're pushing down let's go down let's go down for the team though and now he's cracked wally jax bye i might be lied about the crackage it was kind of close though thank you yeah whatever do we yeah but ever do we i need to i just can't stop saying it it's hard not to once you get into the habit of it it's just kind of like you know it rolls off the tongue it honestly it's it's kind of a class saying i do enjoy saying it scuba do was a genius oh yeah dude you're so much better than doctor disrespect you say that about the dog the back to back two times a bit that's called leap how dare you undermine your yay you don't you don't even yeah every day but whenever you bust it out it's just like it's hard to imagine that it comes from your mouth it's crazy i'd like to hear like a like a fusion between yeah yeah and yeah yeah yeah oh my god one day i'm gonna push that eight the fusion yeah it's gonna come out of the left one i'll play maggie and i'll i'll boop someone off the map and i'll say when when the world needed it the most yes hi who are you killed he's got red this path i don't like him trap on you did we shoot someone this way did he kill him this is just him that's sad yeah we got ben just nine times oh no oh god i got booped two can play at this game oh my god it bounced back at me right oh my god jenks i'm sorry i did not need to kill him else i thought you were down though recharging my shields advanced strategies imagine if the watson pylon generator stopped it as it was coming down it just it just killed it just zap it it just happened imagine oh my god now i kind of want to see it i want to see it happen somebody in r3 reloaded or whatever the custom game make it happen as a matter of fact make watson jen just like zap enemies as you get close yeah just poof them if they jump they have to be airborne oh yeah true that's bad but they have to be projectile well if they throw hands just their hands get the deteriorate there's a handler like jamie lannister like jamie lannister you would i haven't watched game of thrones forever and like how did you even think of the name i've been re-watching game of thrones recently he got his hand chopped off and uh in an episode i watched a few nights ago it's a great show bro yeah oh we lived geez we're filling up the hospital today one squad jamie lannister he says oh you didn't say that wait where do we go do you think there needs to be a gold shotgun bolt i don't think it's necessary shotguns are already like so good i think the kinetic fader should have been the gold shotgun bob where it reloads it as you slide it's brad do it actually smart rather than being a hop up yeah yeah cause we got too many hop-ups like low-key i'm cooking them on red i'm gonna old team um a hundred oh i don't even know what i hit that blood out for there's no way he's got health he's probably [ __ ] bad ah no checks i kept getting stuck on the fence the fence be ready newt an enemy land it need us from my drill got it i didn't pick up any shotgun ammo i'm good oh yeah there's people on me on your ground my roof yeah both of them right on the roof hit past a little bit it's half shield nice shot okay [Music] there's no way did you try to thirst me you got a white swap yeah what are we doing here reloading oh don't just run i'm gonna dude he destroyed me with that was that an alternator i think so it's so good at start i think he ran out of ammo that's why he ran off dude he must have hit like all heads on me because he exploded me i died really fast was that situation where you sort of hoped you got first because you want to see the death ray gap ah i mean in a way yeah it kind of was cause like i got exploded i don't know if you saw that i thought that he talked pretty quick yeah he had no ammo lift uh they do be fine inside me close the door shields recharging healing up what's your thoughts on the car i mean it's it's good but just it's so tough to use that's how i feel about it too i started growing on me the more i use it because i feel like i'm getting better but then i'll just like miss half a clip on somebody and i'm like well exactly back back to the r9 yeah or the rna 45 or the alternator they're looking at me he's looking it's the octane bro he's looking at me funny uh i fried that guy really bad oh my god whole enemy squad has been forceable on your feet darling again that guy looking for a mastiff if possible but you are my maggie i've got a pk if you want oh no i'm good i have uh i haven't okay peace keeper here do you need a medication of irony uh yes the ring's closing soon can we get some serious ground together uh yes oh did you see that warzone released redeploy balloons isn't that kind of funny yeah and like think about like fornite didn't have the respawn feature before this game either apex out here innovating everything yep it is dude you know what i was saying this before you know how apex kind of gets stale right yeah if you think about it it got stale when they really stopped throwing a wrench in things it's like they were playing safe they didn't make drastic changes they didn't do nothing crazy but when they started making like all those crazy changes that's when like defects was edited like yeah it felt like it was out of speed i can't say at its peak because it's at its peak now yes but that's when it really felt like it was that it's the gameplay oh my god richard i'm getting pulled yeah you want honestly they really don't like you they don't want to see jenks win are you one for 45 mate i'm gonna hit him with a skynard look up behind you correct them nice reloading you're full knights this gamer him three wingman shots can you watch my back pals evil shields were there the whole time oh they yeah me i think the pad that i took to get away was the pad they took to get up there ah makes sense and to be honest they did a lot of damage on this purple probably just on you to be honest though i got fried i find it difficult to play games there's a reason i don't play multiplayer card there's no risk i need a risk reward i need something on the line i i feel that i'm the same way to feel alive that's why we like tarkov and stuff like that yeah vr i need to lose it all i like yeah tell's a good story too i think stay called it goopy game of brain goofy gamer brain yeah there's people here rich with the wing fighting hail the first two didn't heal this guy was the only one that had a fair gun fight i think they don't have white shield that was pleasant that's why you have to armor switch if you're going to loot the rest of stuff you know even if it's white armor take the armor don't sit there with nothing yep i think this one might have been on the phoenix kit that's just unlucky timing oh tanks there's almost everywhere i want his in particular removed from the data pool [ __ ] we got a runner oh no no no oh my papa bat uh i might die doing this i'm so sorry i thought i was caustic i literally thought i was caustic i've been playing for two hours oh you've just been scammed i'm so sorry oh my god i've never been more disappointed in my life you said you might die i was like no please listen in hindsight maybe you did save my life i don't know maybe i do i do have a feeling that you say it's his life though nothing would have happened you know i was the only character it was horizon that could have stopped you from going through there that was pretty funny that was great i'm sorry mate this is so cute oh they've got to be at the hill i'm not having it i mean this is scrap cave there's a reason it's called scrap cave there you go you see i hear fighting at the hill rich i'm just going to put some traps down brother i have never been more bullied yeah i mean even by your own game yeah not just by the enemies but you too you too no not like no not like well what's he been saying whenever i think of bono i always think of the south park episode where he's just a turd i haven't seen it but he sounds great really i i have never really watched south park but i did do a play through of the stick of truth i think the truth yeah and it was just unbelievable they're so clever it's hilarious the whole idea is that bono needs to be number one in anything but he can never be number one in life because he's actually in number two like he's actually a turd he's just a piece of poop he's a turd oh my god concept is hilarious i mean that's yeah it's genius bro put and we've got about a yeah he didn't even go the same direction he wanted to fly off he flew off the side here on the right down here maybe going to the trump tower i might just take this i don't know is this worth it i don't know if this is worth the jax oh it's worth it listen rich i'm going for a clothesline maneuver where is she on me did she get there she was underground no so close i always i always get scared fighting up bangla 1v1 like that dude they're hard because the speed boost the passive especially with the wingman that's tough she landed her shots open the door could not make the roof oh nice tanks i suffered hi uh wow what the heck was that that was insane once there's a valve so i'm gonna try and get to you i'm gonna beat him to your and i want to watch my death recap i want to see how fast i just died i didn't even miss a shot like that was crazy that guy had to have hit all headshots on me right surely maybe maybe one is a crater where's that giveaway from there's an egg there's an egg behind you behind you behind you behind you behind you rat rat rats i'm cooking them rich i hit him from i hit him a lot you're cooking him i think got him for 11. i think i'll just stop both your kills i don't know what in the race oh my god how did you come out of that alive i really don't know i don't know i've been getting bullied even right until the bitter end i was getting if i wasn't playing horizon that valk has the high ground and manages to kill you i think that's just so lucky i actually want to go back and watch the footage i want to see how fast i died to that valve yeah you had no pressure you had no time to react that's crazy at least my friend rich popped off i mean if they're all shooting you it's a simple job
