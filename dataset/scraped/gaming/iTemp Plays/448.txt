hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today a trailer dropped for the new event coming to apex legends called war games and the reason it's called war games is because five all new limited time modes are coming to the game for two weeks starting on the 13th of april which is this tuesday coming up now the first mode is called shield regen which is fairly self-explanatory your shields regenerate i mean i can't wait to play octane in this mode with his passive health healing as well in fact i would like to do a no heal challenge on this game mode playing octane if you're in a terrible situation you stim away sits in a corner for 20 seconds and then you come back almost fully healed up you'll be looking good the second mode is called killing time which is round time is reduced every time a legend dies now this is something i could see making its way into the regular game mode to some extent because nothing is worse than trying to find the last four people in the first ring it's nearly impossible but in this mode if there are four people left the ring will start moving sooner and the game will be sped up and i think that's a great idea the third mode coming is called auto banners where banners are automatically collected word of advice for this game mode carry around a respawn beacon in your back pocket and just instantly respawn your teammates when they die this mode will be mayhem with all the respawn ships flying around it's another good idea in my opinion and it is something that i could see being worked into the full game but maybe with a few tweaks maybe they'd have to put a wait time on when you can respawn your teammates so they're not just instantly back into the fight the fourth mode is called ultrazone which has three hot zones per match which is a cool idea sometimes the hot drop isn't a hot drop and sometimes the hot drop has 30 people in there and the lobby is dead straight away having three of these will hopefully spread out people uh along the map which will keep more people alive for longer which is always a good thing now the fifth and in my opinion the most exciting mode coming is called second chance where each legend gets a free respawn once per match and it looks like fuse here respawns with his weapons that he died with so you're not going to be coming back scavenging for loot with nothing you are ready to fight and this is definitely the mode that i am looking forward to the most it'll equate to so many more gunfights in the game which is always fun now the thing that i've realized with these modes is that they're all trying to address the problem that apex has in public games at the moment which uh it's if everyone dies first ring and then the game is dead for six or seven minutes whilst the last few teams try and find each other now respawn have a track record of implementing changes from the ltms like this into public games in the future so hopefully something sticks and it's healthy for the game so we will see let me know in the comments which one of these you are most excited for and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with a great game of apex my friends people think we play this game like 10 hours a day and it's just not even remotely close um i'm going to detour hong kong this way all right this is the most i've played apex uh probably since it came out i like this week whoa yeah this week because i mean i haven't played back to back like every day yeah like four plus hours every day i haven't done that for i can't remember sorry teammate i also need luke feel bad is standing still is he typing to me he said really [Laughter] oh get rolled the next ring is far oh you guys are about to go at it
