hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have decided that my favorite days now are when the replicators on apex have a skull piercer and a level 3 heavy mag in them the ultimate wingman gamer crafter now you may have noticed that i've been using git a lot more recently the wingman that is and not just for video titles but because it's a good gun and it's satisfying and i feel like i've got a little bit better with the weapon itself i love the longbow as well so having a school piercer in the crafters is amazing now which is your favorite crafting rotation because you'll see the energy mags in there the light mags uh and even the shock and bolt as well so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends compensate for the recoil that's mentioned you don't pick up stocks and barrel stabilizers that's mental the part that annoyed me was that the stock doesn't do anything to the recoil it's got nothing to do with the recoil yeah so yeah yeah it's like this guy had the confidence to accuse me of cheating doesn't even know how the game works that's usually how it goes though are gonna do that they kind of don't have a clue oh he was so bad oh poor rice feel pretty bad about that and i didn't even find a gun wonderful i don't know why you had to do rice like that he was in my building hello hello hello get out of my building wait wait oh sorry sorry did you did you ping the wingman oh that's sorry i picked up the vault basket there we go i'm a fool do you need a meg there's blue heavy meg down there somewhere too i just crafted a purple one thank you it's 40 for that so i need this on all right on our right we're getting powdered on i am taking
