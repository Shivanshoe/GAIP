hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and if you guys remember season zero and season one of apex you will know just how good the wingman peacekeeper setup was back then the wingman had far more bullets and he could fire quicker the hit fire was outrageous and the pk was just always good thinking back when apex came out so many of the guns were just ridiculous the spitfire and the r301 off the top of my head were both recoilless you could they were just laser beams and they just nerfed everything into the ground i hope you guys enjoy the two games that i have for you today and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um i'm gonna land right side okay i'll land i'm tempted to land up top i've got two people land on you yeah and they got he got a spitfire on ebay i'm dead what was he looting to not find anything like i shot his teammate that landed late and this guy's just i don't know what to say about that i mean that's kind of like what i was going through these guys might push the ones over below me only have a mozam i have no oh here we go i have a mozambique and a havoc i have a purple [Music] energy oh i don't like it better let you not use an energy i dropped it wow i see energy and it's like i know i know it's hard to find so you have a bat you don't have under here uh i have two bats and i'm wise just give me a hard time or nothing i'm taking my energy ammo getting mad at me over bats that you'll need did we go to that scribe for one i mean i'm gonna put these guys real quick and then clean them up and then we'll go doing entry damage for you why i got stuck on dead [Laughter] it's kind of crazy right it's the thing you're just gonna stick people because we don't have any amuses but obviously they're just that's just the same they can just that's pretty much [ __ ] that's why they just flick it yeah this little flick of the wrist all right i'm cranking another all right gucci hold on hold on hold on you're fine you're fine i don't have any attachments my wingman oh uh okay deep north okay let's go this way bless me on the horizon like that oh my god nice huge oh this horizon's still alive is she wait no i don't i don't i don't i don't know oh the ray's already self-raised yeah she's here 47 sometimes i'll say one after you finish the kill yeah you know your callouts you know i've i've come to just uh i want you to know that i'm here three times that's all right should i try i hit it three times oh i am thank you for telling me of course i mean i'm kind of sad i had to drop a turbocharged havoc you know here's what it is the boys okay but they didn't land up top what they'll say what are they doing they're getting oh he's so laggy dude i kept thinking he was gonna go to the right but he just refused nice oh my god uh um um there's so many kills out um you probably have like seven eight you have eight seven no no seven okay i have six assists so i've helped with all i've helped with a lot you have you've been here i mean i've been i've been involved that nice all right humongous places uh yeah that bamboo to me too so stop still look death box here oh i jumped down i did the same thing nice little spot give me my shield need to score this sir i should have checked that explosive hold there's a low crop there but i haven't seen anyone use it oh no gotta hop up i've got the most seasoned zero loader you've ever seen uh wingman pk yes nice two guns i'm so famous for being good with you know i mean you know i'm known for just being absolutely insane with those weapons as well so that's something in common they're like all right some plays the guy there's a demon with the pk that's what they say i mean that's the first thing that comes to mind wait how many people are oh this guy just crashed i always forget that it scans a looticky i mean he's gonna remember you as the guy with uh okay demon i appreciate you just watching that i was like 110 i got nervous recharging my shield so you're coming through i mean that gun just takes so long to finish somebody with i'm not going nice um yes twice he was uh resin extended energy mag here level four coming nice let's let's go let's go oh i hit you with one shot you wake you wait i do i wasn't even moving do i have to snipe on black ops 2 i'd zoom in next to them drag to the left and just getting a rhythm because it will just oh you're one of those guys yeah i don't actually just quickscope someone just like zoom kind of thing one of those guys um i see nobody okay well that's just i am that's just ridiculous that you did that without saying anything i can't even climb it i'm in this weird alt so my fov is so strange you go move my god look at these guys he's a movement machine off he goes this fov is so bad the sense is bad this character is just awful he's talking to me about excuses this guy can't climb the lamppost because of his field of view apparently i mean it's that's just a truth though this fov is defeated by a lamppost no i don't know i can't do that you put a jump pad on a roof yesterday oh someone's saying i need your help like a half second to get you rich need your help i mean you're on your own that's your own fault why do i reload the pk this one oh i don't know my graph i don't know my ultimate yeah i wasted it on lamppost yep ready for this that oh i mean that's all yeah i'm so bad why can't i use the pk this is why no one knows me as the demon with the pk i mean they will now after that i mean hey i mean it wasn't too bad you are the apex champions i miss one shot i'm just like i'm terrible i mean my katie's not that much higher than yours i have like a 6 or 7 kd on this account i think it gets to the point where it doesn't matter like you're at the top it's probably capped out at like like three two or three or something like we're in the one percent in terms of katie and i'm not with you at all nice thank you was that the wreath uh nose horizon that was the one showing you in the middle someone else here didn't tell who it was thank you taking a moment to heal i swear maybe you hear me no one's this way i was healing those up problems yeah yeah oh that [ __ ] is someone like here i found a george tower here ultimately they're pretty helpful my loadout's awful [ __ ] broken i mean that's better than alternator sentinel um yes it is for one person i think they padded away let's do a team over there we low you tell me no one had any extended marks like normal funds no it was a close call insanity are they there i don't think i so i heard someone to the left maybe like this way i don't know oh someone said i swear [Applause] yeah there you go hostile spotted it is the worst big arms you just use the low bra for that you're like things by the way i mean i could have gotten shot out of there it's from safety that's the whole point [Music] oh i need a better bag this is going to if you see level 2 above please for the love of god please let me know hello brother lebron come on nope no good bags anything meant yes here we go there's a team up here pushing i can try careful careful pushing this i mean when they don't have their roof oh they run away can't do anything without it we're gonna get sean to back aren't we probably what do we do i'll scan in a second um you could full send them what are they oh that's so healing let's do it they're running off again it's so dark i can't see you i can barely see him this thing's going to push one of these it's impossible to see this guy yes can i interest you in a level three shopping level three um absolutely not okay well that was the care pack so nice solid i mean andy had a purple but since they put evo's in the game everyone has purple yeah if you don't have purple by now you definitely do is on their own jordan evo came out and you needed like 12 damage each tier you'd be in one fight you go from white to purple yeah i do remember they increased it a lot yeah they did he's definitely just gonna pop a battery he has right beneath me i'm still running oh my god uh oh come on i'm nice okay i can't say if that was one of the people that was sat up on the rock i don't know i just got here here we go there's no way it's not guy run off this way it's broken i don't even see him mate how did he climb over i'm gonna grapple stuff i can't disguise on me now guys straight oh that's what i mean i can't really help you with that i could not hear women shot on that guy very strange he's kind of totally 30 seconds remain the ring is nearby what reckon odds on someone being on diving board uh where's the zone oh it's closing on there probably it's probably pretty solid 50 if they're not there then they're on their way ha i am the diving board lead someone below is that oh yeah i don't know how to lose why am i so slow i'm no they stole it and where they give you easy on you okay yeah oh my god i can't believe they stole that kill tanking my wingman shots i need to uh i need to get some bats hold on yep they're both broken when you said three teams oh when you said three teams i didn't even check i thought you're giving my shields a recharge what these fights what these scopes they have recharging shields nice transfer kind of clean okay this is like a deja vu of our previous graph but these guys are running away for some reason okay these guys do it it's like nine seconds nice yes those last three fights were just like as soon as we stopped the fight the other guys were like you know what's our turn we're gonna we're gonna start shooting you from three miles away apex champion you just did not want to push at all no in fact they wanted to run away nice mate gg eight assists pretty good pretty good
