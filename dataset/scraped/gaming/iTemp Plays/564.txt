could have fed with this if they told anyone the tricks all right these guys they're running they are scared but they they had a really bad like we didn't have like a terrible draw but they had like the worst possible drop they could have had atlanta split dude she's uh she's one on the roof okay and your next champion is right here yeah that was a rough time for them they definitely could have made it too they're all landing there i'm coming we gotta we gotta cut these guys off yep nice i gotta pop a bat crack on purple you gotta get them oh let's go jay let's go dude that's some behind right yeah yeah that's guys over here somewhere then masturbation i thought he was further away than that yeah oh my god that was crazy i forgot i was oh i fell on my word that's okay we should be all right yeah over there he's just now coming in we can we can take a state take roof we go to that roof and then i'll throw a bounce pad and we'll take the main the center building they sound on this roof or like in this building that's fine here oh i could hear them but i didn't know if they were like beneath or like yeah it's confusing yeah they were beneath they were all posted up in the bottom floor no the bloodhound was a little late getting there so that's what kind of caused that fight yeah yeah yeah he was like damn that's the ramp not the rampart but the uh the horizon was playing really aggressive right there trying to come up so fast nice i'm gonna make another one for my hemlock oh i'm coming on blue back up a little bit some high hold on back up i gotta i got a pad we can take height we can take our height back or actually take that out i tried to jump shot an idiot last one's on our teammate stunned nice i told you i can't help okay so they threw some nades they realized how late it was and then they they dipped yeah they realized they weren't the third part anymore i couldn't get up top really not with you mate oh i thought it was just i thought i just won you're happy thank you i'll be able to back up that's my batman oh my god i'd have been with you but i hit my head on the umbrella on that jump pad yeah and here here right here quick hang right lane there yeah i know there's enemies there oh they okay they backed off okay we'll take this side we'll loot up and we'll try to rotate out she's cracked on me oh i got my own people i got a kill i'll be with you in a second my man i didn't see anyone i didn't i didn't i didn't see them land here that's why oh my gosh there we go perfect now you guys will be able to lose the loose ends that we got here there i thought there might be a which might call it a replicator here but we can we can grab what you can we're gonna head that way yep that's good to me yeah that's the play or not i'm gonna be thinking what's he doing cracks we're gonna show the back hey were you the nerd from earlier that shot at me you're dead now haha that was toxic yeah they were they were really they were really split i should have i was gonna hit the second shot with my triple take but instead it hit a lamp uh that can happen oh that was tough are they all dead no that was just two level four there's still one more he's probably riding underneath right here right here okay i'm up top she's one that's you got her there's a little horizon around unless you killed her i think we killed that i think yeah there wasn't really too much that person could do oh found another squad i'm back like in the distance they were just taking pop shots at me this guy's still down over this way too reloading nice you pulled up all crazy what happened my man we're having a pretty i'd say this is a pretty good game like despite the scuff start we've uh we've managed to pull this oh they're gonna get pushed so hard that's tough for them i feel like pushing them too i know we do but i know what's gonna happen everyone's gonna be there yep we just got to be careful from behind and that's what they give you to keep an eye out on appreciate i appreciate you gibby know that he knows what he's he's up to yeah there they are they're going for the okay they're going for the zip they're going for the zip get ready i don't have an angle you're fine he's blue i'm saying i'm sending i'm sitting okay i'm back in the back and attacking them right now this is giving up they're running they're run running they're going around i heard someone close i don't have my scan yet inside here i don't know if i want to want to give my high ground no no don't don't don't go back go back yeah go back to height we got the first thing there's a there's a zip line over here to the to the right i'm gonna say give it up high give it up height like that was just that was just to kill that one yeah i wish we would have got more kills but we got one and that's already put seven advantage yeah we'll take here we'll take here i need one coming in oh she's in a she's in her thing thing yeah yeah she only has blue she's gonna keep running she has to she has to oh i miss i don't know if i want to give that up just for one i don't need we don't need it we don't need to venture too far we need to kind of like hang out around here because then we still have that too that wraith and octane can still be a problem they can send on us like that yeah yeah yeah so we'll hang out around here there's a blue swap down the side this is nothing it is she just didn't turn around okay go yeah i know she didn't turn around dude i like a random teammate he's actually yeah [Music] it's probably the ski no yes coming crazy with it got her hey as if we won that game chicken nicely played as if we won that game he was a very good job ah i love you now after those games i needed one more good one to make it a diamond which you're watching in the background here i really wanted the rank up game to be a good one but unfortunately i just wasn't playing well in this session i hadn't really eaten i wasn't thinking straight i didn't feel crisp on the sticks my brain felt like i was on a half second delay but we still got the necessary rp sometimes you have to recognize that you aren't playing too well and just jump off and reset and this was definitely one of those sessions still with chicken's help we did make it a dime in this rank split and honestly i will take it we started a bronze four which is just a massive time sink to get out of this puts us at a better footing next season to reach the higher ranks and i still might kill people janks this season who is in masters so we can experience those predator lobbies i will have to warm up quite a bit to be playing better than i was in this video but we still did it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye you
