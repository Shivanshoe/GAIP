hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the game that happened today well i have like four or five of them but the final game today took me over three hours to get sometimes you just throw games for the stupidest reasons sometimes the games are just impossible to win this is a regular occurrence to me on apex it just happens i hope you guys enjoy the journey nonetheless thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends dropping in hang on oh i got the team i've got the squadron if we don't win this game it's an absolute embarrassment we probably won't probably get murdered by a predator three stacking dead or something i don't know give me at least one of these give me the triple take i'll take this what else we got triple take and r301 not bad ah i wanted i wanted to use the uh shotgun but whatever you guys are interested lucky us we are already inside the ring sorry gonna miss a few shots firing i'll be honest oh my god i did not realize those arcs around me this bad bad i'll be there in one sec we almost switched oh so close so close up close oh we just got like how many people are over here it's ludicrous nice try guys nice try i should really turn my game down i've ordered food and there's no way i would ever hear the doorbell with the game at its current volume oh this looks like a scout oh just for just that split second i was so happy you know i don't chill yeah i'm gonna do it there's a lot of uh energy here i wanna move i'm bumping into every surface right now giving my shields a recharge oh one of them probably should have made that was perfect that opportunity look at that the enemies are shooting at me don't worry i'm here at least i've got one i need some energy in the shopping mall watch out i have to go here collect the syringe oh pop the syringe say thank you to the syringeo god i hate not having big heels i mean i had that bat but i didn't use it i definitely should have thank you i can alter some top if necessary the team's already up there though this goes are they still in here i need a shotgun on all night here we go oh god no this isn't worth it for a syringe oh my word okay i barely have any bullets i gotta peek out with no boats i need shields taking fire reloading enemy taken down i locked him disaster there we go let me check hold on where is it it's on the way oh my god i'm going to play with one ear off oh they're here too and i can't hear anything let me speak fire i can't hear 33 seconds ago hmm here we go i'm going to try and sit up top if i can it's bouncing me off the rocks i hate this there we go achievement unlocked standing up god i'm good oh my god i do not want to challenge that i'll be honest what are we supposed to do did i get my kill ready from the first guy does anyone know he's another team here can taken down that's all we need i think she did i can't even i can't even get in there 47 bullets no stop it we're gonna be the focus of everyone here this is stupid actually when i have bullets on a spitfire too that's not good let me in there should be someone in here oh god the team on the left how good is this we should go this way why am i landing up top here it's not going to give me anything 45. yeah yeah i know i know it's kind of crazy bam oh my god there you go i can try against you on the way where they at i'm east let's explore this way i suppose well done all right listen i landed nothing with a chore tank i've still got it oh god i should probably put the 24 on the triple tape maybe it will help me land a shot who knows let's see ironically i landed the one for like 84 from downtown yes one minute and it's me uh me i'm going for the gold i need energy if anyone's going there there we go do you know what i should get rid of this uh triple take favor of the vault and go bam like that what a guy thanks how'd you say thank you in french again what is it giving my shields uh it's not civil play i think that's thank you oh no please i mean in progress [Music] making contact with the enemy taking damage that's gonna pop this bat that i got he pushed oh no now they really do have the chimney that was so close let's go this way i can help you this way wow looks like that was the last one on the squad it would have been an absolute disaster oh please thank you we can respawn this guy here how did he like oh i don't know we should go this way being led giving my shields a recharge as well [Music] nice job team that almost went horrendously long okay though i thought that was my teammate behind them wait i have no bats i need to get them from these guys one shield bat one disaster oh this guy why should we add something you know shield battery now all right 10 kills not bad not bad at all teammates have got purple armor each all right finally we found a fight someone's down no they first of him either it's gonna suck there are buildings this way i can probably just alter this on top of them i don't think anyone else has gone down come on still five squads left lives that is my fault that is my fault they seem happy enough yeah they seem happy sorry team sorry i'm coming someone landed up top how annoying nice job teammates someone someone got first a bunch of people at antenna i can see either eight shots i think that was far enough into the sunset but we've got more people to deal with over this way first oh heavy ammo extended energy beautiful quite like the three times in assault rifles at the moment this is like the time i pulled you out of the dumpster but more fun under fire the heck is this guy doing like to land up there and like pick up a sniper and just snipe at people but you're going to die when people get close because you haven't got any of the guns coming amigo nice what a waste of everyone's time kind of tough shots why is that why can't you walk over that it's a little bit of damage i've got too many heavy bullets she's going finally so slow there's such a big fight here but i can't commit without i'm teammates get all their shield back thanks teammates look at him do that climb for horrendous did we kill the race is he so body thanks i need it okay they're still fighting this is perfect we just sit up here or something step one of them i cannot believe that guy just challenged like that is that not the that's the person i hit for like 100 and something right it's crazy i mean it worked there was so much going on i couldn't really hear anything now she's beneath me he's got two clothes [Music] i actually far missed really sing an arc star right does anyone know one more time [Music] don't take it don't take it don't take it full team full team oh my god don't die no unacceptable oh my god the 14 just landed on me that was ludicrous i've got you ex-girlfriend so you're still a girl still like that was terrifying using a phoenix kit that was terrifying i was gonna i was gonna phoenix we're gonna phoenix it for the boys all right nice good grief i don't think i've ever had my adrenaline going that much on apex before full team landed on us look at him over there [Music] heavy heavy heavy heavy extended heavy mag here level two one minute the ring isn't far open here i will now got my g7 escape so i can just pick up all the throw balls in the world 240 energy bullets i like running like a care package weapon with a mastiff or something and then you just have 300 throwables imagine doing that as fuse as well that's the tactic actually defuse mains like think about what guns they have to use like the best ones surely do the best ones are sure to use in like what would you use you'd use like uh what does it need much ammo wingman sure you'd use like wingman pk hello come this way oh hello mr worldwide all right two of the squads we've got a care package this way might as well go and see what it is that's a problem not a person fools me every time i've died once too many times today by grappling in without my team so i'm not going to do that to the last grapple that was my final grapple of this entire game i won't use it again oh god you see that's what i mean who was he hello blue gamer he's blue gaming over there he wants that like i could head shine if i use the crater but okay we know what that team is where's the last team great already inside the ring if the last team's behind us i'm going to scream because there's no way they aren't like up there or something they have to be up there surely oh i think she craved her damn if i could land my shots of course they're behind us i really wanted that down i knew i was gonna get shot but i've really wanted that down so bad but i had in stupid double tap mode i hate double tap mode i'd have killed during single fire fire is that the one i only said single file i'm getting jumped by proudly oh god hey back it up stop it [Applause] nice shots gotta be careful about overcoming to these these are nowhere near him though oh there you go through the teams here the other team came down beautiful there's some good positioning we keep high ground keep high ground keep high ground if you can on this right side i think i've got bag i won a game it genuinely genuinely took me about three hours no cabbage no cabbages involved did you well played it was also great delegation for me champions by giving my teammate the crater because he was popping off the crater i knew i wasn't going to land any shots i could barely land a shot with the scouts let's be honest i should have changed the two times i'd have either landed far more shots than that seven seven seven three revives from me three provides for ash a solid team performance i finally got a win unbelievable scenes
