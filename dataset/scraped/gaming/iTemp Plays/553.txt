hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have two very different games for you the first of which we died to a hacker and i thought it'd be interesting to spectate him and the second game i was playing solo and for the first maybe 10 minutes of the game i was doing recording tests to make sure my frame was back to normal which it was so then i started solo commentating the second half of the game which had a great ending i hope you enjoy them both and i hope you guys had a great christmas as well thank you for watching as always and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends ah oh hey that's yours that's you that shoot dude i feel bad i always land on you and i always go to leave the gun and that's the one time we both left oh my god i feel like i always take it so i was like i'm going to leave it this time no no no you were too nice that's real hemlock by the way that's the two times on my ping oh that is ginormous huge pings right are the biggest things ever possibly oh there you go would you like another r9 no i'm good thanks either level two extended energy i'm just looking for an armor if i find her armor i'm good right here wait they're not in this one they're in the next one a team learning status apparently are you okay uh yeah i might try and go up here because it's a caustic and i'm a caustic do it classic on classic action where did he go he's in the stairs he's in the stairs he's in the stairs i'm in the stairs that's me no no i watched him i i saw him going i got him asparagus i feel bad that's a nasty nasty third party happened to us enough though yeah i was gonna say how do you really feel after you get a kill oh it's all kicking off over here just so you know there was a team behind us okay i saw it i went to go luther the house behind us and there was a team that looted it i might be rocking a black too where was it they're fighting another team over there i'm down i'm trying to go over there cuz this team's doing fine i'm down okay i'm gonna grab this rope okay they're on me so you're good you're good you're good go up take a deep breath oh see them yes sir uh another team right here phoenix using a phoenix they're pretty far you got lots of time for coach could be someone who's dating another man if this lobby's dead and there's a level eight that had six kills within the first like three minutes of the game so i don't know i think uh i think we know what to expect yeah this team is going to come out uh trials i think i'm pretty sure what is this okay let's get it missed get in there oh that scene that's seeing that scene that's it let's get in there yeah he's cheating he's cheating that's the guy look at gabe look at his teammate bless him he's struggling his teammate's struggling he needs help help this guy this is the confidence only a hack would have you know three times this game okay four shots with a skull is he cheating or do you just have a good barrel stabilizer yeah i like how you can you can still make a joke i'm sitting here tilted you're still able to make a make a funny out of it that's impressive he missed our noob never have to deal with this ever again wouldn't that be wonderful i just love how he's trying to he hides his hacks a little bit by scanning that's my favorite part it's like i know you're there because your scans don't worry about it good game mate didn't even get a 20 buck oh there we go i'll tell you what teammate i apologize but i might have to send this in the full variety oh my gosh i've launched my ultimate and they've decided to jump down into the ravine the avril ravine am i supposed to be able to hit those shots like they're too slippery run they're on the horizon they're fighting someone else now i'm not even involved it may have been a bit a bit audacious i just think i do think on the way up you might stand one what side have you gone on that spitfire my friends nice i don't know how my teammate's standing him i'm across the way with a spitfire i must have like a four-time sight oh my god i got both those kills i don't like taking the kill credit you know i don't want him to think that i was just stood there waiting for the revive to come through just so i can get kill credit that's definitely not what i was trying to do i said no problem hey what a great guy we're going to win this game 100 i'm going to win i don't even know what i need in terms of lit i mean i'm pretty stacked i don't need any shields maybe a bit more ammo for the old scale but apart from that we're good i'm down to just run off into the sunset we are top 10. i i'm in full agreement the waves lead the team my friend hit well there's a fence there i'm like oh there we go looks like someone else has spotted the fence enemy over there not really worth the shot teammates pushing up we can let them get a little bit closer i can barely see with this one time site it's not a good spot to be i mean that's the superior positioning you know if they're running into us right like that all you have to do is back up a little bit then fall into your trap a bit of damage a bit of zone control but apart from that okay okay give me a second hold on teammate sorry he was trying to sell phrase i didn't want him to have a gold bag revive behind just sprint off into the sunset heal up and then shoot from the back you know and it worked out this is the action that's the thing with these battle royale games did you have a gold bag you see it's a good job i came back to kill him uh you're always going to find action at the end of the game it doesn't matter too much about the early game you know we've seen here we've got red armor now i have five kills somehow someone's got a crater which is kind of intimidating especially late game all the all the hard work you put in let's go over here we couldn't even hear the gunshots so they can't be too close uh what was that i feel like i was halfway through a sentence or maybe i was just i can't remember anyway it's been so long since i solo commentated it's actually kind of a struggle i've no idea how i used to do this every day for two hours every day uh but what's gonna oh when you loot at the start of a game when you when i play defensive at the start of the game for like five minutes you get loose i feel really protective of the loops more protective than if i oh this might be decent more protective than if i just killed someone and found the loot you know what against one team they could get kind of close close range give that back if you fancy that i've missed the ping i apologize roger okay one of these guys has a crater one headshot okay well there's the crabber the good news is his friend unfortunately i hold a different angle try and put some shots down get them distracted try and get them to pre-me a little bit maybe my team i can get a a crab shot i'll tell you what you guys are getting peppered you're getting absolutely peppered up all i need to do is knock one of them and then i can just love my ultimate this is all i'm trying to do here let's go this way all right there's the macbank in the middle of the safe zone fantastic watch my back either need to get a bunch of headshots with a g7 on my teammate i need to get a knock with the crater i don't want too much though because i'm not wasting his shots until i'm sort of padding my standard over here what damage per game he's gonna go he's gonna be thanking me at zero for the first 25 minutes of this game i've never seen an angle like it you can probably still see my shoulder imagine if i had a crater i'd have killed you guys like 12 times all right we are depending on this circle trying to put i don't know if it's possible for them to get pushed off in the circle but we need it to be decent for us horrendous circle is actually tragic getting him back bangalore sometimes you don't even have to smoke yourself if someone's okay and the vault is pretty much an assault rifle you can just smoke someone's high ground and it means they can't see anything apart from these guys who have night vision goggles or something on thermal sights still getting shot at somehow how many shots does this man have he's had this crater for for so long do you know i have a gold bag if you can just buy some time oh my word he's down one hold on teammates yes sir we did it are there two gold knockdowns i'll see ya thanks for boosting up the damage numbers good job teammate i'll tell you what he's actually absolutely pushed up there these these guys jumped on his head and he's managed to not only survive long enough for me to self-rest but he's actually down one of them in the process and knocked through the guys shields doppler waves what an absolute hero six kills i mean 2500 damage imagine if i actually shot someone for the first 10 minutes of this game the 4k badge would have been mine great work there doppler waves i'll tell you what what started out is just a quality test a frame rate test turned out to be a pretty fun game i'll take it a winsor win thank you for watching i'll see you on the next one bye sorry i forgot my intro there it's been so long oh outro wrong word
