hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in season eight respawn buffed up mirage with the buff that we were supposed to get a few weeks ago but apparently they accidentally put it in the patch notes and it was always supposed to come out in season eight but anyway his bpg ratio has gone up tremendously bpg of course meaning bamboozles per game now his decoys come with footstep audio which can cause mass chaos and confusion in a big team fight but i definitely need more game time with mirage because whenever i watch my games back when i play him i realize just how unnatural i act when i've popped my ultimate like i'll alter so there are a lot of decoys and everyone's confused and then i'll do something that clearly shows who the real mirage is like i'll climb the railing or i'll start scaling a building or something i need to pick and choose when to use it now i've got a great game for you here today over 3 000 damage if you are new to the channel please be sure to subscribe as we are going for one million subs in season eight of apex and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah uh i'm gonna land um behind this okay i always land in that building and someone always beats me to the gun and then i'm just very mad oh it's got purple out of a band dude nice i got a sentence on this guy's chase me uh double p 20 20. okay i'm running away anyway so you're good like the armor situation was good uh the gun situation not so much not so good yeah i still have double p 2020. i had to crank a finish on this guy i couldn't take the disrespect he just did to me what do you do just chase me with the repeater from the start of the game it's like especially when i like i made it to a bin so i had like an armor switch down and he must have seen it and he just rushed me with the g7 repeater what a mania he must have known he's my first game mind and my aim's a little bit shaky you know that's the only reason oh nice i haven't been around people right i hear people i don't know he's on the roof i blocked myself in oh i'm okay the guy all the way down though bro i don't like cracks i think it's the revenant if it's the if it's the path that you don't just climb the rope okay climb the roof oh god that was the last one i came i saw is there anything on the roof okay nice job mate there we go ah that was actually kind of sweet nice little balancing act from the boys there sniper mag here level three a sick 301 with a one times yeah or 301 with a 2-4 and anvils uh 301 with the one times yeah i think i know what the right decision is here but uh it's trying to think of variety you know i like the anvil but i don't like the variable scope so i can't personally i can't deal with it so if you find if if you want i can use the i can use available on my scout because then it's like a little bit more relaxed than this real one or something and i can give you this three times but nah um i want to say probably not i'm going to use that but my problem with the anvil is i could literally just laser you full auto and faster than i would if i just handled you i mean three times and for these i don't know why really satisfying i like you on the flat line that was kind of a little play dude i played that building so well yeah with the shields and stuff they couldn't even touch you it's inside i'm setting up i'll open the door for you come in come on i'm gonna try and make it look at you nice job [Music] nice job i swear i press triangle switch gun i swear i did we shouldn't be alive man that's crazy we survived that nice job what do you mean dude we got the walls we're good i wasn't worried for a second i feel like zeus up in here i was a little bit concerned when i was stuck in a bangalore horizon combination i'll be honest i started panicking a little bit i saw that's why i opened the door i saw the alt i was like all right listen get inside open the door for you i'm opening the door for you you won't be able to open it on your own get in here oh that rampant shield absolutely melted the face off that wraith by the way then you know dude it's actually so good now oh i didn't know that was the thing he's cheating he's not going to hop off this side i don't see him peeking horizon it's surprising she's on your building i think i'm just watching this back door right here on the roof angles behind you in my village no one back there actually not dead [Music] i hear two more on me i'm gonna come over here go to bangalore i hear an octagon yeah octane's like i'm coming inside welcome to my safe place i like it i'm gonna climb on him is that bad i think he's in our shields he didn't go in did he make it over let's go that was the last one i came i saw i tried i don't deserve 1400 damage it's all the sales i'd have 200 baby this is amazing i'm having fun let me see like i'm in the wrong gaming position which is why i'm planning to be weird right now is there more coming i'm ready for i hope so oh man this guy had all the jews yeah i'll make all right oh that [ __ ] you're so scared now because the people people keep coming in oh on the rope on the rope this road how do i now see him flying oh he's going up it now shot a little bit hopefully they'll come over back him into the old shields where they going can i shoot through do i get amuses through this i've got the craziest headphones well i guess i'm gonna just chill yeah damage boosting style these guys haven't peaked oh they've gone up the big rope we're going here unless they take the rope again i guess anvils might be the player hold on 100 hold on yeah i hit them for 66 and 37. play four points track 26 flash oh my goodness look at him standing behind the glass we see you there what's our team i can see if he backs back uh he doesn't want to communicate this is mental i just want to i want to fry them wait here [Music] all right [Music] i haven't even hailed for a little ride okay i got four inches yeah they're pushing up a little bit that's all low ground this team pushed up on me they got in one got in one fourth two underneath i'll make it to you baylor one shot sailor one shot got him you got bamboozled look at you send it a decoy wait the bloodhound oh though i mean we have just locked down this area yeah i didn't really know how to play that because i didn't want to i didn't want to take the time to heal because then they'd be able to walk up on us so i was like trying to keep pressure on without healing that's kind of tricky i'm not going to lie yeah and i suppose me saying if you can make it to me then we give them our shields you know yeah look at all these boxes look at all that we did this dude we did this death box here do you feel bad uh absolutely not i saw tremendous how are you feeling like a bully you got more shields i'm not gonna break that door in case low brought inside so they're going to come out some way i'm going to set up a shield over here yeah yeah let's see oh you saw me for dinner please they load the bracelets back they're definitely going to try and wrap around they can't come that way they know they can't they're definitely going to be this way do we just want to go in the zone we may as well right because whichever way they come we're fine what is going on where are they i don't know tomorrow i think yeah top market oh top market yeah i know for 40. nice it's farming enough give us that 4ks in progress i'm gonna put the anvils to work here do it then been in the game for for a long time when was last time in the ring like season five or something i don't know man like yeah like four season five oh look at that here they come here they come rich that's where they're gonna come from they're probably gonna if i was then i'd go like that this way she didn't make it in half 86 41 i have to reload i'm gonna first the path oh i wanted extra damage i'm gonna start this guy he's gonna move from the rock oh so close i'll do it again oh she had no heat of all she was 41 health nice job i saw i tried it worked this is a weird game oh wait wait let's go oh a fellow rampart one minute ring's nearby that team is like here i'm gonna try to get an angle on the ground i am 134 damage away from my 3k badge oh so that's what i mean it's like with the animals like i'll just fall out of you and do more damage directly i can find a thousand damage off these guys what do you want to try we only have blue so we dropping some chill bats or what we can try they are safe in there oh they brought to the left they won they ran like they're going to go high ground over this way like here i reckon i'm going to get an angle on i'm them no end in my 4k i'm dangerous to win victory okay let's do it they're on that door what do you want hold on they don't know about the double shield strike oh no no they died i'm gonna blow up their door the double shield strategy that was great what a fun game that was actually a really fun game that's a completely different vibe to how we usually play but we got so many kills and so much damage apex champions feels good damn you fry fried let's go so those shields mate without those shields i did 1500
