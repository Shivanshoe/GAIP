hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing valkyrie and she's actually one of my favorite legends in season 10 because she is amazing to play on king's canyon one issue that i have on the original map here is that i can't find anyone to fight i don't know where to go to find people and then the lobby's dead and i have three kills and 212 damage it's rough but that isn't an issue for valkyrie because she has the best rotational alt in the game which also spots people on the ground for you to engage on on top of that there are some amazing places for valkyrie to use her jets on king's canyon like the buildings that have the holes in the roof that you can shoot through you can quickly adjust get on the roof and then shoot down on your opponents try her out on king's canyon i'm telling you she's amazing i have an interesting game here for you today with a ton of damage i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends probably yeah i think i hated all three of them yeah i think so i literally never made a video on rampage oh she was just so bad she was so bad when they dropped her wait i couldn't make a video how do you know i could make the video now make it now yeah it's not like it's five seasons i mean at this point anything we do is just big value i mean we gotta just take it around into this wow i booty suck oh my god this is the fastest man ever exists this guy's so fast taking out more enemies don't crawl out of their teammate you crazy guy get back in yeah yeah yeah here we go i thought he's coordinated myself i'm going to you in a i need to heal up i'm dropping this guy at med let's go here oh my god please how am i so stressed out it's used on that huge do you need a match are you good um i only have strangers i dropped some sort of you can like two syringes actually showing me that it'd be funny cracked one in there i'm nice what did you stick him no just but it's crazy it's like nature well i can fly i forgot about this that's damaged no i had one board in my evolution this is what they get for all london in the exact same spot can i just say this guy the p20 and nothing else half the squads remain i don't know b20 is kind of nasty now i didn't see your video they're gonna excuse anymore uh uh symptoms i am on my way i've got a quick question for you actually yes um have you ever hit anyone with valkyrie's ability no yes or no because i i yeah i've met i think i'm the same where are you i may have been looting but i'm a fast guy there is a team at market but i'm going to do this these guys are just that back and forth over headshot two people over this way i mean i'm on my way i'm be honest i'm a one times g7 escape demon let me tell you i don't know why you just don't embrace it like you're trying to you're you're trying to like fall away from that title for so long but just just like embrace it i might have to at this point i'm a flatline crutch i love it every day of the week this animal shields are recharging i am going to grapple oh my heart i'm tempted to just go there i'll come with you i'll fly up oh i thought i had my voltex i pressed triangle but it didn't register so i fired one bullet and looked at them for a little while so that might have been my fault ah i've been there my reaction time is really bad how do i get anything yes oh okay i have my own i literally we can scan this area this is all louis caustic it's all looted baby we need uh we need to carry ultimate accelerants for you yeah we do we did that right next to a rope i feel like them might have been a bit of a waste that guy's dead a little bit i think he thought i was going in oh [Music] recharging shields oh you took the ultimate accelerator nevermind oh did you drop it for me well uh no i didn't really drop it but in my head i dropped it oh i see i know that means oh it wasn't mine but it wasn't mine in my head it was mine 223 okay thank you yeah we should just take the ropes when we can that's a good idea thanks yeah yeah so i really wish i had my own administering medically i'd be efficient here because we could just fly over this mountain imagine the scenes if we could just fly over this mountain yeah but we can't that's the problem you're six kills how much damage you want uh 1200 okay we're even then respectable very respectable i thought i might be joining but we're good uh but you have been joining all day don't you start i tried nazism everywhere i just ran down there spraying my evo wherever it could go you got me looking under the stairs looking for harry potter actually i started at the back wall over here and then i sprayed the window and then i moved to the stairs it was i don't know how many names people have thrown me today but it's at least 200. okay someone is going to comment that i'm in a bar lobby guaranteed around the corner oh my god you're throwing there's another team here as well oh my god i just wanted to leave let's go back over here oh no we just need to sit up top with the boys by the boys i mean me uh full team pushing you this guy's only worried about their sami though don't worry oh yeah two times now i'm not involved everyone wants a scrap mate me only me look usually that works did you get some good light uh i was about to get a double turbocharged evo so ah okay that sounds worth actually it was gold mag two turbochargers it was gonna be great tell me that was then with the bow no it's behind oh my god oh my god why a building kind of blows this is ridiculous man everyone's everyone's fine at me it's the craziest thing i've ever seen how do you i hate you in my head server as a reminder fire service over here nice see if you weren't valkyrie you whoa look at the distance on this yeah valkyrie's op if they chase me instead of holding those people in zone when there's about 12 people struggling in the zone behind him they they're really bad my height how do you really feel though oh guys look like a good time you're really going to chase me instead of going for those kills teammates all right you may write fire blue armor swap blue armor all those empty white armor swap oh he's dead he can't get across the sacrifice mate that's been sacrificed i can't believe there's a team that exists like that that's that's my old judging on my shield you know they're you know they're really bad when they chase you and they follow your path instead of like cutting you off they're literally just following your exact path like the longest possible route yeah they just like followed every footstep that the caustic took through those buildings instead of cutting them up crazy oh poor guy i mean this is an easy 4k if you just don't throw you would oh oh you do not know my power my friend what's this guy doing what do you got hello wait he wasn't even in reform no hello mate i'm so confused really appreciate it if you res me sorry teammate i don't think i'm getting you two teams left don't go in get our just that was kind of just like bm i was just kind of like letting him know like yeah i'm not gonna get your back hey good look lol get rolled with that it's an easy win you have a g7 high ground oh easy easy dub oh we made it i have one cell i should have looted a little bit more than i did i'm gonna be honest with you get a down with your tactical i'm going in i haven't used it once one last squad made it this far [Music] nice oh doesn't have gold things back hey come here for me did you get radar shows the rings close by 45 seconds okay ah zone's closing in ten recharging i only got a bat almost to the ring right oh oh i could have killed those guys they sucked oh you know what you maybe should have done this is just this is just me no no i want to hear it because i don't know yeah i think uh when you you did like 170 or something to that bloodhound yeah you should have just used your tactical on the door and blown it and you would have that would have been an easy down good point i didn't really think of that but that was good no i could have killed them and i would have got the 4k mate i'm gonna cook back to you saying this is an easy 4k if you don't choke because if i let you just down one of them i could first for 50 damage and get a 4k on val that would be pretty nice i feel no oh man i don't know how i don't make his back just finished right in front of my face and i got scared because i don't i thought the lifeline was on the roof the reason i kept flying to the roof because i thought she was going to drop my head so i wanted to try and keep that as mine
