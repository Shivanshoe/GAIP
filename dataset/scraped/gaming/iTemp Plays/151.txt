hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and here it is the season 12 defiance launch trailer for apex legends now with this season comes a new legend mad maggie who i assume or just be called maggie in game some huge changes to olympus the map but i'm not too sure that we will see a new weapon this season i didn't spot one in this particular trailer but it's early days yet and we might get some more information on this later on now i'm playing the defiant launch trailer in the background here and it follows maggie's introduction into the apex games and some of the biggest news is that olympus has been teleported or something and it looks like it's going to get the red skybox treatment that we saw king's canyon and world's edge get before now one of my favorite things about olympus was the colours it was so bright and vibrant it was a beautiful map so we'll have to see how this looks in game because a lot of people didn't like it when they did it to king's canyon and walter h and it seems like many of the open fields on olympus have more bits of cover dotted around them with crates and boxes that were thrown around when the entire map was falling through the sky now this is a welcome change for me sometimes these open spaces were just too brutal against snipers now you'll be able to duck and weave your way to safety a lot easier next up let's talk about some of the teasers towards maggie's abilities first of all we see some kind of dart that she fired at horizons team when they were chasing her it stuck to a box and exploded when the enemies got close to it now i don't know if this was a proximity sensor and explodes when enemies are nearby or if she just timed it really well in a trailer and it has a set fuse time that you'll just be able to fire whenever you want but he definitely stunned the enemies for a good amount of time here and i'd be surprised if an explosion like this didn't do at least a little bit of damage much like revenant's cue just 10 damage you know it's not much but it adds up now i would assume that this is her regular ability she might also be able to stock up on these uh if it's the proximity version i assume that she'll get a few a few stacks of these at least but if he's just a regular stunt grenade maybe she'll only be able to carry around one of them next up when fuse uses his ultimate on maggie from the flames comes this wrecking ball that reminds me of the rap's kill streak from black ops 3 if you guys have ever played that game it looks very similar now it comes in it hits fuse right in the chest and knocks him down now they don't show what the wrecking ball does afterwards it sort of just carries on rolling away maybe maybe he doesn't even get stopped if he hits someone it just carries on going in a straight line to the edge of the map and it falls off i'm not really sure i mean it could explode after a certain amount of time as well but we don't know because they didn't show it but we do know that it must do a good amount of damage to knock someone if you hit them directly but i'm not sure how easy that's going to be now these aren't mistakes either by the way apex always uses these trailers to hint at character abilities map changes even buffs and nerfs new weapons everything everything that they include in these trailers is on purpose so i think that's her regular ability i think we've got her ultimate down which is the wrecking ball but i'm not too sure what her passive is sometimes that can be really difficult to portray on a trailer you'll just have to play her now just some little details here that i saw some people talk about it looks like lifeline's drone is following her around the map which could be a hint of a buff for lifeline but it also could be just because her drone is almost a character in their own right on apex and they wanted to show it in the trailer i know i just said that everything in the trailers is on purpose but we've seen the drone fly around before i also saw someone say that octane was holding a new weapon here but i'm almost certain that that is just a rampage lmg now we will be getting more details in the coming weeks so be sure to subscribe to the channel here to keep up to date thank you guys for watching i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all
