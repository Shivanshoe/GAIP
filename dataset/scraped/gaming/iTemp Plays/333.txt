and in yesterday's video i attempted to use the alternator of course i missed the the hop up attachment the disrupter rounds which turns into a god-tier gun possibly the best gun on apex legend in fact i've just had a thought maybe they should switch the alternator to a care package gun because that is how good it is at the moment i called it and not only did i call it i was also using the spitfire look both care package weapons going into season 10. the alternator destructor rounds is just ludicrous this will be an instant pickup from the care package in all of your future games here are the clips from this video stage old classic move it's the age old classic move enemy down yeah he's done three shots and he shields with we've done so headshots with this big fire these guys down it's the stupidest gun oh one guy it's the stupidest gun of all time it's a crazy gun this before this game is looking ridiculous as well the season 10 care package is going to be hotly contested so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends but he's a really nice dude like he really is he's really he's like a genuine guy if i was kill racing like not kill racing but kill grinding i'd also like on this game you have to use the most annoying stuff to be the top one yeah well you just lose your mind i get it you know i respect it because i definitely couldn't do it you know oh i could never i've got an old snack in like two hours and i'm finished are you only is that all you're looking are you looking for like double alternative yeah i could do it i love double alternator i uh try another if i find another one i won't i won't run light oh you can i meant lost everywhere i found out i found it i'm dropping a night people were here on my way i smoking second floor back to him but i don't know how he can see me but i'm trying to get to you we literally just played against this guy yeah we literally just played against him i can't
