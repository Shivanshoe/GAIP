hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some watson those are words that i've probably said about three times in my entire life watson is not the most exciting legend on the game because her kit is very defensive it's about bunkering down protecting an area and in public matches which is what i usually play if you try and play like this you won't really find too many people to shoot however she did get a really nice buff in the chaos theory update she now passively regenerates shields at a rate of one shield per two seconds this is an amazing buff for watson because in ranks and in competitive play oftentimes teams are running on fumes they have three shield cells between them and a dream and when you combine watson's ultimate with her passive regeneration you're saving your team so many cells and bats over time which can be crucial now i was playing her in some public matches but let me know if you guys want me to play her in some ranked play which is where she will really shine remember we are at diamond two at the moment and we are going to make a push for masters this season so it could be interesting anyway thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends um it kind of and my thermite is not even touching i'm just hiding in a corner hide hide hide hide why am i climbing come on i need energy so badly all right we got a second a team over there just chilling i'm not surprised it's a rampant team energy ammo here okay all right get some throw balls on the go yeah yeah yeah oh you have any cells i only have one more after this um i have one bat and four cells hold on and we've only got 45 seconds let's go strong kills i have 470 damage for one kill can you nate through this let's go here um watch the left side no they're through the middle yeah i think they left did they oh yeah it's open is the gold loot saw there don't listen there open it up mate open up oh you gotta press the button off yeah oh why would they not get this i mean old repeater foolish foolish behavior i've got goldback gold knockdown right here what's this one what's this one oh here we go we need better gold weapons longbow replaces it's definitely not and these guys just left gotta be caged right i have a solid solid whopping 51 damage added to the board pad up the stats they're climbing can you hear them yeah they're being little monkeys one drops not with you at all [Laughter] my fault i'm gonna be completely honest um i tried to shoot my ebay but apparently it was holstered uh he started throwing the hands instead of the bullets i just admitted you know that does happen on occasion uh spare energy yeah it's pretty worth it i'm taking it off i'm gonna put a one times hollow on just because i can definitely can farmed a nice 704 damage right there how many kills you want two kills i got two kills seven hundred and four damage solid got his revive on the pathfinder um oh oh what the heck i thought we i thought that one died no the octane ran off i was so far behind you and i'm just i know it's depressing when you're playing octane so depressing especially when i thermite the pad and i'm the last one i can't use it thank you it's like i feel like it's bad for anyone who's not playing october sucks because like when you guys play octane 2 it's just terrible it's such a bad time oh pass behind us i didn't even see that guy or here oh my god come on oh he's fried i'll just find a friend 30 seconds to go all this dude a lion flying but i am just so fast this is so much fun right toxic behavior but full burst into your back i i heard you shoot it and i didn't hear the floor already i up top somehow you stream me again don't know how it happens oh it's always me being shot it's wild oh my god it's always me you know it's crazy because i'm just so fast they can't they can't see me it's gonna be so gross this gun is so gross imagine that that was a regular weapon a few seasons ago and triple bins get no gun and i'll meet you on the other side yeah yeah yeah i like that i like that this part of the death box oh yeah see you in the lobby uh all right two bins no gun two beans no gun can we make it three oh i got a wingman with a scorpion oh my god i'm gonna throw up is anyone down there with you because i've got a wingman for you with the skull pieces up oh um no oh my god going from 30 fps um 240 is just very strange uh that yes i can imagine look at this drop oh my god thank you very much a lot of crazy a lot of dps i do not have a bad all right again thank you better use it this is another reason i didn't want to use the switch too much so i know what it was like switching between console like at least console you're going from like 60 frames you know oh yeah yeah and the input lag isn't yeah isn't as bad yeah 1080p resolution that's actually sounds like a decent time let me play the switch yeah i i saw so i saw um so many people complaining and i was like what are you like what do you guys want it's uh like it's a i know it's a portable i could be taking a dump and be crying at the same time like you can't do that anywhere else it's meant for zelda mario party you know yeah the fact that they even put um apex on the switch is pretty ridiculous and and insane to me oh my god somewhere in cage i completely booked it final fault please let me know i might have one other one for you if you are not using it um do you have an energy again i have i have energy and i have a purple i don't have an energy going i've got skype oh my god oh my god rich wait where was it in the corner he was just showing them syringes oh i'm bad that was just he was standing in the corner all the time pretty sure he used afk having a conversation and he comes back because you can hear footsteps right next to him panicking she made almost everything i can hear him above me i think it's either a bubble below and i would assume he's above can you like have you got a nade like here oh yeah nice situation is terrible snipers extended sniper mag here thanks man oh here we go yeah yeah should we have to throw my ultimate on your page just i see somebody um you should be able to bounce everything off great um i mean you just don't miss uh shots it's just everything's easy you know there you go is it ultimate sound i'm gonna passive regen this so i don't have to waste a shield cell all right this one's not which isn't ideal yes oh my god the amount of damage i just farmed kind of crazy i need it i need an opportunity to use my ultimate oh coming down there hold on hold on [Music] they literally can't get inside so don't worry all the services are on the zone i don't know yeah in like two seconds it's kind of crazy so these things are gonna say you're gonna drop off you get angry then are you gonna drop one uh i already jumped and i've got two more oh my god you're just actually using that yeah when i use the legend i'll use the legend you know i don't see anybody i'm gonna get crippled all night um i have gold bags so okay couldn't be opposed okay that's not too bad wow they could have just let me come up there and kill me wow oh my god yeah they're up there they mean business mate look mates come in good try idiot 83 i don't have an angle in this guy i can't even i can't even see this dude are you ready to push i just pop this off this is a really really weird angle i do like right here uh okay should we try and crack them again yeah there's the same name we're better we'll wait and we have amy we have the power of god and anime and amy's on our side can't show you the theme is that my dawn i was getting trouble with the other team so was that like this way maybe this way oh he's got no saw in the power left he took the sight off i fell ah okay all they threw they threw at least you've got my ultimate up top i wish i had my ultimate up top give me these cracks nearly people like knight shield blue chance cracked nice all right i fell down like an idiot he's just here nice i know you had that yes the crowd is so weird with your iron sights it's it's terrible the iron spikes are off on that gun i don't know why you take off the dj especially when you're a cool steak nah that was the worst play ever was it the worst play or was the worst playing me like falling off a mountain which one was worse um that was pretty bad but you know when you have me as your teammate you can do it whatever you want i mean i him both with pretty much the hundreds which isn't bad you know eh
