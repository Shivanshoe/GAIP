hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the spitfire has taken over the kill feed in apex the time to kill is slower than other popular choices but you just don't have to reload with this gun it can turn anyone into a demon so i decided to make it better by playing rampart her passive of course makes lmgs more effective and the spitfire is indeed an lmg so we had an absolute field day with the buffed up fully upgraded spitfire if you thought it was overpowered beforehand wait until you come across one in the hands of a rampart thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go yes oh my god it's not no no no no no no no no no no no no that guy's got he gold on your side wait it's just aiming for double headshots he has like one bullet on you what is that uh he was flesh though because you must have him yeah he's like 58 what's that look at you um take this take this and pop a syringe no no no i'm gonna just pop a med i'd have to pop two syringes that's fine i'm using two lumbos oh huge mate one long

rock up in a car it would be on the radar wouldn't he i don't know oh yeah some shot scene i hopped but using my own rampage shield i cannot believe what i'm watching that's amazing i go down again don't rest me please no i've got you about that stream right you're gonna start streaming what the heck was that what i got it two spitfires double spitfire would be sort of good i'm i'm down for that tactic that see listen under normal circumstances rich i wouldn't condone this behavior but you are playing rampart yep and i feel like because you haven't done it you kind of deserve it i mean if you play rampant you you are allowed i think that's the rule yeah exactly [Music] i love that slow walk on when you walk slowly just like i don't know he shakes his hips it really gets into it he looks kind of cute right that's great oh man oh i can't find anything good how do i have no armor giant um you know what rich i don't want to be the very bad news but you kind of walk past like eight armors up top i'm gonna mess with i thought i had armor so rockefeller with my own two eyeballs just a couple of whites up there i didn't bother painting because we were like right beside each other but oh i walked past loads yeah i thought i had some that's my whoa these are looted open supply bin here mates oh there's a blue over here oh no i think i heard someone fire this way i don't know okay it looks unluted maybe maybe i'm wrong i've been wrong before jenks does it seem to say wrong um no there's someone here that rate this one i hit it for like 70 flush dodging my shield rosin is all four where'd you go ray oh shoot here she up here oh my word jank choose one thank you let's go oh my god there's a skull piercing down here i require yeah i saw those two hop ups and i thought maybe oh my goodness oh nice spitfire filthy oh the loot here is just tremendous oh i meant that oh i'm going to use i'm going to use the spitfire elsa i never get to use the all-star and i said it was the best gun in season seven but with rampa it honestly it's it's game it's close yeah yeah there's only one place to go ps5 to the ps5 that package landing up here i mean this isn't technically the ps5 oh there is a fight there check this out oh they're in the ps5 i'm scanned i'm scared i'm scared i'm big scanned for you mates it was like oh he did he's going he went into the ps5 front door front door of the ps5 ridge oh okay think i never have to reload my guns oh dude yeah the l-star and the gold mag spitfire you don't reload there's no reloading no reload challenge it's the matter uh i mean yeah you weren't seeing the lgs but i mean you should you should just because you don't doesn't mean you shouldn't exactly you uh you're not uh you're not that race right uh someone ran away i think there's one person left there was a yeah there was a red armored wraith that uh i hear i think i hear it this way mate close the door here everybody choose a good player good player get ready to race she might be up top wait for us to run away because the banner i don't know ah i'm not leaving the banner i'm gonna be that guy she wants so bad she's gonna have to fight us for it right totally oh i'll miss the stock i can't be bothered someone's gonna share with me for that everybody shout out item for not picking up the stock right now i've edited the video if no one can hear this don't worry no no evidence absolutely oh she said she's here oh sub me in i'll tell you i thought mate i thought you were awake no but she is oh she's stuck oh she's stuck oh oh she's strafing she had pretty good movement she was down there i thought she was gonna kill me one of these uh yeah she was she was evasive i have six bats mate do you need something sorry i thought when i said submit i thought you were weak because i heard you screaming and then i saw your health and you were absolutely fine no i'm just trying to to build build build it up you know build up the emotion yes yeah yeah it wouldn't be fun just to like oh no i didn't almost die you better get some white wine yeah we gotta get some hope uh i heard a scrap this way it's an ongoing scrap um more details to follow okay good calms papa wallace ttv's involved so if you want to stream snipe uh you know where to go oh i don't encourage that behavior but i will encourage the teabagging of the gtv when he falls and then we do live oh charge rifle charlie over there someone's hanging right next to me i don't know why i'm big scanned from the left careful i'm getting shot in the back as well jenks nice then shuffle it this way somewhere there's a team in here is moving too i know if you've got a pad but this guy we can leap on his forehead i've got a gold helmet so i get my pads really fast good man 90. they dropped it down trying to drop it but i dropped the hollows right uh almost charlie's trying to make a move it looks like as soon as we put some damage into this guy i think we'd leap on his forehead we could jump on this guy too i'm ready i'm ready whenever we got some enemies okay he went that way nice i thought he was going to stay inside but he kind of oh he kind of rushed a little bit in there that's my fault did you see my tweet from earlier from or yesterday no how cool would it be to grab the arm the marvin arm right and if you dropped one of your guns you could actually equip the marvin arm and just beat people to death like a melee weapon like a sword yeah or what if you could throw it like a grenade but it just like bounces off them it does like 10 damage and then that and then i started thinking what if you could put it if you could throw it what if you could put it in fused grenade launcher and then just like because it's been launched by fuse it's got the low spin right what so we gave him a javelin he said that the marvin javelin yeah i think i'm onto something 10 damage i want to say like i'm talking 150 i'm talking crab damage a grave or damage from a marvin arm if it's like a slow projectile yeah 100 i was thinking like a little floppy throw like it's like the the the physics of it don't even make sense that's how slow it grows like the floppy throat you know it's a regular you're gonna stimulate them first mr craver or marvin arm oh i put the marvin arm on the ground it's a cool bag i'm leaving this for you if you want to get aggressive with it i'm doing it there's no way it's not this guy right it was i'm a genius i'm a genius yeah between each other though wait they were just like fake fighting no i think they were just no no no no yes sorry i still you mean yeah they will find someone wait oh no that's a replicator i thought that was a respawn beacon i was like hold up last thing oh this way reloading i don't i don't need my shield i'm using the the better version of trailer spitfire i see him down low oh no that poor guy he saw that he saw that he saw the rampage shield going up and thought this is the better way to die i feel so bad you are the apex champions oh man oh gg my friend hey
