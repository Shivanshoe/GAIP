hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we're going to be playing mirage and i don't know if you guys have noticed this as well but mirage players nowadays are just mental they are insane we all know about his buffs a few months ago that gave his decoys more health and also footstep audio and at the time i definitely saw a big increase in the amount of mirages in my game which slowly declined and now the only people who play mirage uh are apparently just the world's greatest players it's probably because he has a somewhat high skill ceiling like it's easy to be a bad mirage for example oftentimes i will use my ultimate and then i will start climbing a box showing the enemies who the real more argues straight away but if you use him correctly he is incredibly good at getting out of sticky situations which is 95 of public games at the moment before we get into today's video though a quick word from our sponsors lenovo and microsoft [Music] thanks once more to lenovo and microsoft for sponsoring today's video i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half

through it like i've finished you off mirage by the way i'm a mirage my name is too bad yeah because after today i am a mirage main and you are back to your bangalore maine actually it depends whose first place because if i'm first absolutely not seen that i've claimed him i've claimed him after you've seen my mirage gameplay you won't be able to stop me from playing him you'll want me on your team it's a mirage no no no no no no no no no have you seen my mirage game did you see that game of the day where i altered ran into a wall made them revive each other next to me and then shot them as you were down on the floor and then i revived you did you see that because now you know what it's like playing with you every single day here we go big scrap i'll see him something good there i have no anointed and even right right he's not good uh i mean i have an r99pk oh but very similar there goes xb5s yeah they're down here targets right in front of me thank you pretty low nice hold back the other team's round right reloading they got two on me yeah this is running for me huge one team left been i'm gonna pop a theme i can't last one he's not pushing he got tired still not pushing somebody sliding right side did i i think i'd have traded but i'm like i think my ping pong got me absolutely not go to the tree why i'll find i'll go to the tree i'm gonna get nothing all right you're gonna be jealous in about 10 seconds we'll see what'd you get online don't look like you have much r9 r9 and a blue helmet not impressed i'm in the rainbow like 10 other well people thought we can just leave together no one can jimmy relax sure why does everybody run at me bamboozled she's gonna not make they're gonna shoot me i like it but there's another team here maybe cracked on purple know one of you out look there stepped up will any brave souls step up to them sending out my decoy this crack on purple i think i'm writing a different game i can't tell 14 14. he's really though i'm not here for 14. i have a phoenix for you i could use that i'm throwing reloading oh man i'm actually the best mirage you're supposed to be running to the wall convincingly i started reviving right behind me not on purpose though right on purpose it was kind of nowhere what's my fault in progress yeah walls are dumb and then they use that to like plug their stream and it's like you know and then it makes makes perfect sense like wrong before gameplay i actually stopped shooting i mean i'm throwing them i guess that was the last one going for clips and it's not really happening i was going to punch her i wanted to punch her you're going for another 800 damage game of the sentence got shot by someone else i think i need someone top need i don't know going in for a clip yes for a clip i don't have any heels what am i doing are you going to use yeah there could be some other softest rope i think they found each other you're actually cracked this is why the numbers are on tick tock oh oh that's actually wasn't a decoy i just got bamboozled that reminds me i'm playing mirage oh i got destroyed uh down his teammate yeah i think he's getting charged rifled me yeah he dropped out did he i'm the best teammate ever when you're playing a rescue no he didn't he didn't you're a liar oh he did draw but he didn't i didn't say he dropped all the way i just said he dropped oh what kind of comes with these those are comms there's more comms than you give me huge comments mate yeah i appreciate that at least i don't say they're cracked when they're not cracked all right let's go triple tape infinitely worse are you are you having a laugh mate i need to hit a clip i have to i've gone down 14 times this game no i'm not with you hold on don't throw don't throw don't throw them i'm

when you're really in love with it flying through the air i'm trying so hard i'm so bad he's so committed to killing me kill him i only got here get her hurry i was actually kind of close i'm setting you up for so many good plays and clips i can't remember taking advantage of it i can't heal before i revive you because you've gone down so many times oh i'm literally i'm patting your rezzes i'm
