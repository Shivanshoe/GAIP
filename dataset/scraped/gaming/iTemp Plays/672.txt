hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so in season six everyone is talking about the vault smg they're talking about ramparts the devotion bloodhounds buff but no one is really talking about the triple take which has undergone some pretty powerful buffs as well its fire race has gone from 1.25 to 1.4 its magazine size has been increased by one for each extended mag and now you don't have to scale the map for the precision choke hop up as it comes with one already fitted it is a beast of a weapon at the moment alongside those buffs to the triple take specifically we've also had a sort of a quality of life update for all of you snipers out there in regards to the ammo counts now you'll find 12 ammo per stack instead of 8 and you can stack that up to 24 in your bank and that's up from 16. that's an increase of 50 percent for both of those you will not be running out of ammo anytime soon for snipers triple take man half man half triple take is back and this time he's even more powerful than before unfortunately but yes thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends for me there's the bottom floor has got the best one it has it really does someone's been meleed already oh that feels bad okay well i don't have a gun yes i do right i got that's surprising if you want to use that there's a mouse i'm here no no i'm good well i throw one for this guy oh thank you i'm using a shotgun too nice there is people fighting at construction if you are keen on going crazy over there i am indeed there's a mastiff here i've got one thanks a massive triple take give this a go yeah yeah i'm getting real weird all right i'm gonna hang out over here and just see if they rotate out or if they stayed in construction they're rotating out to the right they're underground right now oh it's perfect then someone's inside still i put a shield down watching the left dear lord he died oh my god nice stole that one bro this guy right here he got someone else to say hey i don't know where you know where they're from they're coming right here in a sec they're on me

i agree yeah um i kind of think that they should have just like oh wait they're not on the care back they were here 40 seconds ago hold on literally yeah i'd rather keep this trying to protect some people do you think they went i hear gunshots that train i do is 12 uh that's 64 jumped down oh they're in construction they're in construction i'm looking at them old laptop give me a huge nade trust

you a sec it's scanning what might be caustic there's a bloodhound and uh a girl legend obviously i don't know they're rushing me practice back to my tent practice that was dude that was good nice job i was really well balanced the flank i'm glad they pushed us yeah it's so difficult i was just about to go up that wire in fact i did then i i'll just chill behind a pillar you know if you're gonna aim this way uh yeah uh that's a lifeline over here by the way how far was that it was pretty close it was pretty close i don't know where exactly but no this way you know what it might be on four story maybe full story what's that again the corner building with the two ropes on it or with the rope inside the rope one big big big boy yeah it was like in this direction hundred percent it was it was a lifeline i'm gonna pop all something just keep scanning okay are you going here one little pathfinder guy one nice job mate good skins look at that bro the bank smoke to the beautiful it's a

fun to use so satisfying i love it too love it always been a big shotgun guy i haven't you know i never even liked the peacekeeper oh look that's what gave him away look how far they made it in here you know trying to make stuff diva you know look at this right where i said it was a little bit off but you wanna make yourself a diva i have ten craft materials but there's loads of like i do not i got the thrill one for uh for range and i got the flat line for up close i've got the triple take mastiff but i'm pretty much using both the shotguns at this point it's all in lucy no one's gonna be here you know what i liked about the trailer when they did uh when they did this thing when they did this building over there what did they do with it i can't remember they slid down it oh yeah you're right i've got such a bad memory you ever you ever go up there did i ever show you yeah you can just slide down imagine that play imagine these play drums okay you wore them like this and you just like bam through there oh my word imagine that i would lose my mind oh that one hit the wall one day one day what's going on up here whoa that's a good little spot why are you picking up heavy ammo wishing this is gonna be impossible mmm we got smokes we're good i have my ulti too i'm gonna go like that stir the pot up a little bit he cranked this i think i'm not going to smoke they're waiting for me trust in the old father oh that grenade landed on my lap nice job it's definitely just how dare you oh i didn't miss every single trooper take shot oh i'm signing down i smoked you but i slid

cracked uh 60 health on the pathfinder nice revenant crack 2. don't see any scans jump down 16 seconds ago you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna see if there's a little bit of extra heels in here before we get going all good still we might not be able to loot any more after this that way yeah i have one bat which is decent but thank you this guy had a bunch might as well just take these steps i'll grab these balls cause i've got two guns that don't need any all of their throwables at us i got i got more battery nice thank you yeah bro pc players are crazy with their throwables man it's like god they throw them all at once through like four frags of me and they all landed like on my on my lap i've been hit by so many today the race straight oh my god they are so difficult to hit yeah it really when you when you're when you're playing against the strafe like that oh they're no wait that's a lifeline that's not even a care package oh you know what rich i'm going zone i'm going down i'll come with you oh my god dude this is hard people are playing so passive it's insane yeah i'm just going zone oh man laser from another team now it's the revenant team everybody was just holding
