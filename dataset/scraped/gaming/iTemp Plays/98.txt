hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing the legend who i think everyone has in their arsenal everyone loves to play a little bit of mirage if you're a wraith main if you're a pathfinder mate if you're a what's in me i think every one of those people enjoys a little bit mirage on the site not like that not like that but it's just because his kit is so fun to play there is something about hearing the you got bamboozled about eight times when you pop your ultimate that just gives you a little bit of a chuckle every time i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there's like a bow battle going on over this way right do i have see i have two shield cells oh my god i've got to kill someone rob all their stuff oh my god i'm so sorry there's one right here nice job reloading shots how much do i or whatever i'm gonna use let's move that way i have to heal teammate you can revive okay target's right in front of me wake up ring's moving that thing hurts all right ladies and gentlemen we got him we wipe the squad spam goes the boozle they're on the roof or at least they were how do i get there i don't even know where they came from there's one right to save the day i don't know if this will work or not my shot's been bad but somehow i'm the kill leader and don't worry there are a huge 12 people left so we should be fine no more to the right here judging from those shots there's a guy just said that i should have decoy over there sorry guy bam to the woozle send it on a decoy yeah just go past me i don't care if he's invisible gosh job prowler i don't think anyone knows reloading isn't even following someone hey here's the question recharging shields i've had the problem went straight past me no it's trump straight past them to get to me fences yes i'm running out of ideas i might as well use a phoenix kit though it's probably just as fast as two cells in a syringe [Music] known as pinched i have fallen all right something like that we shouldn't have stayed there i can't believe my teammate stayed there we need to uh we need to basically do what i did force our way out it was our only escape route you got bamboozled shot at throwing our star you got bamboozled look at you given my shield to recharge gonna use the phoenix kit okay you know what i actually really like the charge rifle i don't care i'm sticking with it i'm not sticking with it i can't stick with it because if they're close range i'm doomed they're big scrapping though i've been scrapping over here don't think anyone landed with us can we just have a cheeky peak over here it's not just not just a cheeky pig no overcoming i know what you're thinking you're thinking rich you've got 38 light rains that's not enough and so my answer to that is i understand okay but there's some stuff on the way you see this look loads of light rains in the three times heads up got one here big third party action bamboozles for the fools [Music] oh god that must have been the last one i said you got bamboozled giving my shields are in charge i sending the know oh my god ladies and gentlemen if you need it there you go that's why you said pie because these guys can have so much stuff for us so many things so i'm going to try and stack light rains if i can you guys have many or she's got enough i suppose but i'd still like more light ammo here that's huge thank you thank you recharging shields that's a big drop too nice good start oh i don't know what to say in this situation it's like yes it's yes it's me yeah you know i'm taking shots i'm gonna try and get a bit of high ground on the left so if they try and push my team i have some opposing to cover recharging shields my shots team bamboozles for the fools it was better in my mind target this game is tough right now it's so difficult we have taken out the champion it's so gosh darn difficult no come on no no no no come on come on come on delivered incoming care package pro tip don't try grabbing something here i just gotta pack my hands up hang on one sec healing up wow we just got rocked up on by two great players apparently hey sorry i forgot you said that we got third hello i have one shield cell i've won shield cell by the way thank you tried and careful nobody panicked but we got bandits out there target spotted this is that the same skin on pathfinder shield tail here is that this third one we've seen shields it's like the green skin okay forget it and put it to light who wants to fly 400 isn't enough then we're all doomed and bam goes the boozle oh boy one of them has blue we can just push this i think we should be okay oh god good job team one squad closer to winning we would just bear it quick optics here close range just using a phoenix kit do you know what the charging shield i think i do need some more light rains what do i drop for light here i've got two guns they're both using it probably shield cells for a stack right 12 cells i've got four bats so it should be fine i'll take that nice i think that's okay considering i have a level uh what is it is this a level this is a level two you get nothing you get no space for anything no man i don't really land any shots either you guys are messing keyboard yeah i definitely shouldn't take it then you get no i ain't just that gun over here yes how about this way i can't see for jumping though you see i'll be honest i wish i didn't take the crap look at this guy look at him oh bam he'd be dead if my off the road was oh beautiful reloading please be careful not to pinch ourselves too much here you got bamboozled reloading we can't really push past that setting up my decoy we should be okay i see you nerds i see you reloading who's this guy who's this idiot where is he let's go here that's a big entry frag with the uh with the craiber from our teammate isolated the octane because he was download by himself so whilst the other two were preoccupied one was revived and one was shots reloading ladies and gentlemen is i thought that was one of us for a second he was in the corner trying to pop the phoenix i didn't see him for ages yeah ggs ggs that was fun that was so fun i love the place you can make a mirage apex champions thanks man i appreciate that i'm like stuck in the middle of the open with no shields in that pathfinder's looking at me i'm like that ramp and i just i just hold out there and shoot in the back it's sensational what a tremendous legend ggs me amigos ggs
