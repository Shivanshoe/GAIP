hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and today i'm going to be explaining why season 12 is my favorite season of apex that we've ever had now of course season zero one two and three were all amazing half because of the nostalgia and we were fresh to the game but i think season 12 would take my favorite season title just because we're so far into the game three years into the game and i'm still enjoying it so much and i think the biggest reason is the variety in today's video i was playing valkyrie and yesterday's i was playing ash horizon was the day before that then it was caustic mirage pathfinder bloodhound and it's not just the legends that are really well balanced i've used such a variety of guns this season on three really fun maps and we have control in there as well even if you do get bored of the battle royale i feel like every time i jump on i'm playing the game in a different way and it's it's just keeping it really fresh and i'm having a great time so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yes agreed it's very tough i learned these triple boxes although the last time i landed i didn't get a single good i'm happy for you i'm down catastrophic anyone land here i think so they did not deserve the title first blood shotgun bolt here level two does it because nobody did it i'm good i got havoc and power now okay yeah surely energy ammo here i got a feeling there isn't anybody here i have no idea where they'd have gone but not quite i am if you got loot i'm ready to just get down on me too i'm not gonna sit around here i don't need that heavy oh i totally just you liked it it's okay i could drive you a little bit i got a 105 i have 60 on a hemlock wings i'm mainly using uh thanks a bunch anyways well now i have 105. that's okay i'm probably not even going to really use it i got a prowler anyways i don't really like wings up they're right here reloading copy where was that at the top of the top of the hill sorry jenks the guy picked from the left ring this is i do like playing valk in this place though she's really good in this area i love playing valk everywhere dude valk is awesome she's really good she's such a cool legend sometimes let's check this quadrant i'm wings up i don't know what are you going to do up here evil shield here level 3.
