hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are giving horizon a go who got a nice buff in season 10. horizon was definitely broken on her release i think it was season seven alongside olympus her cooldowns were way too short she could spend most of her time floating in the air popping her battery for free you could barely touch her but then respawn over nerfed her and she wasn't a good legend at all in season nine they've tried to find a nice middle ground for her with this buff and i think they did a pretty good job she's useful again and you can still escape some sticky situations with her ability but she's not completely obnoxious to play against what do you horizon mains out there think about her changes let me know in the comment section so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't even land in here are they like i well king's canyon is back but i have absolutely no idea where people land on this uh on this particular map people are pretty confusing i'm actually going to take this god that's a deadly slide of all time that's the kind of deadline that gets you killed when you're trying to run away from someone and they catch one bullet on you stops you sprinting and you just you just scream and grood you know you're just done for llama tremendous don't mind if i do well i guess it's a good thing that no one was here because i've got a flat line and i've got purple if i find an r9 i am going to take it see me there's another one here all right market is far more popular than salvage and i don't know why people love markets no longer unfortunately it would appear as though the gunfight is over spotted an enemy over there hello friend you are reviving okay get me out of here i wish i had a grenade for that if i was here i could have just um i could just interrupt okay thank you teammate they left his boss as an armistice if we need it but it is a seer on dave is that too much time to heal up here let's go his ultimate on there can't even get on the bin here all right uh strange can fight if i was here i could have just interrupted the revive it would have been a little bit easier i didn't hear the octane running behind me but i was speaking so maybe i'll just spoke over it and half the squads are gone we've got to find some more people here teammate hello friends yeah some great loot though i'm gonna message these guys ask them where they looted because look at this tremendous there is someone here and i'm looking the wrong way i saw a rush mix i was marked thank you teammate i'm landing on this guy's head that's a mistake at least he didn't lifeline revive his teammates i would have thrown a spanner in the works so to speak he didn't have a gold back though so he probably would have been fine he would have respawned and maybe popped it back or something all right well we found the action if you want to find action on kings can you just fire a few bullets because the people will come he's trying to join my lot this is the worst angle to fire someone ever shields recharging it's actually sticking a revive right now no i should i could have got 100 extra first damage i did that completely the wrong order an absolute monday tragedy if you ask me well that's how you get a gunfight in king's canyon you just you kill a team uh and you make sure you don't spend too long looting because the people will come big scrap humongous crap good fight's over i guess that was them in the feed that's a panic grapple if i've ever seen one before he's trying to get up top same thing happened to them that kept happening to us we can't stick in and loot too too much teammate let's get we'll get rocked upon there was another uh fight actually south west and if they finish their fight before we did there's a good chance that they're going to try and third party so i'm going to try and defend it here this might be the play it sounds closing on the right so i doubt they've come that way was i just wrong i mean there was definitely a fight over here but i don't think they're coming this way i'm completely drawn to care packages this season because of the only two more squads why were they not full health recharging my shields this could have been the team that came from the cage that had to fight the cage but it might not have been it's sort of dangerous to assume that i could come over this hill i don't know i mean if no one comes here then we can safely assume that he was lame hello the ring is closed the shield's recharging i don't see what they are it's a shame they got to the care package first though because the guns this season from the care package is outrageous like okay i have no idea i can't even see you but that's not there's no way that's the right that's the other last team let's get some more cells here could come back the only reason the writer would come back is for banner and i don't mind if she gets it because the respawns here will probably see it there we go big scrap okay well this team's got blue armor the race is definitely the biggest threat i did a decent amount of i say we just rushed this the rate is definitely the biggest threat i think we can take the team or two pretty easy but the race seems pretty good i'm pretty sure she got gun from the care package we just need to hold hands okay so the team's getting involved too gonna peek this this team is just farming care packages apple teammates charging up i couldn't even see it i got stuck on the i got stuck on two doors i didn't just get stuck on the door i still got two doors she got the armistice look at her health oh man oh good game it was so close in the end i'm pretty sure this rate is going to win i hope she does actually because she probably deserves it with 2000 damage i could have won that but i got stuck on two doors and she got that armor switch that's unlucky here for loads too did you ever play the tony hawk ride of the skateboard like the little interactive skateboard game no i didn't oh it's so bad was he bad now i'm already it's been two seconds it's been two seconds rich i'm already getting see or altered in my face all right dumpsters like that for one second there's a bangalore behind us so if we're going to fight these we have to do it quick oh this isn't you on me you bangalore almost there make sure you just hit a 360. oh dude the lunge on on melee are hilarious i just saw him jump like five feet he's crazy glide across the air just to punch in the back of the head stressful stressful day just never stops are you streaming that i don't know this guy's not solo behind me he went straight down looks like a flying squirrel he's one she's one i can't see because your decoys flew past me you've really wanted to go okay excuse me i'm gonna send you a screenshot your awareness rich that's what it's for it's what it's there for please say shadow phoenix yes part man i was just looking at that name shake my head irl man how can you just play with that name man i just oh my god he's popping off he's going crazy too oh he's not even an acoustic he's views oh yeah what's the ball oh that's his oh god here we go happens every time every time kills we're rota we rotate too fast yep all right yeah a guy just needs to get he just needs to find his own kills i don't know what it is calm down and get his own kills i say on me i'm sick of it i'm sick of it yeah i'm sick of it too sick of it too it's just an everyday thing we should follow him let's be honest oh probably happens every time because people might have heard that but it would take them 30 seconds to get here yeah i don't know what to do i'm just going to kind of stand here i'm going to stand here too in a different spot there we go new eat look at me ready to ready for action she pegging it mate she's got 19 health what something i don't know what did i say 153 she's got 22 alph yeah she's fine i think he's a bang well she's not quick until i fire though so i can see her yes i mean sort of cavemen i don't know why teammates saw that's crazy whatever you do don't shoot bloodhound on it [Music] excuses excuses hit by this is your leg okay go down what the heck just happened i don't have my cue today i'm dead protect me i'm trying to join thank you oh my god the unboxing fades now they're fighting i want to push this team yeah yeah i'll be down with you in a second how are we live mate that that's illegal oh of course oh there's somebody in here oh my god destroyed that man get from the top i don't know like did that team just rotate around or something like what happened where did they go i don't know anymore i don't know level four might not have been so much easier if i had my queue just a few seconds before i am a mess we're alive there i mean your leg might be a bit burned but apart from that i don't know how i didn't i don't either yes that was weird kill check eight packets that impressed i know i'm not kill leader so about impressed not game for you i mean i have 10 kills but i am not happy with it sometimes it happens  this guy i need thermites the team's camping cage which is a really great spot that they added on the map i opened the door with my nades this poor guy he's going to be horrendous then you know mate i'm trying to this is actually for science only if you could still see me on the left 112 on one of them last time was the indie crack as well they're pretty much off track except one like almost i suck with horizon like it's nothing funny you guys in your third damage jesus look i don't there's damage that's my theme i don't know if i've ever trapped anyone in my horizons they're all on a ledge and i love it and as it's in me there they don't even see it coming and they all instinctively move out of the way like how did it happen ah get it together she's so difficult to use me but whenever people use it i'm screwed did you get it together i'll have to replace you with mega tone how dare you make dummy's check uh kill check dummies check how many i just saw you thirst six people in a row rich you this is not equivalent i first had one guy at the end i absolutely now you thirsted people in the middle of that fuse fight i literally saw you do it i don't think that's true i genuinely don't think that's true you thirsted the gibby in the middle of oh that one yeah but i was on the left i couldn't say past him he was too big he was too big it was just the thing it was just the kitty come on man
