patient if this was before yeah are you walking around a corner oh it's like spinning nothing up that guy's mad i mean i only hit him for like 50 but he's still furious i can just tell in his eyes you can tell yeah he was looking at me like i'm one he's just like that you know oh that's with them oh whoa what are you up to lady ultimate accelerant i actually don't know where you'd find it oh there it is underneath the med kits in there why am i running rampage and like thermites the whole game i feel like you should be doing that i don't know i've got a flatline we can switch yeah magic down to switch yeah sure join the gold mag because i don't really need it for this thank you man this is one of the worst skins possibly on the game all right well now you're not getting the extra thermite that i had so no i saw it also the one that i put on it i was going to ask you to put yours back on no it's too late come on man i can at least have the thermite uh no okay all right i was actually talking about yours you've just been scammed you've just been scammed what is your skin it's like from the new events you know i've paid good money for this oh that was trash no it matches my rampage against mars yeah how do you i do enjoy beans commerce um yes that's why i buy every alien that's true this is true the first game i'd play duplicates i've got many duplicates i've got two pathfinder two octane imagine a magic that's probably the worst thing i've ever heard yeah man i was getting cyber but yesterday my first game on uh i had the ramp heirloom and we've got my teammates said are you okay and i said yeah i'm good and he said you got the ramp heirloom already [Laughter] he's gotta be he's just gotta have the worst life ever are you doing me yes well i did because i care about my fans and i know they wanted to see it did you say i care about my family fans oh okay i was like what does that have to do let's be honest let's be honest right here if we're raiding ranking the heirlooms rampart is at the bottom i think it's not i don't even think it's close i think it's last there's not even like uh there's not even like a it's not even like a close last it's like this is by far the worst heirloom ever uh i agree i'm just i'm just fighting blue gamers oh my god the blue games are fighting back the games are flying back they're actually red on your head they're actually red games now with the amount of damage they've just done to me yeah you just fed him damage hey i did a little bit i know i'm here i think they know i'm here oh yeah i can't wait to annihilate these guys they're chilling up there they're just head glitching yep they are having a good time i swear the bullets on this gun don't go where you were expecting to like i'm actually certainly oh they don't is she flesh they've got one of the they've got one of the guns they've got one of those guns you know the ones i'm gonna do something do something about it mate okay yeah shoot at me not the guy padding up here oh they probably can't see you right i'm coming up how's that feel voice i'm on the way where are they mate by the shields oh no oh this is i'll use their own shield against them with the turret oh gosh no oh no oh no there's only two yeah just to say oh no oh god that's a huge find and you bought a blue hemlock that's like that's damn bad that's most of the ram first i'm glad you agree i'm not sure i agree with that to be honest but it's factual factual bachelor saying the gondola is like an actual human being it's taking the use of the uh public transport yeah yeah the devs put a lot of work into this and you're just not even bothering so i'll show them appreciation wait there's one on our teammate i think he's punching them thank you so much being here because i'm just opening the door with the wrench no i spent 2 000 on this wrench i missed oh down bad horrendously oh man what's your best impression uh do it dude that doesn't count that's one word that's one word what's next i've heard that before but there's not a there's a definition for impressions i've heard that before i mean it's a good one it's a phenomenal impression it is a good impression i'll give you that he's just gonna keep running i'm furious get back here bloodhound you got blue armor mate inside the next one get my shield back um i just got a no rig i just got a full mo rig he's 180

actually good it's better no it's better 100 100 is better so much more consistent yeah you could hit like consistent 45s with that every time yeah oh shut up lucky i'll be honest i let him kill me i'm not with you guys you're left i'm good yeah he's the best going on the game 100 better than speaker anyone who says it's not is just stuck on nostalgia stuck in the past stuck in the past wingman mozambique well i'm not using any i haven't used an ability this thing i know i've used shield too i'll see you guys big trade i love the helmet on i find it you know do you know what i've dissed the ramp air limb bit but this little spin animation you get and the noise it makes when you spin it is actually kind of satisfying is it yeah it's kind of nice still disappointed be honest never mind these guys are terrified i almost died did you oh i killed the guy they were fighting scanned this way back to bloodhounds like 60 health max i don't know what these platoons up to mate where are you going this guy's death box literally just disappeared oh no it's in the rock look at this this is this is where this is where i stash my loop come here kind of appreciate this oh you think i'm screwed man you think i've got nothing right just look down into that hole there wait where you'll find it you'll find it right right there you know i'm like in your fam like in your head i can see your face no i can't even see it can you not no it's not even on my screen watch watch watch or disarm switch got two armors now oh i could i could like study it and yeah i can't do that not one this you know

anything like it i'm trying to kill this team over here oh my god oh my word once looking oh didn't jump in and jump what is this game what is happening over there one's really weak over there i mean i'm trying i don't know how i'm gonna get this team off i'll be honest there yeah that's safe nor are we though i just need that oh i need to do it like this that guy's behind he's behind a load of shields over there so that he's shooting me in my back too what's that one over there i'm trying i'm trying to get over there i need to pop first i wish i had a need for this they're getting shot they're getting shot this is one hp i'm burning something corsics con away come back up come back up i'm not imagine paladin losing i just cannot imagine the scenes in the discord call that's just so sad how's that possible whoa one i used all my ammo i used all my armor i have no ammo out of here get out of here nope it's not working the ramp is one two i am punching a guy out with full red armor i'm hitting you man i can't even hit him he's impossible to hit i think i hit him once it's impossible right mate they probably came over there thinking we were the ones that have been coming up there oh man getting fast let's see what's going on i don't know this game has been i've just been i've been listening i've been messing about uh you're trying to be toxic and uh literally giving that to you i'm using the mozam nope i hear a rampage sorry oh my god this is the third one in a row should even place it down why do you need to move when you're up there oh where did my thurman go she's somewhat weak punchable punchable angle okay i was i was going up there punching but apparently you did negative damage like 800 hours do you not listen to comms no you said do anyway and i thought i'll i'm swinging mate i'm doing it for the team that's not my fault i gave you calms i told you yeah you did she started swinging back but that's when i got shook for the apex oh man that was such amazing three in a row the rampant tweets at no four in a row actually because one of those wait that was the same one that was yeah that's the same solo ampere it was the same one i'm pretty sure every team we fought was just around parts round parted up slit
