hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course we're in some platinum rank here trying to get up to diamonds and i am using a loadout that i don't think i've ever used before in my entire life it's a 30 30 repeater and a gun that i have been slating since its release it is of course the car now every time i pick this up i land maybe three shots and throw it on the ground and i sort of figured out how i should be using the car and i just have to treat it like it's almost a shotgun because really up close and personal it's absolutely devastating but anything past about 15 20 meters i can't hit a shot with this gun to save my life and i know it's an smg but so is the notes knight and i can land shaft of that range with that gun you just need to know how to use it but anyway i dropped over four thousand damage this game was a great time i hope you enjoy thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i feel kind of bad about that to be honest wait did the blue come all the way down i guess i shouldn't have come through the same place but it happened i got purple armor here instead i've got an evil shield here don't hear anyone so we should be okay of course keep your wits about you but when i've got a car with a level two mag on it and purple armor i'm not too afraid already inside the ring i think we're just going thirdly straight away i think we just get over there okay i'll leave the car from my teammates so i can catch up on fellas i'll loot on the way it's too juicy enough to get over there and get some free kp that's what ranked is about 3kp get in let's find the best road pretty sure [Applause] all right i need dual shell hello right here oh god is good choice good work kill leader recharging shields i need we got this medkit here listen let's not feel shield here level one grappling repairing my damages i have no heavy yeah get out of that teammate lay down one of them recharging shields no i saw my that's all my life oh my god heavy under three times i'm going to keep this they spotted me i'm taking it i'm so much heavy so much heavy here i go boy i need to recharge my shields stop walking in front of me [Music] out to go crazy i guess i'm having every single kill taken here as long as it's my team and i'm mind reloading when the car came out i thought the light and heavy ammunition options were going to act differently i thought the light was going to have less recoil and i thought the heavy would have more recoil but more damage it just makes sense if it's heavy i didn't mean to slide off the edge of the roof no please yes the potential big potential peak potential actually humongous potential recharging shields oh my god i missed one too many shots there with a 30 30 but they're three times like that range the wingman is always gonna be there always recharging my shields contact got our friends banner this is great we go back here and we leave it's the age old question these are good teams here but the path was good his strife was good i'm gonna stick it i'm gonna stick it enemies i guess oh my word there should be so much loot here for my teammate as well fresh off the spawn there was another revive safe too that's good comes from the teammate i cancelled the healing to push that guy okay if you guys wanted the variety when was last time you saw me use a 30 30 in a car combination you know it's not something i'm terribly comfortable with this combo you can see sometimes it's they say you're slapping and sometimes the 33 slapping me metaphorically because i'm because it's hurting my chances of that doesn't make any sense sometimes i'm good with this gun sometimes i'm bad that's what i'm trying to say here we go perhaps one did they land what are they doing wait what what's he say am i going am i getting too eager again were they getting chased no they're only two of them and one's got blue i'm not too terrified we don't have to push there's only two of them and one of them's got blue i don't know we don't have to push but we can have a look there's a team here as well i don't know if you know okay oh nice shots when he said on me i was about to grapple directly too i got scared do you want to push up is that what he said morning my teammates get in that team i don't care about that receiving damage crazy the blue tank sort of kept me on the thermometer for about three years so i kind of do care about that i took three ticks of damage right there i need shields any bats you know that's where you know keeping my eyes here i mean i have 20 cells the cells aren't the problem get ready it's zipline time yeah let's get back over there we still need to right i could definitely stick the uh the recon but i think we'll be okay we've got a care package landing i think we've got all this behind to ourselves like that guy might go back for banners he was an octane i didn't want to chase him it seemed a bit unnecessary g7 scout here you know what i'm absolutely down absolutely got thanks i didn't enjoy my time with the uh the old 30s though i must say one thing that disappoints me about the scope reloading probably this guy shooting at me again i told him yeah it must be anyway let's take some of this just because i can switch it on over here that's a nice nade are you thermite friend i'm running out of ammo on this scale already i could farm damage here for my 4k but i've already got a 4k badge on pathfinder so i really don't care it's going to get the teammate up i've got to find an extra 200 damage there let it be known nice job team giving my shields a recharge to be honest you'd probably pop small heels but whatever healing up any bats any mats on you no okay i've got 80 shots left that's decent right that's fine i know the care package there is this guy want to get farmed still or what let's go this way let's try and stay on this knuckle side firing i mean all the last teams that i view this side of the bridge i'm pretty sure unless there's a rat behind us dead enemy shield got them as much as i want to i'm going to refrain and i'm hoping this isn't a vault because i actually want to stick with the car it's been doing a lot of work for me oh my god no here the whole point of the video i'm supposed to be using the car you got to use that teammate you got to use it to be fair i could have went g7 volt my old combo tell me someone took that yeah ray took it nice we got around here just the two i'll just get some angles on these guys they might sit behind that they went inside down then rotate down that and rotate i missed there was someone aiming at me from i don't know clown there lucky me yeah [Applause] all right three teams left i think these two wait we have to go to them is that safe that's safe we can find our way over though or we can race for if we need to these teams gonna have to fight each other kind of soon i think they sort of have to rotate around the clock let's move i was on the roof that i can see hello opening fire [Music] out of there i can't really beat this no i can't beat that he wants to give me a 4k okay i'm climbing i'm climbing the building i'll see you guys at the top you are the apex champions gg i'll say it anyway just in case my mic wasn't working i didn't know gg me goes hey another 4000 damage game i've had i've had quite a few recently huge i had 14 kills since when he said a shoe yep g7 playing work gg
