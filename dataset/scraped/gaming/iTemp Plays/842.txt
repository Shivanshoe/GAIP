hey was a guy's ETH welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are here in the fire range and the reason we are here in the fire range because I wanted to show you this weapon it is of course the new one the Sentinel I used in the previous video that uploaded earlier on today and I just wanted to show you how this works so the regular damage 65 to the body and then a hedgehog is 130 however if you pick yourself up a shield battery I already have one you can press the left on the d-pad on PlayStation 4 to do this animation which charges it up and you can see in the bottom right it says disruptor that ball will go down and whilst our BIOS all active your bullets will do increased damage to shields it's just like disruptor owns from before however once they are sheila's he still goes back to 65 damage this guy will have shield they've taken a shot off it does increase damage every time you shoot the disruptor rounds go down a little bit so it's one shield battery you might be able to knock all the shields off an enemy team if you are and land in your shots but anyway I've got a gameplay here for you we'd be swept and I hope you enjoy if you do be sure to give like rate and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends you've got to go to the harvester oh my gosh both my teammates right expenses I forgot to put my trail on my leg Beck's prepared to with one day left and I've got a permanent trail you probably hasn't even put it on yes all right this is the harvest at this is the planning officer and I assume it's going to be a bit of a hot job here torching for me my teammates are looking pretty good dropping in with their fancy contrails not like me give me thank you French Maddie's in a weird way I came punched hey stop it now punch out like you wanna get T 20 times if I'm using a website on both my good team yet absolutely nothing good yes you are nice work I guess [Applause] I can't deal with these sites or Sentinel sniper this has been a soggy pretty good on this actually after the Lifeline still has no does he need it no he doesn't need it he opted for me thank you friend and that's a shocking mo someone asked for that think he might be Nikita alright three kills I bought the bow pass in its entirety and I've thrown on every single battle passed in of gnarnia you know momento por war teammates I thought what she was gonna walk forwards both no shots are incredibly close Amy down nice so he's reviving though messed that up two assists don't want too much done so quotes the shots are so close that the last one wasn't that close but the one before that I mean all the ones before that Road must have been given people haircuts and painting silhouettes and my buttocks around their bodies you know that's how close we're talking here Oh couple slug stuff I think that might make this zoom in quicker I'm not entirely sure all right well I don't need any sniper rounds I thought I did there's a respawn beeping my friends my teammates done up too interested just anyone easy I thought that that's what's gonna be the charge mechanic I thought it was gonna be something involving the precision choke I guess water got the triple take for that tears are coming over I was just going to stand back and snipe if they if they didn't decide they wanted to scrap unfortunately they do place is down exactly where you start the animation you can't start the animation then slide for example now shields messed him up shield Weiss that was one shot was he I really want those purple fields move on those purple shields is this cheeky quite possibly ponies in abilities she showed us anywhere just the Shuar oh my god another assist Michael take the L star name I mean I'm running of like ammunition my team at leech has like one health she's answering geez I've got a few of my own I'm gonna try and help I gotta try to help a lifeline especially because I stole her purple shields I mean it was kind of half and half there we go bit of teamwork I've got a decent although day it's an interesting load as well you know it's a better sight after me because the Sentinels obviously new so it's still extremely fresh 99 mm-hmm I'm keeping the L star the honor to know mister he was it was nerfed the damage was reduced a little bit not too much and also that the L star was off see a care package weapon last last season but they've changed that as well nice job teammates I have to shell cells and no shell batteries and if I define - your battery I'll be tempted to use it on a sniper I know well so hopefully I'll be in life I got the same idea here I love the red tint around the map now it used to be so blue me more curls heading over here that is I tell you what lovelies character more and more lines up top thank goodness cuz I used to hate coming to train yard if i wasin if i wasn't a fine again up top was horrendous where is this place there's it that wasn't meter okay this is let's try the top there yeah coming here when you won't pathfinder last season was so bad you couldn't get up there it was such a struggle and people just can't believe with like watts and fences and stuff at least you've got an option now won't be good to see around with a sale sniper day blue shield Matt just looks so nice these red tint it's like I'm playing with a filter honest with me or I'll go for kills there 18 of the people left the storms going to closing on that way but I don't know if anyone's come in it doesn't look like it to be honest Nick we might be solo over this way I can eat people scrapping in scraps or seasick I means let's sent over their envies five is an absolute mile away though you can just he loses he fine over that doesn't even sound like scraps I'll sit anymore sighs like more towards the plenty half-step they've all had been there I'd like this to end describes our city because with a sense I'll sniper I should be able to pick people off with this thing guys I'm one of them okay shields I need them I still don't want to drop the extended line mag I still don't want to drop it because I think that the L star just eats energy roams and they're sort of hard to find hey Ralph I can't say friend there's maybe two play that's gonna play a really aggressive name is obviously I get killed while seeing this mode and a respawn back up top the shadows I don't want to waste my I don't waste my shots on like shadows even though you need to kill them there dove respawn right next to us with like full shield really low health but really love shields and with the l star if you find too many sharks eat just overheats and whatnots not worth it that's all play that little bit tactically looked at though finally good grief the whole t-bag video drum back there he goes is it tough - 39 shots I have so many sniper aims though if I could find a different kind of gun got ten seconds on the on the brink I always call it the storm my teammate needs any drones as well I've only got 39 I've got enough time here it's annoying I haven't got back down but I want to different kind of good I've got this level three content like now if any of these guys are using one-dimensional weapons and I'll throw one there it's got an annoyance no I'm not using that teammate sounds those extra million under Isaac I'll drop my Laurel three extended mags in ninth person this box there we go I go on thank you friend take it I can't ping it just to make sure he's got it alright zones committing six kills nearly top 10 we can call chase both want to miss apex predators remember we're closing on scraps or crazy so I thought he's voice long it's over two of the squad's left I still have an extended sniper Mac I've probably seen one but the thing is I'm not sure what they look like well I I know they look like but my brain isn't looking for them you know I'm not too familiar with them I probably left a fair few behind here I think chin of toffee is probably our best bet I've got my sniper my bolt-action sniper I'm not gonna charge it up it's my only shield battery if I had to I'd probably do it even though it's already ill-advised why are we looking friends I see my landed the shot come on gotta plenty two shots in succession I'm not sure I can get there in time but that's maybe stupid you're probably stupid some schmuck all my word basically so satisfying it's not as satisfying good on the game maybe not as satisfying as the Kramer because you know it's doing a lil bit more damage but good you can pick up off for the ground hey I didn't rosie was still over there stopping old shield man yes I thought you're on Watson finding skin suits wasn't even a skin suit he was a robot's there's a fellow robots stole back y'all least we got one yeah it's borderline racist you know I'm actually offended then at work that we're going to try and use the zip line there so I think I've halted their their advances we love their to play a little bit aggressive our container this is the fight on the revenant expert take that I can't even use it if you name that's why himself I think he was a nice try I'm coming out of shadows I bet that there are like one health I can just play that go on revenant tonight's messing them up one guy left I didn't expect you to challenge our you're not expected to challenge that's what the first game on PlayStation today at least not ever obviously look at the states of that legendary skin my friends good grief oh my god that's not why I want to do don't leave the game I want to see my stats there we go eighteen hundred and twenty I damage nine kills eleven kills coming out a lifeline 1970 what is that two times two is 144 more damage than me two more kills sees about right she was messing them up at the start three kills out of the crypto but when you're in the drôme you're not getting any kills it more of a supportive character that was an excellent game fortunate for me I - apex predators on my team the the Sentinel sniper is I know I set it in the game incredibly satisfying to use the same to me there's something about bolt-action snipers you know Oh level 101 on the bow pass on our way to the tier 110 skin thank you for watching friends I do appreciate it grow these challenges I've completed thanks washing I'll see you on the next one [Music]
