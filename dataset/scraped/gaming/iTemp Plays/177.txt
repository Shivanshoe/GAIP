hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing a legend who got buffed a good amount they had like six different buffs to their kids recently but it wasn't enough i do not see anyone playing watson where is she i don't see her anywhere i see a lot of octanes see a lot of race i see a lot of pathfinders i even see quite a few ramparts but watson is non-existent in the meta i really like the buffs that they gave her i really like her heirloom even though everyone likes to say it's terrible i actually think it's pretty decent i love the sprint animation when you start to sprint and she fumbles it you know it really fits the character i'm not paid to say that but some people would believe i actually quite like playing it but what could they do now to improve her kit to make people want to play i just don't know but anyway i've got a great game here for you today with a load of kills a load of damage i'm sure you will enjoy thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah a lot of a lot of people are cascades actually i don't know why that place sucks my game position here isn't optimal i will say that this optimal you could say i have p20 mozambique the two guns that i always get to start the game for some reason did you loot this one that quick okay well i've got nothing my guns are real bad i'm gonna have to loot just one more building hold on we're safe i'm gonna have to be quick though we go there we go i'm on the way on the way let's go here oh i thought these guys were rushing it probably not wait rampant doesn't even have a gun okay well that's an absolute tragedy i'm gonna have a little cheeky peak this is what i'm talking about you got two guns now energy ammo here if people are throwing p20 20s over here it's not these guys are looted and why not you know just gonna have to get over there and see what we can do we are not alone look over here they're coming i'm going to stay on the roof until they're here why can't i spring does anyone know there was the guy that was uh reviving was the guy that got revived i was expecting the guy doing the reviving was the strong one because either guys should be healing you know that wasn't the case and that is the classic third party i got three kills from me uh we came from like this way i reckon mill and checkpoints are absolutely full of people over there i didn't even get any of these what's going on if anyone sees one of these please let me know not much but it's um actually let me use that there's a few times on the ground there cracked reloading nice sorry teammate i was trying to first i don't know why not stop squad more people check money this amount of people left i assume some people will be coming out this way sometime i'm watching this soon for movement just topping off my shield whenever the ship goes over checkpoints there's always so many people to come over that way this team might have honestly come this way as well because the doors are open it's the first time first think we spotted coming out this way so maybe i'm wrong maybe no one's going to be here i don't know it's tough to know isn't it it's tough to know you can predict maybe the first part of the game but after that you're struggling the circuit is complete i'm shooting this way i was right but to be honest i don't think it's checkpoint i think it's like this way let's go that way sounds so far okay maybe down here [Music] oh my god this guy's face has got melted off the old face melter i defeated an adversary we're one step closer i quite like the 2-4 yeah i think he's up top i heard metal beforehand let's give this a go i need to i can drop my teammates are here maybe not the weirdest ones you've ever seen i still think there's a chance people oh there we go he was up top nice i still think there was like two more teams maybe in the zone or something anyone passes through here we'll know i don't like how far you can put the fences although it's a bit uneven i thought i'd be able to get at least like here oh here we go yeah big scrap although i'm scared what the heck's going on here it's a family spiders zoomed in you can't miss oh no that's going to destroy it even is it careful they're getting shot on the back we need to move up here i'll remember that someone on the left i think that's who my teammate's trying first guy at the back too pretty sure anyway what do i need a few light rains some bats at least one of those apparently no batarinos all right now i'm getting all that reigns from these heads moving i'd move the two to four it's so good if you get used to the variable scopeness because before i used to like grip my controller like i was trying like i used to just destroy my controller when i played like there's no finesse at all just pure grip ah guys i'm absolutely just shooting you in the back i know this guy i've played franklin before he's actually a really good player that runic favor i've played him a few times i think in ranked towards the end of last season really good player let's go here uh this one's easy you're right uh not much you can do in a 3v1 though at that close range i mean it doesn't matter how good you are if there are three people holding hands and two of them have got red i mean how many bullets is that alone like even if you had like a spitfire i feel like you wouldn't have enough bullets he had to try though his team's banners were timing out it was towards the end of the game you got to commend him for it and now hopefully we can just shoot some people in the back that's the plan it's always been the plan the problem here is that you don't know if they're fighting for prowess or not i think if they're partying you rock up the probably start fighting you instead you're doomed i know they are shooting each other let's go here please please no please does that work i think i think they at least get distracted and start shooting it or biting it even yeah there you go they're distracted pretty sure they were firing from this way we could just go zone if we need to we can always turn around though we should just get safe i think wait no which way do we go this way we should move here yeah that just leads to antenna that's no good to us although we might be able to might be able to have a little cheeky peek there might be this a minute to hit way i have a care package hmm watch this impenetrable defense anyone passes through here this way it's just easier i think it'll be safer this is one of those fun games on storm point where everyone doesn't die straight away like i actually really enjoy storm point when the lobby stays alive and you can have gunfights in all different areas of the map that's when storm points good storm point isn't good when everyone lands checkpoint or antenna or barometer or i don't know fish farms no one likes fish here let's be honest that's a tough shot i tried for yourself an idiot i'm gonna makeshift skates this is a fake skate oh god it didn't take me as far as i thought he's foul caught in that's good i mean he's stuck there shoot him he's stuck in a tray he's glitching out oh god they're coming too much this has happened too many times we're standing all in each other's ways die he's that's coming over he's too good at it he's got the crazy strife i've ever seen who's even still alive here that guy's strafe was was actually crazy i mean if you also kind of the damage i put into my teammates back of their heads i've easily got a 5k badge here he comes what the heck oh that's huge please all my 4k 3k yes i know he's that falco's into the tree oh my god that is taxi i'll play guys he's champions oh my god my mic's in the way i can't type properly a huge nice little 3k is watson okay
