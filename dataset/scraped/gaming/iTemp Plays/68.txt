hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course we are back on our solo diamond escapades our solo diamond adventures and i have discovered why on earth shiv has played bangalore and got 200 000 kills on bangalore as a solo player it's because she is so well suited to getting out of those sticky situations i mean as you can see in the background i have escaped with my life on every occasion because of one or two smokes my ultimate and my passive and then i just basically spin around in a circle and i confuse myself and therefore i confuse my enemies you know they can't track me i've even got this hiding tree technique down i got rushed by a team of three they were right next to me i did a circle around a tree log and then climbed into a tree and they left me alone they couldn't figure out what happened i hope you guys enjoy the uh the solo diamond adventure here because not all of the games i'm going to be showing you are you know like a 4k badge in diamond where we just steamroll the lobby i have to adapt to the way that my teammates are playing and it changes from game to game and that's what i think makes it so interesting it's just a really nice mix-up away from the regular public game lobbies that i've been uploading for the past like three years now so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all with some gameplay in five and a half seconds my friends heard that hemlock why do i never see this anymore i never see hemlocks anymore devotion here got an evo shield here level two why don't i see him anymore it's weird all right we've got three blues that's actually pretty huge that's a good start first blood gotta be someone glad it's not one of us that company out there reloading got time for that up wash my back don't you worry about that so this is a separate team right because the other one was like say uh someone else watch my back this separate team i need that heavy i could also switch that r through one whilst i'm up here so who's the [ __ ] like which are they dead draken i don't know what happened let's check out this area giving my shields i didn't actually want it to reload my hand locked there i'm gonna save some bullets the heads we actually won this fight though give me a sec we have to move we have 30 seconds to move delivering care package let's check out this something good this way heard that care package touching down they usually carry rare platforms we just have to get out of here which way did my team want to go i'll just follow them this could be better because it's higher ground you get pinched quite often in that little chunk point a little bridge area this isn't the best give me a second choke point either i've got one kp from that [Music] two different times spotted an enemy over there three to one he said three two one that was his countdown not him saying he was gonna count down right the chimney hold tight i got your back thanks i smoked some off up top too so should be okay there we go not bad not bad it's because you always took that straight away i'm not getting pinched always oh that's unlucky because i thought we could like horizon queue up with my ultimate knocking on my fire ground okay i guess she got caught off guard a little bit you must watch all back yeah we were lost lobby split too all right this is a horrible spot one of the worst i can think of i hate diving board i honestly think diving board should be eliminated from the game any bit of cover like that it's just so it's just so stupid so difficult to get up there without certain legends who's the heck you're shooting me i don't think oh my god he's not lying shield battery here it's all team arrived i basically cracked the race but it's not much we can do about it like we can rush them stuck his arm show it's not gonna do anything easy how boost did he give his arm shield how stupid is that i mean they're getting kind of beamed by everyone they're gonna have to hop out which way they're gonna go broken enemies good smoking dj i think we have two digits on the team they're gonna have to come out this way they're gonna come out this way right here can you guys hear that might be a decoy which way are they going should be almost 20 seconds rings just ahead shields recharge three bets nice job absolutely not can we see in here yes if they give you sound as well more heavy for me i don't have a i don't have a keybind to change it to a single fire put some trust in for my team right behind us or something no i have three bats excels let me know if you need them said let me know if you want me to drop i reckon they thought i said can you drop some or something because i'm stacked on all right let's go this way i'm down i'm gonna go 2kp oh we cannot are they safe that way yeah they are behind that rock they are giving my shield to reach out back which is good that team up top has to move soon as well roping back i think broken enemies 122 with that that's outrageous promise even if we knock one of them up there this team on top is what a group what a load of griefers can't wait for them to have to hop down to the water they're the worst man start with the chimney are they half they have their hearts well he's one dude he's both my smoke freak though why did i smoke that they're needing us play this house play this house you have to come in [Music] this charge tower here heads down airstrike danger this team isn't too much of a bother it's more this team my aussie give me a second can you not do that this has always been the team we need to worry about more damage either oh behind nice job they've got a fuse which might be a bit troublesome here up that's what me doing that's not gonna do anything i've done good damage here's my knock down if you need i think they win this i think they win this he's got a massive though nice teammate last one i'd go doubted the zone i think what played guys huge nice i think good damage at the end why did i not get my alt back because that would have brought us the game like so much easier i was going to wait for like 10 seconds left or like five seconds left and then they would have been absolutely screw magrude but i don't know why didn't work i'm really confused nice team wait i only got 5kp that's a scam that's a scam
