hey we cigars it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and as I'm recording this introduction the old templayer has reached new heights we've just hit 800,000 members 800,000 subscribers on the item to channel here so I just wanted to say thank you to all the people who are new around here to all the people who've been here the last year of Apex and all the people that have followed my YouTube channels for the last 10 years that will say thank you so much for all the support I'd really do appreciate it today we are playing a bit of caustic for a few reasons one I wanted a bit more variety in the people that I play I'm often to see pan around the map as Pathfinder I do play a little bit of revenant when he claimed that I think got voted maybe three games is revenue which is not bad and now I'm playing caustic but I do have an ulterior motive as to why I'm playing caustic I had a great video idea okay you know revenant listen to this game reverence ultimate are you going you use it you only take damage on your health when your health reaches zero it teleports you back to the revenant ultimate I'm gonna play course deke I'm gonna find someone else's revenant ultimate and place my own gas traps there they're gonna teleport back trigger my gas and instantly die tell me that isn't ingenious it's gonna in a bit difficult but we'll get there eventually I'm sure it doesn't happen in this gameplay but hopefully within the next week or two we're gonna be able to pull that off it's gonna take a while so yes thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll sue one in five and five seconds my friends it's also cities me amigos that is that exactly an object I mean I don't know Matt maybe it's getting old to me because I'm the one that has to say to myself about eight times a day and seven out of those eight times no one else ever gets the hearing it's just me saying scrapple cities my friends just to myself over and over again no no it's no I listen I'm a big fan fan but I'm also even though this guns been nerve to season four for some reason I'm an even bigger fan of the online on out that I was in season three maybe I've just got a bit more experience with it I'm not entirely sure they say we know it's not a wingman that it's a Mozambique shock and rains a little bit too late all right well scrap the sounds dead it's not really scrap at all well at least we've got ourselves a lord khandoba the flatlined iron sights you can actually see the color that I've bought you're shooting because of the hood gaps in the in the iron sights here level two oh my friend I've got one here very much do appreciate that also got myself a goal to barrel stabilizer as well which is always nice to happen the online tonight either flatline no not not a wingman give me that I've been enjoying this gun recently not we third the barrel scuffing especially not any online snow near get out of my ventric not a fan third level to shields tents instead of I live in LA County all right who's getting respawned subject spotted it there it's not a close one is the one on top of the building unfortunately will it further away another level to shield another level to shield I want to get involved in something here friends because I haven't even seen anyone yet and I'm getting a little bit honesty I mean let me go up a trap down and costing the first time since 1997 I reckon it's been a long time yep I served me on my friend or two of them objects here close range best song in the game barrel stabilizer what sounds further away right someone's down oh I think we can track him in here house I want to talk about it some of those shots were close some of them some of them weren't but some of them could have he he was like 50/50 mister behind us so I have to try and dine him as soon as I could it's a patter I'll don't do this to me again so why don't use the women at much if you're wondering this is the exact reason but sometimes I'm good with this weapon sometimes I am NOT good with this weapon that's cotton don't bother finish the kill let's pop this man I love it sit far away I will land up wingman shots are promised get back here please where are you going this guy's lap unis here so close stop embarrassing me on my own video thank the Jonas twist for that champion Daniel good grief I'm stunned listen I'm using the wingman steel because this is this is my theory ok if it's 50/50 whether or not I'm gonna lend a shot and I've already missed 50 shots must care package in the distance and then over then it then I should line 50 shots in a row now so there needs 50/50 does that make sense I assume that make sense so now I'm not gonna meet for the rest of the game and I is the reason this guy's gotta take the cap how cute it's why pathfinders I'm fee you just steal the care package wait from the poor caustics that have to run over there back it up rubber man this is mine obviously a first kind of nuria fine I'll run off I'll find some shelled elsewhere I've got six shell here six cells and that's see these wanna drop some for me but it's not the battery it's not the batter I'm not interested all right well there are 23 people left I got myself two kills and a bunch of cardio done to be fair chasing the octane a ton of cardio decent battery i'll find important most i have anyone this lobby at the moment i don't think i've shot they're not looking too interested green so looking over here and review it might be one of those situations where I have to lie to them mmm I don't looking too interested oh no so Intel ours it there's an enemy here oh I'm chasing down I'm gonna get him please come over please we have listen-only here doesn't even look looted unbelievable this might be so confusing I'll have games where everyone's learns at Scrabble City and the game's over within 5 minutes and then we'll have games like this where there's just no one to be found I don't even want him I've got a sure batch now I'm fine no well there is a scrap in the distance at the very least train yard will never let you down the only problem is I mean cause it's no actually think about I was going to say train yard as bad as costing because you can't get upon that all bird cage thing is you guys Tommy that would call per kg so which is a good name for them but now the bad about it those dollars it blinds so I should be fine and once you're in one of the bird cages as a core stick you are laughing the kind of clothes I should be okay I just want go mental until though around they'll hear me fire and they'll see me probably being downed and stuff and then over and over here we go he's been waiting for literally scratching my face toldja subtracted from the mean is another team here but I told you I'd land a few we man charts eventually oh no the course deke okay I'm gonna have mine into the mix this is man you don't get any a mrs. drew in the caustic gas and it's really confusing to go from having a mister not having a me sees that quickly he's so off-putting just anything if they use that's a planetary that's gone all the way name the two kills I'm still not the kill leader six kills unbelievably someone's popping off that's gonna say was that only me I've got a thing you better caustic gas there you go getting back up there only heard one zipline is under the one I do have more gas why wouldn't let me place it down I shall love it in there is actually trying the revive there's another team or by download we need to tame them that last one not hate call these guys that Blue Shield's annoyingly spotted close - upon into the sunset literally a floating Bangalore head it's literally a floating head I'm not to zoom in there laughs I remember ticking them a little bit back to her note and whitie nightstand when that thermite unfortunate timing I'm gonna be little bit behind here friend careful I think there are two of them maybe three it's like a Pathfinder I heard a race before all I can do is launch one of these that's it we're on the same team Hammond I should never pick a wingman up ever again I think that's just that's what that's what I've learned this game I think that I should never pick when I begin the last two teams are fighting here I thought I saw some purple shields on finding the kill leader as well well they're scrapping teammate and it sounds like they're in scrap its all 60 which is annoying because we spend 25 minutes a scratch-off City and there was three people there if it's honestly not worth losing I'm not sure we're going to get there in time but hopefully we can at least get a few shots and then West when the winning team is looting the losing team all I can hear is the symphony of our knives nines in the distance slamming scrap salsita they're at the train train tracks or whatever drove ultimate coming down ta this is the most important thing I promise you if you had 25 bullets I'd still say get the hair King freak involved I'm not gonna I'm rapping I was thinking about it but he's Pathfinder and he could just grapple to safety I'll tell you all that got away we're on there absolutely gone away one day my wingman shots I just please please don't leave a comment bullying me about my wingman cuz I'll just I'm not gonna pick one up ever again and that's what's gonna happen I'm in nearly 2,000 damaged caustic by the way he's sold fun I need to get bit I think I wasted his ultimate twice that game I was hit twice kind of I mean I did do damage with it but they just ran out with it I need to I need to I need to wait until they're in an enclosed spot maybe I should have launched it into the bird cage if I didn't waste it that would have been a genius idea upon my word this man he's fine I would like to say that you're gonna see some more cause the game plays but I'm not gonna commit because I said that bad Bangalore and he did already happen yeah I'm Matt blew that one that is why you just run you've run when there are three squads left and a new to a fighting you'd it's good you got to get over there now is the reason why thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one mmm-hmm
