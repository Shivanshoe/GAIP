hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the anvil receiver hop up is back in season eight which means that it appears on the legendary r301 and i put it to great use in the game that i have for you today dropping over 3 000 damage i'm sure you guys are going to enjoy it also i wanted to mention that i attempted a youtube live stream earlier today and it was lagging for no reason whatsoever so i ragequit youtube to do a test stream on twitch.tv and 1000 of you guys came over and watched the stream over there which was amazing i had no tech issues whatsoever and i'll definitely do more twitch streams so if you're interested you can drop a follow on my twitch channel item it'll be the first link in the description i was bad with corn app subs and big donations um because i didn't have any of the alerts set up or even a push to deafen on discord anything like that but i will for the next stream so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends live aboard oh that's just not what i expected diving board what's wrong with dylan boyd i was gonna land um there but anywhere that's contested i suck so all i can do is that's my plan you cannot shoot me yet are you let me know when you are idiot can get it all out get it all out why would you ever do that to me people getting mozambique in their back pocket they think i'm going to land on everyone uh whatever i've been saying rachel whatever i've been saying it's terrible people are so weird when they have a gun off drop like when they spawn with a gun it's so weird it does happen on khan as well yeah because the pr the little pistol is insane i hate that one one of the best guns ever i hate it but like it wouldn't even do anything because the the the melee is so ridiculously empty in that game that it like it wouldn't even help taking the pistol off no i feel like punching people's even worse you destroy people can't even react i saw someone reply i think it was to you and they said and they said like people still melee on this game too so yeah if you get punched by someone at least it sends you flying you can get out of it i think the game sticks to you i broke one by the [Music] i need some energy desperately i have i have 136 that i cannot drop whoa whoa whoa i have 11 shots in a mozam thank you oh that's a lot of energy thank you okay check these boxes there's a heavy mag up here purple i've still got most i'm going to take a r3 oh extended heavy mag here backpack here level two don't worry it won't slow you down then the attachments too that's one thing that's great about this game too is being able to like swap a gun and whatever attachments to fit on that gun will swap like the auto like a better attachment you can just pick up it auto swap yeah all those little things are just oh and you don't have to worry about whether an attachment is bending either it's obviously it's just better yeah apart from sights have to worry about like in a call of duty just random attachments doing absolutely nothing that they say they do that's just it's such a cool concept but it's been executed probably the worst that anything has ever been done it's just so bad i've gone off and it could be amazing it really could that's the annoying thing i'm away they're somewhere i don't know if they're um yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah they're right here right right here dude what this dude just instantly starts are shooting rich i don't even know uh you've just been destroyed by big biscuits how does that make you feel biscuit is actually just embarrassing oh they're both one nice uh lifeline is going to rest she's down here he's still low growing she's still low ground i'm gonna full send it should i send it uh right here she's low ground still she's going towards the teammate now oh i fell off i'm gonna raise i'm gonna race i'm gonna race oh you shouldn't hop down oh i can't raise you there oh no i dropped all the way down you're good you're good nice okay so how did you guys a big biscuit come on come on come on [Music] she just laid out she just lit up eight seconds like from i even turned a corner yeah because they were just spamming you i'm afraid sometimes that's life mate sometimes you've got to admit it yeah i guess so i need energy so terribly i'm in desperate desperate desperate need although i could just take these light rains and then switch out i mean i got a gold energy meg if you want to go on any energy mad there's one in here i am i'm chilling i've double our 301 for the boys for the squad this is not a knight i'm the best animal uh receiver player this game's ever seen and it's not just let's focus on the good stuff i heard you using that and i was like okay um is this going to work yeah absolutely i was just absolutely demonstrating it it actually is really good when you get the gold archer at once you just got to use it oh it was ochio yeah i have a gold offering nice oh one miami i have really no idea what's going on back to rising uh he's right on my head i need a better bag for a level three bag uh i'm not sure i'm gonna craft one uh how many bars do you have uh four do you want two uh yeah i have zero go there's two any will do there you go all good less effects on you because you haven't done enough damage to get yours ready yet but no i mean when you're just as fast as a player as i am honestly i'm not gonna go that down that road i have 575 damage so you know you have your game all right rich okay you have your one out of 20 games all right and i will let you have it you're doing a great job and i am all here for you uh big big big i think i didn't want to go there okay independent so you use an ability for nothing is what you're telling me i'm still sending out there hey um this is the proper route no i had phone over this way so look oh they're leaving it horizon spawn [Music] please jump down i down one i'm going down he dropped he dropped himself killed that bridge he's blind he's one shot behind the tree i believe in you yeah that's dead he's dead nice i know i probably shouldn't have done that i'm sorry you could i just i i i had to i know i had to get up there until my pad came and i've only just got it you need to do you need any healables uh i'm okay i'm popping them up honestly the veil will scope with the the little anvil kinda nasty i mean i feel like if i'm gonna use that i'm bill i'd probably prefer that over the like two or three times because i don't really like the two or three times but that literally isn't i think the resin uh the two or three times oh okay rich where is he oh there no english rich yes okay just making sure i do i feel like if i'm full auto i'm one times and then if i'm going anvil i'm going two times you know yeah yeah replicators they went towards um what is that a pulsar guy oh no there's not even anywhere to go over there really hear him right here company and then for you to sell me chickens what's that we could check out here like close behind this rock but like once further back yeah right here all right i'm just looking for names i don't oh i knew he's going to be craiger there's no headshot cracked race am i right to my right another team okay okay for the last two teams so both of them that's anyone
