hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and so far and i are playing joe's in trios as it's just more fun than playing regular joes it's a little bit more difficult as whenever your random teammate gets knocked there is about a 42 chance that they just straight up leave the game and you're left 2v3 unfortunately this was one of those games the 42 chance came true and we were left alone in the apex wilderness but we just started beaming it was great so thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed today's video if you're new around here be sure to subscribe and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends and it's just like an average game for both of you guys right um i'm getting kind of nice i'm getting kind of nice in the keys though oh okay i'm getting better getting better i'm looks like some grandma maybe replacement if you wanna watch these watch these i was i've been playing so much cod i'll jump shot you right now you'll do it guys oh my god get rolled i don't even have an armor get rolled first you've been outplayed it really happened it's crazy come on i've got you on the are they

accidentally shot some of those down whoa i've never heard lifeline say deep so enthusiastically he's really happy did you hear that yeah he's very happy that's what he sounded like he didn't hear it i did was that a good impression that yes i think you're a pressure i think your impressions are good no thank you honestly i think they're decent uh i just want to hear some more best impressions yes hold on this is one question you want shawn where are you hi extended heaven what is that to be you want some i'll give you have you never seen that no matt you are on culture my friend clearly you've got no friends you've got no ground no friends you don't know oh is is that a oh what's his name i can't think of his name right now the volstone writer they called him but i i think i know who you're talking about but i can't think of the name i'm very uncultured by the way in case you didn't know okay i'm gonna need you to calm down man i literally can't find anyone i can't even get to this guy okay now they're coming now they're coming now they're coming yeah where are you mate there was a guy locking me down with a sniper i'm coming over it doesn't even matter i don't even need you so much better all right here at the golf band listen up just left me no i didn't you did you're supposed to be watching my rear i'd love to do that but you did it that there's a guy over here that had a sniper and i was sitting on this mate i literally couldn't walk up the ramp i had to wait for him to come down i was stuck i couldn't come up the ramp so that's why i was like that were you that intimidated by the guy with the sniper six times yes i was that intimidated yes i couldn't move you just you're just shivering in your tube socks yes you wear two socks what the heck is a tube sock a tube suck it's a sock with a tube in it they're like knee high socks i think i don't know what the i don't know what the exact uh definition is but i think that's what they are oh okay um let me know if you see a divo or a havoc please i've been holding on to this turbo about 1993 and i would very much enjoy using it you're like what 35 a little bit a little bit on there a little bit all there wait is that you back there looting i thought it was our teammate no what are you up to what are you up to i'm actually so much smarter than both of you guys because watch count it down oh you got a car but you got a car i could have stolen that but i had to leave was lagging behind four three two wait wait wait recount recount i ran into a walk one i'm gone i'm already here i'm literally all right i'm literally dead if you were in the car you wouldn't have been dead good job they heard the car coming and they naded and shot me that was all your fault by the way these guys are full sending me and there's another team why are you guys all here stop i have no good attachments like whatsoever this is this is not the vibe sort of multiple teams i know what the vibe isn't definitely not divine there's a guy lifeline raising if you can get to me i'm not vibing they're gonna steal my kill they actually stole my kill it's an actual tragedy that was johnny that's the guy with the need one of them's only got white shield okay one's rushing me real heavy nice is so much better ever eight shotgun shots and 74 energy that should be fine there's a guy down low here as well mate down one  close fight oh my god still pushing me okay the other team is gonna be pushing some extra supplies popping about i'm not with you seems kind of scattered they're kind of all around you i had to change one game i broke one you're good if that crosstalk can shoot in the back you're good yeah i'm good i'm getting good they're pushing they're pushing nice the other one's back at the rock are hydro he's pretty low nice that was actually nice because i don't even think they knew you were there yeah they were just so focused on diving on me really shocking so bad so it's on me okay okay good all right oh more another one behind you when you just wear okay 69 23 broken really bad i hit this dude so he's probably already shielded i'm so bad at this game triple take it does not work i can't do it i can't do it i never get the rhythm of it but yeah i could not hit anything i'm so bad oh yeah we have a i need 30 seconds i need i need heavy desperately um if you don't find any i'll drive you something oh i could just take this r9 i'm taking an r9 i have a lot of heavy how much heavy do you have a lot okay um there's a lot in there perfect i think nades i guess 10 seconds the ring's just ahead perfect all right good to go that was fun for your ultimate team my camera oh this gun is so good yeah it's just too good take a picture of my cat mid game because she's looking just so cute i wish i could i wish i could let my cats in my room but they will just just cause absolute destruction i guess we should go this way inside is probably better too yeah that was the best wait i just i just tapped out it just it just my game just typed hold on how does it do that it does that every once in a while on the right yeah the right side over there so weird my game will literally just tab out randomly that's like really bad that can get you killed so weird i don't know why it does that wait why would i pick this up hello hello what game man i'm gonna be honest there's a huge scrap going down i am trying so hard to pick up samuel wouldn't let me i'm going i'm going i'm going what's wrong with me oh my gosh mate i'm like pre-aiming pre-firing the doors and stuff okay and aim at this on the guy on the bottom the resin jesus what a mess wait who's left this is the last team i i don't even understand what's going on who's left wait what's happening i really don't know who's left i couldn't be bothered there's surely like one guy left somewhere i'm so confused i'm sticking with you that mirage was part of the other team right i yeah i don't know what you can get up here let you oh it pushes you off a little bit huh is that really that good of a spot though no i know why i'm saying yeah i don't know why i beat it up that much i'm literally about 10 feet off the ground no cover with absolutely zero coverage wait if i had my alt i would be running so fast uh i'll let you get this anyway i felt bad i've seen a lot kills this game yeah you have i agree oh is that a 180 uppercut you like it let's clean it oh yeah i'm not taking it oh oh i'm so ready to go for 12. we've only got one guy left surely wait there's like let's go this way if he was gonna respond where would he go we should probably see on these boxes it's it you know it's even worse because i'm bloodhound yeah that's a good point i'm not a good blonde though so that's fine with me i'm going for it i don't care i don't think he's here but i'm going for it i didn't even hit the wall from my perspective i just like ran into the wall and turned and shot him i don't know you meant i thought you're gonna run through the storm i was thinking i can't really do that no i'm just going for it oh he's right there he's right there wait wait wait wait wait one one chance one chance no that was the worst wall jump of all time time out be set mate you better you better do something i'm out i failed my walls i'm good all right hold on he's running he's destroying his remember the last time we literally died find this we're fine it would have been a head shot it would have been a head shot i'm so sad all right let's one more time oh big chill big chill no no i want the purple switch if you please kill him i can't please i did you see what happened i shot his i saw that now if you if you die i'm literally uploading it and i'm blaming you no i'll kill i don't know kelly didn't dude i did a wall jump and it was right on his head his brain that's why he went into the corner to use his drone to block oh my god that is amazing because the drone comes out on like right on his head oh my god that would have been that'd have been great i would have been happy ah two in a row for team temperature it's not like he wasn't you were using a triple take and i was really trying hard with a hemlock and a vault you were you were trying you're trying very hard
