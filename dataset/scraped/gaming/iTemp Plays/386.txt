hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the most so far loadout ever mirage with a flatline and the prowler and i actually kind of popped off this game maybe it's the secret recipe for success with a little more look it could have been a 20 kill game but not quite thanks for watching guys i appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends shooting far away from him as possible i landed literally as far away from anything as you could possibly land i'd be like that there's one right here [Applause] r3 and the charging shield i love that that's all for my favorite that's the ball hey oh so uh hear them below this time you know the vipes recharging shield uh what am i need of maybe a bit of heavy patching wait what are we oh we're doing the pistol thing uh oh no we're not completely forgotten i forgot to i'll do it at the time um i'm gonna go this way mate take the balloon okay see you next year there's no way you beat me here right there's no way i have to heal oh that's why yeah yeah yeah like your poor path in i'm dead i believe it reloading sound an enemy ladies and gentlemen we got them here rings closed behind us thank on my way reloading last my first time thank you iphone bat japanese bats um i have two i'll block both of them please um okay don't ask you don't get you know uh have a level one extended for my life gun sickening why am i sliding if i wasn't sliding i've been this guy what was the best flash on my way it's small hailing i messed up tremendously mate i oh i like that that's my video title i stole he's legend and he's loaded so i mean not lying i think i just saw a scan over here i just got scanned i don't have any big heels mate so give him my shield to recharge here one bat i won what is this audio two teams yeah it's uh two bloodhounds one of them's below me charging shields i got some bats uh i have five here you go i gotta use one just got to patch myself up hang on thank you kind of problem eh i don't know what the word is can't remember kind of problem i don't know i think he's charming german for no problem or something who knows mate not me definitely not me faking him out with a decoy roger's opinion yes he is he said that i do just bambooze myself with his footsteps that's why he's so good if i don't even know who's the real one i was having an existential crisis i was like this guy's looking convincing you know sometimes you just have to check i just looked in funny like wait a second uh right in front of me but then i remembered cogito ergo sum oh i think therefore i am you know are you looking this up while you're playing this guy's one shot can we hit the crazy smelly of all time here i'm zooming i don't know if i'm gonna catch up to this bad boy ah he's off the scene ah man he's too quick he's gonna wrap around right through his banner check the corners here on me oh i connected the right the top of my head just broke the back of your neck how could you see me like run up on you too that little hit marker thing yeah just right on my head perfect accuracy is that the spartan kick you keep talking about yeah that's the one that i'm talking about you know run ten feet are you ten strides backwards and then uh four strides forward that's right momentum i would not want to be on the receiving end oh you win it did that be grace i actually don't oh is that behind us i have one good deal i reckon it's this way yet you still only have one get here it's getting better every day a few days ago i actually couldn't hear anything through it like the tiniest amounts but now it's okay yeah yeah you know the vibes a shoesh you know that's close i don't know if i told you this already but i was at the gym the other day and he's like these young kids just every time they did a set they're just like just oh this guy just got respawned how many you got respawn without ten minutes you got respawned oh i didn't versus 15 health mate wow what do you expect your teammate is this okay whatever 15 health 10 seconds the ring is basically knocking on the door [Music] now see i don't want to do that because like like i said before it becomes like a thing where you're doing it ironically and then you start doing it unironically and then it's weird and then it becomes part of your vocab everything's moving and the next time you write and something happens like that's important that's why people say pog it's just like in a in like a business meeting that's that's that wasn't very pog champ off you tension delivering care back what was that heads up all the head on my end was she hey oh whoa whoa whoa one of the boys oh yes yeah it'd be better if you if you're using an auto why did i do that because that's what real men do lower dps lower kill potential uses but it's more skill worse more skill to use actually have recoil control oh god oh no nah man that was a punch potential oh my god that's my fault the burst mode is too good though the first one's too good here you're you're through you're throwing at this point that's not my fault when the burst mode is just deleting them you know ah they would have been dead way faster did you say that you're right cause i could have stopped firing but because i pressed the button once i fire five bullets which is just doing so much damage you don't see ex champions more skill yeah yeah yeah that's true okay conqueror well i could have dropped it i don't think about it the columns are just the absolute worst so it's just not going to happen i didn't i wasn't going to ask you for it but i didn't think about it i you know i that might have been what am i thinking i know i'm not going to ask for it i'm not like you mate i'm getting my 20 bucks naturally
