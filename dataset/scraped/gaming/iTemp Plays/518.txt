hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so with views coming out on tuesday i am sure that we are going to see 30 of him in every duo's lobby and 20 of him in every trio's lobby so we are going to need to get our counters ready now looking in his ultimate and his ability i reckon pathfinders not a bad idea you can grapple out of his ring of fire and if you're stunned you can still grapple to make yourself harder to hit so it's not too bad you've got a horizon for the same reasons but then i thought wait watson counters every single part of fuse's kit he can stack all the grenades he wants he can launch his stun at us even his ring of fire may even be counted by watson's ultimate ability the problem is i never ever play watson she's by far my least played legend so we needed to change that so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds mesa i was french from my friends if you're curious i've just learned it google translate yeah um oh i could do that thank you i've got a bit of a plan here i don't know if you notice but i'm playing watson and my plan is um get good with watson because fuse's abilities literally all of them can be counted with with watson so i'm now what's in me uh yeah you appreciate you appreciate the line of thought here yeah i mean you're putting two and two together you're playing chess we're playing checkers 100 that's always been the way um some sort of double tap stuff like these guys over here he's gonna die if you can ask him i'll just put my fence down on him all the stunts yeah yeah it's a good idea the sunstrap yeah yeah okay okay i made a team run away because i threw ark stars at them i appreciate that me how dare he i don't know who it is he must pay for his crimes oh it's a horizon she's here okay all right she has blue armor oh he's trying to talk i'm okay chilling on my end i'm just gonna wait for you to pinch yeah yeah the angle of one bullet horizon's cracked it's pretty bad ryzen's ready can we swipe where she went awesome she switched and i have no energy i exploded to bangalore [Music] i need that person's guns or energy oh god that's going to bat real quick all right i haven't used any fences drive my ultimate okay i'm rubbing an ultimate down i'm going to do it put it down yeah it's going to be super useful probably look at this they're gonna lob some tap me and they're gonna come unstuck if you've got white shields what are you doing challenging me do you have any um light rounds mate i i'm gonna come again if he's in the container he said as well there's an often right here too what the heck we haven't played in like three months and we're actually the best players on this game see i don't know about all that i've only got two kills i am kind of frying though well listen i'm sure you've got four assists in there too oh sounds behind oh no it's my ultimate just being destroyed that's so if you see any ultimate accelerants let me know oh yeah okay i the thing is i know i should be looking for them but my brain doesn't register it it's like when i when i'm running like um a sniper i'll need sniper rounds but my brain doesn't look at sniper range you know yeah but do you really need old accelerants when you're playing watson and pops yes [Music] like i saw it i think it's i think it's not as bad to forget alt accelerants than it is to forget i'm a brand new yeah yeah there's different levels to this foot what are you doing up there i'm chilling they won't realize it's me actually you probably wouldn't notice oh my gosh humongous i have a great idea hold on just in case somebody tries to get up here yes just in case what a plan planting centers i mean fence them out no naturally impenetrable nobody will ever know imagine seeing this across the map you think nicholas tesla's back named nicholas was it nikolai i can't remember or nicolette nick i don't know mate i i don't know i'm i'm stupid that looks awesome from down here oh i just took down oh i thought that was me i was gonna say that would have been unreal i got way too excited look at that thing oh it's a big it could be no it's a little one's a little off-center but not bad it was all right for a first attempt if i'm gonna be the best watson in the world this isn't gonna do i got scared ah the spitfire god over here you're gonna have to move at my speed to make them he's practicing i don't know where he is cracks really weight okay it's really exactly the guy this dude with the spitfire is actually like the world's best yeah he's only getting headshots on me oh it's actually gonna kill me [Music] think he knows you're coming up and he's going to come this way oh you had him literally yeah i mean he was he was waiting he was he that's why i wasn't going to heal 13. did he loot drop down yeah his box is down there we're only big hills i need big hills i can give you i can give you a battery i've got two uh it's okay mate i mean yeah i'll take i'll take one there you go got your energy i got it get a package coming in oh that rampant shield's looking a bit soft yeah oh no oh come on fellas i destroyed one of the shields well this is not performing oh no i'll put it where they're going no no i'm just really stupid how do i get there how long do your i can heal until you get mad this is going to hurt me though mate i'm going to get hurt here i'm killing them bro how long do you get a pad i i'm doing a lot of damage i'm burning something or someone i'm doing so much damage bro i'm taking all that shields okay i need i need to get some you go you gotta go thank you that's one knife they're leaving 81 in the first guy 26. hello is uh no no okay i gotta get some better gmo now oh no i mean i have so many heavy bullets so if you need to switch to a heavy gun let me know and i have two bats so if you need one of these bats also let me know about that i i got a battery thank you okay you know what i'm even if i don't find any energy ammo i'm good because i got the peacekeeper now and i'm just gonna charge it up and this could be a crater hold that thought i'm sure it's gonna be did you see my little i listen i'm no i'm no janks but did you see the last headshot on the revenant level was it the revenant i don't know oh i've got one man that's all you i don't know who it was but you bear like his barely his head was showing like it was a nice shot showing ronnie's scalp yeah the first one was a body shot the second the second shot was pretty nice too it was all right i mean he was he was looking at someone else right i had some time it was the third one that was surprising the third one was crazy oh either two times on my flat line no oh i did not need to do this not when i'm rocking it two times on a scout as well uh it's my sensitivity is a little bit lower than yours because you'll remain you have to place on seven seats that's literally impossible hey don't call me where did you shoot he's going no yep a hundred a hundred one hunna it's mates here oh god that's there's a path near did you get the pat no i can hear him moping around under us though he's climbed up i think just trying to distract me i'm brian i'm dude i'm having so much fun with this dk she's one shot the ramp is one although she has got gone oh he was yeah he was one all right one guy left somewhere hold on hold on hold on i'm gonna put my back get into him dude with the bed no mate the two times is so mental you don't understand wait i was just gone i had no fence i wish i had a friend so i wish i could actually you actually almost fenced this pathfinder you got him with the second one dude he was definitely stoned pretty upset because he's a pathfinder he could just like grapple oh that was actually hilarious i can't believe you almost died that was it i hate the two times in the flatline i just can't use it look at these damage numbers first game back from the boys yeah that was actually first game on in like up a long time like a few days yeah i've been playing like three days yeah dude combined 5k the last tricks above that one
