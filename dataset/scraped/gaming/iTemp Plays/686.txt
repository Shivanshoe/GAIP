hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some duos with sofa and we are doing the ultimate duo combo it is bloodhound and bangalore it's pretty self-explanatory here but the bangalore puts the smoke down and the bloodhound can either scan or even just pop their ultimate for perfect vision in the smoke and then you just roll through teams it's actually a lot of fun and i hope you enjoyed today's video if you do be sure to leave a like creating subscribe to join the i10 player and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends we're dropping hot i missed school town same very sad it was so fun i i know it was bad for the game because if i post this video on youtube people will absolutely lose their mind and tell me how it was terrible for the game but it was fun all right so yeah when you landed there and it went well it was it was a good time it was very hard to beat a good skull yeah such coming down he's got purple cracks cracks nice oh god why did they not push um i don't know they're somewhere on this side in this building i don't have any 17 bullets my little player like he's lasered i have no guns was in there but they swapped like really weird yeah that was a strange one do you have any health heals um yes i have some bad news here come in here maybe syringe here giving my shields of recharge that was a strange fight i am not sure uh sounds like oh yeah i don't know if you find a slide from my hemlock yeah i literally just found one for my hemlock i just put one you got him yeah iron sights on him like a rub yeah especially if you're trying to do like a single fire yeah it does so nice i've been using a lot more recently oh don't do it i'm thinking i'm staying in here good job god because i just see it in his eyes how bad they want to sit how bad they want to chuck their old i have no idea how i killed that revenant i just shot through wherever yesterday i couldn't see anything and i blended a few headshots from hey i feel kind of bad yeah i tried to do this i did a couple shots people find it like what's it called the pizza i'm gonna loot this acoustic grab zero light ammo on my weight extended heavy meg sounds like run off as well in the syringe uh i got some i'm just taking my time oh my sick drift's gone i just realized i fixed it that's nice did you use it did that happen after you like blowed into the analogy yeah nice because there's scuff you can like take the thumbstick off so it helps a lot yeah yeah i need my own yeah yeah yeah sure that's good i'll be way too far ahead of you i have a one time um if you need it and there's two people there it's hard you do not need me well there are two people on your screen and the aim is just trying to stabilize it right right in between them let's try to pick which one why am i dropping here what am i doing yeah the game just can't decide you could have dropped a drone oh yeah there's a drone thank i've only you small heels too i play i play too many different legends they're just always i always think i'm capable of like an ability that i'm just don't have my bangalore bangalore i think i'm lifeline or i'm great and i think i'm pathfinder or i'm caustic and i think i'm bloodhounds when i stop playing everywhere what's his name corsic i uploaded it i i was yeah i was playing pathfinder and i was trying to throw barrels all right i'm pushing well kind of wants cracks for late one time on my screen my screen broke nice i'm all back spitfire is kind of scary yeah yeah you know they'll just never stop okay nice that's nice that they rocked up with uh white armor yeah they're low they're a little confident it's kind of late in the game too a lifeline uh package dropping like bearish i think no there'll be more to my right it might honestly might be behind that but they have to move that way do you need any bats i have to i'll drop you too or h i'm gonna drop some light ammo if i need it oh yeah i do actually there's a full stack thank you very nice thank you it's almost pushing these people anyway like i still say you're welcome even though you don't have voice lines yeah as long as i see it as long as i see it i still did same i always try to oh right here i really want to turn on voice lines too just for just for the memes fine i've been absolutely shredding tonight oh god where did you come from of course he's rising up weak nice the mirage hasn't healed nice oh my god good job nice clutch man let me grab an arm real quick yeah yeah oh nice man i got your back oh yeah where where did that lifeline come from that was so confusing i don't know that really threw me off oh wait you had uh you have purple than you let me take you on purpose i got a phoenix wait where did the old purple go um wait did i have a purple oh no i dropped it right here right here at the bin completely figured out that was so weird that i thought it was a completely different team yeah same same i thought we got 30. that lifeline brings you so broken like he makes it useful it's a good update to be fair yeah if she if they would have played that differently they they would have won definitely definitely they got overconfident he was just trying to snipe you i think he did hear a shark didn't they because i saw his either did i just hear somebody wait what what's this i just saw a big red thing i yeah can you scan can you scan this like right in front of me i thought dude i'm tripping sorry if you said it as well no i swore i heard somebody maybe it was you i don't know that was kind of weird i just saw somebody take the balloon out again this is such a good combo your smoke my old my scan yeah i keep forgetting that remind me and i'll scan like oh i mean i'll smoke out like fights although here 25 seconds ago yeah we're on the way we're on the we're on the hunt they stopped here to my left oh that was 60 seconds ago uh oh yeah uh bingo is one nice where's your amigo amigo i think it was an octane i heard him nice like what how did he get back there is that an octane oh that was a lifeline oh i thought i heard a knock saying i'm hearing dude i'm hearing the weirdest thing what is going on i've been playing too much apex just hearing everything i love the single void hammer i didn't like it for a while and it started to grow on me recently it's so good one of those that i underestimated until i got beans by it i was hold on a sec yeah so you got destroyed by it like five times yeah what's this gun oh look at that oh yeah your favorite place give me alt i'm gonna i'm gonna use my ultimate this time i'm gonna i'm gonna throw my old to try and get them off and then i'll push up where do i go give it a go [Music] yeah they're in this building also one here yep right here i chomp i broke one the other one's low shield nice loba is really low nice crack underneath this has just walked around i know she's dropping down a little bit that's are you they were back in the yeah especially when you all i should just smoke out everything like every single fight i'll just smoke it up it's such a good combo i had a digital thread as well i should have tried to [Music] i like that one game where you have like like 700 more damage to me but i have like five more kills yeah it happens
