i'm not sure if you guys were aware of this also i just wanted to let you guys know that i think i'm going to post random games every now and then i saw staycation post a battlefield 1 video yesterday and i loved it some of you guys may not know this but i posted well over 100 episodes of the battlefield one rotomax rank before this channel took off and this channel didn't take off initially with apex before apex i reached around 430 000 subs posting fortnite videos before that i posted a full let's play of a south park game and it goes further back than that all the way back to 2009 when i started posting gaming commentary videos when i was 15 years old apex will still be the main game on this channel by a landslide i'm literally talking like maybe i'll post a random game once every two weeks or something so if you see one of those videos just know that i'm doing it for fun and if you're only interested in apex just wait a day and i'm sure there will be one on its way i hope you
