he was a gauzy treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some more war zone of course and today we are playing with an old friend Benny central now many of you who were around in my early Call of Duty days would probably know who Benning is already but he's back and it's uploading tons of great content here on war zone and it's channeling kebab in the description so be sure to check your mates so again I have you today we are using an underrated assault rifle here on warzone it isn't as powerful as the m4 it isn't as powerful as the ground no gun on this game either but it is a solid choice if you're looking to switch things up and it's extremely beginner friendly because this gun just has no recoil a funny enough it's my most used weapon on this game and I don't see anyone else using these so it's the kilo and here's the class setup of course you have to have the monolithic suppressor on every single gun that's ever been made apparent it's just the greatest attachment of all time I'm also using the commander for grip the 19.8 prowler barrel the 50 round mags and interestingly their blk optic which is a three time zoom this can barely flinches the extra magnification comes in footage of those fights in the fields and the woods what I will say is though if you do use besides I've recommended running an overkill setup or trying to run with a ground loop SMG so you can get that second loadout it's not the best gun in buildings as you can expect on burnings with the new fennec gun here then overkill setup I'm using a zero hour deadfall barrel which gives it a great suppressor on there as well I've got the Merc for grip I've got the stipple grip tape the 40 round mags and the sleight-of-hand perk it snaps it mail machine up close and personal so again today starts off a little bit slow but it's with any game here on warzone the mid to late really pops off with a lot of action so hope you enjoy it if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to join the I attempt and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends he's like playing for Knights I'm never going to like tilted back today yeah super stories until

angle you have no how about here yes then they have no idea where you are million hit me on me it's the old h1 drop-off tactic oh yeah here they are hopefully one of them just pushes out here yeah he came outside May he looks my way uh how on earth would you have known oh maybe they've got hard beats down drop nice one kind of bad I'm gonna push in see for the top and again II and he Marcus he's

the garret in the garret dis get and I finish them all without God I think we did are they separate teams the honest I think the guy up top I just didn't honestly was what was going on that's unreal I got lucky with that one great save though I worked just about its Phoenix unreal oh let's go kill him yes come off they've got three whole minutes of being a crown thank you all hope is lost you've got a helicopter and you have a mission yeah I never really thought to do that the old helicopter take all he's running he heard you mate oh we're headed oh I'm awesome where he was just talking to a teammate when he Spanish no I'm afraid submarine fell for us yeah as you can translate oh that vehicle is coming in our direction squad three don't dad dad I finished the none of the still people there yeah I just finish the damn guy I've got we've got tick we've got to finish these guys quickly there's another thing coming in May they just went down into the bunker oh no no in the bunker they're in the bunker I can barely see that god Tom I've done the gun gets here I'm safe just jump just chill hmm someone just opened easier I can rushing there with a fennec me to go there's anyone in here what they're rich a few um there were guys behind us if you come this side and maybe check the oh where the fire yeah I'll let me buy you a half gallon lucky they're still swishing especially I'm just Joe got sniped from behind yeah we're low smokes look he's coming down a lesson sighs lucky wish distracted I'll be cool Schumi one got close somewhere huge there's a procedure on this dive already go on oh yeah grab that plate uh you got that's three but we need to go to the spying on us I know there's people around here I've got the airspace to crowd equipped I would if a precision air strike these guys some so long ago yeah I mean by some extra plug it's still looking us mate they still look nice do you see him like Northwest you still find out him big yeah I'm just buying a nice Oh all right I said let's just bail out let's go backwards let's go backwards and how what is going on with these guys where are they coming from there's loes mate before you lose the Sony place there is a vehicle here May it's not too far but I guess we just want to get out of here you just want to get away from those snipers cuz they're gonna be watching us are we can just plop that could've been then come on I'm nan oh oh good I didn't realize there was ice physics on this game no that's gotta be new one of me you can't climb these if they were just like Chinon with shotguns or something yeah which is scaring me because I've not seen him across what a bunch of lunatics mate make sure that we're good for this buy it I want to get into the the forest through yes like up top area yeah take full advantage of our skins wait that's the one there we're looking rose over to is perfect you've got eagle eyes yeah there's another guy out there as well they look nice now yeah I'd say that's why they take more let's not engage where we don't need to I can't use my precision so I can't use mine either decisions are out by Illinois this little bit here we don't want to get in we don't get involved there we want to get up high ground but they have to push this way but I assume there's no stab top there now just rotate top we'll get there early yeah that's what I'm thinking right now right so it's a gunfight over there I'm blue I'm good let's just hug this wall I'm sorry I don't have perks actually oh you don't yeah so I'm gonna go for that that easily gonna be worth it it's a risk it's risky if you want I can get my SMG I saw dropping in yeah I'm good now no I can't see a tree I assume there's a team that way cuz he won't be going there by himself unless he's going to download out of something because a lot of people hover so it's 7:15 so it's like one team a couple teams of three in a few solos I guess yeah alright so we hold this we can get these guys rotating in unless they've already rotated about me seeing me found him I shot man I can't in sim no knows one more like Norma then someone's self present you can see one of them I guess they're trying to shoot down the guy he ran away to the right so my mate I swear something out he's called me out I swear Seng I've turned down to the right I'm not being these bushes somewhere he has to push too soon I don't know where I am you're wearing red my friend also you jump down the hill looks like a fire truck mate I think Beth cat is one of my fave I love it honestly I wish it was in the games I don't how you inspired those guys that I'm just like I was like a lost child trying to follow your bullets all right wearing a really good show this is your brain unfortunately starting in here what's left it's not ending here but it means we can go in kind of quiet so I've seen one squad like over there on blue I have 83 spur I have 130 bullet so I guess it's fine all right let's go let's go clear our back perfectly I just got a little bit of a missus switch on sometimes mine on earth I'm PC mind just like John Searle being could have been that don't know yeah I was just there like you know when you see
