hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course so the alternator was buffed for season eight and i was actually kind of shocked at how good this gun feels the damage was increased from 15 to 16 which sounds underwhelming but hear me out so everyone knows that the r99 is just a better gun than the alternator it just is the time to kill on the r99 is far lower than the time to kill on the alternator however it's a far harder gun to use it's more of a high risk high reward weapon compared to old trusty alternator with minimal recoil and nice and steady fire rate and good hip fire what people don't take into account is that if you can kill someone in one clip of an alternator that is still quicker than if you're using an r99 and you have to reload to finish the kill on your opponent the r99 has far better burst damage but if you don't finish the kill in that one clip and your opponent has the newly buffed alternator you better run away and find some cover and reload or or just switch gun but that still takes a while so i run double alternators in the game that i have for you today i managed to get two double extended light mags of the level four variety the new gold variety and i was playing some octane and we were just rushing everyone if you're new to the channel please be sure to subscribe as we are going for one million subs in season eight of apex and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends here i'm gonna land here it's just small consistent there's four surprisings on this bridge if you need it i messed up my landing really bad everything is okay okay i'm on the way there someone's like someone's that's how you do it nice another one someone's coming out of this door okay he's the one for purple and i have no shield so i have no shields at all i can drop you some here that's the guy purple okay i'll come up to you i'm gonna i'll i'll get this guy a bit got this guy this guy need oh wait it doesn't work maybe it does i don't know where they went why is that both of them i've got that phoenix back to you okay and then you grab this person someone's okay okay phoenix someone threw that at us unless that was yours from ages ago oh i died i was going to hit the pad and go away thank you give [Music] oh they're going to regret not pushing that once it's on the floor still reloading a cracked octane attention oh another team is shooting him just back this way we've got a company two people i'm grabbing uh armor stuff here oh there they are pushing oh i'm coming nice the accuracy in the air is so sweet extended energy oh okay i have 10 syringes for some reason okay wait oh you can stack grenades with me yeah yeah oh no i dropped a lot of syringes if you can eat them can you you can stack two grenades then yeah you can stack one two of any grenade yeah it's great that is so good drama when they made that change and they increased the bag size uh by two for every iteration of it so now it's even better than before because you've got a bigger bag and you can stack them right use fuse like a wingman mastiff and have honestly like 20 grenades 22 24 grenades or something that is gonna be insane yeah like it's a big brain play or what it is it really is oh no i gotta get the timing down with uh with uh my my attacks i keep going to use my attack thinking that it shoots instantly but it's like there's a delay and when you hit them with it it's actually kind of good oh did you hear that was that you that's already open that's already open oh does it let you uh it was it wasn't no i wasn't gonna let you i'm using double alternator by the way really yeah both been buffed how's it going with it good you're cooking yeah yeah doing all

scrap i have five med kits maybe it'll be too many oh i went so far with the pad oh what i'm not with you i find one bullet i'm gonna get a battle real quick i'm gonna hold it hold this oh that was close i need another phoenix i'm scared that someone's gonna come through that door so i'm running away i thought i heard something i wasn't sure do you have any light rains by the way no we didn't
