i don't know how i'm gonna edit this video this is literally my fourth or fifth time if the pack went through uh i've opened up three packs and i missed out on all of them i don't know what i got from the legendary pack i don't well actually i do know what i got from the packs that i've already opened i swear i've already got this skin but i'll put it on and then we got this which is like oh my god okay so i thought this was i thought this was pathfinder dabbing because it kept lagging when i when i when i last came on to do a recording and i thought it was him dabbing but he didn't show the rest of the animation so it's him playing with like a lasso so i don't know how you say that seems like he's not lagging though oh my word we're in action team it's actually happening i can actually buy the heirloom this is magnificent oh that might work that is beautiful especially because i don't know why but i don't have a rampage skin as you can see factory issue throw that on uh we've got a local thing we've got an octane thing middle one if you've never seen these before the middle event pack uh the item you'd receive in the middle is always the one that is relevant to the event that you are involved with if you know what that sentence means good looks here because i personally do not have a click all right this chord's going off got an alternate skin a flatline skin kind of funky i'm i mean and it's an interesting skin it's definitely uh it's definitely different for a second i thought my game's graphics were glitching because if it did this is probably what would be uh the product of such an event all right next pack we got a crypto skin uh pretty much the flatline skin so the theme here is hardened circuitry oh he's got the circuitry okay that makes more sense i haven't really looked at any of the skins yet usually i look at what skins i'm going to get beforehand and it sort of spoils the fun in a way but this time i'm going in completely blind i've got a legendary that's not even part of it who's this for see it throw it on there why not this is the hemlock that is part of the event these skins are interesting we'll see how long i uh i'll leave these on some of them are bangers though double legendary the one that's not part of the event is just a crypto banner frame put that on with this mastiff skin that's kind of clean i really like that it hasn't got like the some of the massive skins have like the little uh heartbeat sensor looking thing on the side the big screen the big samsung 15 led lcd ied oled tv on them on the side you know but that one doesn't so less intrusive i swear i've already got the sentinel scheme but i'll throw it on got a longer skin and a watson banner pose as well 15 more packs to go here on the evolution i am recording right because i've had to stop about eight times i've got a little charm i still think if they if apex released like these r9 skin into the shop if they made it like the nice uh what's it called iron sights i reckon it would sell out i reck i would pay 10 pounds for like a fully blacked out skin i think it'd be tremendous got bloodhound we've got a lifeline epic banana pose and we have a skydive emote for sia which i will be using to annoy so far with when he is the job master got a legendary i assume this is part of the uh the pack as well part of the event that's a beautiful octane skin okay i like these these kind of ones this one and the massive skin looking looking real good i'm a big fan of those next up is another legendary red banner frame okay a legendary bangalore skin solar soldier good luck trying to say that five times real quick i'm not even gonna attempt it another legendary coming out of this pack it's the rampard skin this is actually a clean rampard skin this one with the rampage lmg with the with the new heirloom get the wrench on the go that's the combination of dreams all right no legendary this time just an epic banner frame for wraith pretty nice actually pretty nice i mean that's the other two one part of the event i'm not too interested in them the legendary here as well which is for lifeline i only knew his lifeline because of the pose okay you know i take it back these some of these skins this this uh this event have been real nice i'll give it a real nice f10 so far under the banner sorry another skydive emote this time for revenant i think i prefer the one that i have but you can use any of them when you're in the sky just add it to the collection next up is a fuse skin okay sort of reminds me of gustavo frink from uh breaking bad like the body he's like half and half but with him it was his face so it doesn't really make any sense what i've just said another legendary coming out there's the path behind one sort of freaky looking because these look like muscle tendons so and he's got a very human shaped head you know and like this why is that such a creepy face on his little monitor thing i mean i'm putting it on it's it's different i like it it looks like a it makes it look like a villain that skin it's a nice change of pace for him uh just a banner pose it's time for lifeline she's trying to vaccinate yeah perhaps that doesn't get me demonetized even mentioning anything to do with that usually does i'm gonna have to mute that but i will probably forget it's okay here we go mirage again i like when you're moving around he's all his hair his little his blue hair there sort of wobbles around i like that i'll put it on three more packs until the uh the heirloom pack and oh that was another r9 skin is that a wraith portal in and outside is a wraith portal that's kind of nice actually i won't be rushing to put it on though but it'd be nice to have here we go legendary for the second the penultimate apex pack that's a really clean r301 skin really clean i like that and here we go the last event pack on the cards he's the legendary the legend skin it is indeed it's a wraith skin i i almost don't want to put it on but i've paid money for it oh here we go one heirloom pack remaining that looks kind of clean here that's the that's the thumbnail shot right there one heirloom pack remaining and then after that i hope you're feeling comfortable because we're going to open 277 packs uh after this we're not we're not going to do that here we go gail impact coming in hearts got the intro we've got the heirloom and we have the banner post let's start the intro i know what that means vampire here is the problem solver it's a wrench there's not much more you can say about it and here is the rampart a banner pose oh she's got the skin on she's got the skin i'll put on i like that a lot all right well i've got one extra i'll open the epic pack it's a guaranteed epic i'll give it a go like two comments this is why i don't even open packs anymore just i mean should i put that on i'm gonna put it on i'll give that a go i've just put the wraith skin on otherwise i would have used you here we go a great hollow spray all right let me go into the range real quick um the cable that i use to connect my controls to my pc is connected to my camera at the moment so i'm gonna have to run around mouse and keyboard style here it is my friends ram pass heirloom here's some of the animations when you whack people oh i like that one that one was no did that one again do the cool one again right like extends no no we'll get it eventually another thing that i like to try and do get the animations of like when you pull out the air limb itself sometimes you'll get some uh rare animations in that as well but there you go here's the inspector at least one of them stickers coming loose that's annoying that's disgusting i have regretted purchasing this [Music] that's the that's the melee animation that i enjoy that's one of the longest animations i've ever seen but here you go my friends that was me opening up the ramp airline pack i hope you enjoyed it thanks for watching i'll see you all hopefully this evening again if the server stays stable but yeah thanks for watching bye
