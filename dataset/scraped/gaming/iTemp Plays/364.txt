thank you to ea for sponsoring today's video hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the genesis event is here yesterday i uploaded a video showing all of the new event skins including revenant new heirloom and today i have a few games for you which show off some of the old points of interest on both worlds edge and kings canyon it's not until you go back to the original maps that you've realized just how different they are from little details like the map lighting to bits of color that weren't there in the original map and then the massive point of interest changes that have come and gone along the way we did a lot of exploring here on king's canyon especially for maximum nostalgia and even though we spent a lot of time fighting in school town obviously it was some other areas that i missed more like bridges cascades and even the forest area where raid labs now stands the genesis event goes on for about another two weeks so make sure you hop on to revisit some classic areas thank you once more to ea and apex legends for sponsoring today's video i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends
