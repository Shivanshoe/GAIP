hey wassup cottage rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and he's actually my first video on the Evo shields also like the fixed shields game-mode I can't even remember the name of it now usually I would have uploaded it on the first day he was out but I was moving at the time so I wasn't able to and I thought just forgot it was there for a while we were here on the Evo shield 1 you spawn in with a level 1 at basic Evo shield - it's Connor difficult to start you need some rack up some kills you also need a decent of shield cells to keep healing capture of your shields because our mission of the starties horrendous because no-one's done any damage but actually was a load of fun and I've really enjoyed it hope you playing this game mode more until it disappears on a May the 13th so hopefully you enjoy if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe if you're new around here to join the light empire and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sorting factory it is my friends we are back at it again with caustic I just had a game with this big fella and I'm tell you what like I'm so happy - Dave update it so many of the caves on this game to where they if you before caustic maybe you're not feeling hard done by because he's like definitely a really good and useful character on this game just because he's not played quite as much as Pathfinder right the mini he's not actually useful yeah Tex 15 percent reduced damage he doesn't stumble when he gets shot he's gas explosions do a decent damage name is Prince play this tape can you hear this Symphony of P 2020s let's get the heck in all friends I stood algorri I am her friend how many headshot few times for that I'll start that that wasn't a Piton to any that I was probably only got small heels if he comes this way there's a got some traps for even help sorry in 11 damage someone have that way David finally other small Hills only as L Stallman guess all men's name you never find shield cells in this game mode I'm good I got your teammates where's the right phrase downstairs I got sure don't worry they haven't left yet and they're pinging their banners which is good a good sign here self tempting to loot them because I do need shields and arm switch on this game-mode he's sad because people always just have low one or level two for some reason and until they little bit further into the game so you're gonna have to reset your progress is to arm switch further into the game it's alright because usually people have at least purple it's it's my thumb switch if you've got red to be honest image it might be worth still army switching to purple on this game-mode unless you got like shield batteries or something is using five shield cells takes forever and it's just sad to see name they supposed to be in rush they're still people find in the distance at least it's one of a coursing nice one more to my favorite guns as well at the moments the havoc and the Prowler of course nice to see in that situation you are far more useful if you my tenants gonna need the sir it's not if the armor don't watch the show back friend you're far more useful I mean that enemies focus in on my teammates that it's pointless mean hitting up it doesn't matter if I'm one health or 275 doesn't matter whatsoever if he's fine my teammate though I'm not getting shot anyway Mazal to stop the hill and just help him zoom in the back listen I appreciate you guys you've extrapolated that because I need a heavy ammo I mind either level to extended mag each of you but what you guys do not know is that I have to evolving I can use unfortunately the gold versions of these weapons don't have the sights that I would choose but they're still got you know lost I'll use them thank you thanks very much I appreciate the pink some looted mob I've been spending on each shields and my teammates doctor the shield battery but I'm already flying my friend I think we texture here we go so I need think is with Eva shield says is that opposite takes so many shield cells to keep pumping the numbers up you know on the health / Planet X for right thanks fine gonna bolt here now Ranger cement of shield cells which is good for me because I have a bit of a shield cell problem you could describe us where I seem to carry way too many according to you people in the comment section I got 12 does not do that Thanks the remark startups sorry right free she Asian look after gonna need this one let me know what you guys think of this because I've seen conflicting opinions okay in that situation the Pathfinders clearly dropped it to me he drops it for me and then picked it back up and then flew over to me to drop it again but the brave press deeps is it the race because she pressed dibs oh it's in mine because I was climbing something in my opinion I think that's whoever's closer you know let's just grab the loot what I've seen people said the opposite there are people here keep running to my gas traps even a gimmick you're gonna give you a melted level-one Eva I don't like it did you found this I really did not like I might be dead I'm good right stop looting there's people firing us please just at least shoot them Adobe right just woken up she's good you're not being not difficult the rapist television do with Lutz I think because we began rushed and we can fire me in the Pathfinder oof incredibly wait we needed the right just to put at least a few bullets at least to let them know that it's a rush they're probably gonna take a bit of damage but it's alright it works at the end and I'm in a bit where's the rice go in gives us one guy give me say I don't get started again it's worth thank it wasn't ideal but listen we're still alive that's the good news yeah yeah keep looking keep looking this is an absolute slaughter over this plate come on 10 kills somehow it's like Death Valley this little place named sorry three kills come into this area help two full teams and then this one decides up a template from the depths of scrap it's all City batteries are useful you need the big heels on this game mode but you don't a sacrifice too many shield cells because you also need to yourselves that's my philosophy anyway to be honest half your bag should always be taken up with cells and batteries maybe a few syringes teammates we can we can put these people like you guys have Legion up let's get it let's get it going play bolts they're coming they're coming all the races they're gonna push this way and if you don't deal with them here we'll have to deal them in in a worse situation because they'll be ok okay unless expand this window if I can cover it with smoke if I are nice it's coming oh nice roses too I'm gonna plate so pathetically defensive if I knew it's just two people we're gonna get overrun there for a second imagine how a beautiful that would have been if I was five seconds earlier to the to the situation that's the best thing that cause if you can ambush people if you know that gonna have to push through a long corridor like that to set a few of your gas canisters behind it's a shadow behind rocks behind cars anything anything that they won't see you bind and I think the terminologies they are scream grouped if that happens what do we do now are we got ten kills there are ten of the people left for squad seven people which is a bit of a weird one I don't get overly eager because it could be a bunch of silos and then a few teams you want to assume that everyone's wait there's a there is a geezer up there thank you there isn't Pete I don't think it's a good idea because it's lame and you don't fly that far and if someone is here you have 2d animation of landing and again you're gonna see someone's here we want to be able to shoot them I suspect we will find something here and we got heat way faster good idea French this is pretty the best place to defend at the moment I've got a select-fire a variable scope are we good do you becoming friends I gotcha like we have to throw this far enough astronaut employed this is worth it this is worth the risk this is not worth the risk spend our building then walk into the gas canisters I'm praying they come through this ice cut it's good to speed Tim - there isn't that many people left no way to good way to good I'm trying to set up a defensive line of traps here and you guys are just destroying them before they can even trigger the traps you this isn't working why did you get that I swear like three revives this game race come on does matter that much the good news is with the gold bag if you're not the one that gets it you still benefits because if I go down there I'm gonna come back we've a bunch of health which is always good through the squats leave the same spot but these guys on the same squad there's a guy at the train tracks but there's a Watson that's I retract nationís for some reason thoughts and then got a kill last one down - bleats the triumvirate with only two enemy squads left the probability of victory Rises pricing and it's not now might have a stupid of me so these three sprite is actually being destroying everyone you really can turn the heat on I think this might be solo this is one guy and he's got a sniper as well that's a good portal because now can get the gun lockdown could be 14 on it I doubt it I think it is just this lovely fat boy letter okay where are these needs coming from careful later I forgot that was a Ledge day No I've stolen the kill forgot those a Ledge up there and he was just literally throwing grenades at me for us in general we didn't have some nuisance I thought I was being the haunted by a hot suitcase or something they'd fly in from everywhere here's a [ __ ] stick is so much fun honestly I would never have survived that Death Valley encounter if I wasn't caustic 3 or vines to respawns 12 kills and 2300 damage shout out the team there I mean the Wraith have really turned the heat on there at the end 7 kills you've nearly 1500 and Pathfinder definitely deserved more than 2 kills for 1800 damage as well and also they were both patient and I let me respawn at the start and that is our reward 21 kills what a fun game mode hopefully you enjoyed this video thank you for watching and I see you all in the next one [Music]
