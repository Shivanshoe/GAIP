hey what's up guys it's fridge welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the games that i have for you today show why i will always be a pathfinder mate third parting is a huge part of battle royale games if you're the third party you get to clean house with minimal risk because you aren't the focus if you're in a gunfight you have to have that escape plan in the back of your mind just in case a third party shows up and in both instances mobility legends are amazing and few are as capable as big path i get so used to being able to grapple into or out of a fight that when i play other legends i i kind of struggle honestly i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends yeah it's not a fun fight one team sits on top and camps the rope everybody else is gonna fight everywhere else like me actually i'm romney oh yeah right on me i got another team on me okay you got that one
