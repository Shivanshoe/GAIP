signs on it does anyone have phoenix i don't think a g7 is the best accompaniment to the 33 so i'm going to switch it out for any smg you see wait i'm gonna i'm going to knit this there's an r9 there was an r9 over there i'm going to get one from in here take this the audio's a mess i'm throwing uh i'm throwing a frag at it okay scammed what here [Music] whoa i have a level three ready i mean it's

you really i'm at 345. i've missed like 90 percent of my stronghold 8 29. i was lying the first time but i'm not my name finding a nade oh this yo look at how much more man there's so mobility so much mobility going on here [Applause] boys what about use that no i broke into one another one of those things nice so the loot's actually really really good in those things yeah yeah oh yeah 100 gold mag that's huge i think a gold bag is guaranteed there's people around here coming over that is unreal rich you're actually throwing not using the pad what are you doing i padded to the balloon oh that's even that's even worse i've got like the combos i've got the mobility combinations there's a please let them be in front of me i want to shoot them through the shield so badly i have my old too i cannot control i don't know where they are where they are i thought they're really close oh my god my cat's in the way no i'm not casting away i can't see all right why am i popping a syringe they're burning they're trying to burn you back i got one i killed uh i killed a fuse nice nice one two categories now i think you guys have caught up i don't know i don't know if the bruiser is the play for this i kind of want to use like a one-time sight on it on the on the repeater and then just i think one time is good or iron or the iron inside the iron is kind of nice too right yeah and like i'm just going to use it as like a wingman basically wait is this care package not in the range there's a cafe in a low birth i love to think that corn it must not be in range because it's that light sonic unless it was just like a purple armor i couldn't tell fellas i got so lost in the saucer we're actually in slums oh yeah i forgot oh oh yeah that was actually really cool i love the lighting i love the lighting too i'm gonna check there's a there's a tunnel right here i wanna i'm gonna go through this sniper stock here level cancel that crater here oh oh oh come on fellas oh come on fellas you know that's got to go in the pocket please let's do a little adventuring yeah yeah yes i'm going to grab this crater and then i'm just going to like wander around and check out the new stuff uh ping nades for your boy because i would like to spam them uh i will try some straw for you okay dude the start of a new season right it's typical start of a new season one squad left and they're actually fighting are they scrapping yeah i saw somebody get knocked in the kill feed i'm gonna shoot uh i'm just testing out my gun oh yeah good point well so it will tell me when that's reloaded right it's like four seconds five seconds i think i think it's five seconds four or five seconds yeah it comes up on right all right i'm using a one times on the repeater oh my god they look so clean oh you got you guys gotta buy uh buy some uh check out some of the skins too the legendary ones might be better i can't hit the i can't hit this guy oh i'm gonna go to dude i love that rotation out of there it's great look down the hill so much mobility before it was just that felt like such a dead part of the map rotating through there just felt so uh it did yeah coming out of slums was like it was so difficult the only the only like way to justify coming out of slums was to go to uh i'm actually a containment anton dude i love these little all these little things that you could break into oh is there more on you over there i don't know maybe i'm going to chill here i don't know if they were going back or not i got my own that's pretty fast i'm gonna pull back a little bit of that 84 on crypto get this guy all messed up i messed up wait if you spam the repeater it's so quick for those 40 damage shots it's like 42 damage it's like this is like a better wingman now yeah it actually is it's going to be so broken and competitive like in ranked i think i can't wait to like really buckle down and try to get used to it no i said i was terrible but uh that was fun
