it was a gauzy treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some more effects legends of course and today we are playing a little bit of rife and when I saw the patch notes for season 5 I thought the Wraith was pretty going to be used less than she was before but it turns out the her ability is just as good as it was used to play slightly differently to get the same effect and he got me thinking actually oh I think the respawn could literally remove her ability altogether from the game and I still think that people would play her loads because race power isn't just in her abilities it's in her absolutely meanness fueled hitbox first of all she's still the most used legend on the game and recent hitbox issues with the new skin that was released with the new events let her respond to have seen on Twitter that if he could go back he'd make all the characters the same size because it is so difficult to balance them and it's because so much of the power of a legend on apex is hidden within how easy or how difficult they are to hit because of the massive discrepancies in their sizes wraith is less than half the size of giving i played in the other day and my god you i just melted when you're playing gibraltar every single shot lands he's so big he has his own gravitational force on nearby bullets it just pause the me that's genuinely what it feels like when you're running around as gibraltar and this is why rate will always be the try-hards favorite legend because in one thing one gunfights cheese they're so slippery and so difficult to eat especially if they're doing that wingman strafe that's why they they play raced and they use the wing mode because you unhittable you can't hit them and this is also why brief may be one of the best characters for a new player to play is because you don't have to do anything to take advantage off for a tiny hitbox you don't have to use any abilities whatsoever it's just a passive and I've been playing a more I love and having more success because as I said you just take less damage so I hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and our seconds my drinks all right containment to these mis amigos you guys can tell me that it's mis amigos not me amigos someone is here their evidence all right annoying what's a combo hey stop it nice job teammate yeah that's a tremendous little doll cooking combination I think I'm running a little low on ammo kind of still kind of low to be honest just if you see some I know we're going to start the game but don't be the only team that actually lands day actually there were two teams obviously because the revenant their Raven it before then when they looted this they just sprinted over as fast as they could for the third party I think listen no wait this is pointing my teammate thinking about it yeah that makes more sense cause it'll make that miss amigo think I'm telling you this a lot I'm not ten you have to speak Spanish because but I think me amigo sounds better I'm a fat offensive I apologize if it ease it's just a friendly suggestion the think is it pretty doesn't produce an horrendous to a native Spanish speaker but it's just my opinion and it's probably a completely ignorant one and I regret I regret saying mis amigos from your notes no I've come to totally God nothing if you weren't aware this is one of the best new cheerleader flute spots in the entire game you can very often find yourself a gold gun sitting on the floor may as well man here extended light bag here level two oh thanks friends well to grade it already very much appreciate it I sort of dicen a lot of people left considering how someone white games been going recently thank you very much hey none of that careful teammate be shirtless or did you knock your shields off already yo this week Oman the American service hey nice job our students for a second how I mentioned diamond I was already in cover quite clearly but I'm on the American service at moments I'm not used to playing on any sort of level of pink are you have clean this guy I mean I guess he was you're killed to be fair I've seen none of that that's fine good he levels anyway when I used to live in London I literally used to get it zero pink on four nights you've ran me down to the zero was which was that rageous inside yes hello friend I smell crazy right 98 for my Evo shelter turn into purple this because it's got a faster fire rate I um I'm gonna use more bullets for you all right so this isn't really the gun combo for a level of pure evil shields you'd want some like a g7 escapes or no charge rifle be perfect on the way I'm really far behind letting me eat whoring into these you tarring get to look at him Lisa narcs are though in here anyone but who's still me but I wanted it to be nice hey guys an actually two Psychopaths both my teammate sorry let me know um do both my teammate and and the caustic just running there with his Austin Holmes Andy do any damage with your screen that's why I hate been away from the fight you know I gain their light and it's already totally happened without your your presence okay package not sure what I'm hoping for gold he'll me it would be pretty good I guess because my ability is kind of buffed kind of four times ten times you know I've already got loads of that God bags not bad as soon as I leveled the so far there we go kill leaders got his for K veggies 20 kill badge obviously lobbies time to diet Allah be quicker name only 15 other Pete bus of shame it was gonna check the Korsak sitting on top of that particular doorframe because every single money footsteps is I'm talking nice I mustn't be kill we know who it was when I saw his Bangalore a shame all my teammates one shot you got  by the g7 but I'm liking the honorton Islander and the pilot I don't really need to farm anymore Purple's fine people are scrapping the distance to think it was safe Illya he'll leave his dead so I won't have to deal with him making its but if they killed the fork a badge 20 kill badge Bangalore there we go then won't be a threat themselves I don't have either of those badges on Bangalore I used to I still Manor I've got like a 5kd on that character the Train I know the lob is it any more difficult but you're just not gonna get it I have a chance is before this all started kicking off these clothes right here he might be down actually you're down or confused or both you're a maniac that's my teammate okay there's still someone else up there unless you killed him no there's no a missus I tell you my aim is the jury just goes like this when I tried me apart this is why you never see me hit fight come on shots Thomas how about a health nice both flanking you I think I'll never hit fire again in my life I hate it I can't do it so my game is booked Alex I don't know it's just impossible maybe I need to aim with elastic more need to get used to the fact that it's not actually the same level is did he crawl here was this where he actually died he got fire Denis I've seen to get used to the fact that it's not it's not the same you don't get the same as ceased when you're zoomed in I just need more practice I just act like it's gonna lock me on like a missus to us and it doesn't and then it's just embarrassing give me that sight oh okay a gold Prowler Thanks it's fun mr. visited the old the old bunker was he saw a GoPro did you give this up I picked up he said thanks oh is that for the heavy ammo I'm not entirely sure all right two of the squads a fortune the circle is fairly big so we may be searching for a while here the situation you just go listen out know that if they do start scrapping but you are within third by a distance here not me so jump down well I assume you are yes you are oh I'm gonna get there late I don't like not play Pathfinder I miss I miss you I miss the grapple I do there we go see that's how I went into the gun for our last not good let's get Ferb parted that I went in knowing that that hipfire is different and I actually landed a good amount shots just practice everything is practice I hate organized my inventory's like this listen I don't want see them reload easy I just hate this this might I wish I could just get an auto looter hey hey you probably do me a favor I'm boarding oh I'll tell which is chilly I'm actually bored of looting I mean there's two other people at maximum potentially even want I don't need you to be perfect I just need to throw ball two and enough ammo and a few shield batteries we're good no mate these last team could be a very defensive team and we may be eleven then we kill but the the champion I thought we killed it there's no way he had 11 kills a screech I thinks cuz I have 11 kills and he's got confused or something unknown there's no way that's true do it's on a rampage we go for the get back you Jimmy over there I guess so okay he's so fast was an accident did you did you ping that by accident there you go there God what some fences and everything I've told you the last thing we'll be defensive on all perfect I have known medium range ability you've used your ultimate I can't really get on top of that a big detour this team trying drop down and no ah what am I talking out of course I didn't take that not worth it I can't get up there I can't get up there yes when I'm winning I just don't think I can climb this can i I can't climb it I don't think it's worth it see mate that's why I have to just wait for them horrendous way of playing the game and a horrendous some may say I don't even think I can get up this way can i you can climb this mountain but not from this side I'm and they do have a pathfinder ultimate gun up there it's all you friend I can time what can I do maybe gain to a position where if he downs one I could brush up on their zip line potentially only five face I can actually get up there you drop yeah shut up it's not it's still a devotees range and they stand there what are you doing with that only team where are you going why are you running I can't follow you friend look look I guess I do she's Paula thanks he's damn that's one down nice job I got beaned tonight but pretty much he's got that ego just throwing the flow they just isn't bringing the flow the job of teammate you can always won't be too bad if so difficult for me to even get a bet good to have a nice feels nice even to have a good teammate get some support in the old in the arena yeah more damage than me somehow how did that happen I had a single fire hemlock so I guess he managed to get a bit of poke damage the thing is with an honor time Prowler is what I saw Matt for it's terrible to use with an Evo sometimes because you don't get damaged numbers you can use escapes and get ready you go really quick but with those two like in-your-face submachine guns if you don't deign someone you're probably going to die so you get the 200 damage in that seat so with those 17 kills in this day and age with a bunch of aggressive plays in the lobby apart from the last team actually solid performance thanks for watching how to preach 18 I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
