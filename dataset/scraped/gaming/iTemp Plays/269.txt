hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we all know that wraith gets a bad rap here on apex or at least the wraith mates do they seem to be a little toxic a little bit too tryhard perhaps but i was lucky to have a 4k wraith in my game today because i did my absolute best to throw the game apparently so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i can see a lot of shadows landing here that's gonna arm switch but i forgot that doesn't do i forgot that doesn't do damage anymore that's a good night and that kind of struggling god yeah this is fun stupid g7 this guy can probably see me oh they're in there oh nice job teammate i was lifting two by accidents okay got barely any heavy bullets it's going to keep the wingman plus i'm actually landing a fair few shots is it the g7 guy actually really want him dead teammates shooting him two must be really weak i mean there's not a prayer is there and i've got 20 bullets left that was a mistake i had a few more but i shot them into the sky in celebration it's got nothing there's a team in here decided to pad on my forehead a little bit of a questionable play here but that gold armor get off the roof i was going to risk it i don't want to get pinched uh pinch it again for the eighth time this game oh my god hello yeah sorry and it's a good job i did rush that guy because we would have been painted again ammo for the 80th time you're 40. i mean i've got a wheel i can make dude with like 10. come on it's got 80. and extended back come here teammate sharon is caring here you go all right where'd these boys go we've got a bit of momentum here me and wraith i reckon this team hasn't really fought anyone and we probably have way better armor actually does a good amount of damage doesn't it did you hate him does that mean you hit him i might just give this to go anyway i've got a havoc and i fell off i actually could have killed him okay make sure this guy doesn't drop on my head it's gonna drop my head 100 there he is have a havoc with a purple mag amigo i killed thanks for playing i need energy ammo making contact with enemies come on i'll close the door behind you look at that good manners all right re45 what you got for me had to drop my trusty havoc because i've got zero bullets reloading i've seen we sat up top i actually wouldn't have seen him if i didn't have a digital threat here i don't usually use the answer and it's a okay i definitely did see you even though i missed every single shot that was that was a different matter let's go this way copy that why was his box red there's no way he had red armor right i mean there could be there might be a way he was aggressive all right humongous scrap and the disney good news is we've been able to ah false alarm enemy over there we've been able to leave salvage as well you know this way where do we go this fight's over this way sounds pretty far away now i'm going to turn around already get some high ground on the ship too hello guys i was not to play sorry amigos that's why like chasing people up to high ground is the worst because you you can't shoot for ages the animation takes so long all right this one's still actually going on zone's closing he's got 30 seconds i'm not even sure this is worth going into the zone for because by the time we get there i assume one of the teams is going to die so we could just wait for them i love celebrating with my best friend that's you i'm not sure they're going to come this way yeah there we go someone's got a plea down it's more like left i reckon they'll come this way but if we cover both angles then we're going to watch this then we're laughing you know and won't miss anything they're still fighting in there he's dead in the ring i mean his third zone now third ring that kind of hurts guys you can't just stand in there and fight i mean i probably could have went actually i've got gold and good amount of syringes i actually would have been okay that's not what i wanted to do i'm trying to scan this get my ultimate back for supreme efficiency on pathfinder and as long as i don't get crabarized there we go we're fine uh back to where we came from teammate we didn't actually get to fight that many people here annoyingly because when we turned up there was a massive amount of people scrapping here oh my god oh my god i killed him took out an enemy out of bounds he died because he didn't get off the crank okay guy come on you've got to read the patch notes you only get 15 seconds now out of bounds it used to be 30. that means there's a random solo guy over this way whose teammate he might be trying to respawn soon and there's some of the dream machine behind us obviously i can't see he's too far away oh don't worry though this guy can see me apparently he's the world's best he's got eagle eye vision he's still alive still alive this guy's still alive the first time these gas disappears livestream is only his ultimate i think he must be only his ultimate that disappears when he dies it's not that nice the team's coming here though oh i like this one second we got this stupid corsic and his stupid fortified passive taking 15 reduced damage the guy's an actual walking unit he's got the defense stats of for the full rune in 2005. you know you saw something full rune in the wilderness in 2005 you wanted nothing to do with them too tanky your room long saw can't do any damage charge is annoying yeah we're better than these guys we'll just get close range as long as it's not under the course tick with eight thousand health we should be okay again charge rifled in the back i thought this guy was outside i'm actually throwing i thought i saw him through the window i was trying to arm a switch this 10 nice the ring's closed okay no more throwing let's win all right this is great news because now we get to kill the charge rifle man with no other teams in the area you know there's no one for him to work around it could actually just be him there's a load of ultimate so i assume that's where he's getting all his sniper ammunition this guy should have pushed us in the back or tried to get up top on this big rock oh is that a crater recharging i was two of them sorry there are two of them gotta be grammatically correct you know got him once i'll take it i was trying to ping my god knock down because this guy's got a crater so if he headshots me i can basically instantly start my style phrase and i want my teammate to know that guy's got a hemlock not a craver under the crater sorry you guys got to move down the first guy punch him punchy skye whack him i was going to punch him into the zone thank goodness my teammate was a 4k wraith because i did my absolute best to throw that game i mean the first death caustic is just corsic is a is a stupid legend okay the 15 people underestimate the power of his fortified passive it's so broken nearly three thousand damage although too far if i wasn't choking that game that easy could have been like thirty five hundred i i was on twenty one hundred a long time ago teammate came in clutch i'm happy with that that was a good game i was scared at the end when i heard the crater i'll be honest the guy had a lot of practice sniping clearly but yeah oh thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it bye
