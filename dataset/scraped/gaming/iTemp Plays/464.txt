hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i have never landed quite as many wingman headshots as you will see in this video the first team i come across i land two headshots on each of them in quick succession and i wouldn't be surprised if they actually reported me for that one now the weird part is i'm still trying to adapt to using a regular dual shock ps4 controller after using a scuff for so long and watching it back it was almost certainly look but we take those so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends sent a cool guy with the cornmeal literally the words um it's okay um in there just such a gaming specimen this thumbstick is just the worst thumbstick i've ever used i think that's just an absolute lie and i'm over here one clipping people charging i mean what were you saying about the clumsic no  i hear someone here we're clear no ring players near us uh did you enjoy my lace anything good i mean you took all that one that was mine oh the one that i headshotted all mine scan for me i'm gonna go one two three all right i'm gonna let you and you're gonna die and then you're gonna be mad right just get ready just if you find a mobile reason because all i say is pick it up there's a guy ahead of him i thought he's someone yeah headshot oh my god i'm the best wingman gamer ready for this headshot oh i hit him what's the headshot though here oh you ready if i hedge you out this guy i'm literally queen uploading the video just the first four minutes ready and it's scary they're running he's running really fast i had to because of that ring flares opening near me watch it firing reloading oh this is the one i killed in the beginning i'm sorry no you're not i can't see him because some idiot pinged that idiot was indeed me it's go time better watch it any heavy max rings you didn't ping the scope here so when i'm landing the headshot after headshot with you're the worst teammate you're actually the worst i am i am i'm still a solo player at heart like i'm i can't get used to that's kind of teammate that's kind of crazy i mean it kind of is i'm sorry yeah but when i need you i clutch up for us so that's what i mean i'm not i'm not here for the pings i'm here for the clutches all right i was like our first game all right oh my gosh oh my god technically my fault technically my fault will admit will admit he's just in the he's in the bin in the bin maybe my thought may be my fault definitely i didn't rode you with that close so i i heard them rushing me and i was like let me get out of here you know this is the problem uh with the dynamic that we have your cons are just always urgent yeah there's no level there's no level of like kind of urgent a little urgent it's always just i'm dying now and i full send in and then i die do you know the problem is that you don't tell me if you told me i'm full sending in i would have known that you were full sending in you know so i mean you should know me by now let me maybe get the vibes up i literally don't know how to do anything else have you ever seen me not full send no i didn't i knew you were there i'd have been there with you but i didn't know how close you were no i know i just like ran in and yeah i appreciate that i needed it uh do you need some energy emma there's someone here energy ammo here um why do i have a wingman what the hell i think i took your energy just like loser for this box mate look at this one sometimes oh i didn't even take it rich come on yeah i literally went out of my way not to take it even though everything in my body told me wait till he gets up and shoot him they got me when he goes in there dilated that's karma virus here you know sometimes karma's just on your boy's side i had a rough i had a rough month i knew that dub that makes up for it the flooding the work the go excellent everything losing my goals not eating fresh opening up with that dub the exchange rate of dubs the balance is back high ratio at 100 out of the row you know i win did you know do you want to hear some apex trivia oh sure the wingman is the only gun you can get all gold attachments for fact what about uh i'm actually the best gamer that's a decoy stop being an idiot doing this is bad this is bad for that there's one right side come here i'm gonna cover no good that's 120. dude there's no way she hits a headshot right there like oh my god oh my god this is i don't have a gun the guy landed in here after me and got a gun are you going if there's one in it are you ready here on ammo okay what there's someone here the heck just happened i'm good was he there the whole time i couldn't see him i don't know what happened i couldn't see him either i was so confused that you're popping a finisher on a death box me too i think that he like respawned me to do that or something i was so confused there's so much going on too i couldn't focus cranking my heart that guy by the van you'd be glad to know that there is a ring there on us right now and someone jumped over this way yeah i down the guy uh i went over here did you oh not this gun oh god he's here you can only go down i'm about to go it's officially down low you should have shot me what are you doing [Music] okay i'll finish that mirage for that poor mirage was vibing the finish in the middle of the battlefield that was terrifying it was so much because i was trying to i heard octane pushing so i was trying to hold off the octane and i heard you cranking a finish or a wall that was happening so i looked at from my angle it looked like you're cranking a finish on a death box there's no one there i think honestly i think that was his box but then another buck spawned in on that one there was no one i know they're invisible when they go down but that was like 35 seconds after weird because i down like three people there i don't know i don't remember what happened i have five kills high five two we got ten kills from that way crazy if i have 390 damage okay i didn't have a gun for the first 25 minutes and i didn't steal two of the kills from me because they were fighting loads of people no none of them had armor what there's like three people in a row oh you're actually sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry you wanted too much you asked for he when you're using the wingman i don't be in this gold piercer when you're using the r9 i don't think the r9 you know there's a lot there's one in there i didn't realize no that's my fault i was looking for one i didn't even look for it yeah there's a 99 in that box now big things are thank you he'll just be healed by the time you get there unfortunately no no no no no i'm full sending off that call out okay uh he just finished the battle i saw it i i think i saw him pop back no no no no no no no no no where's the where's what you didn't even want me to take that is that what's going on here i told you that i was gonna put a pad rich on the roof well i didn't say specifically where but you know that was a banging pad wait this is an action wait what i'm i'm dead nice right in the middle what is this character dude i can't even explain what happened to me that guy was like yeah i don't know what happened i obviously tried this close one there's a purple here that was so strange i he sent a decoy out and i shot the decoy for a split second and i think there was an actual player right behind the decoys because i shot the player guy's poor soul oh he's so long sometimes teamwork absolutely did you give up i'm still trying but like some sometimes i'm good sometimes i'm not good and i don't know what the difference is i don't get it that's the winner that's literally i guess it is you know you know when you're confident you hit your shots when you lose your confidence is when you're going to start potatoing time because then you start hesitating i seven kills and 720 damage nice we're moving at the same pace and kills but i mean just damage is just not even remote my damage i mean i have like about 1300. the three people i killed at faster none of that armor and you didn't shoot any of them just saying so i i definitely did anyone no you'll see even though you'll see anyone that even took a breath was taking a bullet from me i mean almost finishes though i mean i just i have the eyes of lamora it's crazy i was finishes oh no no no no no no what are you doing challenging me like that's [Music] [Music] oh they're getting on the back this one is on a thousand pin oh my god dude movement over here just so you know i mean you know that's now you know how i feel every day nice headshot ringman game is back and he's gaming with the wingman nice oh definitely now you're fine i probably i would have you snapped on him no thanks i mean you should probably have this goal are you kidding no way why did you say it like that like the rate that i go down is way more there's no way we're gonna have to do some statistical analysis i don't even know where they're at i'll just learn it oh my god i was dead have fun wait i'm sorry i just wanted to do just like one damage you know get a little cis get a little 20 damage he was literally one hp oh it's all at least no false advertising there i'm not causing that you can believe it yes oh this is the trailer boxes up here i missed a lot that's where i was earlier on level five um one team left look at the circle nice i mean these guys i need 2000 damage to get uh to get a 4k okay not that bad correct did you see how great oh i'll make it this way you shot like a thousand feet in the air not my swing are they really over here yeah i saw them like landed like they took a balloon and went to the left somewhere okay nice worth it oh yeah they took it they got the care package i'm damaged oh okay oh okay well this is just not playing damage too good literally too good this is is oh just ruin the kd just ruin the kd nice damn daniel is your apex champions uh come on could have dropped this one we out we've got 24 kills and what 3 700 damage that's kind of low we had so many kills at the start of the game in 13 years yeah yeah we had 10 kills like in the first two minutes yes
