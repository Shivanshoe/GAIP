okay scrap it source it to you these I'm not sure how long this is gonna last because every game that I've played so far everyone Lancia there's no gun there's no I'm up this is a prey bear should be interesting so probably try and get a different gun here it's not like he's beneath me though you speak me out there teeming sorry not see me any makeup please by dance going I thought he just crawled down taking here I thought he'd just crawl down loads of safety sensitivity this is unbelievably low but if you in crazy my gosh teammate I'm gonna trade there you go we both need some armor oh nice guy Adnan either there is a joint scrap going on well to be honest I can't even hear anything anymore but there was a joint scrap gun on a dealer building I'm a little bit shook because they could easily fly on over with the zipline if we aren't at the top oh okay it's nice on the techne flat mine I'm going for the double sniper tactic you never before seen or at least for me that was it that was in one out as in I don't talk like that load us actually looking pretty good that may be the third ever crabber kill as I've got here so I never use this gun I'll never pick it up I don't trust myself with it I shall be a headshot wish man this man should be dead that's pointless if I down the Gibby he calls her safety and get to revive if I down you the guy give you dumb down and debuff him so he actually Hills quicker and he's don't also he provides quicker it's like it's like the new life line is like life 12.0 oh let's see yeah thanks for playing the shot look at this absolutely sugar okay now I am I've landed more crazy shots this game and in my entire easy gonna revive revive sentry hate variable scopes I tense up on my shoes and it just means that I changed the vet all that sucks he's got a massive should be wait till they're roaming the streets down here isn't he gives you some small heals I hear your teammate I really wanted to try and loot him so different team that's a different team I should probably leave it's gonna mask if it's why I just very careful I was just really hoping that he was gonna get greedy and go up top and try and lure something still might kind of get an angle there I'll just go down fight m8 I got yet the respawn beacon still here we're going back into the game we can come back and get some decent live forever there's a few deaf boxes there this is a risky double sniper setup that I'm rocking now not sure the flatline would have been a better move but I mean I've treat the crater locket okay just to there's two people hanging out near respawn beacon why didn't I engage with the snipe like the crater Oh calm down double crazy Craver squared like it's ridiculous there's nothing scary in this game the ninja brought I tell you I nearly ran away our bility nearly just booked it is that the term booked it I don't know if that's a term enough things I'm a med kit right then more shots in it teammates back I have said but how did I get seven kills I've done for people with a crabber alone so just good that guys stuff I only upgraded a bag and took some syringes I think it allows us have been there for you oh she's been a good game so far a real good game I've never landed this many crappy shots in my life I was terrible with this good one earthís happened oh we did that level one I thought he had level 2 for some reason I was gonna ping it out for the boy well girl I guess series Bangalore alright well I think that was a very small beacon hostile over there there's definitely that way yeah they're scrapping - oh that is nowhere near high enough it's because I didn't have my skin on good I wasn't used to eat I try and line it up with the low mark the size for because it says it's like 300 and so it makers away that's 500 that's because it's the hill below or behind this would definitely be my longest night before time if someone just starts a loose or something that's all I need start standstill friend Christmas miracle in January all I needed was one of their PlayStation controllers to disconnect and I mean I'd have been sets headshot easy never lucky friends never a little bit of confidence with this some crab another actually landed a few shot unbelievable sorry I'm just so shocked after they changed that the bunny hop in you know you spelled to do this many times since they patched it looks a new to be school it's more like rounds teammate main needs the better shields med get here if you finally I think the loot looks is kind of weird in this mode all I find is shield batteries everywhere and the armor I know I've got purple here oh there we go riding that's a fresh prey be too wasted on my shots but I often run around with no shields or level one shields I just by extremely lookie here I'm gonna try and get some high ground I wasted so much time trying to crab with him that the storm saw pushing towards here close care package touching down they usually carry their platforms by shield less I did hit that guy's fault because I saw level 1 and level 2 I'm not sure what the Hawks are doing French I guess he didn't have the grenade indicator did you come from can I don't over loot he might need some stuff Phoenix a lovely stuff but there were so many people at this angle that I'm worried that people are gonna be coming out of the storm there we go you see that they if they wanted to fight that easily could have come towards us instead I know we're here Tom's not pushing them out oh my god I'm the craver King what happened what has happened how did I hit you the guy why would you stand next to this is awesome can you fire a vibe right there the job team at absolutey oh you want to get credit - ah I'll do it all day forget triple took a lander can incur a price that's look better than in terminology I'm gonna pick this girl up in the regular mode okay I've got a newfound confidence with this we have one-off double digits in smoke five squads left I attend shots left that's not bad if he worth getting some throw balls I've got so many healable to some real my gold arm Robbie I'll be sets set for life I'm Minuten don't have a gun there we go I'm not sure that's worth it we got 30 seconds left I might have to trade this in listen I know I've been I never been crab rising people she wondered what's the mast if I definitely saw one there we go look when Tiffany gets down to like three squads here and these guys are in buildings the Mastiff may come in clutch fields I want him don't kill credit though is wrong I say portal I must grip my controller like no one else okay I still got a crater that's good news though because if I get close he's only got one decent price range good praise friend we're getting pushed I'm gonna go to the left because the other team is on the right and I wanted to get pinched I don't want to be the team that gets pinched team I don't please don't smoke it smokey this way for more grapple twice Romney kills land upon did I get ten all these guys that's 12 combined I think we're going to our turnoff thousand damaged nearly absolutely devastate don't even I don't even want to know how that ends I don't I don't care I don't care I'd say well I think if I if I put my Tristan in the craver I think I know slept in there like I did that Pathfinder early on a quick scoping like it Lucky's call a dream modern warfare 2 intervention sleight of hand Pro I don't even care that much that we didn't win I'll tell you why because how many games have you seen me win on youtube.com that game is interesting because I don't think I've pretty buddy 2 videos of the crater and landed a total of about three shots that my friends was an inspirational performance for myself I inspired myself I'll take that here we go free peacekeeper skin reach 500 RK point it's pretty decent one Lamarr on your skin not bad it's worth thrown on when it's only a bullet which is a rare but that is a decent rare skin especially because considering everyone's going to get these I've barely played you over I was in your play for about 40 minutes not bad
