hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using the wingman almost exclusively in the two games that i have for you today i have become so much more confident with this weapon now and it's just so much fun to use i have more wingman games on the way one in ranked where i was just head shotting everyone hopefully you guys enjoy the wingman gameplays because i have used it so much recently so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends here heavy mag like i actually got great loot yeah we're laughing oh yeah they're bopping i found a half up here i hear a spinny going i do indeed hear that as well do you need a battery i just found two i have uh um did the guy drop down too there's another one in the doorway lifeline's 50 health max i did that let's see if they stay up i'm just wait one just open the door somebody's on the roof though right one just grappled away level this is 100 worth it look i need to regen one health so no well maybe a little like arthritis or something i play i don't play very good my first games on either it usually takes a few i don't think it's my hands i think it's my brain i'm not lying my eye it's my eyes like like i've got 20 20 vision but sometimes i'll it'll be blurry first game of the day because i'm just so confused i feel like it's not like blurry but i just feel like my reactions are slower oh you going you going in someone is in here i don't see him though i'm bottom floor they're in the stairs nice team running this way too like i see it for eighty middle guy they have a pad are you there pad they're breath pushing yeah there's i think there's like three different things here i sent the rev back right i'm getting absolutely destroyed for that charge rifle we got we got like three teams we've got charge rifle team rev team and then we got that crypto team yep and a team that landed on the hill all the way like northeast like that way we're just chilling with joe yep good job i got rid of that octane pad look that kryptos coming from banners again which way is he like here yeah he's over here he's in this building he's out back in that building he's going over here now oh kill him yes get rid of him flash let's see what these guys are up to so remember there's the other character that's needy cracks inside the ring i got shot in the back you can hit the pad to your rope okay thank you [Music] fire friends i have no healables not stuck here i go whole team just sitting underneath us man they're not making any moves he's over here somewhere he's right here they're putting another team uh shields me and a pk i feel like one's like a purist and one's like i'm just going to brief everyone that's a weird combo yeah it is giving my shields a recharge i know right i hear some people around it actually sounded like they were outside it didn't even sound like they're in the building it sounded outside here unless it was your footsteps i could hurt yours maybe teammates got a good ping there but we're safe here too and i don't think they're selling cookies i thought i saw something down the hill i don't know there's one rat somewhere here too one solo oh yeah whole team here let's go let's go behind them let's go find these guys i have rope okay pretty far away though we can use the rope to get back if we need it okay like you can send it in and then we can like use that hello i don't know i have no idea but they started shooting at each other and i wonder i wonder if maybe yeah maybe 100 valkyrie purple my shots all right i'm going in is that not work man i'm not with you i'm trying to get to you there's a random guy in this corner i patted i pat it to chase and i counted it into the other team that was sitting there if you had to get rid of one gun in the game rich what gun would it be um good question me miguel i couldn't answer man i was like right now i feel like it's the most balanced the game has ever been oh like the first thing that comes to mind speed five but this spitfire is fine now honestly i kind of have a problem with it at the moment i fixed it oh taken down i don't think you're frying down here i'm doing okay that right should be somewhat weaker health he was up top he probably went down to heel though yeah he probably went down the hill he was in this back corner oh oh right here top middle thing crashing again he's going down again before we want flash [Music] i think every gun in this game is fine man everything feels viable in one way or another and everything nothing feels like super overwhelming no definitely not i come onto hey that's all you bro i only hit him once good work team frying rich what do you like to see i'm doing okay giving my shields a recharge we meant so fun man what was i doing sleep on this gun for like four years you were sleeping on it a great gun you know my favorite site for the wingman just found it close range i wanted to on the fly line no on the wingman or on the no no no i'm using it i'm using it i'm using it are you are you smoking glue what do you smoke
