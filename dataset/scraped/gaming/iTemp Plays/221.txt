might be something good this way what happened to our teammate we didn't get one so it's just two it's weird it's okay though we can make this work at least i hope we can i'm playing race so if there was ever a legend to do it i think it's her all right we've got havoc it's only white on but it's okay if these guys are in a fight which they are i say we just get involved what we got to lose [Music] i mean that's the dream right that's the dream recharging i've met kids so i don't need loads of uh syringes anymore i've gone re-45 and i have it the havoc is so good early game like one man kill someone easily did it a few times there i actually needed light rains i assume i would have taken them if there was any oh there we go don't mind never overestimate my booty the world record i think kind of tough to control this range contact with target new killer watch for them how's the mirage decoy actually that's a mirage decoy too i mean he could just be running to the sunset here we both using energy now we are reloading killed an enemy this guy's just gonna run to try and get his teammate back there's no way that's unused but keeping focus it wasn't used this place is unlooted okay oh did i already pick it up that guy got away with his teammates banner who cares there's definitely more people this way we didn't finish the kills over here i'm gonna try and have some fun with this game because it's only two of us and that is a respawn over there i'm going this way though i don't want to confuse him i think that's the pathfinder managed to escape over that way that's absolutely fine one nice work care package coming in recharging my shield this is going surprisingly well wait i have six kills i'm not the kill leader that's unusual that's a huge find the most random death box in here i have nothing else in it follow the tunnel portal's ready all over the place i can't trade back any damage here friend now i can [Music] shield here level three need some help here one second we got this i needed you need to recharge my shields oh my god yeah i guess they realized i'm solo so just decided to rush what can you do what could you do the tree the land of the tree this diamond tree he probably thinks he's in ranked land at the tr so sorry guys the presents teabagging nice we made the right choices there were people at the tree what a great start i mean there's nothing more satisfying than killing people who are trying to punch you especially when that someone he's a caustic and then his friend comes over ah i've got the full sniper loader here i'm not anymore obviously i've dropped it but i did you got a cargobot oh she loaded this shouldn't get a gun that sucks what a cargo bomb purple armor gold knockdown oh that's a that is those are some big things how far is the fault oh it's miles away i'm gonna hold on to this it's so far well it's an interesting start i was i was this in the tree to begin with but you know what i regret my decision that's a fun place to land those guys at least uh people have been here how do you how do you say again it's like that one activity i think the wrong place medkit here people have been through yes map shows were spread out a lot contact he tried to hit me i've got 20 bullets in my brows nice job team oh my god what is in my adventure that i don't need did anyone have a vault that's the question i'm looking for a vault okay i do like the prowler having a good time with the longbow but i've got a gold mag oh here we go the stuff of dreams i don't need that medkit do i charging my shield not a full i need energy ammo all right i know the squad wipe only got one of those kills but i did some good damage against the caustic i'm 700 now i think we just need to run north honestly i think this is i think that's our best bet to find people just get out of here this way whenever i play race i never know when to use my portal 28 seconds ago it wasn't that team right i was aged before package coming in 23 seconds ago right here pressure going just chaser [Music] could i switch yes i could am i going to absolutely not oh come on oh this guy's got the right idea i guess i've gone to pipe i'm out of energy ammo that's the last of that squad i don't want to drop my prowler i'm going to have to do i get some of that no taking a moment it's so sad i'm going to carry this though recharging my shields one day someone will be using energy and i will be able to loot their 200 bullets okay how useful is bloodhound there by the way didn't know those guys were there saw the footsteps so we knew that someone was going to be nearby and then the huge scan as well oh look look what it is 20 energy bullets but i still would have been terribly under prepared for any sort of scrap so i can't move i don't know if i can heard that i hear you which is the best they're in the same place again oh god he's killed nashville they're just assholted up there oh my god nice job teammate reloading i don't know how far i can take us i'm taking shots nice teammate i'm glad that guy said paul's late because i never would have i have a mobile respawn this is huge deploying a respawn beacon i never would have thought to do that i told you i did i mention that i remember thinking it i'm not sure if i ever actually mentioned the fact that i never think to use my abilities when i play wraith like ever i've kind of i've kind of been frying this game just a little bit kind of destroying my teammates is this my teammate's death box yes but it was my race using the phoenix i think i took his back that's for death box here that's for him there'll be enough of the rounds surely any sniper ammo no i mean i have 38 with a long bow thank goodness he said portal i mean i think i could have stuck the res but uh teammates said he had a gold bag so i stopped we also have a lens wall right all his welding ends well i think we need to get out of here 30 seconds i'm happy with my healer balls i'm happy with my attachments apart from the barrel stabilizer in stock still fine longbow's been treating me well been quick scoping most of people on this server wait we landed three this game and i've got two half thousand damage this is a world's first there you go it's not about playing wraith turns you into a straight demon i think i must must be the reason what can i hear yeah they're fighting on that north i think let's go this way i was trying to distinguish the the noise but i'm pretty sure they are fighting this guy heard it too so makes sense that they'll be coming from capital yeah gunshots oh they're big scrapping they're absolutely humongous scrapping no he's down two of them no the last team did he trade any downs i don't think he did i think he was a clean wipe that sucks because sometimes people like to loot before they revive and then you get there and then you shoot the guy that's already been down you get the kill pretty it's just the greatest one of the worst there is it's kind of crazy i don't have a i don't have a knife that guy don't get caught we broke one of them i think he said someone's so close nice job teammates i managed to do like 150 damage that guy but there was two of them on me so i just had to phase out teammates are damaged nice that's the humongous kick of good jobness that's what it means that's what it translates to okay you are the apex champions huge gg nice work everyone's in the remote so i'm just standing still there you go nice job guys that was really fun
