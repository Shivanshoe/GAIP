hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and today we are playing some solo ranked in platinum on our way to diamond so then we can grind for masters and ranked it's hardly split i think it's got way more attention because of some big streamers coming over to apex and grinding ranked which is amazing but i'm loving it it's a great time and in the games that are happy today i shall be sniping first with a longbow with a one times on it for some reason and then with the sentinel which i had the three times for and i love sniping in ranked you can get some great pictures after fights it is a little bit trickier when you're solo queuing because of the communication factor but we made it work so thank you for watching i do appreciate it see you all five and a half seconds my friends i mean my loot's not the best um but it doesn't really matter if you're shooting people who are already in a scrap so i mean i haven't even got a bag to be honest i don't really need a bag i haven't even run out of space yet because my loot isn't the best and i assume if we manage to kill these guys one of them will have one there we go massive scrap well underway for kp and that's how you play ranked especially if you are playing solo like i am at the moment a dead eyes tempo in a center not i mean it's tempting but i think the longbow is better than the sense now but i think the sentinel is honestly i think it's more fun i think it's more it's more satisfying but i'm trying to take it seriously volt six there's a big scrap of the uh the streaming build at the moment of course or at least these gas remains up top i think that plan here is to try and commandeer this building is that the correct terminology we're just going to steal it it's our name where are enough of these people there's a respawn to the west sorry coursely he had his ultimate hand it is the reese it's just two people i mean there's no reason for us to push here i think we're just sitting on top of four story when i got a sniper can we just defend it because if other people appear it sucks we are currently fighting two different teams in one i think we should i'm researching are you okay i mean he's pushing he might have them weak maybe this isn't a good idea i don't think when he's running off let's just get back in let's get back to full story horizon spend off a full team here i just want to see up top with my one times longbow i can't see a gosh darn thing i'll be honest oh my god i should have traded revives i wanted my kill oh he's fine oh and i've got a gold back sorry teammate i don't you know i actually don't think that was my kill i think it was my teammate's kill i just really wanted to fury if the thing is it's not just this team's the west there's a team like underneath us to the east this big i mean that was the time to push if he were gonna push but they've probably got the teammates pushing these guys now what if we get they're still in here i'm scared of the broke though i put the rope down to try and rush those guys but no just gives them a free a free rush up top on us target over there i mean that's a full theme my teammates are actual psychopaths they've both pushed this so now i'm the odd one out so i may sort of regroup if someone gets a stream of building though we're kind of screwed because the zone's pushing that way but it's better to be as a three than it is for me to sit up there by myself and get headed on and die you know it's better to do a bad plan together than three separate plans i mean this is a really bad plan though i'm going to say i got 40 but with long bark i'm kind of spamming it the ring is in close proximity less than one minute we need to get out of here 10 seconds the ring is fairly close let's go she can't look in no one sat here out that is not a good push i know i missed every shot i mean i might have been able to come over if we were gonna rush these guys we should have just went train and help them and this team's on our last legs but now there's a team going streamer building i mean i mean my teammates are just a they're a pair of psychopaths i don't know what's going on here there's only three i mean it's plus 80 rp right but i'm still a little bit furious i can't i can't lie maybe no i'm furious i'm furious i'm pretty sure i only come over here when i'm playing ranked and as you may notice or as you may have already known about me i actually don't have any friends so i'm here playing solo ranked in platinum once again so far in diamond and i'm not strewn along in diamond lobbies which are substantially more difficult than platinum like i do not want a solo queue diamond it's actually pretty tough but it's definitely possible i'm not saying it's impossible you know but you'd have to take it a lot more seriously and did i pick the bagel yes and i don't want it so i'm just going to sell a coupon for a little bit it's not too bad what do you want some games uh the stocks recently didn't they their stocks do so much more than they used to i can offer you a level one because i'm also struggling because if you don't know if you used to have a better extending mag you actually reloaded your gun quicker and they've moved that buff to the or sorry that effect to the stocks so having a purple stock on a sniper zooms in quicker you've got reduced idle sway and your reload quicker so it's probably the most important attachment i would say one minute i've got to put on that shield cells there we go i wish i had three times no making contact i my teammates leaving with the force actually no they're not i thought you guys were leaving oh he was trying to kidnap one i thought you guys were leaving sorry i wasn't there i mean that was a little bit scuffed i wasn't sure whether to grapple into the middle of the fight or grapple away oh there we go three times these guys have to lose amazing moves obviously all right uh that's why it was a little bit scuffed and that's why soloq is a little bit more difficult because the communication factor is uh it's a little trickier you know strange it's okay we've got the job done let's see a decent fight in the end 500 damage 2kp i mean i have 2kp and i'm a minus 2rp like even if even if these lobbies were impossible here like in terms of the players you can get 2kp just by camp sniping just camp good got my ultimate ready let's grab over here we do need a bit more kp although there we go extra squads down we're actually positive with eight squads left with two killed participation points that's mental my ultimate is ready target spotted target spotted act oh my god zebzig oh that guy's dead via on the thumb sig that's mental call stick is an absolute tank i mean i guess that's a lim shot right but an amped up actually i don't know if i slap my amps nuts on the sense nowhere nice okay good opportunity i didn't realize they were respawning uh i only got 2kb for that that's fine though two out of three hostel spotted i don't know why i think about that sometimes well i don't know what my teammates can do with that information someone's pushing them wait that's a great pink now we just hold them so underneath us now there are two race well i just had a great buff idea but we're in the middle of a scrap hold on hello friends never mind coming teammates lightsaber okay all right so you know how watson is like electrified and stuff that's the whole like character thing why she could like already turbo stuff like turbo devo turbo havoc just watch your ping watch your ping because the doors close me the door's literally full on closed nice my teammates are the best i was talking about now please that's a friendly race okay i was talking about watson buffs we're back i didn't realize one was going to be on the roof like that let's get the life out of me i tend to save the portal oh yeah here we go no match i'm reloaded i'm good nice now i'm gonna get on the roof round two no i cancelled it this is a sad sad day oh there's a chance to trust this guy all right now he's got two options he's got a stand still and he'll there we go he took option two but she didn't even hear he just went for it which was to run and not heal which means he's pretty there we go perfect good job team i need i need you through the entire game there i was so close to throwing the entire game like i know i was just distracted by my brilliant watson idea what do you guys think about that she's like electric and stuff right so she picks up a devotion off the ground and it's already got a turbo attached is that too crazy because the turbo no it's the turbo's too good they should i don't know they need to do something to watson she's useless
