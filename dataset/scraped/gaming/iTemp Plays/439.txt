hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be looking at a teaser the respawn released as part of their 100 million player thank you video to the community now the teaser was tiny it was a few frames at most but it did show a lot and here is the most important one so what are we looking at my original thought was well it's obviously hammond laps it's going to take over for season nine you can see the giant waterfall in the background it's definitely hammond lapse but it's not and let me explain now chad grenier game director at respawn said that in season nine you're going to see a ton of titanfall coming into apex in one way or another handgun for season nine and apex legends is entering a new era for the game one that goes beyond battle royale for the respawn team and apex legends players the best is yet to come so it's looking more and more likely that this point of interest is actually a map for a separate game mode hints and rumors have been circulating within the community for well over a season now about a ranked 3v3 mode coming to apex and this would appear to be the biggest reveal we've had for it yet now 3v3 sounds like an incredible amount of fun the meta will be so different to the battle royale in terms of legends you don't need to rotate late game with 10 squads left in a tiny circle so is wraith going to be as useful will we see more zoning legends like caustic who can shut down an area of the already tiny map will pathfinder be useful at all when there is no real places to even grapple to it's interesting to think about and i'm really looking forward to this mode now just going to the map again if you look closely at the middle it looks like mirage voyage crashed down into it the map is nearly symmetrical with the only real differences being art related and it makes me think of other areas that they could adapt for the 3v3 mode i'm sure everyone's first thought is skull tank but it would take some adaption as it needs to be symmetrical as this is the easiest way to ensure its balance for both teams i personally would love to fight at thunderdome with a central power position that could be contested there are so many possibilities and each map will have its own meta in terms of legends and guns and also rewards let me know if you guys are looking forward to the potential 3v3 mode coming in season 9 and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the doberman and a german shepherd that sounds like she's really she's a dog she was pretty big uh she was smart like probably the smartest dog i've ever had she's so sweet and smart oh just cause both of those dogs are just uh they're they're really smart i'd be crying that's really sweet um we should have we can get to a i'm scanned from the right i think yeah might be something good this way uh i'm on my way i don't know [Applause] friend all right round one beginning ring countdown i'll play well played do we get the heck and freak over to one of the spots should i paige just out of interest i can catch up to you oh yeah i forgot that we could scan here as well do i heal or do i just wait over there uh cage a lot capacitor some artillery there's only one team at the rigged one i mean that's always gonna be dead ones over here nice mate uh running in low ground shotguns their bolts are just not play i honestly thinking back to how i mean i'm bad at looting now but back in the day oh my god useless so i reckon i was using the pk without a bolt and that's maybe why i didn't have much success with it i mean i don't know the way i see it like uh attachments in this game are just compliments are there not compliments they're supplements yeah they they just uh they they help i mean uh mags are a little bit more um necessary but i feel like most attachments are just supplements and you can do fine without them and i feel like sometimes uh using not using them kind of kind of helps you a little bit more is he used to like a weapon yeah yeah like getting used to a weapon in its worst possible uh like form and then if you can get good with that i feel like once you once you put attachments on it it completely changes the game oh yeah 100 i think mags and bolts are the only ones i really care about yeah those do make those do make a big difference for sure give the whole time yeah they definitely did if he's just sitting right now he's coming back to the right here she goes i'm literally not hitting her but i'm here for 11. i'm literally taking everything eliminated i'm not doing anything in this game oh yeah i found a gold one last last game too and i was trying to use it it's really nice use the anvils use the anvil yeah absolutely absolutely not 70 damage i'm too impatient it doesn't fit my face though i told you this was going to be a decent place [Applause] wait uh oh i could here maybe i'll protect the top if i can oh yeah he's uh he's running to the right i know there's two of them actually oh now they're going now hit the race 42 too bad a pathfinder miss missed his job oh no he got he got it oh she gets aim assist in there i mean i broke one we killed the last member we just forced the issue just get up close and personal yeah i mean you know when you got that aim assist in your pocket that's what you got to do as soon as she started beating me through a window i knew that she was on the master keyboard and that's when you grapple in and just hit fire yeah get right in their face big brain tactics you know place your advantage i don't have red i don't know i have red he's ready to fly on a zipline oh yeah crave it i'm gonna skip to the next gameplay [Music] me coward i will hit you for 20. 15 20 15. i'm fine my red i broke up one [Applause] on this bloodhound uh can you keep shooting the uh i'll try i'll try i'll i'll shoot the guy up top i can i'll try taking them the noise are shooting at me i'm gonna send this bloodhound i'm tempted let me do let me do some poke damage should he slow back yeah just a little bit hopefully she just starts pointer is she even up there anymore i think she's yeah even just if we just take that recharging i'm tempted to assist anymore i think we'll be all right i mean i'm gonna get closer hol wait let me get my scan i'm gonna get closer and then grapple when i'm close enough okay she won't even be able to let me know when he's crafting i'm i'm moving up i'm who knows me got stopped for six an angle a broker noise i mean he's fine to the end here ah no oh yeah i'm dead i'm actually dead he's got hammers mate i'm dead okay just please shoot him thank you there's both hammers he's trying he's i'm like the last person here i'm the good luck good luck good luck i'm sorry i'm really sorry oh there's a blue over here if you would like it [Music] oh i'm lagging i'm like i'm lagging i'm lagging all right believe me got a million dollars this is this is awful this is not okay this is not okay in any sense of the word that wasn't so bad um i mean the lag has kind of gone away i have a gold helmet would you like it oh no it's fine i'd rather have pads just like that um yeah i'm flying i'm flying save it for me make sure nobody takes it they'll stay there oh sorry i've already padded i think you gotta stay there oh no i'm not going to get it i missed the prowler i miss having a heavy smg oh here we go um yeah i miss it a lot those babies are faster i miss it before then before the the buffs then that's when it was just ruined wait what is this audio um this audio is so changed is your pop uh oh one is an eye on the map um uh decent amount of people labs quite a few people west but don't look like they're all so low and north yeah let's just go north i guess yeah i think the straight north you grabs the labs oh you can see where the game's gonna end too so do you want to just post it yeah yeah that's not even fight don't know what are you doing okay i'm just gonna make sure they don't come over here because they might know as well oh they're padding over to the race oh here we go we'll be there sooner or later your mobile character back to one of them oh here we go i don't really have many angles right here you know memento reloading down that one i just destroyed this team oh nice barry i am on my way playing with an octane when you are not an octane he's just something else okay of course the lifeline yeah they're both over here they're both kind of just chilling just wiping out like i don't need six bats no you definitely do might be overkilling this model no i say you take more i'm gonna take two bats i don't know i'll take more i have eight you want some um i've been trying to watch anime recently really i've been trying my absolute best i'm just trying to stick with it how's that going i mean the story might be good i'm watching attack on titan oh i hear the two teams fighting but head north i'm watching attack on time why why is everything so dramatic like they will just like every episode of every anime ever someone is having a breakdown and it takes one of them to go no it's okay we're fine well you don't like that it's just listen i know they're getting attacked by italians in that but everyone just can't kind of just chill out please that's what i'm saying i've never been able to get into uh it's just him and he's really low jesus what we're just rocked up for the freeze whenever that was fun i think i got 14 kills and i didn't deserve it and not as an octane when you've got yeah i mean [Laughter] i mean well having an octane on your team is just terrible like it's honestly the worst experience ever
