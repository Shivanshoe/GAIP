hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the sentinel sniper and i found the secret for success with this weapon at least for me and how i play the secret is to just use the one times h sight something about it just makes the gun feel so clean and i was landing some great shots with it it allows you to use it at close range as a weapon you open the gunfight with you charge it up you hit someone for 88 to get them weak and then you're rushing with your smg it works great the first game i didn't use it all that much and i was a bit here in miss probably more missed than hit with the second game i used it so much and i was seeing some great shots i hope you guys enjoyed the sniper gameplay thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends for tomorrow that's good mate yeah i want to get one more and then i can actually stream again yeah we got a long time sir one mirage video an omelette do fromage [Music] oh now i didn't get to pick up the r9 is it [Music] would have died yeah i saw that clutch oh my god you are my hero there is a blue up here but it's like mostly trapped i heard him i heard him flying i got checked my hero got company out there [Music] okay i'll let you know if i energy ammo here say lobey uh oh hold on here hold on here i got a bad guy i know people like right here yeah they're in the window shoot me throwing my door bro that was gross just broke his ankles or what uh don't worry you'll see in the video that's gonna go in

guy that got respawned and then you just went about your day after that i told you i told you it was the worst man i left it disliked i unsubbed so funny honestly i'm going up this guy's i'm going up this guy staying here i'm taking the traditional route hold on i am thank you there is a phoenix in here that i dropped i'm just gonna pick it up real quick i need a better bag i i think there's a blooming market shotgun bolt but it's so far away there's a portal right here dude i'm taking it stretch it yeah i think it's still the one thing to do in this situation i'm dead here there's so many ropes here i don't know if you've seen he's just rope jumping hold on i have an idea this is how you get rid of racism strengths it's just rope jumping little ttv guys he's got aim assisted mate you just got him assisted it's actually insane oh that's just jumping around bro the easiest counter is all you do you know you know how to counter those guys that are doing that uh no do you melanie yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i do yeah it was kind of funny i actually should have died there i was one shot popping a bat and the dude completely missed his pk shot come like he whipped it i was one health he could hit me for a nine and i would have died um near me yeah so that's why i don't like the pk as well all or nothing and even if it's not all or nothing it's nothing or nine oh wait hold
