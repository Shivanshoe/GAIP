hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this is one of my favorite games that i've had in season 13 just because of the ending just the absolute clutch factor also at the end of this game i did like two or three minutes where i broke down thought process and what i was doing at each time i did well what i did wrong so i read some of your comments saying that you appreciate it when i do that kind of stuff so hopefully you enjoyed it thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i hope this is the same team if it is it's a 2v2 and a separate 1v1 i've got to win my 1v1 i'm gonna push him early cause i've got an alternator very few guns can compete with this say what can compete with an alternator though another alternator and high grain hold on team right here i'm coming are the obtain's on me all right well hey listen i did my job i won the 1v1 looks like the 2v2 didn't go down quite as well watch each other's back don't leave right please i was fighting i cannot let this guy set up we'll never get these guys down you know never kill him enemies i'm gonna have to go over five teammate and stop looting otherwise he's gonna leave which is fair enough i mean octane could definitely do this because he can get there quicker and i need to heal on whatever but uh i don't want the race to leave people are usually very impatient and it's fair enough because with the way the game goes to the moment if you die at the start and you wait for it i had these spinny things if you if you have to wait around to get respawned you'll end up just having one good fight whatever i understand why people leave you're coming back though go out of good stuff look at this exploding's everywhere you're a care package landing on ps5 i'm pretty sure they were fighting a fountain stop trading shields and let's get involved in this fight let's get some proper loot we're gonna get some purple shields get over here and start shooting people in the back you see that guy's gonna get away anyway i'm coming don't die you guys aren't firing he's doing actually over there no okay i could be involved in this right now i could be shooting them right in the back i think someone else is healing up outside that company out there you see the door open and closed like that suspiciously you know what's going on [Applause] it's pretty good there might be two up here my teammates make it absolutely broken okay i'm sweeping you guys in okay let's come back uh someone look at the rope they're gonna come up behind us have to be very careful yep or something she could have faced to us hey see i sort of expected people to be behind us there because they were fighting inside and if there's one thing people do on apex is their life's a third party so of course they're gonna pump the road behind us we have to get top of rope and then we can look down on this team we can't get banner from like running low ground to see too risky it's difficult though because you've got to try and track these things in your head like you've got to think of yourself as you're in the gunfight where are we going to get birdie from and how how we're going to escape it i was so ready for someone to come up behind there these things you pick up though i guess necessary the right i got smokes like a new yorker give me a second i'm gonna be honest with you i wasn't gonna use this close respawn beacon just protect the rope don't let them come to the rope please look at the ropes oh this what is here about these guys nice little switch for me first quick disaster don't really don't really need that down i don't know if you saw the octane switched to my broken red i like we were getting rushed there is no way we had enough time to fill that up the only reason i wanted the arm switch so bad even though it wasn't technically what i killed is because octane was full shield i had my shields got knocked you know i need ammo before i go back up which is pointless only two more enemies i killed them anyway i can't go up there ten seconds yeah i i can't i cannot get your banner i have to switch to this um wingman having range is absolutely fine if you've got a full team but it's a terrible idea to have one like long range like three times kind of gun i mean if it's on a flat line or a spitfire or an r301 i think that's fine but 30 30 so like long range i think it's a terrible idea if you're solo and i cannot get these guys banners like the road makes so much noise there's probably three of them alive at least two and even if they moved they would just gatekeep me at the end of the walkway i i don't know and the valkortin that whole thing was a disaster i should have let octane use the mobile respawn and i should have just stayed looking at the rope i need to hide from the valve passive otherwise it's going to triple land on me i think oh good news he's there big scrapping even better news this is going to be a volterra mastiff all right okay are you look look that's the worst care package that literally just landed gold knocked down and a boosted loader what an absolute joke i never get vaults and i never in fact i never actually get any weapons from care packages anymore and it's pretty smart but this is the team that killed us because that's the octane's red which was originally my red what happened to the fight guys you guys are you guys are having the biggest fight ever and he's all died down what happened as much as i want to shoot this guy in the back i really cannot be the instigator here just going to play this smile i mean the kills aren't going anywhere if they're not fighting he's completely pointless engaging first they're going to valkyrs here aren't they if i stand here would it stop him from coming no it didn't work why do you put that smoke there i need them to get into like a proper close quarters fight i needed to get messy for me to win this there you go that car is always a good sound if you can hear a car fully auto they have to be somewhat close surely here we go finally hello friends that's sad me giving my shields give me a sec recharging shoe oh my god i cannot believe i've won that game that wasn't even like perfectly ideal that situation to the end that was like two separate 1v3s i granted i did shoot one of them in the back and they did down the ash i think because i don't think i damn nash good great 3400 damage i ended on that's pretty good oh it's a shame i didn't get close to four thousand if i could have farmed a little bit at the early game because i don't have the four count bangalore that was good though so i just wanted to talk through some things that i did well in this last engagement and some things that i could have done better first of all i was wrong i did down that ash initially she's the one i shot in the back and she just crawled away also i am nowhere near a professional on apex i'm decent in public games and i know how to work the flow of regular players and their tendencies to my advantage but that's pretty much the extent of my skill set here now one thing that i've learned from league of legends that i applied in this gunfight is that you can treat your health as a resource and trade it into situations where it's more beneficial to you look at this moment here i see that i have maybe 30 shield left to work with i know i have a fresh red swap right next to me so instead of switching to that red shield and leaving this 31 on the ground i have an opportunity with my great angle on this gooby to do some good damage and to disengage whenever i want because all i have to do is press the duck button the goal of peaking here was to trade my remaining shield with some of gibby shield and to make him have to heal this is because we know that the valkyrie is flying above us and that allows us to separate those two players because your ultimate goal in these situations is always to split every fight into separate 1v1 now one thing i did bad here was this peak i mis-timed it with my reload horrendously if you don't know if you fully empty out a magazine there is an added animation to the end of the reload that makes it quite a bit longer i should have waited a split second more before challenging here but it didn't matter because both of them were pretty weak now when i get these two knocks i know that i have a great chance of winning if i just disengage and pop a bat you never want to take too much health damage because it takes far longer to heal it up now i could thirst for an army switch but it's too risky because i don't wear the valkys so i back up and use a door to pop a bat doors are as you know by now so clutch in these moments and i get the bat off and all of a sudden it's a fair 1v1 now after a quick trade i take the high ground to pop another bat this is because i need to buy time to finish this battery if i stay on the ground and she sees me and pushes me i can't do anything but now that i'm up top when i hear her flying up i can buy time by dropping and cussing the line of sight to finish the bat now when i can't see the valk i quickly try to first one on my down so i can have an armor switch ready to go this is really beneficial for two reasons one it benefits me because i've got that armor switch but two if that player is still in the game the valkyrie can't armor switch that very quickly at all because she would have to pick up the banner first it's only advantageous to me really as it turns out the ash played out in a really good spot so i push over and i want to play around this death box because it's free armor so i take this gun fight right next to it and as it turns out i didn't need it but it was there if necessary again i'm not the world's best player but everything that i've talked about here can be learned pretty easily at least it's a lot easier to do this than to just be like oh i need to work on my accuracy because obviously like i'm always trying to be more accurate but that's difficult everyone can learn to play these situations better and one thing that's helped me a lot is actually recording and watching my games back like this and seeing what i did well and seeing what i didn't do so well so i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in the next one bye
