hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are trying out apex's new legendary hop-up the boosted loader it's for the wingman and the hemlock and it allows you to pull off a really quick reload which also gives you more bullets in your next magazine to achieve this you need to reload your weapon when it's low on ammo but not completely out it's actually really useful and allows you to have 11 shots on your wingman when you put it off which is just outrageous it is rare though it's legendary and it's pretty hard to find but you will come across it every now and again and when you do it is definitely worth trying out for yourselves thank you for watching i do appreciate it please subscribe to my channel for more apex legends season 10 content and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends pick it up for now in case someone runs in here i got a purple mig all right your l-star is chin up top i'm going to come grab it thank you first blood on the enemy oh fully loaded wingman what's he called not fully loaded ammo here like a gold one juice i don't even want to check what it's called please do load it boost it by the way i stunned a guy i'm coming level two i'm going slow i'm not gonna push just inside this here in 45. nice mate he's running away i don't know if that's gonna hit him or

oh wait the craft to see i can get myself two extender mags nice and i can craft ammo something here [Music] wait that's a different scene that's a different team different squadron rockingham i can see it all i can see it all everything [Music] uh they're on the train tracks i'm beating them to you what we want point five they can shop [Music] oh like we don't find anyone for that long and then we find what three teams there's three there's three of them i cracked two okay recharging shields i think i got one i did i did nice oh he's only got a long bow that's why they shouldn't have all landed in the same place him and i we had a little we had a moment it was great there's more than one up there on the bottom floor of this building okay ow i need shield desperately okay we're getting

like bad uh careful we're going to get 30 inches see my market right now did we fall back here i've cracked one of them bad need two of them they did throw their halt on us so they know where we are that's okay okay anything but that now what are we gonna do wait what is this oh my god that sucks i didn't even hear it this is all your fault um i am sorry mark it sucks like why do you land here um

market he's luke cause i actually don't know what's he's and i can't really afford to drop too much we're inside the next ring i mean there's a black marker here with a ton of food is that padding far off he will be fine oh he left okay rddc we have purple i'm so far from you they're not really pushing they all have purple on the back side yep one's pushing you pathfinders grappling in attention oh thanks man so far no i need to go away he said the team's just rocked up though keep it moving keep moving thanks mate hey i've got a kill from that i still need you oh yeah that's why i took his stuff i don't know what stuff we see guys real rich that we all don't know no one has oh wait i just got a gold wait i didn't get shotgun ammo oh right on my head i missed a lot but then i attacked him so i was involved uh but i did miss a lot where are you really though well i did miss loads oh scrap we should go here just gonna do this real quick i just reloaded and got less bullets fewer bullets down the subject i have zero we are screwed there's three scores left okay should be uh so much stuff over here there has to be some bats over here right here i don't think it's either team i can suffer as oh there's no way it's a horizon i don't think i got this off i think you're okay so six head shots four five cracks four five flesh dead nice one down that completes open for business i need these big hills oh my god i'm sure you need stuff too um i got something over here i'm chilling there's a gold uh gold heavy mag and a boosted loader in there i have those thank you though oh i appreciate the comments i tried if you fast reload the wingman and then i had nine and then i shoot once and then i re like i swear i reloaded and it went eggs i know i must have been dreaming uh you messed it up wait what was that sound i don't know i thought that was extended oh that's interesting oh we've seen plenty of thermal in he's really well does he make it this way i think it's just him
