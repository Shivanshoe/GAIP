hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i really should have played titanfall 2 before the stories from the outlands dropped but i will play it before season 9 is here in a few weeks time because clearly knowing the story would be extremely beneficial to understanding what is happening in the trailers and overall story of apex legends i do know a lot of the things still i know a lot of the basics i know about blisk and the apex games but not so much about the individual stories so the new legend is called valkyrie her dad was an apex predator in the games but he died while serving blitz apparently this is part of the titanfall 2 campaign uh valkyrie grew up in the shadow of her father's legacy but now she's ready to launch her own in terms of abilities they haven't been officially announced but we can assume that they will be revealed soon however from the video and also this picture from ea's website we can tell just how she will play i expected to play like pharah from overwatch with a focus on aerial combat whether she can boost into the air or just have improved movement whilst airborne she also has a rocket ability these were modified from her father's titan in the video so make complete sense i mean i already struggled with dealing with horizons now i've got to deal with horizons and valkyries too i'm gonna be struggling out there everyone's gonna be flying about alongside the new legend reveal ea have confirmed the new weapon to be the bosek bow now i do not know if i'm pronouncing that correctly so i will refer to it as the bow from now on it's described as a powerful and deadly weapon for those with the skill to wield it capable of inflicting tremendous damage at medium range you will need to make each shark account this seems like an incredibly difficult weapon to use expect the bolts on this or the arrows to have a slow travel time but high damage just like every bow in any video game ever created it's taken me nine seasons to be half comfortable with the wingman it may take me another nine seasons to gain any sort of confidence with a weapon like the bow with a high risk high reward factor the major map changes coming next season appear to be on olympus it's called infested olympus an infestation has sprung loose strangling the city with roots and natural growths it sounds like olympus is going to have a lot more greening around as there isn't anyone to upkeep the airborne city interestingly season 9 isn't going to be advertised as season 9 on the ea website it's just been called legacy only so i'm fairly certain that i will play the title for two campaign before legacy comes out i'll probably record it and upload it onto my item channel there'll be a link in the description for those of you who are interested in keeping up with that and watching it when it comes out um it will probably be in a week's time or so ready for the new season to come out so there we have it we've got the new legend we've got the new bow i'm sure in the coming weeks we're going to have plenty of trailers to break down loads of reveals to talk about building up to the excitement of season nine's release thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i certainly was not it's not i'm gonna mix
