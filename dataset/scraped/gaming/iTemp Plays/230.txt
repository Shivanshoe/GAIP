please don't under this door thank you down under the stairs for some reason double havoc havoc squared wouldn't mind a shotgun or a light gun i wasn't expecting to turn around that's that was the enemy bangkok went past me by the way another no i'm under fire i didn't mean to reload my havoc and i tried to switch it from mozam to stop it reloading when i could have just pressed like triangle or any of the buttons on my controller you know what all right a little prep badge you know i'm going to keep myself i'm looking for a phoenix kick take those instead recharging shields i have seven i have seven i'll use them i want to save my bat if i can alright an average of 86 damage per kill but that's what happens when you third party at the start of the game you know everyone was pretty weak it makes no sense when you're in the map okay so my ping button is my trigger right if i want to think i'll ping like this you open the map it suddenly becomes the other button it becomes r1 becomes fire doesn't make any sense you know what money's easier still therefore reloading nice drop teammate these ones crack too enemy down half of the squads have been disqualified we routed that squad focus do not let them best you again oh my word i wasn't ready for the gunfight i had like i had like half a clip reloading into my vault because i forgot to use the low bro from ammo an absolute disaster 120. this is beautiful this is beautiful i can't get up there we go we absolutely good at that guy's box oh we're still live 100 damage a kill now at least he's gonna upload some maybe use it to try and get some high ground if the opportunity arises the enemy is in striking range nice job i'll do me i could take her three times on this maybe i should to be honest i don't want to turn around though forgot you can't take that back no deep don't go crazy they're going kind of crazy i've gotta come up with them reloading [Music] i don't want to go all the way down it's probably all the way up now oh that just got rid of it this is the third team right has to be [Music] recharging that's it we need to go get our teammate back let's regroup here yeah three times and that's all the way back recharging let let's respawn respawns let's put a s at the end don't know why i just wanted to know what i'm doing there's a crypto team over there i guess he's trying to respawn his friend as well because we first is one of them and i'm not gonna waste my ultimate here like i did before opening to the face of three people i mean i definitely definitely need i need ammo teammate right he's just so loud thanks teammate and i need shields too i don't have enough shields to fully get back my uh my red armor here i'm going back oh look at this meet me here i've saved my ultimate just in case people here there's a good chance to crypto grab banners and try to bring people back i don't know i just need stuff though so what do you think here here we go the enemy is here okay it's a disengage for a sec that's exactly what happened the crypto respawned that guy came back with white armor but annoyingly he's gonna have better stuff now i can't even think they're in here my penguin's so broken is yeah blue armor i guess they just didn't fight that much they're trying to steal all that stuff i'm very tempted to take the flat line i don't trust myself with this 30 30. but there's two squads left and look at the map huge uh we need to go we need to leave i don't think you have time we need to move quick progress my control is not working mark's my next location i have two med kits and i've got my ultimate remember that's huge don't drive set people died the other side there too my teammates honestly if they don't have heels they might die only round two i have ultimate do i have any heat shields no they're not in the craft though i haven't seen any i guess or i have and i didn't pick him up which is definitely something i would do this doesn't seem like the biggest ultimate ever but i've got to try and pop it for the team that's the thing with my ultimate is i can't face and look at them to pop the ultimate she when did she start to make it she might go down please oh my god last two teams are fighting too did you see how close it was to horizon dying there come on guys you got this that zone can just be so fast one squad are they like uh they're a duo as well i've got a medkit you've got a phoenix that's huge replicator dropping do you need any of these i'm gonna drop a med key medkit here if you require it so i've got one spare all right one team left and they were here all right that's another challenge down we got past the yeah the zone our last challenge now is i think we keep high ground it's the final squad i think that i think they're on the train track so i don't want to lose high ground on this especially because i've got a three times 30 30. it was a minute ago now that could be anywhere that wasn't a care package i'd go for that who they firing at the target spotted they're trying to draw us in for some reason i'm confused is this a mobile respawn beacon the enemy is here oh my god machine just don't die teammate i just need to not die actually my teammates have got that this guy's self-reviving yes sir we did it nice job team they seemed like a pretty good team but they just messed up the wraith got horizon altered huge horizon ultimate from this guy he's pretty hopping everywhere in celebration oh look at him go look at the speeds i want to be over this way to celebrate there we champion i go a game of apex legends i've had some rough games today but that that was not one of them we did good 2700 damage for 15 kills should have taken the teammates though they were good horizon especially pun in performance but we're all there we're all involved oh my word i missed i missed world's edge so much listen i do like storm point kind of but world's edge i just don't think it can be topped it's so good ggs
