hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be using wraith with a hemlock and an r99 i don't know if a more try-hard setup exists in apex legends at the moment also i've done a few videos recently using different settings and i think i've settled on a nice middle ground between them all in this gameplay i'm running a 7.5 classic setup but i've actually settled on a 6'5 classic setup and it just feels nice and responsive and i'm sticking to it this is my setup my friends if you're new around here be sure to subscribe to the channel to help me reach 1 million subs and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds actually you know it only looks like there's one team gold for them too oh we could have just landed there and contest it don't worry they might push us thinking the same thing they'd be like oh we got good loot let's just go to them yeah hopefully i have him like online oh nice i haven't made for you oh beautiful thank you i'll do the job i'm done i will it will i don't have a sign in my hemlock when i'm down to push oh they're here they're here they're here they're just at the wall i don't know if they know i saw them just here i'm east well they're not going to have any heals yeah she's facing back he's ran away you need to crack nice i'm so bad with this gun full squad's down we made the right choices i will take your wingman my friend is that a bag oh here we go i just kind of i got a blue one from somewhere mate thank you though i don't know where that came from this is good because now we can just take the uh the rift yeah the civilization um i am still looking for a wingman the one i have has a one to two on it and that's you can't change it yeah i will keep that in mind don't worry i was playing with chicken yesterday and i was complaining about the one to two on these guns i think complaining about the one to two on the massive and on the wingman is very reasonable i agree i agree he was like bro no it's really good i was like no on the master bro there's a reason that nobody uses it you're a psycho they couldn't tame it and it's a butt we shouldn't have tried that i've never heard anyone use it once two times i mean that big scrap not over there i am ready he's good with it he's good with it he makes it look good for sure my brain just don't work with it it's all preference and i always accidentally increase or decrease you know i'm pressing l3 backlights up the skin's not not fair i'll come down to you i think you're down here there's no way they jump on me they're charging my shield i'm batting in a weird spot nice job charging on my shields rich i don't know what's happening i'm so bad with this one or two i can't do it oh nice give me give me give me get me out of here not working huh no no not at all get me out of here let me any wingmans any wingmans i haven't heard once this entire time apart from yours i don't have a light mag either i got me a grey one everyone's struggling over here all right i'm going to say the rift yeah am liking this ads because i've always hated the two times and above scopes close range because they're just too sluggish and i don't like the per optic settings because it sort of messes my brain a little bit yeah um so i think this is a night like close range or two times i'm still i can still do some good work i think nice i found a wing man nice yes let's go dude now i'm really ready to go i found a purple white matte too helmet here level three the john wick challenge commences now because i actually have a wingman i can hit shots with bunch of cat back again this way it could be people going there could be yes i'm gonna slide down this well then let's go introduce ourselves shall we oh i was going to slow down this but i thought i was way closer than i was i didn't work placing a portal letting them know we're here okay we're coming absolutely nothing i was just kind of letting them know like we're here that confused john wick is in the building uh to the left over here somewhere they find these trees in the hedges oh that's not bad it was in the hedges in the shrubbery extended heavy mag here level two come on come on reloading i have a nice little bag now too oh my i have three bats i mean three well i got it so i had three phoenix's that's what i meant i
