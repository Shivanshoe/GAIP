yeah he's someone else a 360 rotation [Laughter] 360 rotational pain nobody was in sight i very much appreciate that thanks can i teach you a lesson are you sure yeah might take some time but look at this right so look at this blue helmet on the ground just here where was it here okay if you look at it as if you're gonna ping it and now and now look at it do you see like a guy with his hand raised in the top right is that where it is that means i need it oh and if i pick that up does it go away yeah it did it went away there you go mate i never knew that yep no lesson my opposition opposition's

here is that he's so good he's so close ranked last season in solo diamond he's so good he's so the information that you get is there's two teams there yeah it's unmatched man it's unmatched so incredibly good oh they're up top as well we got company out there we're inside the room i don't know oh no it was just the drone on that one tom brady that was impressive oh they're both up there this is i can try and smoke them off i wish i had a frag i know you're just going tonight i'm not pushing there's two teams there's two teams down here i'm just going to chill down range there's one other team unaccounted for the little nervous they're going to put you back i see them they're in this chart okay hey the team on the far left is moving i'll try and get a shot on him okay one nice shot yeah like you look straight up in the air and it just landed on it straight up but like pretty much this guy's moving on me they dropped they dropped they dropped lifeline flash nice job i'm recharging it's got studying health okay that's my thought i shouldn't have pushed i played maybe i'll get you the ring perfect i forgot how like separate we were there that's my fault well i could have pushed up a little bit more i i was using the 30 30 so i was kind of just like chilling i had no reason to push you know i'm out of energy so that's perfect thank you all right so it should be a team of two and then a solo all these guys they got the care pack what gun did they get though this is where duels can get could get intense yeah oh craig where's that right here dude it would be a craver i'm jealous hey for not even for nine rush that i hit him for a hundred okay back to the guy that run off under the rampage jacksonville he was cracked yeah he definitely did race almost certainly because i don't think anyone was able to get there i'm just chilling yeah deploying a respawn beacon i'm going to raise one vacant mate back i'm looking behind so yeah as long as this guy doesn't headshot me i'm cooling they're moving on the bridge left out of the bridge oh the guy crab with me on the right side i'm okay i'm re-judging my shoes let your brother hit me for 100 too
