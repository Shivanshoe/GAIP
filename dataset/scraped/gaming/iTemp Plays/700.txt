i haven't speak fine and all night oh that's huge uh offering r301 thank you you were looking right now i'm checking the sides actually there's people all over yeah there's someone up top too spotted close opening fire that guy's flush i'm gonna push him down now i did crack him oh god and we are back yes we are indeed thank you thank you i uh i don't really have any bullets what do you need uh like one more minute yeah i don't really need it actually i i have my wingman so it's not the end of the world we should be able to loot this stuff down here too this was a hot spot wait there's gotta be a gold or something somewhere there should be but i'm not sure no no one even landed up top and i looted all that place so maybe ran off with me i guess i mean it must someone uh dropped a lifeline package just behind the mountain what is it like bro how much light do you have i have 40 spare if you need some look at this come look at this is this part of the hot spot because if so this is super fitting oh my god that's so sad that is the saddest little box i've ever seen one single fragrance i can just imagine him just being so embarrassed to open he's just like yeah a little frag grenade he's just so scared it's like a metaphor dude what if they add different throwables like rarities to throw balls and you had like a gold grenade that was like a cluster grenade imagine that that would be a leak i'll just find more light if you need some they've been now okay quickly look these mortars run over oh purple knew was worth it it was worth it sometimes it's worth to take a little a little detour an old a bit extra i'ma hit the balloon yeah i think that they're do you think they're in labs or do you think they were on the outside i'm pretty sure on the outside right you reckon they're like that way i suggest we do something oh you know what that's a that's a lifeline yeah they're probably fighting on the care pack yeah i think at least i'm coming over very slowly no no top chunks they're looking at you kind of nearly cracked one should i call there's a crypto drone back here too i think one of these guys is a crypto on autopilot one's down the subject it's still in the race on my word what am i supposed to do lifeline for 105 rich i'm installing my shots i'll be honest nice one man good job she's actually crazy in this mode if you think about it lifeline because she's lifeline for i don't know like 200. i need to heal a little bit wait one second crypto oh my lord forgive me the thrill once nasty good kill i was just trying to shoot the guy the same because i panicked but if you can shoot the drone it just stops it coming to think about it i haven't done that there's more yeah i got the loba okay somewhere okay i'm gonna watch her back then i hit them for 90 blue it might not have been like a nearby trap okay i'm just going to watch our back just in case he pulls up yeah yeah yeah recharging just move this guy down you got him no no he just sprinted i can't i can't catch up to him where is where'd this loba crawl to hop up here skull piercer oh that's huge actually i need it i haven't i lost his low but i knocked her and i don't know where she went hey honestly that can crawl pretty quick he's probably gonna get the res on her uh so be it yeah that could happen someone's raising that they stopped the res are they inside that's they just stop the rest though i didn't put this in auto i'm coming in rich nice job she crawled all the way inside that's impressive shout out to that octane though he wiggled his way in there he didn't he did he also recharged wait why are these doors i was just checking it uh i have five bats if you need anything i i have it's good oh i'm not gonna lie man i i'm kind of starting to lean towards the 301 over the 99. uh when i'm i've been trying to use the r9 like medium i just can't down i don't know what i i feel like they did something to the thrill one i don't i can't like quite put my finger on it i remember doing the video something is different and you said in the video like the author oh someone's here they both still oh my god well played he was holding that down though it was close good gravy was all down that trigger anyways before we were rudely interrupted um i don't know what they did but it feels like there's no recoil like at all like it's just like you first ten shots put it on them they die yeah first ten shots on the r3 on a really good it's only after this first 10 that it moves a little bit i have eight shield batteries uh the more the merrier that's a good problem to have it is especially the red either i'm dropping my i'm dropping some cells let's force out here yeah yeah it is oh by the way you'll be happy to know i finally found a crater earlier today and who would you use it uh yes i got one kill with it and it was very good put it to work yeah and then i tried to no scope last team and then they killed me which is good i respect it though that's usually how it goes for me too yeah you gotta try the audacious i mean just clips don't make themselves i was trying to put a role in my life and i no scope by accident but still still i was just trying to ping for my team i appreciate it good to risk it like that you put it all on the line yeah nothing wrong with that the ultimate test all right well this is a crater you're taking it then right oh yeah

how he wiggled out of there but i swear to god that was fun that was a lot of fun look at that even damage i like how you let me get the kills and he was like even and why you did see i had to let you shoot them with the crater yeah come on it's not often you find those things you got to put it to work you do i i shot every shot so i'm happy with that nice i missed a lot of shots i should have hit you know i did treat someone in the foot and drink a van so i'm happy with that you never hit the shots you don't take exactly when it's going to take them michael scott
