streaming some apex legends arrived this is season six this is also sponsored by ea so i do appreciate them doing that for me i haven't streamed in a long time the chat is going kind of crazy apologies about the other ones i think i have like three three streams go but go public he's live i need to mod alec give me one sec i need i need some mod add moderator i believe that was early i hope it was all right so you guys can hear me this is great this is great news we are back so yeah it's sponsored i'm going to undefend because i'm in a discord chat and we're going to be playing some apex there we go i'm excited i think we're going to get we need to guess how many dubs we're going to get i reckon at least two hopefully i i reckon we could pull off three right we got we got we got rich right who's the greatest part finder that's ever lived and he's super ecstatic about the buff as well aren't you rich oh the buff yeah yeah cause then i can use my ultimate so much more how do i i know how much you love recon beacons uh i should put the stat tracker on because you'll see that i've done at least three thousand respawn beacons i'm not respawn beacons though sorry i was tapping in both into the game okay okay i'm coming i'm coming they're recon beacons yeah yeah respawn i keep clicking my chat and it keeps minimizing my screen oops all right all right we'll get ally in here and we'll we're gonna go straight in we gotta get this we gotta get the dub straight away what's everyone predicting for wins in the in the chat let us know oh i've started i've read it up in the valley that's right okay so i'm sorry i'm sorry that's the cardinal sin um also for those wondering we are playing on pc today right so i know rich you normally play on playstation i normally play on xbox so we've all kind of come together so we can all play together on pc yes we don't have all our awesome yes it's fine i'm not 54. i haven't been level 54 for a year and a half i believe oh the whole game is here zero what's that total level here 18 what what 93 is that no it's uh my math has suddenly gone straight out the window nine plus 54. let rich do the math god maps all right i am in i've just got oh let's go all right let's do this i'm excited i'm excited to know no it's all sorted i've just realized we can do some ranked playing a little bit i say we just pop on for normal trios okay yeah definitely we could do a bit of ranked we should get ranked in there should do some bets in the chat people guess how many kills we're gonna get each game oh my god bet zero boys you disappeared comes off oh my god why is my camera off now boys i'm being absolutely scammed today you know what i might leave that off for a little bit i'll sort that in and i've had too many issues and we're going into a game i'm i will do that in a little bit all right i'm gonna be i'm gonna be bloodhound i feel like we should play the the layout that we had earlier where ali was smashing it where's rampart i was bloodhound just kind of popping off the pink because bloodhound's been buffed massively i like he's been underrated in the meta i would say but i feel like he's gonna have his time to shine especially as that utility player within a squad is that me or was that rich what that's bloodhound you told my bloodhound oh okay you're confused about who the utility player was gonna be me thank you so much i should probably definitely do that someone said rape okay that's just my face came though right everything else is working yes everything else is working mate don't worry okay okay all right oh i'm the first jump master should we go to our trusty building even though it's the hot drop it's literally the hottest drop in the entire game we gotta start it we have to we have some good games here you start how we mean to go on also everyone's starting with vivo look at that there is a predator here we could just punch him in the face i'm i'm tempted if we literally is he the red guy yeah i'm not doing i'm not doing he's too risky no no no i'm not i'm not i'm not confident enough right bottom floor oh he's wait wait don't get that great on the wire oh my god ali got me i'm down one of them there's two more people in here ben you said you were coming to the main building i'm going to the main building rich okay too there he is there we go i'm seeking refuge behind this down guy lifelines that's the main thing i'm being a noob i'm being a noob i'm being in this rude which come ben come help us in two seconds there's down people everywhere mate it's an absolute mess it's pure carnage everyone just trusts just trust trust me all right excellent okay my comfort is everyone if you guys start crawling up the stairs up the stairs we've went the other way i'll leave i'm outside mate have fun you're gonna get killed there is yeah i did indeed i did indeed i did damn someone there oh my gosh all right it was the hot drop in capital city i'm just a little bit nervous right now do you want inside the right dude you can probably hear all right hold on hold on well i'm just having to move away and i do need to go get ali's banner i believe it is 70 seconds it's on my agenda i'm just playing nice and slow here you know i don't want to you know i'm just going to let a bit of chaos kick off i've got a little minute mate yeah don't no need to rush no need to rush they're shielding in there just so you know also a nice little scan all right see now that i know they're on top so i can make a little move for ali and then get out of here there's a nice one uh straight east of you a little respawn straight east yeah it's pretty far away but that's good because we need to reset a little bit oh there's a trusty hemlock there but i i kind of prefer the flatline i don't know why oh give me that if you don't have a sight keep the flat line someone's next to you yeah gonna get high ground real quick sometimes you just gotta play for survivability that's that's what i'm going right now i'm back all right here we go oh no oh no you've stuck between about eight teams i think oh he's got the new gun oh my god i'm sorry sorry kill and you're out there i like it for the pre-flight i'm sorry guys the left down there no as if ben ali is down we died at the start what is this thing i got a kill did you i think yeah you died because that guy you downed early that squad got wiped it just got a little bit manic there i was like in benny we trust and then it just went it just went kind of the ship sunk sometimes that happens you know i tell i shouldn't have gone for the thirst that was my problem i got greedy i should i i was like oh kill him you need to get a few votes are we gonna go for ranked what are we saying should we go from ranked not not this early it's embarrassing by playing bronze i listen if the bronze is like a last resort okay i was watching other streamers and they're like battling against pros trying to get to predator and i'm just like i go live on youtube like you want to see some bronze game play boys oh it's longbow now it was the either eight earlier on oh yeah switch just past the daily page oh we could all we've got to do that we've all craft longbows you can literally craft a school piece a longbow i actually quite like that i'm really sorry oh not a problem not a problem but are you ditching rampart only because i want i want some cheeky movement you know what i mean okay i'm gonna go with guess who i'm gonna go with octane octane you knew richard yeah who else has movement on this phone maybe octane is really satisfying have you seen the meta where people will do like rafe because they've just added it in the patch notes as well where it was like wraith revenant um and then uh octane as like meta just like max movement yeah with like the jump pads yeah that's why i like a combining pathfinder with reverend since they got rid of his like the distance on his ultimate so you revolt and then you just pathfinder like across the map all right where where should we go ali it's your cool this time do we go to our building again uh maybe i don't let let's chill let's chill i don't where normally we go to the left and we you know we do that nice little that building split and usually i don't i don't land up top because it's just a ping contest i said a born in which is chat spam one if you love rich and just call oh my god i wonder what's going on i think i just joined every single oh wait you got the mastiff okay it's one of the top no yeah someone's coming oh no it's juicy i'm downstairs downstairs downstairs coming quick coming he's right he's like a race yeah yeah yeah running away purple shield broken weak what's behind me here right i'm the one oh i've killed him are you on him nice this one over this way so be careful i'm getting i'm getting his armor absolutely young oh oh my god watch out oh let's go easy baby you know what this new scout skin you don't even need this one over here don't even need a cyanide the iron sight is glorious is that good celebration it's so nice with the new scout skin yeah oh i'm jealous i'm gonna shield them this way if anyone sees any energy weapons i've got an l star right now but i'm not the biggest fan of it anymore someone's over this way i might go off a little bit don't worry let me let me find out oh there's three people in there all set up big big big they're a mid floor they're fighting each other should we get involved honestly where's he i think he's gone into the building across the fence i'm literally just firing everyone through windows here all right there you go there's a nice little scan what's this shield doing here go away that's a very smart way to use rampart shields if i miss one thing that's the end the stream ends when i mix one attachment that i need everyone does it though it's like it doesn't matter what you do you always miss it when you're playing and you only realize when you go back and looking like oh why didn't i pick that up i know like it can be the most obvious thing literally in my first video today what's he did i can't remember what it was people missed your first video was your volcano wasn't it i believe something are we running by the way we landed on honestly best gun in the game right sure yeah with the turbo charger you used it earlier ali used it earlier and just mowed everyone down yeah yeah it really was over here let me use my old careful well i can i can use my ability to give me two seconds and get a nice this the first time i've started seeing people use ramparts um turrets to kind of using it a lot you can spam them as well can't you you can you can someone said don't worry if someone's here we'll find out three hostiles a repeat what what where there's a corset down low i think they're down below some grenades on this guy if you need some grenades there we go so annoying i got silenced by the revenant yeah that's sometimes you start noticing be quiet literally means what it is like mute yourself the worst thing is i just popped my alt as well as i said like i can't spam my all right all right we're good we've got a few seconds now look at this by the way we had a bit of a bit of bottle we landed the the hot drop in a glorious game here thank you should we head over to the um that supply drop that just came down yeah i saw that i'm down no one's got it yet sorry i think one of the things i really like about apex is the movement it's just so slick i just like the fact that you can put your weapons away to move as fast as you can as well yeah i do that all the time i always remember that all right no hot stars which should be good where's the blue light oh there it is all right give me ah no there is a uh one of those and then we've all got that oh that was the worst that was a waste of time that's an absolute tragedy right there i think i believe i feel like we've just been robbed is that what we got uh yeah no all right let's get i'll come over to you rich i'm splitting from you the octane can infinitely run basically oh yeah so as long as you don't mind going a little bit weak pull off those flanks no issue for ali [Laughter] uh guys in the chat i can't deafen at the moment so i can't like thank for like new members but i will do after when my hockey works oh there's a um that's a lifeline one over there yeah let's do it we might as well go get involved all right hold on let's eat over if you've got a mark on it i see i see here should i try and throw myself over will i die but i'm not gonna there's a rope next to you i'm gonna i'm gonna use my old hair yeah nice mate love it love it you can just hold it up oh look we're back to our building now oh this is sick let's go you just don't have to move from this place can't see them at the moment yeah they're on the train station are they i think guys are good yeah popping a little shoe battery all right stand one uh nice mate practice run enough i'm coming with you then uh going for red's growing perez or on him on the other person's body kit just been i'm burning down on me he's left a nade i'm being absolutely outplayed by this guy nice job get him ben yeah yeah he's dead nice job guys the bolt is he's got a volt smg if you want if anyone sees a um lovely uh what do you think the turbo charger i need some light ammo by the way black in the light ammo department uh what don't i need i've got too many shields which i may have got a little bit mate not loads but i can drop some i have 130 i'll try and use escape thank you that'll help on the plus side we're we've got two of us on um good armor right now yeah wow fighter decelerate everyone looked to see who the two people if i had red armor right now they'd be scared so i've got to lure them in every time i just went up that thing and just landed on ali's jump about it scared the living hell that's lit that's quite a little spot actually which are we eating into this circle do you reckon i'm just yeah reconnaissance i guess so oh you can double jump yeah cool i didn't know you could do that is that a new thing with octane not in this season but it was like somewhat racist see you nerds i'm infinitely running away from you i'm gonna get all the kills don't leave me someone said the worst loser i definitely missed something what did i leave boys why did i leave i just get really indecisive i like i i'm like i want the fragrance i also want the ark stuff but then i need the ammo but do i have enough i think my worst living habit is when i don't really have when my bag isn't full i will literally grab every throwable on the game and half my bag would be like thermites and arc size and then i think i've got no space it's way somewhere we've got oh there's a fight going on that way should we uh go get involved yes indeed they're shooting at someone close so i'm going to get on these yeah yeah i see my team it's a wraith uh raping away there yeah she's trying to port all right i can scan all right i'm throwing a nade and just i don't know what i'm throwing at oh my god fiend absolutely they are late to your weapon being shot from across as well there's guys on the left-hand side we've got the zone so they haven't come towards us getting shot by someone else as well sorry let's check out how much i feel good yeah i've got it's going to take me a little while actually hold on let me do and if you're going for that i'll try and help yeah i'm just taking yeah who are you pushing who are you pushing there's a guy around here i'm here is that where he went he's [Music] uh rich just try and crawl into the as much of the safe zone as you can i'll just chill here for a second i can bring you a bend with my ass no no you're good there's two teams here this team up top is like i'm just trying to keep them off you a little bit they're at the bottom as well you know where my yellow marker is they're camping shooting up just heads up i'm risking it ally no well i can get you back good job this is great yeah watch out for those guys should we run away because if we get too close we can get thirty i'm gonna go through a flank here because they're all set up there right rich if we go around here and we play for 200 iq play these are the last two squads ben let's get involved okay give me two seconds i'm going to be behind them paracetamol's killing everyone it's not going to be two seconds it's probably going to be a little while about 20. now they're fighting now ben i've never seen anything yeah i'm nearly there i've got my grenade out to thermite them to switch to the devotion and they're going to beg for mercy am i being late he's here give me right give me a red i think the last one's on you with me right no no that was in so i just killed one he put the top there down he's going for the rest now he's resting now get me up here he's pushing he's switching he's pushing he's going up he's up i'm screwed there's no way he's seen smoke you've got this he's got a digital teammate on oh just run this one just run my shield he had a gold bag i'm still safe here you're fine if they've reset oh my word let's grab the banners and where's us yeah honestly nah it's a bit risky they're out striking me yeah that means they're not gonna i'm sorry ben no worries i literally didn't i you've just got numbers now you've got numbers i don't have much ammo so i'm going to wait a little bit it's the most stressful game this is unreal come on come on there's no way there's no way there is no way i will literally oh we finished second we gave it a good go we're getting a game though that was a great game then you need to see what i saw when i looked on that helmet you need to see absolute carnage as i was i managed to get behind him down too and then i got killed by the third person on his team oh my word i feel like i was stealing rich's kills base based off of that damage thing you know i was finding damage at the end with just the g7 i think half my damage was on that hill are you wanting to set up your face cam by the way i don't i don't know why it's not working it was overheating though yeah and i think that yeah that's right what mine does my if it overheats keep just reapply your open everything back up turn your uh camera off turn it back on it should just reappear i'll give it a go someone literally just donated forty nine dollars someone before that twenty dollars i've got so many to read out so far donated 20 game thank you guys why don't you just mute mute in here rich and just read through stuff and even get your face oh yeah yeah a little bit i'll read through stuff now and then i'll see if i can do that after that that was fun that was a really good game though all right that's just the warm-up rounds guys so don't all right i've deafened i've deafened guys i literally i don't know where to see all the stuff that's going on here but you guys are going crazy i've had a hundred like there's been so many super chats so many new members like i've got 49 there from the real hacker am i late love you you legend never failed to make my day i strive to be half as great as you someday we've been honestly even play this game same game you never stopped you changed lives man you changed mine thank you the royal hacker i really appreciate that man i could be going into a game here i don't even know if i'm ready to let me double check uh i'm ready enough just saying no uh guys with the face cam you guys can still hear me yeah i only need to get only muted on discord okay let me comment my thoughts what's going on here that game is just so crazy ralph cam okay okay the situation with with the camera at the moment i believe it overheated because i was testing for too long earlier on i was testing for hours and i think it just overheated unfortunately that's what we'll do is we'll let it cool down a little bit we'll try maybe in about 20 to 30 minutes and we'll try and uh we'll try and get a ralph cam not just a ralph cam i have two more cats as well i've got ahri i've got socks as well hopefully they'll make an appearance that was actually my technique that was my tactic because if the games didn't go to plan i was literally just going to go and get one of my cats and distract you with one of those you know fifty dollars i mean i had a five dollars from get off my digicat 4 13 subway big fan thank you so much another 50 eric labar with fifty dollars didn't leave a message eric my friend i believe you what is known as a psychopath that is unbelievable support thank you darren perky i just wanted to uh i wanted to one penny more than derral hacker love your pizza brother darren thank you five dollars from jim i love you all i'm a big fan tell ellie i said hi i've won a second i believe we're going into a game thank you so much for the donations and you as well terry aubry where did rich go i'm still i'm chilling i'm still here i need to i need to unmute myself on discord i'm the i'm the newbie streamer on planet earth hold on i mean i don't mind i kind of like our building um our building this is our building our building i see the spamming triple take the so basically there was a hop-up that was that was for the peacekeeper and the triple take before uh yeah the precision choke and they put it in they put the peacekeeper in the care package so the precision choke only went on the on the triple takes what they've done now is oh i missed boys i missed oh my god triple tech first first weapon but now it comes pre-loaded with a with a with a choke so it's pretty good remember earlier when you got your head taken off in one go i know yeah it was definitely it was definitely a triple taker on bullet shot rather than a triple spread instantly yeah yeah you have to charge it up though all right i'm going to try to take this i'm going to do it i believe in you rich i'm excited to see the uh all the kills going your way there's a snipe stock there if you want it you're right thank you i needed level three either dave if you want fancy you want to swap for a heavy oh yeah i'll take a diva you have a light bulb i've got a i'll start at the moment but you know i prefer if i drop in my d okay i'll switch i'll switch it i'm going to get some loot thank you i just need a lightweight give you the energy all right if you get the crater it is the most satisfying thing in the game i honestly reckon the crater is the most satisfying sniper in like in fps's it's the sentinel good or not really it's kind of good it's it's satisfying i'll say that much about it i've got an evo uh level two oh level three right yeah i saw ali moving towards it as like just sped up a little bit i was like it's mine i'm coming for it i desperately wait did i get that sniper stuff what am i doing i've got that you didn't pick it up i need a light gun i'm carrying like attachments yeah and i don't want to use a g7 and a tripod oh i got triple tape let's go all right i've got to find a triple take as well now we're like oh my god before triple take that'll be the true triple take you know what i'm doing i'm just gonna use an rv45 if anyone wants energy there's like three thousand in here oh yeah i'll take that i'm gonna go back and get my sniper star why is it deadly quite well that's just that's just me don't worry yeah it's scaring me how quiet this lobby is right now it's like the calm before the storm they know with a triple threat we have uh two out of three triple takes so far the third one the ring is closed i'm not going to engage on anyone we are literally just going to sit at the back of the map charge your passion and if you zoom in with it you see how it charges up a little bit and then i need to find one i need to find one how is no one landing here it's a little bit weird in there can we go do the crafting get some extra extra bits oh wait i can get a longbow oh yeah good idea oh i might as well you guys triple taking our longboat let me go get all these crafting materials and we can make one of those up i mean kind of ruins the whole triple triple thing but i'll let you off if there's a triple take i'll i'll take it but right now i might i feel like i'm being left out of the sniper gang at least you can hold on to a sniper you know you can put the attachments on it and stuff i'm just gonna do this i don't trust this i don't i feel like there's gonna be someone just lurking in a corner of a building they might be i'm tempted if anyone's got light weapons they've got a few stocks and attachments i've got a i need a stock if you're not spare yeah i think i've got one mate yeah i've got oh i've got a light mag and a stabilizer oh that's the two ones i've got thank you though i'll keep hold of them just in case you find another light weapon it's so weird now because i'm pretty sure every apex player does this and they will literally just run an alternator until they find a 999 yeah and then switch and then just switching over so i find myself running around with an alternative for like halfway what are you going to do now the r99 is no longer no it's kind of sad um oh i need i don't have enough oh yeah i do no i clicked the wrong thing oh my gosh ben what about bill what have i made i know i made a sniper scope oh i need to make my sniper right everyone back off i'm crafting my sniper i'm back oh i want that wait wait have you taken my slideshow yeah that's mine no no that's that right here we go i love that look at this i can't believe you're taking it here we go here we go here we go boom all right just made myself my skull pierced a sniper i'm going to be honest that's not me it's coming i've marked it for a so we can go get it in a sec yeah let's go put some damage on my on my shield oh yeah that's a good point no one's shooting me alright timeout timeout people i've got enough points to do that i may do it yeah i'm heading over to the um i'm gonna head over to the care package just because it's over there yeah it's all good uh apologies i didn't send my deaf enough guys i'll get to all those donations and members in a second thank you thank you thank you because you know i'm not ignoring you how can you rich all your friends have you guys even heard a gunshot no i've heard nothing i'm enjoying this i'm just enjoying world's edge right it's a peaceful world uh coming like flying down there two two two three three three where are they where are they i'm ready one's got gold shield are you serious who's that who's that i don't see him they've gone into that building two of them honestly this this guy is annoying i i reckon that last shot was lined up as well you won the game 75 shoe broken i'm nice i might just feel broken there i don't know 189 all right is that one's moving waves moving across yeah we should have stayed up top actually that'd been quite big i'm going to lock this down if it wants to get higher i'm not sure definitely yeah i'm not used to using snipers i am using all of my ammo and hitting absolutely no one yeah yeah same you have to lag shoot a little bit in this game not really with the triple take the running cross now i'm getting closer mate i've got no scope oh yeah forget this i'm coming with you what's this what's this on me underneath the bridge there you go one bed one bed got him there's a guy in the stroller this way over there let's go this way one run run because you've got bigger bags over this way yeah i'm gonna just get ahead of them so i don't get caught by these guys i'll just punch him in the face i didn't really love my guys coming she's punching me there's like four teams on the railroad she's right here this is bad do you have your do you have your pad if you can launch your pad i don't know if you can make if you can put put it here as far on the train track as you can see you mean hold on i missed the triple take shot and i thought i'd hear it so i started running yeah if you put your how long do you got your pad uh i got it man now man launch it as far down here as you can mate okay can i throw it upwards you can just launch it just go 45 degree angle all right is that all right it's not coming over all right we need to get out of here ali this is a really bad spot let's just go let's just go wait let's get over this bridge just run to the right yay i'm throwing some explosives i don't know what they'll do but they might despise a couple seconds this is this is going crazy it is insane on that bridge all right where's they um should we go left and forget get rich mate that bridge was something else yeah let's do it yeah i don't like my sniper scope i'm not gonna lie to you guys um it's you hello why can't i hear you guys hello am i deafened i think discord is going to be weird hey got the old respawn we're kind of back the storm's coming in okay at least you didn't see what happened there but your boys back oh starting with nothing okay the triple take didn't work and also apparently nor does my oh i need to get that all storms coming in chill churchill give me this oh that's not good why is it so fast is this the first dawn okay no it's not well then i've got no answers okay i don't know what's going on with the the youtube stream today i've had a fair few issues going forward i can't hear i i hope they can't hear me on discord bow can you guys see the um can you guys see the game as well i assume you can't hear the discord because i can't there we but some good stuff i would hope devil bent i've been very tentative to talk i believe what's happened is my controller unplugged and plugged back in and sometimes when it does that it wants to use it like an audio source for some reason i have no clue why i don't have any health either which is kind of tough and he's going in i'm going in i have no health nice i can't believe i'm standing still there are so many teams here i have no heather balls we hate you the game fine to keep up the good stream thank you llama boy i appreciate that i'll literally let you just sit there i don't care i just need this stuff i need all this stuff i'm not being manny i don't care i'm the worst wing man on this leader planet there you go one of these yeah i'm on pc at the moment oh god 50 donations guys i i will read the master game i promise to benny and alec if i'm literally talking about them sweet i have two arterial ones the team is sort of close here right here it must be above us yeah i switched to pc to stream uh because it was like a the common middle ground between me ali and ben we need to get out of here ben i've got a feeling people are tough here but have they gone across there hopefully they don't see me i think we're good that guy's got his toy itself i believe he's gone wild in that window oh my word i think i'm stuck between the worst parts i'm pretty sure that tori can see me benjamin's back benjamin's back what are the lasers going not shoes i have no clue let me try this one no energy ammo 34 oh my god can i get ally don't think there's a respawn beacon there's not a reason beacon alley i don't know if you can hear me the ring is in close proximity i can't believe if we win this game it's an absolute christmas miracle oh you party yeah apologies i'd have to tab out and it takes i've got 30 seconds i can probably do it let me see if i can do it okay i'm back oh there you are so i got stuck in that room how did how did i deafen myself how on earth did that happen i thought my audio sources were messed up i wasn't at least i wasn't talking of you guys all right we need to get over there rich i don't expect this to um you're getting any faces all right no i just had something that's swallowed in my throat you know when you oh my god mate that is that room is set up that be afraid like be afraid yeah they should what is going on in here it's like a range this is literally what we said in the pre-game we should do there's a toy around the corner i don't know if you've seen this oh my god that's disgusting that stepped up what are these people doing nice ben nice ben you shooting from behind and you need my help i'm coming with oh yeah yeah yeah just push down push down around the corner there's three of them ben i didn't realize those three of them i didn't know that'd be fair that means there were two teams set up in this revival behind you just get you killed i can sell phrase just get your kill i don't know it's going to be carnage run chill just chill maybe they'll fight each other i believe hey play dead use the force i am the fourth the forces of me and i am the force the forces of me and i am with the force oh no you have no health how did we get just stuck between these teams like these there were two teams set up like it was like some sort of bunker ready for the lockdown they haven't even shot each other yet i need to i need to know how these aim is we had two turrets in there with about 18 shields and brought some fences everywhere and i i turned that corner trying to help you ben all three of them came at me i was shooting shin bones yeah i i had that same panic i went out of the corner and i was like oh no i thought maybe it was one guy that was the team older they're doing it again oh there's more turrets there's more where's he going where's he off to oh oh big shots big shots pictures are you watching are you watching uh i've got a gab one roo gamer oh interesting right he's going in from above i've played the turrets with a bit of mobility they are literally just retreating he just walked into a watson turret that was that was insane i have never seen a team embrace the ramp at life as much as them they they they have learned rampa in 12 hours absolute experts didn't we say ben literally we should try the setup that they just did yeah that hard legit that was like oh yeah that'd be a great idea you know with a watson and we did way more we deserve more kills i think everyone was just reviving each other in there including us we both self-raised someday we did a lot of damage involved in that all right my aim's just a little bit a little bit off there but it was okay i can't believe both me and you rich got our self-resistance off crazy not unbelievable you both have gold knock down shields oh yeah yeah we've both had gold knockdowns and just managed to both pull off our rezzes give me one sec boys all right now i've definitely all right okay so i actually just deafened myself during that game which is why no one could hear anyone i've god we had 7 000 people in here seven good grief jim arriga with the five dollars how are you so good mate just how uh jim i am in the grand scheme of things not the best player but i do appreciate it jim i do appreciate it i'm not the worst but i'm not i'm not top tier i play for fun honestly uh we had 50 from darren oh no we've already seen that one okay so we caught up on the on the members in holiday he's a new member very much appreciated be rampant all right i'll play around first if i'm still in the chat i'm not i'm okay i was tab date i'll play rampant next next game i need to unmute on discord i'm the worst i'm back um he's back all right let's go to our building it's not like it's down so far it's our building it actually hasn't got a second they're underneath me in train i believe round one i spend your money that's grappler the century i've never seen anything like it come around the back coming back i'm here running away running away it was the gut with the one more up top it was like a knife say not topping between those two walls i think i think that might be him oh he's up here yeah he's here i did crack him he will not get away he's octane so he's because he probably could try to punt him down all right i'll see you in the next game my grapple right i've got an eighth right here we go he's inside oh my god he's miles away i maybe had to catch him my little launch pad guys come here too far away from him afraid oh he launched himself good grief rosie he's down low he's been sneaky yeah he should be i need shields let me quickly mod someone hold on i'm going to mod um ben can i have some of the heavy ammo you nap from my uh i've only got one oh wait no i can give you i can give you i can't remember if you type in chat i can mod you sorry boys i'm talking over this stream no worries wait you can answer rich first stream just go ahead talk over us all it's nice yeah it's nice to see you streaming i'll tell you what i was so nervous today but i'm i'm actually having so much fun i'm looking nothing to be nervous mate about mate you're a natural i can't mod people i i don't know but gcb has been in the stream loads i'm going to get rid of that i'm going to go for a havoc i'm literally counting the corner oh no the vault i've got a vault yeah vault hemlock combo all right don't worry we we're going just we can just loot up and get stuff so i can hear someone i can hear someone i'm coming yeah you got people on you i'm on my way there shoot i think he's a mirage don't fall for that i have no sights on my guns and i need them around him a little bit where is he he was down low right unless he was the dang guy where has he gone i've killed i killed two there okay yeah yeah i might be visible i got no ammo oh they're all dead one of them's got self-rest yes guys this guy is this guy here it's his self isn't right right on me let me get you where are you you got him i'm just chilling on the floor my friend i'm just i'm just looking i'm getting to is so clean it's so satisfying to use as well yeah people are saying even thinking you're saying the volt and i'm like mate what what do you mean the bolt looks good it's going over to the vault i just like a vault you know so give me a quick little clean i'll bend it like no no i thought i could put it on this um on the board ignore me don't worry it was a gasp for no reason i think i thought it was because i joined your devotion does anyone have any extending uh sorry anyone have any energy uh yeah i mean in one of those boxes yeah well the box i was literally just saying see yeah i think so is that right well is there something yeah oh there yeah there's the um a care package coming down that wasn't me decent you ali by the way it was me being no no no you're just fine yeah now it's so good i'm gonna beat you benny i'm gonna be oh well you're okay of course you're gonna beat me boys [Music] i just got i just saw a girl backpack i was like oh great and then oh god benny let you get that because technically the gold bag only benefits the other people you know they come up with more health so he was like oh no oh you've got the gold backpack you've got to prioritize those revives you're the reza for the rest of the game now excellent my plan worked i like this new um tunnel by the way because running through this before was actually just the worst but now it's just yeah there's no new stuff there's no train anymore it's just like been i don't know cargo along the entire track i think i've just realized my weapon the big thing for me is the train i felt was just like it was a bit of a um a gimmick like it was great in theory and you got some great great moments on it but you could never really use it because it was random if it was in the zone or not so yeah i know i never liked the train because i'd go there and get you know some light ammo and a knock down shield and the guy next to me there man thank you ammo if you want it do you guys know that there's like a little box there now let's go this way hello so you can climb up on top of that oh so there's another way up that's clever yeah because before it was just these two grapples on this side yeah it was the worst that's nice they've made some really good changes they have right i think respawning like west west west west all right hold on i don't think i think she'll win the team down on the low side six seconds position in here oh my god i down someone close they're not self right now yeah the other team's the other side ben we're not with you mate we're not with you i'm coming ben oh god ben you're in 1v3 i'm here okay let's go rich let's go you're getting there get them no oh my god devotion i don't know what happened there i did there was a lot of damage going down there that just came in with the best spray i've ever seen in my life that is that is a ridiculous gun i did put some damage in from afar just a little bit yeah was it the scope was it the sketch yeah yeah they were all weak that looks way more impressive in the feed than it did on screen i think i honestly just saw you slide in and we're just like if i put that in the montage i'd zoom in on the feed and wouldn't show the gameplay i need some more uh ammo with the hop-up on the g7 a double tap it's not worth using that much anymore okay this guy's got red shield i may as well take it right now he's got vault key that was my exact thought when i first looted it yeah i was like gimme gimme all right i need seven more damage for a uh shoot me mate shoot me the foot no no well shooting him in the foot yeah yeah seven damage this is this leg's a little twitching i'll take that kill still alive wait it's a 1v1 oh yeah it's one v it's right yeah let's group up the scoop up we've got this i can scan if you want wait should we see if we can craft something so anything craftable then you you like a bit of crafting don't you oh i can well i couldn't get my um well i could put my armor in oh that would have been quite a good idea actually actually i need i just need i need one more little bit of there's one up here if you need it materials here yeah i'm coming over it might be something good it's a little bit risky though because i don't have to that's a drone which isn't good i've never seen that before what's this droning around nothing else wait i'm putting my armor in this last time i did this i got jumped by the entire squad as soon as i put my armor in they're mine you're buying you are you're actually serious you do realize watch me on the stream and you see me jump checking out the last guy's there we stats it's got the heirloom for wraith oh god oh that man how do people know this wait who's firing is that decorative that's not me i just saw bullets land there from from over this way wait they're firing what's what's that wait they're actually firing yeah i can hear it maybe they maybe they don't want to fight like how we're doing it ali uh hey look a little bit just in case oh yeah they could be like boxing or they could just be like will the last team come fight us so just be careful i'd say probably all right i won't wet 18 more 17 more percent because then i've got my uh i can spam someone's here yeah there they are this way this guy's separated there's a guy on top though i've already gone around folks on him yeah guys oh i'm getting shot in the back guys from over there they're literally all over the map there they are oh my goodness there's two two on you ben two and you've been here be careful i'm going down i'm trying to stream a little bit just for a minute let's get out of there oh my god well played that it saved me you good you're good i made it this isn't reloaded what is wrong with me and reloading stuff today oh i got two people on me i'm dead i'm dead no i messed up so bad i didn't pop this guy damn it too far they're cracked crack players cracked blaze did that person tell fred's die down or something i think i know i got the kill for you i think oh mate oh yeah my hemlock wasn't reloaded oh that's so unlucky they're 20 4ks so they're good players i messed up my hemlock i'm so fury that's the second time i've done that this game damn i got caught out in the open i'm gonna buy that octane skin what is that like second third second sec yeah we've got two seconds and a third unreal but you know what right now we're gonna get three wins back to back to back i'll tell you what though i'm happy with how the game's going there's so much action yeah we're playing well we're just getting unlucky we just gotta get that dub if my if my hemlock's reloaded there we win also there were three people there i think he wraith portals the only reason i pushed over by the way is because i thought it was two people and one was down yeah that was the case wasn't it what happened i think they i think they had a wraith porter when i went over there there was still two people oh that was fun it was a fun game though i'm really enjoying this having a good time how long has it been it's been over an hour already yeah we've been playing an hour and it's just i don't even tweeted the stream let me get a little stream tweet on the go if you're over pushing this game you get punished so hard oh it's very especially the recent armor changes yeah that's very true yes do i have to put add hashtag adding the tweet uh i'm gonna do it just sponsored by ea if it's not part of the contract technically no but worth to cover your back i guess if it is part of the contract then yeah put in hashtag sponsored by ea it's not gonna no one's gonna take me to court for putting that hashtag in so i'm gonna do it there we go a little tweet a little tweet on the girlfriend of all these the evo shields go straight from purple to red yes or does it go to legendary then go to yeah no no gold isn't golden isn't involved it's that's only from like care packages and like the floor kind of thing that i keep tabbing out to do stuff between games and i don't choose my legend this one please remind me all right i'll remind you next game right drop though yeah right all right i'm trying to i don't know what's going on mate i don't know what's going on i didn't get the ammo i didn't get the energy ammo once down i'm being hooked alive another squad attacking a wing man that's literally it do enemies of course he's around somewhere oh he's going probably going for the reds here he's dead corsic's dead i don't know what the guy that i'm down there i think someone's right are you under pressure i just destroyed someone oh my god oh me no he's punching me help guys he's in nova i'm coming i got you from the wall i've no clue what's happening i think i've downed someone nice guys benjamin let's go bensonarino with the greatest legends in the game there's another team i think we're being scanned and being hacked and being hacked i'm gonna grapple up top because there's a team coming for you ali yeah i know i know no thank you i'm down are we down there oh god they're behind me they're armies oh my god they're everywhere they're everywhere i'm gonna try crawl away this is because i wanted to play rampant so we died we gave some really entertaining high octane action at the start then right we're just pulling it back letting rich quickly become rampart here we go see guys i saw you spam in the chat so i just went in and died on purpose face cam all right let's try let's try the face cam let's give it a go i don't know why it's not working i'll try it nice if i turn that on like there enable preview if i turn this on i mean i for one i don't know why that's oh we're back on my words i need to get one of my cats in yeah yeah yeah wait rampart rampart rampart i've already chose her like actually so i think i'm fine i want to see that face i want to see that face in action where is he ready listen the problem is now i've been streaming for like an hour without a face cam so i've been doing all sorts of facial expressions but now i'm going to be still doing that there we go there's the boy i have 21 kills on rampant by the way so basically the world's greatest rampant as this game is pretty much over before it started all right okay same place yeah i like it it's been doing it we've got a second second third yeah it's a good thing so much action and it means that you don't like other than that one game when we landed here and there was nothing yeah i mean one two three four five six seven teams are landing there are a bunch of men's there are many let's let's just take this drop seriously pop off someone go floor yeah it got buffed i'm from the shield then they're absolutely shielded no i'm dead wow i got a p20 20. i tried i killed one of them that was um that was rough stream is lagging what is it only the face cam that's lagging or is if the game plays lagging or if you twist the camera uh doesn't look like anything's lagging to me hey they are absolutely trolling me then he hasn't seen me and he's running you are a ninja oh the game plays lagging a tad maybe it seems to be okay now don't no i'm done oh i'm gonna reload just in case it's good now okay well you've got this rich i wanna after you just get away with that i don't know mate all right ben you like me spectating you by the way yeah my spectating is really weird oh my god 17 seconds on the banners 17. i have no i'm on this sick i've picked it up i have 17 energy bullets i'm coming over let's do or die i think i may need a rez for oh yeah this is the high temp i mean it's just it's easy you know i can't love you emblem you've got that's sick thank you very much i'm back in the game i can't believe that how did you set up with rich i'd found a gold knockdown in there oh my god i've got a good idea as well that's why watch how we this is the game we win oh i think you didn't get my banner oh well i did give his spawning mate you're responding my screen only showed benny as reid spawning i was well disappointed uh-oh where did we go we're being pushed angle tell me if they're behind or not because um um two of them just come back whenever you can oh there's a lifeline she's gonna get her she's raising them all yeah just get yourself some friends i've got two of them i've got two of them all right i can get let me just gear up and i'll come back let me get one of my cats we just need the lucky car i'm dead i'm dead i'm 100 dead all right i'll come back i've now got to do what rich has just done for us right how long have i got okay give me a second oh all right let's just oh no please just leave me alone i'm i'm no risk i'm no danger to you 34 seconds i think she literally just woke up hello i'm coming for you guys oh come on what was that bubble headshotted by a wingman i killed two of them with the uh with my turret you know yeah i sent my tour up there because i had no ammo is it is it laggy can someone tell me because i feel like i'm being scammed um hold on let me just get for you just check on your obs is your obs dropping frames no zero drop frames and no it won't be lagging and he said it kind of was at one point yeah it looked a little bit less smooth than normal should i since i turned the cam on no rich honestly it's fine let's go is it i i'm watching it now it's good okay sorry i can't see if you see if you sit there no that's nice though i'm just happy i managed to guide you the one big thing is if it's lagging just re on let me just go think restart refresh the stream amber said it is laggy is it i might just get rid of my cam it's only doing that since i turn my camera i may be working rich it may be worth it yes yours isn't it's not lagging for me it's just the gameplay doesn't seem like it's quite as smooth as it should be i don't know oh wait yeah there i just got a jitter oh really it's because i keep him to tab in and out as well i think that's not helping let me get rid of this and put it back on hopefully that sort of reset it a little bit should do should do god streaming he's tough how do people do it people said no but if it's lagging the stream i can turn it on between games if a cat's here potentially that's a nice little uh compromise i suppose it's when um tech issues happen it's the most stressful oh yeah cause it's all live and people like and rightfully so they're saying you know you get a lot of feedback from me introducing you keep the face cam sheena makes it lag it probably was that touring it was probably the sick player that i just i just it's the second you got that triple kill with the devotion and that like half a second spray rich i mean what can you do the game was like i can't handle this now it's too much all right here we go if you still if you're still lagging refresh because i think it might be better i can't i can't keep tabbing out because that's not not helpful yeah if there's any issues i have to do after this game mm-hmm right let's do this building again i feel i feel the dub is coming yeah i've got a nice little strategy here i keep finding guns okay i know something all right oh god are you going oh come on man yeah we both land on that he's the one that got the gun i might just risk it you guys are dead anyway let's go for it i think if they're both did it do some damage considering the hemlock at that range let's just go again yeah yeah let's throw back in no like that i'm really looking forward to uh crossplay coming as well yeah that's sick all right how far are we in long in the past we're getting pretty good i mean i've completed it completely yet i've just bought the uh the one where i got a load of stuff oh okay i've got an insider insider sauce apparently it is working all right am i ready to do it no i'm lending no you're not ready that you're not ready yet all right we're good oh i got a load of apex packs patrick said feet cam that's coming soon patrick if he wasn't lagging that would be this one i appreciate the suggestion thank you brand new cam normally people do like controller cam or mouse and keyboard cam um but rich times times have evolved and there's just a cat sat on each foot that's really why they want it i think where is face cam uh beep doll apologies my friend uh it was lagging the stream i think in future i'll try and use my webcam because this is like an elgato cam link and it might be just using too much processing power even though obs says i'm not lagging something's just not right i guess it might be just it might be the codec that is being used on youtube via the latency we'll have to try and we'll try and iron it out if i ever stream again introducing i mean you should stream more you know i'm having a ton of fun i think it's fun like what we're doing when we're just hopping on like hop on some friends and play some games might as well stream me right this this is the game i feel it i said that last game but it must have been thinking about this game thank you for fujimar uh ma for the three euros very much appreciated i'll make sure i'll go through all of these at the end apologies for everyone we just appreciate our commitment to this hot drop oh yeah yeah yeah i this is this is not messing around yeah yeah you die you don't get put off you return i shouldn't i should have i should have gone down low on me i'm killing the course as fast i can 46 down you're getting some damage all right there's that there is someone around here i hear a little bit she might be all the way down low need a weapon yeah i've not got army yet which is my wire shaming the damage that doesn't count when they're on the floor i don't know why yeah yeah well to be fed it would take way too easy [Music] someone here as well uh yeah hold on rich drop it over me thank you oh no that's going to help nice job good now you know four shots yeah oh you got the vault nice let's go uh if anyone's using a product it's like fire in there has anyone got a syringe i have no healer wasn't afraid mate uh yeah nothing bro sorry wait did the course fall off and get revived did someone kill a caustic as long as someone killed that oh i did okay good i killed a ghost stick i'm happy i'm happy then last guy down didn't even get the kill free as long as he's wait there's a problem here if anyone fancied that still yeah i need a scope i need to make a um should we go wait can we go to this crafting so i can then get a skull piercer uh yeah well you've got a wingman yeah yeah uh seven seconds when i can pop my uh thing i'm just playing it slow right now oh they're pushing back here guys yeah they're making a lot of noise though they're going to get pushed i think from behind they are they're in a fight right now yeah middle middle oh how's he hit me there no i'm here now i'm trying to help you come on i'm oh my god they're all up there they're looting that is somewhat rough i can't believe i missed every shot i didn't have the i had the iron sight on the wing man the guy that killed us was a predator in season one compared to season two and they were masters last season so if you're gonna die you die to you can get all that information just from the end badges from badges yeah wow oh i got a legendary oh oh come on oh watson legendary banner that's quite nice actually i always forget i'm going to i'm going to get a hair loom hello and uh hair loop what's the hair look oh my there we go i just got a legendary longbow skin as well that looks sick i've got 48 packs so who's laughing now i have man i'm going to get my right if you pack an heirloom on the first go i mean i got a legendary spitfire skin looks kind of beautiful i can't put this am i ready that by the way uh no i think it's rich or waiting oh sorry legendary from the greatest apex player the world's ever seen what is skin's lit it's a chicken skin for crypto sounds like my kind of skin all right my chat is now spamming hair boom guys just because ali said hair room yeah okay you don't have the hair to make fun of him just for saying hair loom it's it's the right way of saying it guys it's his accent he can't help it heirloom i didn't want to say heirloom it's the loom that goes in my hair like it's definitely not the loom the loom is a very unique isn't a loom like the thing you brush your back with in the shower it's scratching my head i thought was some something like it's my bow string on it i swear that's from balloons no no no what's a lymph what's fruit of the loop oh wait it is it's where you um yeah it's like with a little strings thing yeah there you go something that i very clearly have right now like i mean introducing your channel all right we need to get the dub we've had we've had two second places and a third yeah right yeah we have we need the dub someone says in the chat says loom is for weaving so i'm just putting leaves in my hair weaving come on snapchat all right we're what is it with our drop being so hot every game oh no i just realized we rich is streaming to 7000 people so potentially not many people heard me mess that up so that's a good thing i'm on ps4 everyone i'm on ps4 right now going into the london servers on playstation please don't stream slightly on the ps4 which is very good on the playstation before released i need to back up i'm scared i should wait aggressive yeah yeah you're good you're good wait did i did i pick him up no no you don't need attachments for it to be good just here coming oh there's a triple tape if someone wants to jump straight yeah if i can go over here all right let's go oh i'll come back for you triple take i won't forget you goodbye my friend look at him i love him i need more energy ammo oh here ben here yeah there we go kill the guy on the left he's flanked nice he's down yep damn pushing him pushing in uh i need some energy ammo if anyone's i should probably plead on uh i have been i have uh i've got some i've got something okay i have 49 spares no one sees any energy related um not in this one i like the i like the alternator man i'm sticking with it the oscillator is good it's consistent it really is was it season two was the best gun in the game yeah you know when you had disrupter rounds seriously that's sick it was like the come of the of the alternator it was always like the honor tonight's little brother and then it was just like a chad the r99 is only in no is it in [__] scary so you can yeah out of hiding it's got time someone over here was firing don't worry i can do a little scan for us yeah he's in there for 44 daddy's [Music] nice job nice any more of top up top one's behind somewhere too i'm down there's two here both cracks oh the guy was above no behind behind my mind go shoot go chewed he's trying to get out of here he's going apart cracked dead nice yeah it's kind of weird now isn't it because like do you want that you know what i mean it's a strange one i'll take it he's like yeah i'll have it i'll try if um you know what i'm willing to be the guinea pig if you have any big heels just drop and i'll give you all my small ones if you want to i'm not trying to hold you around yeah like no no i i reckon i'll use it i use that what yeah we all just got shut down no we were that what we were winning that game they knew that was you weren't winning it was a win no i had so much good loo i know we were just about to be stacked um oh i'm back i'm back we're not in the game but are you back in i'm back in the loading screen i'm getting connections just keep trying i'm inviting you rich um yeah what do you think do we count that as a dub absolutely i don't care any people left look look how much gear we had we had we i had four kills and four kills i think did you have two i had seven kills actually yeah was it seven seven point seventy nine seven oh i had good load out though like a nice alternator and a hemlock setup yeah we just leveled up that's annoying because we we had a few games where we died right off the rip and that's like a 50 50 place but that time we got a little bit of a start it's all good we had a lot of gear then we were set up i had a vault and a wingman and i was about to just go make my um skull piercer we'd have been sorted we would have been yeah i mean we can get back there you can get back there aaron he's like ally a loom is to weave cloth i'm like yes that's exactly what i wanted aaron clutch sorry don't be silly oh my god ralph's here say something yeah by himself he's been so naughty recently who's been naughty my little cat ralph someone donated 49 i'll tap it after this and read those i think when i tap it lag stuff so i'll have to do in a sec thank you so much shout out to automatics in the comments who says is ali good at apex i'd like to answer that directly and say yes i am very good at apex just never like he doesn't play that often he's got ten in eu i'd say you would be good if you played your game there's always been aim and that's what this game is i find it really hard in this game like i feel like there's no assist at all yeah it's good i like the challenge of it it makes you you've got to be good you've got to improve yeah it feels satisfying though when you pull it off absolutely when you get when you like use a wingman and you get like pull off three back-to-back headshots and take something down really quick you get there's a level of satisfaction there you don't always get in uh other fps's definitely this is the longest commit to a drop i've ever seen i'm quite impressed i think i feel like we've got to go until we win like that yeah team did land off to the east side yeah they did a better job than us it happens it happens you okay you okay ralph's stealing the wire again oh no not again ralph you did it the other day what the hell was all this shield going on i know i walked it i got a blue one in there there was like four shields sat there it's like help yourself oh my god there's another one there's so many shields shield heaven playing caustic i'm so sorry people people hate yeah my fault it's my fault no no no i had honestly i was there the entire time and i didn't click pathfinder in time oh my god i'm just as bad if not worse all right i've got this hold on oh no i thought i was going to get that oh oh shot shot shots down by the car my friend he's pushing me oh my god i did it two down two down last one's on us got the last one let's go oh baby that was fun nice job i i'm as close to death as you can be that was outrageous yeah ben she's louise mate well done i'll just like hide hide hide luke i must confess thank you it's what i long for uh most people this map are gonna be south of us by the way yeah yeah because of that drop line yeah yeah of course it is the man thanks irish lad well i don't know why i'm saying thanks like i designed him i just i appreciate a good person that appreciates coursed what i'm trying to say i think course the like i used to hate him because when you know when it used to impact your um like your teammates as well yeah and i was just like whenever i had someone that was a teammate that was cool to kind of like oh gotta i'm just now gonna have to be so concentrating on what he's doing as well yeah where his traps are yeah oh yeah i'm no worse no kill leader no you're right though as soon as they change that people started playing way more because he's actually useful to a team now he's not just toxic to his teammates as well as the enemy yeah hold on should we head over here and just get involved in there blue shield of uh sorry blue helmet if anyone needs that i'm not even thinking about what i'm looking here i'm just spamming everything uh which way we're going i just we've got to head south right and they're going to come straight into us i'm trying to think actually i'm going to put my sight on my hemlock rather than devotion i've got a devotion as well that's what we need to get that done yeah the shields got changed guys they they reduced all the shields by 25 points and you spawn in with evo shields but the one you're spawning with is like level zero so you have to do 50 damage or even get level one either it's nice because it means that you don't have to necessarily rely on hot dropping to get a bit of armor yeah and i felt recently that i was just not getting any shields from the get-go like no armor at least now i can i get rewarded is that your scan yeah yeah yeah if you get in a fight it means that you get some armor which is nice yeah so if you land and get 50 damage it will just put a shield onto you you have to shield up yourself but you will have that ah i get that that's really cool yeah that makes more sense and the gold shield is three which i just think he's just ruined it yeah the gold shield needs to be changed now i think it needs to be matched to the four sure i think the four and the it's got an extra perk which is fine in my opinion yeah but it's now but that's kind of really pointless because it does double shield health right so it only helps you when your shields are broken yeah yeah so it's not in a multiple fair enough if it healed all of it but then would that be too powerful i might just head over to that i got some bad news i hear grenades where we came from oh seriously yeah which is sad because we spent so long which way do we go if anyone sees any attachments for lmgs let me know okay we'll do it yeah what time have you got spitfire it's the devotion mate i've literally failed every ball jump i've tried this stream every single one i'm going to redeem myself off this watch this one unreal athleticism oh my word he's just showing off hey what you came oh no i'm [__] the legendary ball oh nice the ball are you again yeah yeah oh it gave me nothing you gave me a one of those close range that's just disappointing you've got hemlock oh god all right should we get moving yeah that's i don't know what i'm doing here i was sort of it seems it seems very quiet yeah strangely strain like too quiet you can hear shots yeah left four front left i'll be honest i'm coming you guys are you guys going different ways to me okay that's all right that's not the worst well mate i swear i attacked you don't take that purple for you boys sorry about that oh god i can hear that yeah wait i may be running to a different squad than you let's see wait we can we can sync up because if you stay there and me and rachel just kind of loop round behind them actually no we want to stay this side i'm going i need to go back i mean 50 seconds there they're gonna like they're gonna come this way though yeah guys uh i think they'll okay yeah because this will be back the way that we were going how we do you guys want the most what is what have we done to you ally behind me i think they were that way i thought they were like sorting yeah but i don't see them yeah i think you guys are they're doing absolutely delusional just saying what is going on here reload the door you're so confused oh you guys are the best i should stream all the time if you're gonna help give me helpful tips like this thanks boys and girls in the chat what did you uh what was your thing everybody loved my divo oh i've missed a uh a vault key hill just came in okay benjamin i'm sorry i don't know how we both literally did a loop-de-loop we basically held hands and crossed there's a nice little figure have i shiny one in this game should we go this way let's go this way we did it at the start did i wait there's a blue there's a blue thing over here let's go over here where we started the game literally the way we we started unreal yeah but there's a there's a there's a surprise we have to yeah but it's just that the rotations have just been impeccable this has been the strangest game watch how this is the game we win after all this oh yeah yeah yeah after all the hectic games we've had i've been being far off yeah you've been being made if i fall into the lava do i die by the way no no no you've seen me i've never seen it okay benjamin is miles valley it's me and you i have no long range you can be okay yes i do i'm mine here's someone closer i think yeah someone's on me rich trying to get to me if you can't armor red armor i'm not with you i'm trying to get there though shoe is i don't know why i did that my chat will probably be uh i've been a terrible teammate they're fine are they there's a team to the right that way and there's a team on this left-hand side near ali's box i don't know don't go on me oh well done okay maybe maybe do it but that team on the left is they're looking sort of suspect mate they've got a crypto drone they're emptying them oh they're on me yeah yeah there's a team there ben you just went into a team i need i need a med kit there we go give me that i have three syringes no no meds i've got a med kit now reset my mentality one of them is one shot which is annoying because i missed 12. they're pushing down two teams two teams big big third party here they've just killed the team though about toss always that fault is kicking off he's he's got a shield there anything on you yeah they're all over the place i didn't know he's on you i came to help sorry i'm just backing up i feel like i've got no good attachments here on my on my diva i can't even okay i'm dead i spent the entire game running and i got murdered i downed two people one diva clip and they got revived i did nothing that was 10 minutes long oh that was that was a bizarre very bizarre game where was everyone i'm pretty sure there was one team that was just dominating by the way oh i don't know i can't believe that that was hilarious that was the worst game of apex i've ever played and to be honest it was half my fault for half your phone yeah i didn't have any good attachments for the devo and i'm i've changed which gun i wanted to use about three times so i just had no attachments i just i don't know i was just in a weird loop the loop and then i separate we kept separating like ali went one way then me and you went another way then i separated from you guys why did i just place a trap down right there and i could have hidden the in the gas like yeah we could have hit gas hidden yeah good excellent demonstration of losing all around this is why you were tuning to the stream my friend this is why you're here if you need any looting tips just leave just let me know tier one looting that's what my ties like everyone all right this is the game oh yeah yeah yeah yeah right the others have been warm-ups okay but this is going to be a high kill high action high octane game all right so he's slowed down yeah yeah ben will get four kills i'll get two which will get seven and we'll win easily all alive there we go bam if this happens exactly like that i will stream for another 12 hours okay you've only had three hours sleep i would not do that i've got three hours sleep and i've been up since 2am can you read the donations yes i can i keep the game there is something you click uh rich if you click viewer activity on your um stream setup tab the problem is when i tab out i know do you not have multiple screens i do oh i can just have it on for your activity i'm stupid you you're not stupid rich you've just not done it before no i'm the worst are we full sending or are we yeah okay absolutely yeah we're going to talk about that we need seven four and two so it's good it's gotta happen if i have six kills i'm not getting the last kill i'm not streaming for an extra 12 hours i'll sacrifice are you going train ben no no no no i'm looping around the building going into this game i'm gonna go bundle someone's landing with you i'm 99 sure on the roof on the roof there you go yeah yeah nice i'm gonna help you down here two to one above now let me push him he's really weak i'm coming i'm coming back nice did you just get three kills there alley i think someone said uh i don't know no i didn't i think i got two perfect i can't get another kill guys i'm banned from killing all right well played though nice job it was uh yeah nice let's go back i started quick scoping i donated and yeah i will i promise i will check the um the donation see you soon my apologies i've been the worst today they're weak i'm like i'll shoot anything at them i've already got purple shield mate let's go oh wow all right should we head over yes give me one sec get a bit of a gun i'll take this obviously i'm just like trying to find a scope just want to make it perfectly clear that i cannot kill anyone for the rest of the game assist ally that's what the a stands for an ali a yeah yeah ali assist oh stress damn i hate that i just missed the um the little nodule of the drone thing yeah this is so depressing that happens i was like i've lined that up perfectly and it's like oh no i happen in the end yeah and he just flies off super quick because he knows it's being shot at then you're like oh don't leave me it's kind of sad when you think about oh team here not quite as far as that but that direction yeah they were here 73 seconds ago did you say right in front of us close close close close something clean they've been doing games through teams two teams we've about to run into each other this right just want to say i did a lot of damage in that gun fight same sound champion as well i did i think i did muslim about 400 there at least i think maybe yeah maybe i threw four grenades didn't hit anyone and then i saw the last guy dying that was it you just created everyone's panic though those grenades the key [Laughter] um it's gonna be a legendary uh smg but to shoot sniper bullets oh wow that sounds like slightly broken oh people coming down the bridge i'm popping my all laid in the blues my friend i don't know why i said the grid where's the bridge wait i've got a three times three times that guy's one oh my god shield yeah oh no they're kind of back there they're gonna peek right they're gonna be bright set yeah i'm just meeting i'll be back in the action in three seconds that way too careful they're stuck behind there guys they're stuck behind there they can't move on the back pinch on the back there's a g7 somewhere he's one shot by flying one shot that's your lifeline's down otherwise you're right you've gone that way i don't see that guy there's someone oh i'm doing nothing now i'm chasing his lifeline i'm going in yeah ali there's a guy higher up the hill i think yeah [Applause] go in here yeah he's on the little ledge on the ledge up there he's jumped off gone to the right three-story building oh my god someone else is in here though right was that from the left alley yeah yeah from left from east east i'm doing nothing all right let's just stick together here let's just read that oh sick i'm being messed up team no no we got you got me inside i think these are separate teams yeah i can get a scan off let's just hold this let me wait until we can see okay okay one there where's the other one i can hear let's go upstop yeah yeah bottom floor one down another one i need help coming come push me hold on hold on hold on he's one shot he's right here yeah nice guy but he's on the box climbing on the box oh okay i like you guys i did not in that fight i i felt like i was chasing everyone i was stabbed up with a triple take with a three-time sign that happens though that happens you know when you kind of just get you kind of lose track where the fights what the like how the fight's breaking out yeah you don't know i don't think that happens i think i just i just chased too much and this guy just like knew i was just going to run around the corner and he sort of just played it better than me yeah these things can get you killed i guess khan it's rough how come my uh hockey doesn't mute discord whilst i'm tabbed into apex by the way uh it should do it depends on how you've got it set up mine's just like my hotkey's four so i'm going to press it can you guys hear me i feel like they're trolling me i reckon they can still hear me let me press it again hello there we go perfect it worked okay my hotkey's working now boys edison a donated two euros and he put a beautiful hello gift in there i've had appreciate that edison thank you getty1416 with the 20 donation i am so happy to see you streaming happy gaming thank you jesse i've had a ton of fun i've had so much fun today i've been nervous all day about this i've been up since two o'clock in the morning um think about these streams i haven't streamed apex before hey let's go already and i wasn't sure how it was going to go i wasn't sure how to even set it up properly uh but i've had so much fun honestly uh peak revenant i introduce you i guess i can if i play a little bit longer i can i guess rampant's the new the new hero as well uh tony c donated fifty dollars at nine twenty five that was 26 minutes ago tony my apologies my friend i hope you're still around i hope you're still around love your content rich keep it up thank you so much tony and edison donated another two years and said good luck have fun and i will read the previous donations after this i've worked it out now i'm getting better at streaming i guess i'm bad that makes more sense yeah let's go we're rich uh do we like someone else are we just doing it we're doing it it's a hard job be careful i feel like we just oh it is the hot drop i feel like we've just got to do it because we're going to get the dub the dub is coming we deserve it i'm perfectly happy to go somewhere a little bit quiet if this doesn't work just to secure a dub just for a variety sake i don't even mind if it's a busy place there's a predator landing up top i'm gonna land bottom floor i've landed mid floor i've been landing train every time by the way this is probably why we've been losing my first weapon on the top i've got elsa on the bottom i just got a legendary flat line fire on you i think ben all right correct me unless you're shooting benjamin [Music] it's all kicking off it's all kicking off it's just crazy that didn't go well there's like three or four teams in here do what you can ally i have an elsa with no bullets mate so i'm not worth the race but come on come on come on oh my word thank you i've got nothing though there's someone out here she's running off nope she's peeking i've got a really funny animation right now of how you're running with your hands no yeah i have my preview screen it's like just a little bit off of you so it's just like it doesn't quite work does it i'm trying to get a revive by the drone land somewhere else yeah i think i think i think we should just revise the sake as well right that's nice ali's going to get the clutch of all clutches here oh come on 30 seconds on banners i could zoom in because you're you're octane just yeah just get rid of hide your weapon he's going through this door careful i need a stupid card in your hand oh that's quality it's been a few rough ones in a row all right we're gonna go somewhere else and we're gonna win a few rough ones in a row we need to mental reset as benjamin would say yeah you know reset your mentality all right we're gonna then yeah approach it we're an esport team that's what we are right now yes we are we are what's the name of our esport team we need we need a name i think chat come up with the best names for our team we need some suggestions team name suggestions what the tin openers yeah why the tin openers do we open a lot of tins yeah no no we got we've got t we got the letters tba no we got our art we got rba that's the names doing the initial i'm just i'm just taking the initial the first of all together to create something lit we we also could be team rabb all right let's replay you're blocking my creative brain waves right right i'm sorry all right which is bandits that's a solid i'll reset my mentality someone said team diplodocus i mean that's a good one that was both me and alec to be fair yeah yeah i was involved in that i was quite proud half a dinosaur half a meme and if someone's casting us and like there's they're like watching a different team and then we kind of seen them be like it's the dipper duckless like that and they can play the sound on the drum master all right rich it's not your decision the legends the temptation to drop right below right now is so strong should we go somewhere new no we are we are we are yeah like this one no i didn't mean i knew you were me seriously i meant like i just realized there's no areas on the map and we've been landing [Music] i'm gonna land in this little bit up here i'm going to land it back with rich there's a team going there ali i'm going to go okay i'm going with ben i'm going with ben everyone everyone is going fast no one actually came to my one i think we're safe the problem is how much losing oh this is where we came third reloading i need a better gun devotion here oh i need to help on yourself i need that i need up i don't know if we can get to it there's a on the way there's a thing there two down two down i've got another ammo we're coming no one's got weapons guys oh my god all right one second i can scan i'm scanning yeah they're they're heating back now healing at the back i'm flanking whole team rushing you they're all here they're all pushing through oh they're swarming they won't see me i'll accept him i mean to be fair i'm surprised we even win that first fight oh oh they the thing is we third party but so did they but they they were like the third party afterwards yeah they were the fourth party omg it's benny temp there you go i'm gonna be honest with you i don't think we're gonna be competing i i think we can some people think we're smurfing because i'm such a low level it's because we're on pc guys we haven't ranked up on pc yeah we all kind of switched on came on pc so we could all play together because i'm xbox rich's playstation ali you've kind of played on everything a little bit with each of us i think at some point or another console that sounds a bit wrong one second one sec dylan a weizenhunt donated ten dollars and said your your video is brian my day and helped me through a rough few months thanks for the positivity you're a national treasure dylan thank you so much for the kind words my friend i really do appreciate it thank you so much dylan the game i've been saying that every game maybe if i go this isn't the game i think it's a positive person a bit of reverse psychology this isn't the game i like how off stream we win three games in less than two hours and then on stream we don't win no we got second second third yeah second yeah i think we that's close all right we're going to get everyone go through that hole yeah there's a decent amount of loot in that in that place yeah because there's weapon racks as well there are a fair few boys coming by looks like i see a lot of trails there's a gun thank you do we commit to this wait hold on i'm gonna help out hey turn around turn around let's come into this team i have no health by the way literally nothing hit him come home for 98. for 98. i had one health it's coming in it's coming in okay you're not in there sorry sorry sorry sorry my gun's not reload i'm like staring at it like as if it's yeah the path line is like two health you've just got to deal with a wraith and that's fine the pathway to here ben nice no they're both weak they're both weak i don't know this is another thing coming into the team i just had i have two health from the start look at this 90 i think you've got that i'm dead no all right maybe a quieter drop yeah we're doing some crazy drops right now we're contesting we're doing a lot of damage and getting a lot of kills from it though uh yeah even if we won that another team rocked up yeah that is like who's the last team to third party run away unfortunately we would just trap my friend no they were everywhere if only i'm afraid yeah they they were they were pretty much every direction that you could possibly think of yeah it's okay yeah we did pretty good considering i mean i've punched someone in the face which is that's very rude rich victory in itself right black bear back uh top keck jameel topkick jimmy oh that name rings a bell i believe he was sup back in the old battlefield days i'm on the king jamil thank you so much for the 500 donation it's good

other questions that you would like answered or no i that was the one is ally with us by the way i think am i like oh bro my game's so bugged i'm running on like you are running uh bro i'm literally joking around everywhere you're by me i'm on my screen i'm out the building isn't your connection or is it the game seven i'm fine ben is fine i don't know it's weird it's strange i've got i've got a vault key ellie you could alt f4 and reload the game you can join back now yeah i have a volcano now i'm going there first i'm doing that it's my key i'll go to this one we'll split up i think that is potentially one of the best additions in a long time for a vr stuff no the the um that you can rejoin your game like the fact that the amount of times that's happened on so many games that i play and you're just like i'll just sit out for the next 10 minutes while your friends finish but this get back in works nicely yeah it does you don't have to worry as much all right here we go uh i would have split up ben but i remember i saw a team going lava and i did not want to die i think there's there's going to be enough loot for a boat for the both of us i mean i've got gold shield off round two four volts yeah we're on the way on the way kirby panic not my friend oh that was so satisfying hitting the guys there that's how you say in england i say gosu no we're not talking about the the oh

among us what's what can you do what's what's the issue here imagine you're playing on a thousand ping but that's the best way i can describe it so honestly don't worry about me that's yeah in before ali gets the winning kill no there's absolutely no way guys we need to we need to find someone yeah i agree all right let's just group up though rich yep which way is should we go yeah let's do it because i'm pretty good and i've also got my alt so i've been losing for the last 12 minutes so i can't wait to just go in and die because i miss all my shots so i feel stacks though i feel stacked that's when i get most nervous though i feel like anyone who comes up against us is going to be scared oh ali's faster faster faster oh on me oh he was friendly oh i shouldn't have killed him he seemed nice what was he doing and he still waved and benjamin i didn't shoot him i did i'm sorry mine was a warning shot i'm i actually feel bad for the bella one he did have guns though oh he was hiding them you just killed a friendly stream sniper i don't think he was a stream sniper found us earlier oh yeah we have been uh very easy to find honestly where are people dying get me involved let's let's get flame just stack thermite grenades and we'll burn the enemy you want me to scan do you want me to do a little scan probably won't come up anything try that waldron mate close that's good enough for me i run around i am not checking the damage recap on this one wait oh something look i think everyone's lagging that's why everyone's standing still why am i the only why you do fine then there must be one team that's cleared the lobby because everyone's standing still okay now i don't feel so bad about having no kills because someone in this lobby probably has like let me check the banners let me check is there a kill is there a kill later i'm not lagging yeah i'm not liking at all i'm not like what so you're just getting free kills uh then are you on about let's spectate me they probably think i'm the one i'm gonna get reported here yeah i can't believe you're doing this such a cheap [__] you've come against it's just been stood still yeah that pathfinder wasn't friendly he was laggy oh all right let's head over rich let's just let's just go in i've got footsteps i've got footsteps yeah that's probably the team that's not ifk pretend to be afk and shoom in the head no joke make it with someone no joke make it with someone it's a lag off legit legit i've knocked two people's shields off all right we're coming in there's two people here there's two people here it's a massive lag off they don't seem to be lagging very much but they're not very good they could just be like they're really very good feeling there's two of them the other ones around the corner ben yeah dude you gotta admit i did a lot of damage to them mate they were so easy for me to kill if this is nothing honestly i don't care if this is the way we have to get a win i think you do you've got a lag switch on this one that was not me doing that hello back off my jacks are you enjoying the impressive game play here wait have you seen him i thought i heard something but it could have been you guys i can scan yeah big scan big scan no i'll start scan twice right we need to win this we need to win this if we lose this there is no hope ali's trying his best to come over i can see him on the map he's traveling he's traveling he's doing his best oh that's a replicator that's not worth our time no but there is a blue thing over there there is a supply drop can you tell i'm lagging yeah i just love how subtle alley was at the start of it it's like oh yeah i've kind of um it's got a little bit of a problem but oh my game yeah a bit of an issue yeah okay taking notes listen step number one get your leg switch out for the boys if you can't win on stream cheat just cheat this is being weird i think it might be a server glitches i don't know it takes people oh i've got a crater i've got a crater hey all right ben if you don't have 100 accuracy this last team might not be laggy by the way because someone was going around killing everyone oh maybe they were all dying to the gas because they couldn't get good point well-made because i'm the kill leader if they were killing everything someone was killing everyone i wouldn't be the kill leader what was it the game before this we all got kicked off for servers no no i think yeah okay yeah yeah we're going to win this one so it's come full circle i'm trying so hard to run oh it's like having an elastic band on your body pulling when you can't run in the nightmare yes have you ever tried to punch in a nightmare yeah like you she's like pathetic not like me punching my life which is very intimidating but the dream ones aren't rich where do you reckon i'm gonna kill someone i'm gonna win this game look at this boy look at him go i feel like they're going to be closer to me yeah they've got where they've got to be because they're not here i just fell down a hole i think i may have to kill myself no you've played still careful rich let's just let's let's take zero risks no don't worry i'm i'm here for support

time all right let's go i really want to watch that first of the night i feel like that was we read that was a really hard-earned hard-fought victory what do you reckon chat i think we might be unbeatable you can share the stream the video i sent you has been rubber banding the whole game oh wait is that a new feature what i've got insert highlight appeared in my youtube studio oh that's cool and insert ad oh insert ad that should have that's not been there obviously i could barely start my stream so i don't think i found that you ready for this dance i've never seen the insert highlight though oh uh yeah i'm not really sure that is i suppose he's like twitch i guess seven thousand seven and a half thousand people just watched a 300 damage was it 200 or 300 100 damage rich

god punches the lethal they tell you did you know this this moves here ben have you been here and have you seen this as well these things move there's like a button up there these these things don't move oh can you make it move across right or something uh i need a gun i've got a pistol and a charge rifle it's not ideal oh right tommy i didn't realize that hold on here we go this what's moving this big thing here this way it's massive mate you see i was like what am i looking at i another one here so they're not say bridge when you first mentioned that or do i say something else you you may have you may have i i definitely didn't i had no clue what was going on i'm actually quite enjoying this uh this game it's quite therapeutic you know what having a bit of a bit of chill time i feel like we just got murdered for like five games in a row so now it's like you know you just need to ease yourself back in yeah you've always got a legendary stabilizer you actually grab a bit of armor what about the crafting thing i don't need armament all good all good look at the chat please hello sora welcome i'll read the donuts here in a sec thank you for the support guys we're not real how many you got like eight thousand viewers right uh six point nine six point nine that's amazing went up to a 7.8 at the end of that last game i'm not surprised i think word got a that we're on a burner should we head over to train station have you got a purple thing already i just i just found on the floor i was like oh okay i'll take that thank you very much nice am i following ben i'm heading over here in that bar yeah honestly i'm having a terrible time finding attachments and stuff this game yeah i mean i've had a gold barrel stabilizer in that but apart from that i'm the same yeah the loots the loot has been questionable oh there's a vault i should use the vault for this game yeah this is about smg uh i think i'll walk past this shotgun box if anyone sees one please let me know because the mastiff is so bad with that one true sure also i think you can jump i've seen someone hold on let me test it first lie to you guys have you always been able to do this like jump on these middle wires um no that does look new i'm pretty sure it is my uh expert that's new i do think that's new just like this box is new yeah i don't i don't think it was that low before it wasn't was it no definitely not yeah definitely not they've lowered these down is great marks makes him successful i guess yeah yeah because before people just set set up here and then there was no way you could approach honestly i found no barrels i found nothing nothing that's what we get for dessert in our building this turbo is it scorpio yes turbo charger devotion oh let's go on ramp as well things you absolutely love to see should we go straight to scratch on yeah let's do it i'm down i need some action eight squads what should we get back-to-back victories here oh yeah i forgot we won i'm just so used to it special on this stream i'm taking it a dub's a dub from this game mode i mean i guess you could just make it what's that what's that fancy going this way what's what what is it you mean

should have kicked myself you just gotta let it unfold and then try to get banners i guess look how many bodies are here yeah it's kind of wild i wonder if they've moved off to the right a little bit

the dice is rage is that not a name from like five years ago i'm pretty sure it is a silvan a bray with a ten dollar donation amateur alley going into the banners only that was the most courageous attempt i've ever seen that was a great play though it was unlucky you've got to appreciate it no man left behind that's my fault i thought someone's getting revived around that corner they weren't they they no they weren't that was it and i missed my shots so that's not my fault we're doing another should we do a final game final game no matter what happens right this is it right i want predictions in the chat where do you reckon we're going to finish we started so strong i feel like the first hour we're we're bumping we're still playing well we're just getting unlucky it's just it's
