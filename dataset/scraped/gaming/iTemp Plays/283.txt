hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i had the idea of playing one legend who counters this rampart meta fuse but for some reason everyone has stopped playing ramparts i'm not sure why she's really powerful and has an outrageous ultimate as well i think maybe people don't find her as fun to play perhaps i'm not really sure the idea was amazing though i could use my knuckle clusters to destroy ramparts walls and even if she was using mobile sheila which is extremely scary i could force her to reposition with the knuckle cluster itself which is when she is vulnerable it did happen in today's video so i'm glad about that but for the most part it's just some regular views gameplay so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends my cat ate my wire and now keeps disconnecting me how on earth am i this late i don't know i don't have a gun teammate this is horrendous yeah yeah you've got a gun though you got a gun don't worry about that you've got a gun you've got a massive and blue armor like i stole my loot okay this guy stole my blue armor that i got off that fuse is there someone there you climb from the door you can get all the way up top oh my god let me loads i just two people holding hands i'm scared to go that way because i thought it was two people sorry team and it let you die then this little tip here to climb the door and then you get all the way up top he's he's so broken i missed enemy squad's dead i need energy ammo reloading i missed real bad i'm scared to loot this a little bit because he was getting attacked by a mobile sheila but then they stopped shooting arm's gonna risk it yeah yeah you still head don't worry you can still see me juicing me shields spotted an enemy careful teammate oh my god just jump paddy dog into him there are two teams there though this is stressful we're dominating though it's a good job my teammate lasted that long i thought he was just dead thought he was a goner i wish i had more energy i wanted to use the vault a little bit more i was kind of there's some there yeah it's got it happening 750 evo shield here level three shield bats it's not enough is it really well i've got so many uh when i got so many light rains for the vr9 any throwballs to have i have two thermites i'm literally the worst fuse in the world but the reason i'm playing fuse oh my god no no no no no no come here stay healthy amigo the reason i'm using fuse to begin with is to try and knuckle cluster like sheilas and like shields and stuff from rampant but we haven't actually seen any yet i think you can climb this it's like a weird thing you can actually jump on here like this ledge there you go good to know good to know don't even know what i'm hoping for here don't help me one of these i'm not even sure i want it on the r9 to be honest with you but i mean i'll give it a go just in case we run into a ramp or a sorry it's always the worst one you can't see okay you're the best i've ever seen i don't have any syringes charging up my shields as soon as you see here that's my teammate firing i don't mind if i do i have four little shield cells too i'm not sure i actually want to take this he wants to rush them if i can angle my ultimate i might be able to just set them on fire up there take a few different angles two angles two squads left and one of them's on us this guy's clearly a good player i thought he would i thought he would set it off from up top okay i'm the worst fuse ever i get it i'm terrible again nice job teammate i think this is team yeah all right i don't think the last team is near us because we didn't hear any fighting they were waiting for it i guess only seen one guy okay it's definitely two i think lucky here lads we're inside the ring didn't say he's got a crater there's ray fell and they are fleeing the scene are you no they're not just running away are they they probably got a craver here actually i don't think it was this rock there's one further back please go back through their teammate i've got bag oh come on man okay okay where you taking me mate well look at this everyone's going everywhere not you mate not you not you no you're talking about me i'm not i am laggy this is way less laggy than the other servers it's literally not a difference actually right the exact same when i was playing earlier it might just be your skill base probably in these servers oh yeah the skill base is too crazy rkd where servers [Music] have no space for anything someone's arriving in here i knew one of them was weak huh i said i knew one of them was weak because i heard one get a revive um who the uh the gibby was pretty weak uh because i shot him nah i cracked him and then he had like one health after that there yeah i think something yeah i think so i shot him i shot him well i shot him too there and and yeah i feel bad my ping's gone down by 30. so that's good at least 20. i can't tell if it's like still laggy or it's just my 160p yeah i mean i was 150 on the one it's just ridiculous i think that was just an actual issue with the server though because i was on like over 100 too yeah i don't think it was the actual like distance of services yeah are they oh they're fine i know what they are for a second i thought that was at the pit because i kept spinning around but hello rings near with 30 on the clock let's move please don't find each other over there over there we'd be knuckle clustered and it's possible i don't know i don't know i was it down though not his teammates out there why did the two times just not move does that guy slip there uh probably not exactly sure i've got a three-time scope now nice never laughing yes i literally can't see who you're firing at unless you're just really missing here we go here we go i don't know where you're at i'm gonna be honest i didn't see him but he was up here yeah yeah yeah they're highlighted they're highlighted i can't use this three times oh god no i altered him and he's not moving he's won how many bullets does this man have nice let's do the psycho oh my god do you happen to have a med kit mate uh i do red shield okay i want to die clearly that's why i grabbed it someone's coming up right here sounds like a you problem obtain the tap straight first i have no energy at all it's cracked oh he turned around i've only got a flat line three times i am chasing this bangalore she is the fastest person ever oh i'm dead they why you don't okay me views i haven't even right with no bolt on it i run out of energy but it's oh god they really wanted that kill on you didn't they uh they did this guy was running out of the eve right with no bolts hmm remember where the loot was right uh yes i don't know if i'm gonna go right now why not there's guns here i'll drop some healers in here too come this way come this way boxes right here oh yeah oh my gosh they're trying to hold uh they're fighting each other mate i think we're okay now they're getting someone else flying on him yeah we're absolutely fine maybe a huge scrap i can't believe they first shoot like that yeah that's on a crazy you're okay i think juicing me shields one of them a good amount i'd actually want to fight this like that the team on top of them doing this hell holding this temp there's the there's a team right behind them yeah i'm like in a weird spot he's right on my head up here no yeah he's running more to the right i'm gonna go up here that's come all right i got a car from you give this running the game's running it's got no alt as well they're like this this team also just ran as well everyone's just running um i think this is uh we go through this middle part right here they're holding now there's a team holding there i found a fight came down this way just a little bit okay this guy's sort of alone on this rock his team's already like pushed up okay there this is oh oh my ah there's a few teams here too yeah the last two teams uh i'm trying to get up they'll see me this guy keeps shooting me i'll just switch on him i guess you got time you got time i don't know hold on that is almost broken i'm going to take my time here i know i think downhill that's the team we've been chasing for three years yeah they're not very good you just missed like five wingman shots in a row i do that all the time yeah i do that all the time so uh hey something i'm going i'm not with you he's all aged [Music] reloading that football was so huge i just kept poking out and throwing arkansas there i missed the sticks but killed the still i could not the strafe is still pretty crazy with that gun like yeah it's still still really strong i feel like you shouldn't be able to strafe with that thing you can like a jump shine is underrated with that too i have a triple take thumb down to find some damage do you so do i i've got two triple takes if there's an alternator there too yeah i got a flat three another triple there i have two wait we have three triple takes we have we are i don't want that word for annoying i can't think of anything clever either but it's cool though it's cool it's really cool this goes for the sound yeah we're not gonna get any damage oh it's the biggest mate ever it's like a big meteor yeah hundred eleven oh farming oh my god there's one hp i don't wanna shoot i'm not saying all right let's do them right oh these guys are ass i mean they heard all that fighting and sat in a corner oh no oh my they are sitting anyway they are sitting right in there i like that thank you it's beating me down dude as i think the last team is often just like not the second best team in the lobby like we just fought some aggressive players and these guys heard it all sat in here like i can't think but over that way it is just the most passive just feeling vibrant like 70 damage with it i gave my bubbles like a vitamins okay nice
