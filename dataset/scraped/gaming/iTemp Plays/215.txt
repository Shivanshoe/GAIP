hey what's going on guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends believe it or not and we are playing a legend who very often is played well against me but i can never really seem to get much use out of their kit and it's fuse i often find myself throwing out wayward knuckle clusters ultimates to do five damage and end up not even remembering to carry extra grenades but when i play against a fuse it's unbelievable it's a constant barrage of arc stars flames destruction knuckle sandwiches flying everywhere i can't escape but i am practicing and this is rather shamefully my best fused performance to date so thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends should be also possibly no i'm going i'll get another idiot [Music] maybe i don't think they have anything they landed on this bridge out here for like 100 and something here people big building yeah i think i saw a teammate running east but i mean we could just leave him yeah he'll come back and produce responding here see him all the way over there hang on watch this i'm down saying i got it i got your plane tick i did five five damage five damage big scans big scans he's hiding in it too yeah yeah here oh i did not mean to do that you felt like iron there's a guy down here that's my rap name by the way big scam or a big scammed team kill the race i'm just killing myself with enough i'm the worst fuse ever like not even close if you're wondering not her knuckle closers are weird they like they move like i don't know they don't stay in one spot they kind of like shift weirdly yeah they track i need some bats do they have any bats i can craft one or two i've two i can drop you one i'll craft them with me no come here more people will come here 100 they have to i got one i found one i found one no no no no no how's everybody who put this rope down i don't remember that being there i think there's a pathway that just pushed us ah why do you go like that it's weird that's kind of a weird angle i hear somebody mark it i'm dead that's the lava i'm alive oh my god i'm going crazy charging were there nah did nothing did nothing it's okay though you're involved sometimes it'd be like that okay here's someone yes um oh they switch nice i had the fuse weak yeah i got confused uh he took portal he's over here on me i'm going back to get the r9 oh my god i see someone clown there lucky me don't if i want to change this you see that as you're jumping yeah what else am i supposed to do it's the worst angle ever i've only seen a race yeah there's still on there i aim for like 15. well there's two of them two teams let's walk down they put pad down for some reason i don't send white that's you yeah yeah you're pretty useless with uh yeah sorry okay i am i understand ow peppermint i'm just trying to sit on some explosive barrels everyone just calm down get rid of that detected one no i didn't last team what the heck was that literally every team i think there's a lot of squads all there whoa oh man you are the apex champions that was uh that was intense oh the game i did five damage my ultimate all game i'm so bad at fuse i'm so bad after yourself no i'll get oh i was gonna say get out damage idiot i looked at the wrong one no where are you landing i can't lie streamer yeah i'm going to change i've just in a really big circle i'm going to reconvene with you i have two bats blue armor no gun am i getting no regular what's happening [Music] top i don't really have any spare bullets for anything mate the one there's more east yeah yeah just these guys were just looking at me funny just here left crack swan oh last bullet yeah that's not a fresh purple i'm surprised i'm alive to be honest with you oh do you need a bat um i don't have any i have two oh could you someone on this i'll slow hill there you go but that's honestly not bad where was that was this way it's got white well that's cracked and take his stuff i need it where'd he go how are you alive oh my god on the way amigo i have no heavy but i've got a lot of lights noise let me know if you need any light ammo so i've got so many i'm using energy and uh shotgun okay did she have any headaches remember i think she did i had four so let me know if you need another one thank you i got three now oh she did beautiful oh i hate using energy ammo when i'm not logo oh it is the worst yes i can confirm i'm in full agreement on that on that sentiment you just walk past light ammo when i put it on the board i don't need like i have 180 i had loads of light uh secure package hmm i had to drop something back where i was oh here just random guy crossing straight i didn't hear him at all and there's another guy behind me i can't even get inside are you doing nice he walks through my fuse and i actually did some damage with it nice that's all that's all people have to do just walking yeah yeah it's really it's pretty simple it is walk through it you could craft some what if you craft energy you'll get 60 per thing i know you probably don't want to oh it'll bring people over it'll bring people over even if someone's nearby they'll come over you see if i heard something maybe not yeah i thought i heard it bad it definitely is something oh they're gonna talk i'm crafting so good i'll pretend we're fine or something i come over energy ammo here there's uh 20 heavy over there i'm not even carrying that many throw balls ah oh they gave me a lot quicker than i thought australian one oh they oh they think they had an alternator nice job i didn't see the octane to the right i don't think so why did that break so fast oh wait did break wait what does it feel he died there's another team involved in that oh they killed them right ahead of me going wander zoomed i don't know if there's a guy behind him yeah there's a guy just chilling behind him this one this i got it i need some thorough balls here we go hold on take the most op rotation at all i'm gonna be so much further ahead than you so i like how every single geyser is like in a pit just like a surrounded by high ground so you can go about 15 feet that wasn't too bad oh they just put a light down 126 on one of them uh probably here you go dropped one i dropped down to one of them a red pusheen oh i thought i knocked him back must be two things god damn someone close yeah dude hey there isn't here let's go back that's the uh that's the right play we all know this by now okay we'll see otherwise he's weak yes although i only saw the valkyrie that's the name nice what happened to the rev maybe it wasn't even that team or maybe they fought someone else i don't know yeah maybe maybe the valkyrie killed them i don't know no no no uh ash is halted up oh my god yeah she just arm switched ah crackers she almost switched to blue jet purple before that cracker oh it's less guy oh did she ran into a car to leave you gotta be like a special kind of person to like not be able to take an l i do that i do that all the time you do that in a top two situation 100 i'll leave every day oh you are thank you i don't i don't think i've ever left in a top two situation that's pretty bad get out damage yes first time today three hours let's go it's been like it's been like six hours i don't know what you're talking about the longest i played apex in my life i did it a new thousand those eight people was gonna come back as the right
