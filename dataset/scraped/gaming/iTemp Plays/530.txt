hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we got our first peek at some of the content coming to apex legends in season eight including the new legend called fuse and also a new weapon called the 3030 repeater so let's start off with the new legend fuse we had a story from the outlands video earlier today which i will leave in the description for you to enjoy without me talking all over it but we get to see fuse on his home planet taking part in the fighting pit or the bone cage as it's called then we have a bit of a backstory with salvo joining the syndicate space fuse walks in reveals that he's joining the apex games there's a bit of back and forth involving a grenade which can never end well like a little psa here for you guys don't play with grenades come on stop here they're dangerous and as you can imagine the grenade blows up and takes off one of fuse's arms now this is the reveal picture on the ea website for season eight you can see that fuse has a mechanical or a prosthetic arm name and he also has a huge rocket launcher which we had a teaser for a few days ago as well so he's going to be an explosives expert as you can imagine the rocket launcher is surely going to be an ultimate i can't imagine something like that being a regular ability but who knows i have been wrong in the past he looks like a fun character to play who will bring something different to apex moving on to the weapon now it's called the 30 30 repeater as i mentioned beforehand and its description reads salvos most popular weapon this lever action rifle picks apart opposition with hard hitting rounds so it's like a hunting rifle which favors precision which is also nice to see as it's like a skill weapon now i'm not sure what kind of category this is going to fall under it doesn't fall under like the assault rifle and i assume it doesn't fall into the sniper maybe it would be a sniper actually but we already have a fair few of them in the game but we'll see now season 8 is going to be called mayhem with a picture of a big rocket that is on fire as its icon so you can imagine the kind of content that we'll be getting here in just two weeks time so i have a game for you today on octane i hope you enjoyed if you are new to the channel be sure to subscribe and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends hold your breath i think this year i'm gonna get a i'm gonna get a dual pc setup oh more power to you i mean i can't i don't figure out one pc audio i mean you have enough equipment for it i mean i have enough for three pc setup i think quad pc setup just four gorgeous three gpus i um i may i want to play on 1440p 144 like consistently really would love to play at that i play on that on apex i'm fine my fps is like always like it's one for three when i'm just capped out but are you on 1080p you're on 1440 1440 or are you really on 1440 on on apex yeah ah i'm uh but you you have the 30 90 right the 390 overclocked cpu 32 can you overclock yourself stuff i've got my cpu is that uh is that beneficial i think so in some regards it would be maybe not to fps on games because i don't think the cpu is the bottleneck so what is your what is your um your end goal when you're when you're overclocking your cpu just make everything quicker you know like it would affect game performance a little bit but like even like render times and stuff okay what about uh what about uh your gp you don't have a gpu thank you that's why you're playing lifeline isn't it i do appreciate that lifeline's awesome dude well that last that last game that i was playing my teammates went down like 10 times and i was cranking rezzes it's great that was me oh yeah that was you i forgot what's your zero kills and 400 damage yes and you've stolen all of them i stopped helping at one point i stopped shooting so i want you to die you kept standing my kills i mean i almost died at the end and then i clutched out are you clutch i did we see our kill how is that possible how did he close it with zero girls i feel like you're lying to me all the other no the other teammate did let's do that oh you

especially on the havoc i can't you can't control anything yeah oh hard to control yeah you have to be on mountain keyboard in order to control it i say every time i know i do but i'm i'm just zooming in by accident and then it's a mess um yeah yeah let's throw here right like is that energy department no i think i think i saw him over here i think i saw it or maybe there's a team right here

twitter.com was literally you dying and made him safe you are you saving me that if that's what you call safety i imported you out with four different ultimates that is a very very low bar and i'm going to need you to step it up i did i just love that clip at the end it's like you ported to the middle of the road uh my favorite part about that was when you uh when you throw the nade and then you hit yourself for like 50 damage did you watch that from my perspective i throw it and it gets caught on like a ledge or something he said it's an absolute disaster that was funny i know i saw this and i was like wait i'm the one that's down and then i i watched it i was like no this is still funny so good it's so funny oh nelly nice yeah we uh absolutely like that guy he's really weak i'm just gonna i have 26 shots left in this but i've got another nine so i'm good is that seventy one wait no pathfinder's on the light post put an through mania 34 octane did they race down here i think they must have raised no they started the race i'm not going to nade at that door i'm really good at loving nades at doors save for damage on purple got one wait that's mine let me just put it out really i shall mate i'm gonna try and get don't hold on just give me one sec i need to switch i'm going in i'm going around needy cracks on right nice job we can raise him right here i have to blow nine right

of the squats two of the squads which one's that pathfinder but not this one i mean i have come to save the day getting absolutely fried by this store i'll probably walk past some but i don't have many white rounds um i can drop you a little bit where did we kill people i honestly there was definitely some in that box but i just wasn't when i was in the box i wasn't looking for light rains thank you thank you yeah you're always kind of a mess huh i'll go into a box with one thing in mind i'm just i was in that situation i was looking for like a hemlock or an r301 or anything and then i realized afterwards what i need i just click i just click as fast and as much as i can and then i just drop everything afterwards as i run hi foxy um i think so oh yeah guys hold on terrible terrible just bad not bad oh it's all kicking off no one's down yeah i'm gonna come with you i'm gonna cry from each team perfect nice i'm half health from steamy i'm gonna need a race here this is tremendous
