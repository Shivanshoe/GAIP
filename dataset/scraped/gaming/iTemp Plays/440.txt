hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i touched upon this uh for the trailer of war games but we've had the chance to play three out of the five modes and i think now is a good time to talk about this topic again but with more playing experience and the topic is how these modes could fit into regular apex just like the evo shields made its way from the ltm into the base game and it became the new norm so the modes that we played so far are the free spawn mode the triple ultra zone mode and the shield regeneration mode as well and if any of these changes made its way into the base game then the effects would be lessened for example the respawn mode gives you one free respawn token at the start of the game so if it made its way into the base game it wouldn't just give you two lives in the base game this token could be attained in other ways it could be looted it could be a reward for a task in game think of the prowler pve in world's edge there are so many possibilities for these modes to become the new normal what i personally would see is the regen mode but instead of shield it could be health only slowly but even that would be extremely useful remember warzone already has huge health regen and it's a nice base of health to fight from if you don't have loot it helps against third parties it removes the tedious task of using syringes to heal up i think there are so many benefits to it but of course if you make a huge change like this you have to think about what else in the game it affects such as lifeline's drone the gold armor passive on syringes would be less useful octane's passive might need tuning a little bit and to be clear i would want the health regen to be slower than octane's current passive i just want it as a bit of a boost more than anything else i'm of course not a game designer and i'm sure there is so much more to it than i realize so this is more majors thinking out late putting ideas out there into the universe but we still have two more modes to try one of them being the faster ring closing every time a legend dies which would make finding people mid game so much easier so what do you guys think about this and what change from these ltms do you think would be a good fit for apex legends thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm going to the trade giving so if you want to i mean there's so much loot there i might as well it's good i've gone online what have you
