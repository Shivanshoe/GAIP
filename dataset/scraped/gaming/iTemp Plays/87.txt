hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in previous years apex has given us a little update so to speak uh on april 4th and today this april falls is no different this time though when you shoot the legendary mozambique called ole nessie that you'll see a shining light above at some pois on olympus and i assume you're the map so i haven't played them yet uh you actually shoes at nessies which act like the spiders from storm points and they go around and they shoot webs of people and do a little bit of damage now if you're looking to win a game i would absolutely recommend you do not use this weapon it's pretty bad but it is funny in the final game that i have for you today i mean it's probably the best ending to a game of any apex legends game ever so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends once i don't think anyone's going to your poi maybe one person and we meet up out of states yes yeah yeah me meet you at states there we go you're good now i'm good i'm gucci grab the whip ski grab the whip grab the whipped cream i don't have a gun unless you haven't found it you have your only gun that you need don't be afraid to look at your map we're spread out a bit see yeah there'll be some kind of messy ammunition on the ground you never know oh my god i'm launching get in the vehicle friends be free my friend get them boys stuck in there i saw that oh i just eated it that was actually a good shot yeah that was pretty good 16. well they're kind of they're kind of crazy i'm on my way i'm not with you right here crank the nessies crank them i'm cranking rocking enemies watch out oh yeah she has sheila and graveling cracker thanks for the comms good gums pick up ammo what else do i need to show back wait they're shooting out uh they're shooting they're shooting their own website i'm an idiot i sent out the nessies and then i grappled the rampart so she could stay there and i punched that and i was hoping that ness is gonna help and they left me for dead they're they're not very uh very consistent don't trust them honestly they don't get you back huh i thought they were like biting them they're shooting like webs yeah they're like actual spiders so then it's probably that it's probably just the spiders right they just like figured out a way how to make them look oh you're pretty right yeah cause the spiders are weird they kind of just run around and they don't like just pull send you yeah they're not trustworthy either no no no i need a heavy mag so bad okay get them boys oh my god here we go they don't want to shoot them they're doing damage they're doing damage this one here might be something good this way she's facing there's someone there though climbing up so six cracked just behind that which is really low oh my god nessie nessie they're going right did they first the lower i think so yeah i have to send me one is the team hitting you they're both yeah there's another team oh my god that wasn't in the original team this is great everyone chill all the nessies barely work it's kind of tough to use them right they're not very good recharging shield i have a naked wing man oh she's gonna steal this res i know i know she is oh my god hello okay okay using these nessies against people with wingman's and 99s is is pretty bad i think there's going to be a team lighting on it with me uh that might be we could just kill him are they on you wouldn't i oh they landed uh like over there okay oh huge double purple for a second i was very very happy this is gone there's a blue oh boys thank god you were there with the nessies you know champion didn't really intimidate me oh yeah the only reason we survived i have to kill that fuse i'm telling you they like they're so unpredictable sometimes they chase them sometimes yeah they hit the fuse for 45 41 both flesh if if the nessie looked at him he was dead it's close it's close that's enough going this way um sorry pk you suck they're just trying to eat the lettuce mate no they're trying to eat the lettuce let leave them play something real why am i using a wingman with this everything to be fair it's probably not bad no we need a flatlock i might craft a flatline no cabbage i'm crafting a flat line right here i think i thought that was just like my skin i was like what are those you actually just throw them these guys are just flying they've only just landed i got some range oh on the rope on the road he did have a teammate go get him get it get him 19 big 19. another 19. what yours are cracked mine's not doing anything oh please stop i'm gonna die okay you're backing up my ness is a dying i'm a gunner oh they're shook i'm like am i sticking shields don't worry i'm here [Music] oh my god it's impossible it's so they're actually so bad they all climbed and they got there they did the hard part oh no no no no no no no i've got 15 bullets 19 heavy i need to get out of here i can all if i need to okay i will follow you someone's coming to hammond i think that one's pushing firing giving my shields a recharge look um i think so but they're right there so i'm not on that side these nessies oh my god i'll just drop them oh did you see that oh my god you're just throwing them into the abyss how are you seeing this i can see them stop exposing me it's green on the way down there's a havoc in here oh these guys there's a i'm playing safe there's a death box here that's here it's got a sentinel with two bullets okay but i can drop you some light drop before you light and you take the alternator in there squads remain i i'm good i'm gonna get i have all the lightning alternate okay oh no i'm scratching my eyes no uh yes but he wasn't looking this way and i cracked him he's probably going to say the poor so oh my god he's got the necessity going i'm getting it okay i'm okay imagine my confusion when i thought i was fighting a crypto and then he popped a mirage did i rezzy fast yeah you did i feel like yeah i was going to say something but then i just thought there's no way i felt like i read you really bad yeah i think you did thanks by the way yeah why did you remind me something then what's he i don't know he chilled back look back at that recording oh no because if you were to see my shots no you got the instant revive oh yeah that is the uh that's the most important one to get yes it is when you're playing with me i'm not car sick i just was walking to the lift thank you as if you're my uber driver you're welcome i'm rachel five stars thank you said so genuinely too i have nine kills and 846 damage okay i have one kill and 1200 damage okay but you've kind of gone down like 18 yeah that's true no i died to the fuse because it was stupid fact no of course of course i'm just trying to do something i'm getting shot in the back yeah i mean that was unreal double headshot is that dude the team that shot you all know i don't know i don't think he was like how look is that recharging shield i'm gonna show on the back one down here just play your life i'm getting padded on i think chill chill chill there's a whole of the team if you can just keep corny right in the back maybe it's a recharge yeah i'm a crawling let's play your life though i am there's a whole team on my head or two graveling who wins charge rampage or not charge rampage find that next time 20 seconds all right i respect it i can try and disconnect it no i definitely don't have time no you definitely don't have to get ready for the biggest grappler have you ever seen only thirty seconds okay left on the clock i mean if you know okay if you would attack straight though have been way cooler don't worry i'm here huge thank you you got bastard stuff yeah uh yeah i got a phoenix i'm literally holding in my wire because if he's connected it would have been horrendous oh we're still live we're back baby all right i'm using my gun for the 50th time i'm enter 12 get over there 16. where's either take like i don't understand as soon as oh i leveled up from the nessies that's gonna be the world's first that's never happened before in the history of the game big 19 damage another 19. 12 19 where's the other team as soon as we're involved they're like no yeah i'm kind of farming can't lie 12. they're they're crazy oh they're padding away that are terrified but i've got an idea i'm going to shoot the nessie into the pad and see what happens they're right here heads up got one here no they don't interact with pads that's unfortunate there's no engagement on the back right the other team's behind us so be careful i'm getting inside i need to heal recharging shields i'm not with you for a good while very good the team's top middle that would kind of screw up here this is you've got to kill him you've got to kill him josh beat him i think he's broken i think yeah yeah yeah he's going to die yes where are they where are they they're all dying oh no i just hear the streaks of death no oh man you are the apex champions oh imagine being that guy this poor guy i mean he could have just phased and ran so he was down i respect to that guy because he was down listen absolutely zero respect to that guy if you're watching this i've got no respect for you okay well we're not gonna talk about okay at all okay how do i have two kills so i said we're not gonna talk about okay sorry
