hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and this is something that i've never done before i am playing ranked from a decent rank right at the start of the split if you don't know masters and predator players get reset down to i believe platinum three i was nearly d2 so i got reset down to gold one i have two games for you here today one in gold one in platinum but they are far more difficult than usual just because it's so early on in the split now the guns that i was using especially in the second game i think i had a sentinel and a mastiff and i had so much fun using the mastiff with the ghibli on the team as well because you just bubble them you get in their face and you're whacking with the mastiff for 11. it's it's the absolute dream so thank you for watching guys i really hope you enjoyed today's video i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends freelanding related i don't know it's more to the right now okay i'm gonna land a little compound next to you okay oh my god it's the worst supply than ever i got two smgs a little charge rifle action oh yeah me too hoping how did you get as much damage in the last game and i was like farm the entire time i understand i mean i had a three-time rampage though it's just like uh the bullet drop is weird on that gun yeah but that gun's actually really good for like poke damage i think it's great in ranked when i use the like the flat line and like a smg combo i i'm kind of struggling right to be honest with you so many of you guys at long range yeah i think flatline works a little better in ranked on mouse and keyboard because they can like uh uh what is that jiggle name or whatever yeah i know you made her aim and they can uh like with the three times you can't do that controller wait did they take this flying they took a roped on me played hold on hold on oh too late i i have a decent one okay right now i'm only forget some of the crafts you can get 24 every time oh my god you're using an emo yeah look at me ladies i'm evolving as those included last time either people usually love the spot it's weird another charge rifle i'm tempted it's not crafting here for extra ammo though i'm 96 uh and our sniper rifle i started right now last game yeah i don't think that's very much in terms of charge i mean it is a lot but i fired for like five minutes straight i have no i have zero sniper is this even worth it i have to do like uh i have to be able to switch to my keyboard really quickly too it's the issue can you drop me just a little bit and we'll get to a crafter i can craft some yeah thank you i do love having a sniper thanks mate kind of out of my comfort zone it's fun though is that in the tunnel no it's not is it oh it's to the right there's our house victory spawn too can i make this guy mate yeah pulling it out pulling out the musketeer ready you ready ready i'm going to whack him i'm going to whack him on so bad for the new kill leader friend hey i am so bad 300 i don't know what my sense is on this uh four to eight times the ropes up top um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but what about you they're in there they're looting in there a point this way over there i think we're gonna do something to do them now because it's fresh spawns right on me come on go now go down what's broken i'm bubbling from both of you is uh mirage is cracked on red horizon come on nice job just on controller and even if they're a little bit closer like you can still aim it really well fine and team flying five seven oh man three three oh you needed to call that earlier mate i would rush over there i'd have to grapple dean yeah i know i'm sorry let's be quick this is hard i'm trying to use like both but i need to it's hard to like put my controller on my on my leg oh yeah cause then i know what you mean i've tried that before it's actually really difficult i need to be careful behind too broke down nice it's so fun honestly the charge drive was so fun i'm gonna see up here [Music] i7 headshot then just flash one's going up remember there are people in the tunnel that might peak yep i'm gonna have a little peek through cheeky peak oh jake they mate uh one team might have to be they might have to funnel this way because there's one team inside to like skyhook yeah i think they i think they're gonna have to yeah there's a like two two of them up top once i know once logan once looked down here maybe i might have seen two it might be two separate teams yeah yeah here we go try and third be some hey i'm gonna watch that team's gonna hate us they pull it down they all point down are we moving on this social controller it's going to pull back up right but can we beat them there no they're not going to now they're up on the right i don't have any throwables either cracks oh god i got to use the charger iphone controller give your team here see it's cracked 210 another 40. nice job i'm um i'm uh throwing my alter top the ring is in close proximity there's a down right here oh that the team in the tunnel hey seven headshot oh that was a rev guy over there give me still uh give me the below what job do we back up and go around or we need to go back up yeah we have alcohol but i don't wanna i don't know how to calm that to her so it's fine bit more than the time i was panicking again i was packaged too that's fine yeah we're all panicking oh here we go team up here they're gonna be coming out of there just stay right side i think yeah i think this building's free in front of us i don't have an angle on it right here they're taking the rope one's going up the rope he's not alright anymore he's here he's on the roof on that building you pinged move him over there yeah he's in the back 55 on these practices it was a course you come in that building wasn't there so yeah i think he dropped from there yeah a few still over there we could i think we were walking i think we're walking in do you have you have a rope just put your hand over there which way like on the mountain like up there yeah you can put it up there that's fine we can shoot this thing coming out once closed somebody's close oh slightly annoying i heard a octane around us okay i'm gonna sit here until that's gone down the roof here try start your way this thing is so bumpy oh no i have to drop i'm gonna up top then yeah eight seven one of them on the road to chilean it's so hard to stay up here his face on the valk almost broke out tractor and she took storm damage of course then dan corsick nice i don't know down the back it's just that guy it's just uh pathy's beneath you it's just him and then he's through the team okay i need to pull out the controller all that so hard he's down here somewhere i'm just gonna stand now i'm just insane that the team's gonna come over about yeah i'm just playing low ground i can't help you guys try and get an angle my controller on my thigh is the worst i mean that challenge is really it's much more difficult when your thighs are as skinny as yours i mean if that was me oh whoa whoa what that was if that was me like i've just got so much more surface area middle mouse oh is it ah is it just me pressing middle mouse is one of the most strenuous tasks in in life ah how it's it really hurts how does it hurt you it's like it's just too fun do not agree i don't i'm be honest i don't okay oh my god they've got like a symphony of wingman's over there mate here we go how much damage you do seven seven i like that yeah they think we're the worst especially after i just missed that yeah especially after my shots charge but he was popping about the time he's upstairs ah i think this should always be a crafter in the big locations like sky hook wait someone's ready yep which way you want to like on top of the building uh we tried maybe oh like this one or maybe from the ages to say oh sorry i'm close enough it's only one hey really low chasing down i'm going to drop down this way nice job on me i'm stuck on him i'm actually getting body blocked he's gone but time's pretty weak well played well played i was just body blocked right there that was awful police say that guy's got a decent shotgun box if i have one i killed him he was so weak didn't he he didn't even have a shotgun bomb that either how did he kill me the guy's an absolute maniac oh god no sabotage okay i'm literally not healing this up so if i go down it's your fault why you you knitty killed me with you i thought i deserved that oh watch where you're walking but careful apologize oh do not accept it i'm surprised you ever want to play that game again it is fun though like and when you get like some good lose and you escape it's honestly it feels great it's because uh i'm playing for fun every other game that i play is not for fun and that's what makes it stressful my game i'm just like i'm not a recording i have no intention of ever uploading that yeah it's fun i have a sentinel mastiff like i'll try my best but i don't know what i'm doing i just bubble the bowl actually i think they're moving over there yeah they're crafting over here yep i can rope up top yeah dude if you can right here i'll charge you know protect ages sorry one's a right teammates team didn't say anyone was maybe he scanned him but i couldn't see because i was just shooting the other two maybe that's why yeah oh i mean i didn't see he you know i don't think he peed or anything we're just fine no because he's he's on comms but he said it after and i was oh oh i have three bass that's good enough right yeah i got four i love the mastiff man it's so good it's pretty good i miss my charge rifle you can't get it back shouldn't have dropped it i had a dead eyes tempo and a jaw shell in the same game it's kind of crazy that's kind of rare she's in this game beacon i need to back can we back up here try and get ahead and then i'm just going to try and defend you with this hold on nice six cracks found him die by the way the socks in nice job just give it up buddy i'm using the massive still especially with the gibby on the team like having a shotgun is so good yeah it is i should be i should have a shotgun too i don't know what i'm doing over there point five track 91 on gp yeah two of them happily this team's uh shooting at us from far left i mean they're not safe scanning the are area coming in i think we're gonna get pinched i think we just safe yeah or just for a little bit at least yeah i mean we can take this fight if we want there's definitely a team behind us though the rock is going to drop down and they're just going to take the tracks behind he doing he us he fell he's rushing a little bit pushing up give me cracks what's left i think i'm gonna swing on them the ring is she was i don't know if she dropped down again yeah she dropped down again looking down on him give me crackers played almost everything i bubbled back here bubblegum this before i don't even see them oh they have to drop oh they're padding not on twists but are they all going this way though sorry back there yeah what's on the right side leave 16 games broken let's give you okay taking a moment yeah can we go right i'll try i'll try we'll rope on the tracks last one this man only wants to shoot me i've seen nine so spamming instead of taking my time nice did you see it nice nice nice are you listening yeah yeah you are the eighth man i'm missing massive at the end dad got me what happens what happens got
