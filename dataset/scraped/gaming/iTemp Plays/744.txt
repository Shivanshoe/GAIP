hey wassup guys to treat welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and I've said this a few times already but I've really felt it in again that you're about to watch but I'm almost positive there's some sort changes we made regarding aim assist or sensitivity regarding the high magnification scopes I'm leaning towards it being a slight reduction in aim assist because the two times at close range for me is skipping past targets which was Tigana it's almost impossible Pro to do beforehand it was salt slowly moving so I was aiming through sludge and now it's just it's gliding across the screen but I really felt in the second game that I have for you today because I was using the craver which is a gun I often leave behind in the care packages because I can never land a shot this weapon I only got it at the end of the game and the first two shots didn't actually register as the gameplay was recorded before the update the fix this issue and I just felt so confident with it I'm looking forward to using this gun more in the future because it's incredibly fun and I've been under using it really so yes I have two games for you today it's a double whammy so stick around after the first one to double up on your daily dose of Apex legends content I will leave you there thank you for watching and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends diving for at least my friends I absolutely despise diving board just just again out there early on this time I'm fed up of the games end in a diving board so now I've adopted the strategy of starting the game diving board in the hopes that we don't have to return not really sure if it's going to work out or not but that's my strategy and I'm sticking to it at least we can take all of the loser fears of people are rewarded by coming to diving board in the future you describe a containment I am interested I just want me a shock and policin preferably a sight of my beautiful little hemlock here as well I know I could get involved and maybe some bear shields even if I don't get any of these things I'm still gonna rush there passes are dead shields please do you want in here if I so slow I'm somebody if I is so slowly without a shotgun Bob the Mastiff it's unbelievably slow this is where junks Randy unless there's a gold spawn it's where I got my gold Spitfire from okay so Tito you 20 today it's not looking promising we go from the gold to be fine to a basic feat Wynter 20 all right let's all scrapping after a decent gun for Rackham some poke damage in the form of a single fly hemlock and then I get myself purple shields I can rushing with a wishing with purple fields that you get the smoke off before they died and I mean now claim and see what's going on and my office failed I've down one of them friend we need to get involved it if we can otherwise they're gonna run off into the sunset it's being revived yes there's more smoke no believable how'd they get the smoke off when he was down used to just miss marple June but eunuchs deep time no see gosh aunt thing cuz my Evo's leveled up walkie the silence 36 damage to get purple shields now she's hiding it's nice no spot if the rank game ever end TM definitely try seen a minute all skied spot as they're caught no entirely sure why get myself some free Arthi they must've just run off this is annoying though because the chances are they're waiting for us to leave friends they can just get the banner I guess he's not the worst thing in the world if they respawn there to make you know more more people to kill that's the good way of looking at it Oh LEM I'll lend Lea I don't even get the first girl what she's pink that's best finger evidence crazy no fly things get involved did you see how quick but first I got melted with this little one Evo's that's the risk that you're taken when you pick these things up close getting a risk point and that's gonna happen there are people here and I've got no heavy don't want you to retreat a little bit just take this I'm coming aren't you guys look who it is I've been absolutely murdered by the Sentinel Sheila for all good - pregnant I absolutely love Octane's mobility by the way I don't know I mean those sciences do you have popping hey go now you can come into my shop and bolt level-one I swear it's a bit shocking Bobby not already did I not these guys are scrapping I mean oddly I found myself a golf hammer we've replaced it our original hemlock with a with a legendary one telex with team mates even when the jurors here it's get involved it's these guys again same people were fighting the very star the game still scrapping write that after the respawn my leaders for an oft as I say what are you doing standing there every pun that this race get away again she's gonna have respawned an angle or once more yeah she's trying it if she were talking we shut you down low she's down no friend ah she swear she's here she's she's trying to wrap around to get the banner again I'm not sure if this is even the same rate but I'm absolutely not then you get away from this not again I see you on one what there's a fine bed box miles this has to be by the way the best season of Apex we've ever had they cease so incredibly fun this is the best map we've had like the best this version of Kings Ken is the best map we've had there were people finding this way I'm loving the character diversity I'm loving the map I'm living the matchmaking I'm living that there's duo's now and you start the rent grind up again see they sack advantage of all the all the separate plates a pram with a hydrangea we've got here first no forehead knocked over or a rhyme suprem once more she's wait teammate after a full or sub pyro is actually working surpass it anyway share Blue Shield's and I had read please don't wanna sell face please come see me I'm gonna die on I I was gonna try and block it I just think that's it I mean I wasn't me get back anyway there's a 1v1 to Blue Shield's when I've got rekt that's actually mentally no we're having such a good game I messed up teammate that's my bad alright the Wrigley's my friends so kind kind of three the reduced North appear don't think this would actually come to screen caught the rig I triggered back that sees nice that's pretty much automatic but this is quickly becoming one of my phrases to land because even though it's not that popular the right labs is and you can probably hear the right labs kicking off in the distance humongous monster straps going on over there but this is the more consistent way to play you learn somewhere spend maybe a minute looting and then we can just get the hacking freak involved hopefully clean up their labs destroy everyone whilst they're looting the dead bodies on the floor another plan it's working so far for me and hopefully it works here again it's still kicking off you see this is you don't miss too much accent I mean you could walk but the reserve jumped out there it is this party will be a little bit quicker oh my word as if you can't climb at unathletic is the word that comes to mind someone is close kind of I think we're going away from right that's where they got where they going where they off to their far mm-hmm friends if they turn around or not I said wait I mean I've got an L star in a pilot a natural waste of my time even if we catch up slowly it won't be able to do any damage this is why the scraps happening this was the original play we go look at this like this direct impact see ya me a second TV uno momento that's why sometimes the Mastiff is pretty difficult to use but I'm a big fan [Applause] usually conflict in I hear double 13s there my aim was off a little bit the massive has to be the most satisfying gun in the game there's something about the sound of the Mastiff that just makes me happy when I connect shots what did they move this they've moved this free spawn beacon been relocated for some reason throw me off all right teammate still here get a respawn through a ton of supply bins and loot boxes to get and we should be right back in the action that wasn't so bad and we arrived really late - right that's - usually I try and get here it'll be quicker I've got distracted by that God Springs off into the sunset Tommy I've landed three shots from top what's first okay that's all of those challenges where you just think to yourself won by teammates next to me if I go down I'm hoping they'll be able to put your perhaps think of ever Lundy that many shots from directly above someone it is impossible to aim at people at that angle I'm not sure what it is it just feels so unnatural there are only 12 people left this may be the quickest I've seen people die on Kings Canyon in in season five obviously beforehand this is this was normal put it off three throwable so I'm good to go friends I say we just do some reconnaissance here try and find where the next scrap is coming that's our best bet 20 kill batch as the lifeline is that kill leader I don't think they would the champion I think that's kilmeade with the moments all right this is what we can do get back a jello I mean I haven't even used mine yet let me try and put it up top for you he's got any vote shields but if he finds purple in this he might want a moment upgrade okay all spot no one use there's bait we good oh my word dawn do me now so Jess what do you let me time I must've actually is there close range I Drive have a massive than a wingman but if you're interested he's got that over 110 palp asking for my friend free of charge pick it up from the floor this is a this is a extremely risky separately I've actually tried this before where no of both care package weapons and you went horrendously I just run out of ammo here we go there are two teams here friend I think we back up especially cuz I got a crater we do some crazy things okay nice no rake to know right oh you guys are extreme looking to no rake with a Kramer I mean daddy's peak unluckiness if you ask me back have been like 300 damage worth of no wrecks what an absolute tragedy oh yeah get behind the door again I know you're not trying this I know you're just kidding there's no way you repeat that he's got a moment peeking through the window yeah be careful you can't just run past oh oh thank you heckling off careful mister run I know father that team doesn't reengage from behind otherwise a screamer rude I think the termes disguise cooking I just think you just got to focus the high ground here bloom your friends have to focus on high ground because if you engage with the team down low because five would have just murders that's another squad as well how many say hey look a lobbyist on lockdown is building if they come close I got a crabber if they say across the way I've got a gum wait I said that the one brain working there should be a bad week pink where is this guy nice tell appoint a thief I think they've got it drop too much see I think they might be trying to bring that friend back let's go respawn beacon how do I miss the shot when she's teleporting but I'll and all do the shots and she held it fast we fight my job teammate and she knows one shot monster pencils at which point as well okay Oh soon one of the squads well we know where they are they're tuned next to that compound still I can't believe this massive crater combination is actually working out I mean we still got one final test ahead but actually being landing shots when the registration let's meet the scope feels completely different completely different [Music] I was on again part of these guns the two most satisfying weapons on the game the Mastiff and the crepe and my word I can't believe how many shots have landed with the crater there that's that's like old world's first for me I mean Tony 1,500 damage but an extra it could have been up to 300 damage of 280 ish when it been to bad day Oh quick game as well and to be honest everyone was dead before we even got into any sort of proper fight there were like 12 people left I'll take that that's nice they'll finish the game the risk paid off the risk of the crater and the Mastiff combination what a fun game thanks for watching I'll see you over the next one [Music]
