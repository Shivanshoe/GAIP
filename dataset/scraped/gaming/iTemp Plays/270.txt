hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i finally put together apex's hidden combination so let's start off with some info here some background info red armor is quite clearly better than gold armor there are only a few instances where i take gold armor over red and those are one if i have zero batteries at all and i really can't be bothered to slow hill two i'm using the sentinel because it only takes one cell to charge up instead of two cells and the third instance i will consider running gold armor instead of red is when i'm playing octane especially now that his passive regen has been nerfed to a snail's pace this is because you can stim and pop a syringe and get 50 health back really quickly so you can carry on stimming so today i decided to play octane use a sentinel and get gold armor so i can benefit from it three times over it's a genie's plan it's a genius plan and i actually did land some sniper shots in there as well which has never happened before on the channel so enjoyed that so thank you for watching guys i really do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends there is a team here by the way i've just bounced off his head i've just bounced off his head into the next stratosphere cracked 83 cracked box one i'm popping off this game with a sentinel pk combo you've never seen anything like it charging on my shields down opening fire i cracks on it okay i need some heavy desperately heavy in sniper i've got basically nothing unfortunately they were scrapping over here so far away thank you though he heard you oh guy i pinged it uh he heard you hey mike i think he might have heard me i'm charging percentage longer news dangerous these cracks oh two light bullets underneath us come on come on come on hold on i need to uh let me pop a few cells oh my god i broke them but 70 hp wait what happened to my sniper mag that i got i don't understand it's over here like i took a purple sniper mag and he didn't got my gun that's kind of weird man i'm a genius and i'm an octane so it's really good for the syringos you know this is combination of this century i wonder if he's really all about that he probably used me i'll be honest well if he is then he'd be playing rings no but it's going down in a sec he's got all the rp he can he's already he's already number one if it's all all means all uh that means so partially about that rpg yes it is hello horizon this guy had an alternator what is going on that was the last of that i have voices turned off i don't understand was a fight i don't even know where they were uh over here somewhere i don't know i just saw tracers on making me with enemies oh my god they've running mate they're running nice got one spotted i am on autopilot if it's not world edge i'm on autopilot oh i think i saw someone here got one here oh you actually just pass this purple armor get rolled and now now the ender gets it okay roll i'm gonna make my own one minute this is the worst angle evan i'm still willing to challenge your guy 45 seconds oh my god i'm getting this uh he is running this guy's a zoomer parties hi jimmy you got him i'm running away i do ah zoomers don't play like that true ten seconds which is like full send like brainless like no no thinking and uh yeah exactly no no no no i full send but it's like a combination of like boomer and zoomer you know it's a little bit of both that full send but there's some there's some is it basically best of both worlds kind of thing i was this album it's a lifeline i couldn't see there's so many damage numbers popping up you know on my screen i couldn't see anything i'm coming i'm not i'm looting don't you worry i need to heal there recharging shields can you smoke that guy on the roof oh this is the worst oh i'm dead i smell good thank you not really i actually missed okay no he was already down though but i know that's why it's even funnier because he fell off the map is there someone here i don't know our teammates freaking out why is he not a what's this guy doing what were they all doing right no no no no no i'm telling you those those are the zoomers they're zoomers sometimes it's honestly that's a good tactic to let's go down especially like if you've got a lifelong team you're afk reviving the gold bag like that's the way to draw them to you and they do stupid things like that they just sat on the rope and i beam them yeah they i think all three of either all three of them are two of them got hit by my all and they just so we're like nah let's still go let's go guys mess them up watch this watch this watch this like that how did you do it yes we're going to walk cool if we get to abstract tap strafing is soon to be an antiquated movement technique on apex legends that no one will be able to do let's see if the devs ever figure out already if the devs ever figure out how to get rid of it you will be screwed who knows maybe another like two years the last time they tried to get rid of it their entire game broke for like two weeks smokey sniper whatever oh yeah uh i think even he's like helping like and giving input and stuff on the changes so i think it's a call for me i don't appreciate oh the flatline records to the right too much at the end of the mag i need to remember that there's a load over here i can't i'm shooting these other guys down here let me know i mean it's cool reloading hey you're fine reloading [Music] don't worry leave me alone there's like four teams here all right yeah i think it's everything yeah i'm trying to like keep this all under control all right we got another squad what are you shooting me for i'm so confused man under control incoming smoke for teammate you want to do that why help me there's no way this guy didn't have anything better than help with this team i'm here i'm gonna upload this they're gonna see on this thing behind us we'll just back up a little bit if you have to see what's going in here i'm trying i just don't want them to take this teammate love is weak other teams already here that's terrifying i need a bat not with you at all reloading some mobile oh god no i'm gonna get in the roof i smoked her she's broken yeah nice these guys aren't the back by the way i think it's broken no yes we might just want to go around honestly yeah i have gold i don't i don't have any heels though i need to loot this box away now i have to do extra work here you go here you go thank you i'm gonna lose this golden real quick i'll leave okay yeah i'm gonna go around the side these guys are just homeless uh what guns are i have r3 all nine i'm i've got a lot of light if you need something replicator falling down this is the last team i also have white helmet there's no way no one's had a better helmet i must have just missed it i'm safe almost there i don't know if we can get too much banner this is about to oh they're coming down they're in the zone still don't wait for us i can barely see him i can barely see him it's like here he was he was they were trying to just gatekeepers basically crazy just here i don't think so probably mate okay good i played mate that was such a fun game that's a good one you are the apex champions i'll play what played wait a minute [Music] he was a bit of a lunatic i can't lie he kind of was as lifeline too he's full standing fights like down that hill like where we got rave pushing like right near the end and then that team at the end i don't know he was just wking he's seen that he's a zoo
