hey guys this is isadeptic and welcome to top apex plays if you'd like one of your clips featured in our videos complete the form in the description below but without further delay let's get into today's clips bamboozles for the fools it works it rhymes nothing feels better than hitting those shots with the crater i'm spotted start out gastric is it a bird is it a plane no it's another craver um i'm taking some damage so after that patch the servers are back to normal right right let's get our basket down check out this pretty great rotation using pathfinder on olympus rotation crank crank crank certified cranked rotation out here you gotta stick your thing on that perimeter up there gonna write it down when we get up here it gets tricky you gotta crank the fattiest grapple of your life and then the roof behaves so weird on the right half sometimes it's salt so you gotta go to the left and make your way back over and then you drop down and that's it that's the crank difference so guys today we've got something else to talk about for season 11. recently apex legends data miner crow rindo was able to find this little fella sitting atop watson's heirloom however it's called the bloodhound cockatoo or is it later code discovered that this was a ground emote called bird call and that it's actually going to be featured alongside watson's heirloom this means it could possibly be a rare animation however the one thing that points again towards our tropical map is the fact that this bird looks well very tropical seeing that wildlife may be able to interact with some heirloom animations gives us hope that maybe there'll be a few more rare ones chucked in for existing heirlooms therefore giving all heirlooms some sort of tropical theme when used on the new map but yet again as with all things datamined only time will tell so what do you think of this and what do you think will be our next heirloom when we're in the new map on season 11. let us know all your thoughts in the comments section down below and if you'd like to check out the original post by crowlrindo you can find that linked in the description below when playing watson trapping your enemy in a small space is a great option hey guys just a reminder that if you're enjoying today's video please hit the like button as it really makes a big difference in the youtube algorithm if you enjoy our videos showcasing the best daily top apex plays then be sure to hit that subscribe button with the bell notification turned on who needs digi sites when you've got no scope smoky skill smooth okay i didn't realize that there were like two of them bro she's mad about that fans nice q man oh she's sticking res and i stuck hole defeated me the enemy time hey enemy taken out got ourselves a bandit out there [Music] no trouble here [Applause] [Music] that's a wrap on today's video don't forget you can send us your clips using the form linked in the description below be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications for more top apex plays videos this has been isodeptic and i'll catch you next time run through the money the press will be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdie is back tell me i'm garbage i'm going through something that's why i ain't calling phone and progression it's all that i wanted to follow and effects and i summon it because i got problems on problems on problems on problems on problems or problems i solve them i run through the money the pressure be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me
