the children of the mountain is a group of self-supported individuals who want to improve their reality by using patented processes and part of that process is during stage four the helping of people like you hey what's up everything is up i am actualized and i have seen the answers friend what i'm a normative positive and you can be the same listen i know it sounds crazy but you don't have to be a standard depressive you can be an outstanding positive man you sound kind of kind of like it's easy to mock but part of you is thinking maybe i should give that a try that girl is pretty and she also seems happy well maybe i'm living in ignorance but it's a beautiful ignorance and i suggest you try it yes i know it's exciting but through the manipulation of four different developmental stages into a patented process we have ensured that the limitations of your orthodoxy can be challenged hey how you doing oh i am well on my way to being a fully actualized realization of the self that is a true rebuttal of everything that is typical within a normalized cynic so i'd say very formative thank you okay good luck with that it's time to utilize your very own completeness don't let the reality pass you by life is not a game don't be a normal cynic this is your chance hear what i am saying it's simple and clear embrace your actuality how are you i'm an actualized probability wave who has formed her own definitive answers as to her formulation and those of all like-minded energy fields listen sweetheart the only reason to join a goddamn cult is to swing a lot so get laid and shut the [ __ ] up
