interview what is it this time receptionist at an online marketing company i'm not saying you shouldn't take advantage of age diversity quotas but it's so tragic feeling like the parents are arriving to break up a party every time you walk in a room hey i'm not that old that's it head held high i look at you and my dad and i see men stripped of their dignity emasculated husks of their former selves well at least he's got you to keep his spirits up why does someone always come in just when i'm about to take a break look are you sure you can afford this i just don't know whether dressing like a man half your age is the right way to compete with a man half your age you know for a girl working as a store assistant you've got a lot to say about my career path oh this is just temporary until you know the recession goes away i've got my whole life ahead of me as soon as my complete degree starts to gain currency in the marketplace or my blog picks up traffic i'm out of here i buy all my clothes online with an app that fits them okay what is it this time what i can't shop in here i've noticed that older men with a full head of hair are particularly prone to dressing age inappropriately you know for a sales assistant you really are terrible at selling we're trained to be snooty and skating it's part of the suburban vibe well aren't you just too cool for school i'm too cool for school but you'd get arrested at school for being an old pervert wow you know something you'd be bffs with my daughter we just have the sizes on the racks so don't bother asking wow how many times have you been in now look are you really here for the clothes if you've developed some creepy obsession for me i'd like to know now rather than drag this charade out any longer no sorry sweetheart don't flatter yourself because that's never going to happen in a million lifetimes do you understand hey okay okay i think you made your point so long as we're on the same page it's hard to stay motivated in this recession
