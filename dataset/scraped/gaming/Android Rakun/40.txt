you to stop lying to me i let you in the underground because i thought you understood understand what krieger did to rick roxon needs to pay me that's the only way i can beat him i need you to look the other way please i can't uh waking up away i made a promise uh [Music] okay that was a hell of a way to tell me you're spider-man what if i'd killed you you want me to feel bad because you almost killed me i want you to stop lying to me i let you in the underground because i thought you understood i do understand what krieger did to rick roxon needs to pay not like this okay i can beat him because i need you to listen please i can't i made a promise so did i why'd you pick here my dad brought us to that concert seven choirs from seven countries remember south korea thailand venezuela you're right i usually am usually usually what hmm [Music] [Music] gotta say i'm disappointed i guess i was hoping that you and me would say hi that way this is our most secure facility and here the sausage gets made real prick do you know that my brother and i were developing new form he said the only thing you knew how to do was sell other people's ideas well at least i still got a pulse babe but let's not dwell right the first thing we're gonna do is i'm are those involuntary defenses oh man that's hot you see i'm gonna get that mask off yeah and i'm gonna find out what makes you tick because you just smell like next level bioengineering and you know what that smells like to me kid it smells like money okay sorry i'm going to hit the gym get her to tell us where my new form is yeah can't really open applause without it oh and uh use him time to finish what we started on the bridge no cameras [Music] holy tougher than i look huh let's find a way out of here roxanne kept rhino instead of giving them to the police nothing about roxanne surprises me anymore you okay i will be once we're out we have to lift the base lock down first from the control room i'll go down to the floor see what we're doing i guess it's unlocked i'm headed to the floor right above your noise [Music] there's two more ahead don't know why morales is so against us seen him go through three different assistants gotta watch out for spiders man don't really see the point of bullying spiderman okay we're working overtime to get that place open yeah i'm on rotation seems like the whole future of the company staked on that place okay ready for another computer yeah but there has to be a better way to deal with rock song sometimes strategies are imperfect like deciding to lie to your friends let's just focus on getting out fine but we're gonna talk what was that standby might have something okay [Music] yes [Music] down your weapons [Music] looks like some kind of record archive i wonder what's on these computers triggering the override there's a voice memo on here sir the police are asking about rhino what do we tell them our man at the raft is setting up a special work release program tell the police rhino's doing a little community service i can't believe they got away with this door's unlocked but i need you to force it open can do muscle was only supposed to grab the girl yeah he didn't like that here's the deal bud spider-man's the best leverage i got against miss mason i mean you agreed to leave the kid alone uncle aaron ah the kid i love how you say that it's just so paternal let spider-man go and i'll get your new form feed you underground intel whatever you want see leverage works every time my spiderman here's leverage for you i've seen things new form making people sick what you did to rick mason but you won't see it here's the deal europe plus all the jobs we've done together but and we both know you're a little too self-serving for that so we're gonna head in and check on miss mason and spider-man uh but it's kind of an invite only party yeah okay bye is that the reason we got captured no it's i knew he worked with roxanne but i didn't think he thank you you led me into a trap why do i keep listening to you then no there has to be an explanation so when he passed those security shutters got a maintenance panel here but it needs power let me see what i can do gotta be attached to a generator [Music] but i can move machinery like that crane maybe we can use that i'll look around they built engines for their apc's in here hey crane's over this engine thing now engine thing i've got an idea can you move the crane back to the assembly line yeah i think i know where you're headed okay okay this laser should activate the engine oh crap laser shorted out nice webs are conducting electricity [Music] you're good use a laser one laser coming up is [Applause] give me a few minutes to get it open not hard welcome to the stream one exit all right i'll take care of those guards you get that door open welcome to the stream one thing did you ever think about calling me to tell me you were spider-man you know after my parents died rick basically had to become my dad i thought i'd miss having a brother but i had you finn um won't hold forever go i'll be fine just go those guys with the lights on their helmets can spot heat signatures they'll see you if you try to go invisible okay wonder how much of their r d department is dedicated to fighting us probably millions of dollars in untaxed money clear the floor i'll work on overriding security so we can get out yeah those webs are holding the door whole base is on alert though so be careful about this there's only one way out of the base you've got to come through here we need another perimeter you look so peaceful okay [Applause] i bet you didn't see that coming up checking his position check your corners you could be anywhere sorry okay listen i know you don't trust me you're right i don't need to change that stop going behind my back and stop acting like i haven't thought this through yes i'm doing this the loud way [Music] yes hmm is [Music]
