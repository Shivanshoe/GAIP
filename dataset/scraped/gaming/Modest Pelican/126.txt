[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with Red Dead Redemption too if you enjoyed this video please enter the US presidential race and insurer you get elected once in power introduce Pellicano care whereby everyone gets free medical treatment providing they are subscribed to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel well my channel sure is very rock star focused these days but what can I say I genuinely love their games like for example this Valentine's Day I took the red dead disc out of its case pulled down my pants and you know the little hole in the middle of the disc well I didn't do anything to it because premarital sex is forbidden anyway my boys still tomorrow and I have decided that we will start an uber service in the big bad Wild West for this we'll need a suitable wagon it must have at least four seats be less than 10 years old and have the faint aroma of Indian takeaway while searching for the perfect wagon I come across to Cruz in the midst of a pretty hectic gunfight white pants guy over here tea bags the ground which is the international gaming sign of pace so I decide to go and meet the big girl he and his crew seem friendly enough right up until he pulls me off my horse and then tries to kill me for being the victim of a murder is my second least favorite thing my least favorite thing is when someone on Xbox Live says they've had sex with my mum and it turns out they actually did like 25 years ago and then they turn out to be my dad and then they block me the somato says I'm the worst uber driver he's ever seen as rather than transporting the good people of st. Denis from A to B with a heartfelt smile I seem to have injected us right into the middle of a bloodbath it becomes apparent that this city is no longer a good place to start an uber business and thus we learn the first rule of the uber trade don't kill prospective clients we commandeer a little wagon and in other circumstances this would be a pretty cute little commute with my bro if white pants guy and his crew weren't chasing after us for revenge I wreck him with these but I must say he wasn't actually looking that aggressive he had no gun drawn so maybe he is ready to kiss I mean be friendly and then again maybe not as he shoots me in the face with the pump-action shotgun white pants guy seems to have now put on my red beanie and has switched to tea bagging in a hurtful manner which might be the most emotionally scarring thing that has ever been done to me and I fought in Nam these guys are still not in voice chat so we sort of just sit around the campfire which is wholesome that is clearly not the uber dream we envisaged motto then sits really close to this guy and honestly if this gets any hotter it won't be family-friendly enough for YouTube so we quickly find a new Lobby all right back to basics we find the perfect wagon and the last driver looks like he was one hence and Malaka not going to lie at last we can begin but for some reason I thought I could go through this riverbed but I have a severe lapse in water judgment and sink the carriage we find another one but motto isn't great with the reins either as he slowly but surely grinds this horse's head up against the moving train ruining the dream for the second time in about 45 seconds we eventually find this wagon I'm not going to lie it's a pretty dodgy unit but it'll do the job we're definitely not Boober lux either I'll tell you that much haha questionable uber jokes or video like and subscribe and finally we find our first legitimate client who goes by the name of hillbilly Shane and he wasn't talking on the mic would you like to be our first-ever customer mate just jump in the back at Burger yesterday don't our donors trampled Shane late good money often oh boy dude Shane just quiet down oh god he better leave us a good review I'll remove the body cover stop rolling it whatever our changes send me a message I'm the so far this override has been a hugely successful venture and Shane even started talking to us so Shane how will you pay for this trip today you said you had no money its freebie how will you be paying for this trip shape look if you want to go fetch some payment like just an animal or something Oh Shane Shane Shane that's a chain edge two small deer or a rabbit would be sufficient payment Oh a human thanks man it's this little business of his I made a tender for barbecuing so all in all a reasonably successful override Shane kept falling out of the wagon so it wasn't exactly safe but the important thing is he only died two or three times which is not bad the body he gave us for payment also had seven cents on it and some chewing tobacco so I can confirm that starting an uber service is the fastest possible way to make money in red dead online at Rhodes we also upgrade wagons so that clients can now ride in style I take my job more seriously than people who create porn hub accounts to comment and rate videos take their porn we locate another potential client by the name of crazy boy 100 who doesn't want to ride in the coach he's been busy hunting and has a lot of animal carcasses so we decide to do the only logical thing Rob the man he follows us and we just head towards the camp where we can deposit the goods and then sell them later is this ethical know is this profitable honestly not really anyway we get back to our camp and I kid you not crazy boy 100 just starts giving us the animal carcasses for free here all this time we thought we were stealing from him when in reality he was stealing our hearts if we could all be a little bit more like crazy boy 100 then maybe just maybe the world would be a better place so anyway we've established people seem to trust humble uber drivers so we decide to see how we can use this to rob people and if necessary kill them we also upgrade to a bigger wagon it's basically a bus to be honest and should do the job should we come across larger crews get out I'm a no service just let me know where you need to go well uh we'll get you to where you need to go there my client just fell out so we often do they might get egged eyelids wait boys evening gentlemen we offer over service if you want to just climb in the back will take you to where we need to go ah great day please don't kill people did you just [ __ ] he's lagging so much he trampled I'm a gets yeah I don't want any trouble boys I don't want any trouble I just gonna grab our uber and go boys na da le t ha we actually started to get quite a bit of traction going with the uber large but it was a red hot mess everyone kept accidentally punching each other and we couldn't move the wagon if hostile players were in it or something it's almost as if the developers didn't design this game for the sole purpose of us recreating an affordable multinational peer-to-peer ride-sharing scheme you put this many players in a small space and of course things are going to get heated the appalling clients then start using chemical warfare which is just a dick move as soon as it goes biological was really lose their fun factor the leader of this gang frits then agrees we'll have a fight to the death to settle the score we go at it and again it's not pretty the ping between Australia and America is higher than stealth our motto as I'm a bilateral thinker I pull out a knife and start cutting him up and he did not say this genius move coming seriously though everyone's always talking about violence against medical staff and women but never over drivers where the actual victims here next thing I know we're in the carriage with the very guys who have been online bullying us pretty sure we're meant to be the ones driving but this is close enough I'm going to count it as a successful trip if they do crash the wagon into the water but it's an easy mistake to make I don't blame them at all if they'd crashed it into a train however that's a different story you'd have to be a bloody idiot to crash a wagon into a moving train we now need to locate a new Ober the problem is it was already pretty weird that there were two drivers we can't exactly have seven I noticed there's some other prospective clients in the local pub so I jog on over to see if I can drum up a little business these guys are just standing around looking intimidating listening to some classical music I like it and then all of a sudden they explode the entire venue Wow terrorist bombs are so 2000 and late these days it's all about leaking nudes grow up gamers all I wanted to do was pick them up at their desired pickup location have an awkward conversation talking about how long I'd been an uber driver for and then drop them at their desired destination but apparently a man can't pick up strangers in this game I will not rest until we complete at least one more smooth over trip we hide up in the bedroom and then the guy who immaturely bombed us rushes in and so I tie him up and all of a sudden it's weird the rooms dimly lit there's a guy tied up on the bed and there's lots of dudes just standing around and then Mato walks in I convinced both crews to sign a peace treaty and we sign it by committing a mass suicide because this game doesn't actually have a function that lets you sign a peace treaty this also makes for the perfect time to find a new Lobby and complete our main objective firstly I make motto help me get a thumbnail which I imagine is extremely enjoyable for him I get the screenshot and now all I need to do is add an obnoxiously large red circle around the clearly visible wagon and she'll be good to go finally we find a last rutting along who seems peaceful and offer her a ride she climbs in and we're doing it lads and lasses we're really doing it she does seem to be pretty aggressively dry-humping Matos face but as long as she gives us a five-star rating I can't be mad we accept as a form of payment money our pictures of your feet the pulse - that's really those feet pics should fetch a pretty penny with male twitch viewers and therefore with payment complete I think it's fair to say that we did it we have successfully set up an efficient flawless uber company thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
