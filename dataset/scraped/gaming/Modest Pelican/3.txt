i started my gta online series with the goal of my character thick man becoming the most powerful crime lord in los santos three years later i can satisfyingly say that we've achieved that goal the powder my labs make is the purist and my employees are the cutest i've got a flying car that can shoot heat-seeking missiles we own nightclubs that encourage consent some of my officers just have cash laying around and stacked up on the floor in fact i've got several officers for all the different businesses i run i'm working more jobs than a single mum with a gambling problem we've purchased multiple properties together to ensure thick man always has a warm bed to sleep in and not to mention the state-of-the-art speaker system phone stand flexing the forefront of 2013 technology my wardrobes have women's clothing in them we also have a second phone speaker system we're such a kingpin that i can call a cheap escort and she comes around within the hour arguably anyone could do that but does just anyone have this grand view of a nine year long construction zone we bought a damn super yacht yes it's the mid-range one but who needs two helipads that's just excessive plus we've got this captain here who's always ready to go he never stops gripping the wheel ten and two we own the shiniest mechanic shop in town our weed farm is empty right now but just imagine how lush this would be if i managed the business better then finally my prized possession and definitely my biggest asset the first apartment i ever bought nothing makes you feel more like a man than some good old-fashioned asbestos exposure like the video if you sprinkle asbestos on your cereal to start the day with a bang it's been a journey and one that i've enjoyed immensely but it's time for thick man to take on a fresh challenge as buying a new lamborghini doesn't hit as hard when you already own three others i need to holiday somewhere new where i can start at the bottom and prove myself once again but for the moment it's time to say goodbye to gta online as thick man is flying to the city of no pixel this is a modded city where the stakes are higher the police and gangs are real people the economy is harsh there are laws you have to follow and all you start with is an apartment five thousand dollars and a dream welcome to thick man season two no pixel when he's not wearing his suit he really does look like a malnourished chemo survivor i'd still hit i spawn into my starter apartment and it's not bad at all it's the kind of place you'd happily live by yourself but you wouldn't bring girls back to the fridge is in the bedroom which i can't imagine is a turn on i obviously can't use the name thick man as it's a bit on the nose for a modded city attempting to emulate real life instead i choose the fake name karthik manuel it's an indian first name and a surname that's origins go back as far as the byzantine empire more importantly if you put the names together it says thick men this little gag is potentially not worth having to explain to people why a white pasty stud has an indian name i head outside to begin my journey to the top at the bottom of the elevator i meet a guy who seems like a real straight shooter yeah shot a couple people but that's okay yo what what i didn't say nothing all right man piss on the car what you just give me a car that's a rental i'll admit it's not a great decision to hop into a stranger's car especially when he just admitted to killing two police officers surprisingly the big girl doesn't betray me and lets me keep the rental car it's obviously not a rental car but ignorance is bliss and walking sucks i use the car to drive myself to a clothing store the closest one is kiki's organic clothing so i guess i won't be able to buy the endangered siberian tiger scarf i was lusting for i can't just wear my suit that's too obvious so i go for something incognito no one will know the life i used to live you look like a drug [Laughter] with my new clothes i'm ready to start making cash i hop back into my rental and the engine doesn't start you can't trust anyone anymore so here i am running through the dark streets well-dressed and isolated this truly is a started at the bottom story i happened to pass a bank and so i decided to go in and check my balance as expected we have five thousand dollars it's not much money but it is hard to make money in this city so it's a start i then jog over to a car salesman how much is this bad boy it's uh six thousand nine hundred dollars after tax my only worry is like once i start driving this car i'll probably get like heaps of but they can only there's only one passenger seat yeah that is uh hmm yeah you're right you're right um in one of my first gta online videos i bought the rat loader truck and named it shaniqua i must have her again and so we need to make two thousand dollars i've also made the stunning and brave decision to turn gender stereotypes upside down and aggressively hit on women in the hopes of finding a sugar mama then when the time's right i'll steal her belongings and hide in my apartment think big work smart okay sir um it's better since i just saw you in that car oh thank you well my name is delaney and it's nice to meet you sir jolene it's a pleasure the name's karthik karthik yeah correct nice to meet you carthage hey delaney have you met the mind goblin mind goblin these nuts surprisingly she doesn't fall for me and i 100 know exactly why you see i made a rookie error and forgot to buy my signature speed dealer sunglasses now this is what a peak alpha male looks like a day two in the city and i really need money so far all i've done is buy expensive clothes and jog long distances i walk outside and some road man offers me weed i say no as i'm budgeting but he's quite the salesman sure bro i mean in the sea you don't really need them joints bro you twisted my arm alright i'll smoke a little weird bro how much uh how much you're selling for i didn't have the cash on me so he gave me a ride to an atm the first time i bought weed in australia i went to the address my mate gave me i was then screamed out by a motorcycle gang member who was furious i knew his address he became more enraged when he realized i was only buying a 20. the juxtaposed to this experience where i just bought narcotics off one of god's angels i light one up and for a brief moment i feel like a king then i realize the weed is making me lazy and avoid work no pixel is unbelievably immersive i decide i'm going to become a garbage man to make cash and further increase my chance of attracting women i then stumble across a bmx bike and cruise over to the sanitation plant i meet a clown who seems like he'd chop me up and eat me if i fell asleep for too long but i like his energy i like it i'm a little terrified but i like it i do a quick stunt to establish my dominance as the alpha garbage man and then the clown to other guys and myself set off to keep the streets clean the big secret is it's not garbage in these bags it's a hundred percent clean cut pure nose candy that we're smuggling for the mob no i'm joking it's just actual garbage just an honest blue-collar day's work well i mean i slacked off where i could as everybody deserves a break we grinded this out for quite some time but then something strange happened i misclicked and punched two of my colleagues in the face which didn't help staff morale they said nothing but i could tell it bothered them then something else strange happened the psychotic clown found a mysterious package what is that no noise give me a package what have you got there the clown was freaking out because the package did say illegal on it not sure which criminal put that label on but i realize i have to seize this opportunity i had to turn these garbage men into a drug cartel i hide the box in a dumpster ready to pick up after our shift we return the truck get paid and then wait but the clown doesn't return maybe he was scared of entering the drug game or maybe it's because i kept accidentally landing clean haymakers onto his jaw down a man we return to the dumpster and get our package now all we need is a chill quiet place to unpack the narcotics go somewhere discreet yeah yeah by the way we find an alley but then the worst possible thing happens like i'm just took a wrong turn yeah we're just doing some sanitation you took the very very wrong turn these people just drove down in the back alley we can say they took a wrong turn we'd just driven into a gang's block potentially even their base of operations with the stolen box of unknown illegal substances it started to get hated and i thought for sure these two big girls were about to cap us then like hood jesus this guy shows up little homies like you know they they're just trying to show their work that she's like there you know i'm saying they do what they do right yeah of course so just promise me you guys promised me one thing just you drink some water stay hydrated in this hot weather man you know i don't know about that but yeah okay okay i smoked some joints i'm gonna drink drink some liquor but that's about it i love this man so much the most important thing is he calmed the situation and sent us on our way we find a place to open the box that isn't the center of a gang controlled block and inside is bags and bags of weed also known as my ticket to a new car we split up but frank and i decide to stick together frank explains to me that the drug trade is controlled by the gangs and if anyone's caught selling on their turf then they die even still we decide to sell the pot but first he needs to do something far far more important look after and maintain his vehicle all right you know uh we do accept tips here but you know they're not uh you're not obligated to give one just you know give you a little reference point we proceed to not give him a tip i'm still working on my side hustle of finding a sugar mama wherever i can do you like my sunglasses do you want my honest opinion yep i'm not a fan i consider miss click punching her until she dies but i don't want the cops to come and find our pot our new problem is that we don't know how to roll joints and so we head down to the uwu cafe to ask around yes it's uwo like the cat kitten ear girl it's been a productive day and i'm at a cute little cafe so i decided to treat myself and order a booba iced tea yeah the tea is 250 before tax i thought it was gonna be like 20 bucks i don't have enough cash cash for this i'll tell you what i'm so embarrassed yeah i got a i got a 500 tip like 10 minutes ago so i'm paying it forward yeah i'll make sure to pay it forward as well thanks man appreciate it you take care i hustled some free boba tea bro you got some free tea yeah how'd you get some free tea i would have freaked me i lied said i had no money oh damn that's unfortunate because i actually work here i can now never show my face there again eventually we do figure out how to roll spliffs and it's exactly what you'd think you just need papers that you buy from the service station i roll 21 of the finest and still have bags left over frank and i celebrate by sparking one up at the uwu cafe that i'm banned from it'll never not be funny to me seeing people learn that my name is karthik laughing about it and then realizing it's an indian name and despite the confusion having to just be cool about it or risk looking insensitive is it kitely i believe this is cultural appropriation but i have no choice as there's no anglo names with thick in them my hands are tied party time is over as i now have to move this product a short while ago i was the new kid on the block and now with 20 joints in my pocket i'm the pablo escobar of no pixel i've sold a little bit of weed before to these guys in the grade above me when i was in school i used to make a fortune as they were really christian and had no idea how much money it was worth i decide my best bet is to do what my younger self did and just be really confident and hope i can catch some teens walking home from bible study i'll sell at the same price i paid for the ones i bought you're looking to buy some weird at all probably return it turns out selling weed is really easy people love wade plus there's a game mechanic where your character needs to smoke or they get stressed my strategy is to not sell to anyone who looks like they might be in a gang i also keep the product stored up in my apartment for an extra layer of security your name is clothing catholic but i'm close catholic gothic yeah you're you're catholic yeah i'm catholic mother mary said would you like to buy some weed ladies that's interesting you have a good day sir racists i decide to make my way over to the car salesman but if i have to run one more block i might genuinely uninstall this game so i call myself a taxi my driver rocks up in a damn commercial towing truck this guy is adding his own flavour to taxi driving at least i don't have to walk but when it comes time to pay he doesn't have a set fee you just pay whatever you think is fair be brutally honest is that like is that just not enough was that just a really low ball well that's the lowest anybody's ever paid me for a taxi i will overpay for all the taxis in the world when i'm an internationally respected drug lord i chat with the car salesman about buying my new vehicle i also sell her a little weed the hustle never sleeps it's been quite a journey but it just goes to show through hard work smart choices a random garbage man clown finding a mysterious box a gangster showing us mercy and a 1200 loan from frank you can buy yourself a dream car at last i'm reunited with my one true love shaniqua she might have the turning circle of an unborn fetus but she has character and personality like no other a new car and a good friend in frank it could be a lot worse and i'm excited to make our next moves if you enjoyed this video i appreciate a like i love you and see you soon [Music]
