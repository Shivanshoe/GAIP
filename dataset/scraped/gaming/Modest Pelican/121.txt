[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA online if you enjoyed this video please become a marriage counselor and say the only way to have a happy relationship is to watch my videos together daily as this really helps spread the good word of my channels mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories alright welcome back to the world's top rated educational Christian music media source I'll be your host puffer Pelle where I spit facts logic and red-hot parables that'll change your life in fact the only thing that I'm not spitting on anymore is people I walk past on the street because contrary to popular belief that actually is statutory assault so yeah last video we spent millions of dollars on a super yacht which was perhaps the most regrettable decision I've ever made but let's go see how the big floaty girl is doing well I'm driving to the water I noticed this guy is wearing a scarf with a t-shirt what is your neck cold but your arms are warm are you trying to hide your stepdads hickeys seriously I'm no fashion connoisseur but now I have to reshuffle my afternoon so I can beat you down for committing the worst crime imaginable a crime of fashion it seems old thick man's a little rusty with hand-to-hand combat but fortunately I'm an out-of-the-box thinker and perform what I'm pretty sure is a textbook citizen's arrest all right so my boat is a huge flex but it's also wildly inconvenient and difficult to access this dude then rocks up on a flying motorbike and then moments later spontaneously combusts which actually works out really well for me there she is what a seafaring nautical marine beauty I now only have $400,000 though because of this purchase so we're in desperate need of some cash may dumping this guy's motorbike into the ocean and having to pay a $10,000 insurance fee sure is a great start there's still though what Abbey I've been sending photos of Moby Dick to girls I know in real life to impress them the hottest girl in my town responded and then we met up and made sweet biracial love and afterwards everyone in the town clapped and cheered for me it was pretty hot so the yacht comes with a free helicopter which is great you can use the chopper to look at the yacht which is basically what owning one is all about this big guy stands here pretending to drive it even though it doesn't actually move it really is country living in the city out here you've also got a lot of these paperback things I think are called books anyway people who can't afford an Xbox read them there are several luxurious bedroom suites and a bar lounge so that you can Day drink I don't really know how this guy got on board but he doesn't have any biceps I don't mean like he needs to hit the gym he literally doesn't have any bicep toriel muscles I just made up the word bicep toriel as I watched the sunrise in my hot tub with a close-up of this random guys crotch in my face I decide it's time we do a highest to make some paper I'm already with Maddie so I yell in the air sons of virgins assemble which doesn't do anything so I just fly over to stealth au robos house and pick him up also random crotch guy whose actual name is area code 403 is still with us for some reason so I guess he's the new stealth amato a lot of you were asking we're stealth our motto is well you know Maddie right pretty weird how they've never been in the same video before because guess what with the help of modern surgery stealth our motto has become stealth Oh motto no kidding he'll be back soon he's just been busy doing real-life stuff like for example he bailed on playing today because it was his birthday family dinner like WTF how selfish can you be it's not like it was a major birthday Crosby gets online so we all get ready to heist on my way to his apartment I noticed some people in my neighborhood inactive we're smoking I believe in a little thing called loving thy neighbor so I channeled my inner good fellow citizen and laid them out it's loitering pests like this that drive property prices down you're welcome neighbors all right it's time to heist we head inside and look who it is Trevor Phillips the adman himself probably one of the greatest GTA characters ever and yeah he's planning this whole expedition but basically we are going to be stealing non prescription medication from the lost motorcycle club q generic shot of us walking outside as I tried to pass the same cutscenes off over and over again and pretend it enhances production quality the outfit choices are really weird Robo looks as thick as ever seriously the man's a snack we couldn't be more ready to infiltrate the lost MC base this is no ordinary base though it's one I'm all too familiar with a super yacht wife-beater the thin silver chain pink balaclava no scarf boy are we making thug hit different you see the key to making good content is to impress your viewers with exceptional skill and ability like for example hitting this ramp and getting some sick air stunts or flying under this pier without touching a pillar it's like I'm dark Viper au speedrunning my way to a better future we arrived at the yacht and it's the most disgusting yacht I've ever seen mine's better you know what I actually want to buy my own super yacht in real life that'd be some fire content I looked it up and I'm going to need about 91 million dollars to buy something like this if each one of you donated a hundred and eighty two dollars I could buy it and look I don't ask for much just a super yacht that's literally all I'm asking for some people want world peace some people want their parents to get back together I just want one or two super yachts anyway it's really hard to recognize who's a threat and who's not but using my professional judgment I figure it out we steal the coke and escape no worries Maddie gets the Platinum medal and honestly I'm feeling like a G like as useless as the G and lasagna she keeps beating us at video games and I'm pretty sure that's illegal and Q shot of us smoking because emphysema is overrated and Cosby then jabs me in the neck because he's a troubled teen and then Robo pulls out a rocket launcher and explodes us all I feel like with GTA it's just a waiting game to see how long it takes for everyone to start wasting each other with us it's generally pretty quickly after a good 15 minutes of slaying each other we continue with Trevor's heist the plan is to pretend to be garbage men and garbage robbers I opted for a hoodie under my high-vis vest because I'm a thug the lost are moving their narcotics via trash bags we arrived and as an Australian it's actually pretty strange seeing how the American garbage system works you say in our country we use a yellow bin for recycling a red one for rubbish and when we want to get high we just don't and instead make sensible life choices or sniff bath salts okay this is an immersive mission but I keep having my immersion broken because Crosby keeps saying I'm basically a garbage man in real life because my youtube channel is trashed Wow that hurts coming from a guy called Crosby seven eight eight five mission complete and your boy got platinum World Order is restored and candid shot of us smoking I'm pretty sure rock star is subliminally messaging its player base at this point Oh Crosby punches me again and yep you guessed it Robo fires a rocket launcher at the ground destroying everyone do you think these random acts of violence are just his way of calling out to us that he needs help like his life is just a monotone as spiral as he wakes up every morning with no direction while rain clouds pepper him with flavorless discontent as he keeps moving but not forward it's more like circles chasing life's tail until one day he realizes it's not life's tail he's been chasing but it's his own anyway my new car is actually so sick and it's red it might not be the fastest but she goes hard mate she goes hard we have a quick house party because leaving a balanced lifestyle is important but then it's back to the hustle we've got to go and raid the lost motorcycle clubs trailer park in trailer parks I guess they don't say what are you doing step bro they just say what are you doing bro we arrived at Trevor's residence which is nice and nostalgic he has a bunch of silenced weapons for us in his trailer I think this is what the rest of the world imagines a classic American garage would be like we take a boat over to the trailer park because this is a stealth mission and everyone knows black boats make stealth missions seem more legit it's a cold night out and I only have a t-shirt on I really should have brought a scarf with me said every simp ever I love Grand Theft Auto it's one of my favorite game series of all time but JTA and stealth missions go together about as well as a 2003 pinot noir paired with a pan-seared portrayal soul with winter vegetables I looked up bad wine pairings and that came up all right I'm just trying to bring in some high-class references to the channel so yeah in a nutshell the first Maddy alerted the guards what an idiot and then stealth Oh Robo alerted the guards what an idiot then I lined up a really sweet headshot but due to extremely unlucky circumstances I hit a gas cylinder that was perfectly positioned behind my target and I alerted the guards honest mistake then Robo alerted the guards again what an idiot he then had the audacity to go afk and just get himself some food during a mission so I had to defend him while he ate in real life Maddy and Crosby were busy delivering the vans so here I am fighting off an army of bye keys I then went down to the beach putting myself in an awful position basically experiencing firsthand how the Allies felt during d-day not ideal I'll tell you that much a bloody Robbie man I just hope the cereal he ate was delicious so this was all worth it a mission passed and I don't want to talk about it I almost ranked below him and he was afk anyone feel like smoking I could really use a cigarette all of a sudden I then decide I want to throw a party on my yacht it cost millions so I'm obviously going to milk it for content I'm a youtuber on my way to the yacht some guy fires a rocket launcher at my Tesla and I end up crushing him against his SUV take that vid go he proceeds not to take that and comes after me on his flying motorbike I decide to be the bigger man here and tried to make peace with him he crashed lands and I have ample opportunity to gun him down but as this is an educational channel I want to educate at least to someone out there in the art of forgiveness well I killed him so I guess he needs to forgive me which he does not he tries to get revenge and an npc runs him over he continues to hunt me down and it really doesn't go well the problem is I need to get out to my yacht so I can have my party but it'll be extremely vulnerable when I'm moving in the water I decide to send it and for a brief moment with the wind in my sails I feel like I've done it and kidding he had some heat-seeking missiles which I've now learned beta sailboat eventually I arrived at my yacht and he tries to sneak up off the radar but I show him who's boss I have a laser cannon too cheap I then invite everyone in the server to my yacht party and to my pleasant surprise no one comes so I get drunk by myself and this is quite immersive as it mirrors my real life except there's no yacht so it's just a bit of loneliness wow I need to stop making these jokes or people might think I'm being held captive and being forced to make these videos against my will Maddi then happens to find a bunch of Legends who were surprisingly relaxed and so we head over to my yacht and have the epic gamer party wow it's getting weird how often I'm in this hot tub with a bunch of dudes I changed the yacht setting so that we have to wear clothes in the hot tub to keep this family friendly and yeah all in all why did I buy this King yacht thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
