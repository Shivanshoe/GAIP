it's been a while since i've played gta online but i'm ready to make memories again the sun is shining and a new update just released featuring dr dre who used to date m m or something before we check it out i realize i need some ammunition and weapons and so i drive down to one of my local stores as i walk in the clerk gives me a friendly wave guns and a great attitude how wholesome as i leave the store i realize i've been set up an oppressor mk1 a congelly tank an oppressor mk2 a toriyata and an apc if i'm careful and calculated i should be able to take these big girls down meet thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so i spend 2 million dollars on the new music producer building for this update you have to do these missions in public lobbies so it's going to be red hot as i arrive i'm immediately gunned down by some dodgy malacca who's guarding the entrance i take the high road and shoot them in the face with a scoped rifle and then send him a message saying suck on days nuts you can't afford to be soft in the rap game i walk into my new building and old man franklin welcomes me to the industry with open arms lamar's here too it's like a story mode reunion you love to see it knock knock my politically incorrect racial epithets what that do the building itself is impressive with multiple levels and great views i even paid extra for this apartment that comes with this big ass television but it's nowhere near as glorious as the tcl tv hi my name's modest pelican and i'd like to present to you the tcl tv 75 inches of 8k ultra hd mini led quantum dot technology and hdr 10 plus in other words the picture quality on this bad boy will have you going outside and complaining that the real world is low resolution that's what i maxed enhanced with dolby vision gets you as you can see here i put cameras in stealth omado's bathroom so we can watch him shower i thought we're going to go with the nature documentary it's got built-in speakers and a subwoofer for dolby atmos surround sound best of all for us gamers it's got a variable refresh rate of up to 120 hertz when gaming on this tv your frames are gonna be higher than i am from 8pm onwards it comes with google tv so i can pair it with my phone hey google play my funniest youtube video i'm sorry but none of your videos are funny the tcl and i are giving away one of these tvs so click the link in the description to see how you can enter or buy one for yourself tcl inspire greatness so yeah this building's got a very young money cash money vibe about it i feel as if my low quality pelican logo takes the shine off the hustle feng shui but it is what it is the absolute best thing about it is that chop hangs out here you can pat him in everything it's exactly what we all wanted i decided to look through my telescope as nothing says world star hip-hop like appreciating the various star constellations i then noticed something very strange it seems to be stealth omado contemplating life he then proceeds to throw himself off the bridge onto the highway the next time you're drinking a glass of water pour some out for our homie unfortunately suicidal deaths are silly and fun in gta so we can now prepare for business we sit at either end of the table to demonstrate how serious we are the screen is literally shaking because of oppressor missiles good old public lobbies i sit down at my computer and pick a mission vehicle recovery i was getting ready to spit a hot 16 but i guess being a repo man is just as good outside of the agency there's an absolute bloodbath which is unironically great for our image as we're about to leave some dude called salty oz wants to get into our car i decide to be kind but the cheeky boy had a 5 star wanted level which we now have due to being associated with him this is the most betrayed i've ever been in my life and i was a high-ranking soviet officer during world war ii when germany deceived us he can't trust anyone anymore naturally i dump him on the highway while he dies a painful death i'd like to take a moment to appreciate stealth omado he's been in a hundred of my videos and is cute as heck love you bro alright enough cutesy let's steal this car we infiltrate the facility and there's some scientists cowering pathetically we burn them alive as no good music albums ever release without several people suffering do you know how many people are del waterboarded in the lead-up to her latest album so that she could empathize with their pain and channel that emotion into harmonious song 30 people 30 people suffered so that we could listen to inspirational music i'm finally beginning to understand this industry we steal this truck and i believe there are monkeys in those crates but don't quote me on that i'm not really sure it's not like it's my job to pay attention to the smaller details while recording footage as we're making our getaway i figure i better get into my deluxo so i can escort mado this random lad called pikia dave then decides that he's going to give us a helping hand he just starts pushing mato along the highway and i can barely keep up pakia dave's got real desire but even more impressively he's got a dump truck i'm not joking dave's thick as hell keep it up dave we've gotta do a few rudimentary missions before we get to the main course and our next job is saving one of our associates as we're rolling out a helicopter flies overhead which is sketchy although at least it's not an emotional teenager on an oppressor who's projecting his parents recent divorce onto us via heat-seeking missiles mato and i spot an opportunity to finesse the man we wait for him to run up to our car and hop in and then at that moment we sprint for his chopper alien eddie 3000 will be curling up in the shower crying and talking to his therapist about what happened here today it'll be his vietnam we land the chopper save the high value target and then when escaping thick dave comes back and proceeds to hydrate my helicopter which normally i'd be pretty psyched about but in this case it leads to a violent death i love where dave's head is at and i'm especially fond of his virtual booty but i do what i have to do kill them both and find a new lobby sometimes chop takes naps on the various pieces of furniture around the agency what can't this pooch do what a king we're now able to start the big boy missions and i also realize you can get the receptionist to call you in a chopper franklin has organised a round of golf with dr dre himself dr dre has achieved so much in his life i mean the man discovered eminem and 50 cent and now he's in grand theft auto 5 playing virtual golf with stealth omado and thick man talk about a career highlight dr dre i'm sure you're watching this and i'm just wondering why i didn't get signed to aftermath entertainment after i dropped that rap song a couple of years ago in my shit's height can't get hit up on a battlefield or in real life with a kd boy but it's all right fabian talk tough but he on fortnite you know everybody knows that that is a classic essential album mato and i decide to wear matching golf attire which we find way too amusing nothing says fire bars like matching pink polos and baby blue snapbacks let's get it dr dre is disgruntled because these posh daddy's money's boys want to kick him out of the club so we'll say we'll help with franklin sitting next to me in the golf cart it just feels so nostalgic so you might be thinking how do we plan on ensuring dre doesn't get kicked out of the club as franklin asked us not to kill anyone so are we going to have a serious conversation about ethics or perhaps taking legal action and sorted out in the court system well as it turns out mata has his own way of negotiating we also beat the other guy to death with our clubs on the pr which would be much cooler if we weren't dressed like wendy's employees thick man looks like he just disappointed his parents sorry i didn't mean to kill him dr dre is so impressed that he wants to work with us we decide to celebrate by riding the roller coaster mato however ends up in quite the predicament this is metaphorical though as it's just like the emotional rollercoaster of life sure you might not be in your seat where you should be but it's okay to be different although being different may see you ostracized from society and lead to depression and eventually a truly awful death the moral of the story is don't be different and instead be a slave to trends i should really start doing motivational talks at schools we hop back into my deluxo and fly back to the agency it's crazy how bad we were at grand theft auto when i started this youtube series compared to the absolute gods we are i thought now was gonna be really cool and i thought it was good i did the same thing bro why i panicked some of dre's unreleased music has been stolen and he's decided that we're the firm to steal it back for him chop then walks out and straight up dies i was genuinely upset by this but it turns out he was just high chop chopped himself a bowl and punched a few cones seriously what can't this pooch do and to figure out where the stolen music is we need to break into the fib building it seems quite drastic breaking into a government agency but we need to ensure the album launch party is a great time a fun fact that almost no one knows i actually might be the first youtube channel to show this easter egg off but fib isn't just random letters it's a clever play on words and a parody of the real government agency known as homeland security we seamlessly break in while the download happens we need to fight off waves of fib agents i just smoke because moto pulled out a grenade launcher and kept killing them before i could do anything the smoking is a great habit and against popular belief is actually good for you that's why i'd like to thank today's second video sponsor malbro introducing the new fun-sized sigis for toddlers in a new range of goofy colors of course i'm joking but melbourne you should probably send me some money we now have a lead on the stolen music i sit down at my desk and log on and notice that our company name is f clinton and partner i guess we're a partner and my god did franklin do us dirty with the branding he's so lucky there's no option to kill him in the single player story alright go and do that now marto had to go and do something in real life probably to bang a really hot model or cure some rare neurological disease or something impressive i decide to use this opportunity to head over to franklin's house as our new partner in the business venture it's wise that i vet him properly he really is an old man now check out the family car for his kids it also looks like he's bought them the best toys ever nine buckets and seven beach bowls i guess he shops in bulk i proceeded to take a usb drive from his patio table that has some music track on it i'm trespassing and stealing music which is a questionable choice as it's the entire reason dre is so pressed i guess that's what you get when you refer to thick man as partner marto comes back six minutes later and we prepare to follow the lead to a local nightclub it's unclear why he's driving a hearse i only really became aware of this when i started editing the footage maybe it's because he murders vagina not sure if that makes sense but to my 5.6 female demographic if a guy picked you up for a date in a hearse would you a giggle and give him a smooch or b have consensual physical relations right there in the coffin wagon let me know in the comments we moved through the nightclub garage being as stealthy as we can which really isn't that stealthy mato really wants to do the dj emote but he can't figure it out so i just start shooting their toilet paper supply if we can't find the stolen music then at least we'll win the war of attrition we steal the security tape which should guide us to our next clue also mato finally found the dj emote this is surely the content you guys like and subscribe for we now must get to a yacht that's quite far out to sea the sun is setting and i'd be lying if i said this wasn't a little bit romantic as we approach the vessel we decide to attempt an exciting knife only challenge it goes horribly wrong the resistance is strong but we do our absolute best to eliminate every single person that seems threatening the craziest thing about this mission is that it isn't fiction these missions were based off real events dr dre actually had his music stolen and then had his boys ready yacht to get proof of the theft his boys then escaped on jet skis and made their way to the airport where they stole a cargo plane they then did barrel rolls over the city to make men women and children smile which ended racism and then they flawlessly landed the plane outside his production studio this all actually happened it's crazy enough with the history lesson though it's time to steal the song back we put on matching outfits again and make our way to the casino there's a party happening and we need to infiltrate the premises undercover we reach the right floor and then i notice something strange it's my cleaning lady that cleans my casino penthouse apartment she's only pretending to clean though just like i'm pretending this isn't the start of an adult film that i watched last night and cleaning ladies really get me going i think i just value the way they fastidiously cleanse entire buildings the party is pumping and we seamlessly blend in by standing close to each other and holding hands so that everyone knows we're bros and not dr dre's soldiers we then aggressively punch beers and throw the bottles on the ground so that everyone knows that although we're not straight out of compton we are straight up littering everywhere might not have grown up in the hood but i haven't recycled since 2017. call me lil lady little bug mato then straight up grabs the laptop without overthinking it which kind of undervalues this entire covert operation we're running this inevitably leads to a massive shootout it was a highly stressful and chaotic situation and the poor cleaning lady was caught in an unavoidable crossfire we flee to the car park and fortunately there's luxury vehicles everywhere mato proceeds to choose a blue prius as he thinks it's what dre would have chosen we deliver the stolen bag to the agency and we saved the day well actually there's still two more copies of the stolen song but we'll cross that bridge later easy 120 000 though and i've been making money this whole time so i decided to invest into a brand new astron i mostly got it because it's such a great replica of the real life porsche maycan i get it modified and go for my favorite red paint and yeah this update seems really good i'm going to go and visit my family finally after about a year or so so i'll be away for a few weeks i love you guys and i can't tell you how much i appreciate the support on the videos i don't really concern myself with numbers but we just hit 1.5 million subscribers which is absolutely crazy to me thank you so much and merry christmas i'll see you in the new year [Music]
