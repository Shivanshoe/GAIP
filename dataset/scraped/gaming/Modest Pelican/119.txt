[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with Red Dead online if you enjoy this content please drive around in an ice-cream van but instead of playing whimsical chimes just play the audio from my videos if anyone in the neighborhood complains feel free to abduct them at your own discretion as this really helps spread the good word of my channel so I spawn in and immediately make the matura decision that today I'm going to get fat I've spent my entire Red Dead career looking like an intermittent fasting glue sniffer on a juice cleanse and frankly I've had enough oh and I'm also going to get myself a new horse because sometimes it's nice to treat yourself anyway you might be thinking hey Pelle aren't you just using the exact same concept from your GTA san andreas video and trying to pass it off as original content well yes yes I am I ride over to the town of Rhodes the most forgiving place on earth the seriously I've slaughtered the residents of this place dozens of times I stock up on excessive canned goods like a panicking boomer and head outside to start chowing down I just spent my entire bank balance on this but no regrets you've got to shoot your shot to my dismay after consuming a considerable amount I am as slim as ever how incredibly anticlimactic you know what they say though if at first you don't succeed give up immediately but no I made a promise to you guys and I won't let you down yes I really did just try to act like I was doing you a favor by getting fat and honestly I probably will let you down in the future and it will probably be quite frequently so my next strategy is to hunt animals and eat their mate which should be a surefire way to stack on the pounds I already have a bunch of row mate that I've been carrying around in my satchel for months lol Salmonella so I head back to camp to cook it up it's so wholesome just cooking over the fire like this notice how I eat the meat right off the knife because fun fact the plate wasn't invented until the fall of 2017 only three years ago I've actually been working on this new invention called the tiny Trident which could be used to pick up food I really need to paint in that soon so yes 16 kilograms of meat later and I still the body of a malnourished orphan it's time to up the stakes literally and figuratively I've got to bring in the big guns the best Red Dead online player on the oceanic circuit right now I've got to bring in stealth amato he's just by himself fishing in the rain and if that isn't the most heartwarming thing you've seen this week then you genuinely have no soul actually if any of my 6.7% female demographic are seeking a husband let me know and I'll put in a good word for you you could be the next mrs. stealth Amato's he is currently in a relationship of about seven years but home-wrecking is such an underrated power play all right it's time to pull our focus back to getting fat I decide to hunt some crocodiles and day to them which actually reminds me of a funny story I was at a water park the other day and this girl asked me if I wanted to go on a date and I was like yeah sure but just letting you know I'm an epic gamer and she said she didn't date gamers but then I proceeded to Naruto run around her in circles quite fast and she was like wow that was quite fast and then she said yes now she'd go on a date with me I then said sorry I don't date gold diggers and everyone at the water park clapped and cheered my name as I was leaving a crocodile leapt out of lazy lagoon and ripped her head clean off as I watched on in horror as the rowdy crowd only cheered louder I ended up going home with a model who said she'd give me a risky premarital but when we got to her house she had a twin sister and naturally I got confused and ended up ploughing their dad anyway I'm really struggling to get fat here as I can't quite comprehend how fast my boy's metabolism is we try and find a herd of buffalo or something but are not successful and so decides to change tactics we will learn cache hunting bounty targets and then buy bulk biscuits and candies it seems mato has picked a legendary bounty and a cutscene plays which gives me PTSD flashbacks of all the times I forgot to take the frozen food out of the freezer as a kid harsh but fair parenting it seems the man lives in the swamps now and he goes to shake martos hand and it's like come on mate do you not watch the news we try to make the arrest but he Swampert roofies us suddenly we are tripping out and all the animals are massive if there's one thing I know about hallucinogenics it's that you should not take them minutes before your nephews third birthday party I then see a large parrot and naturally I try to destroy it as parrots are just colorful pelicans with pathetically small beaks while I'm distracted Swamp man proceeds to do me dirty with his machete what a dick I shoot this guy in the head with a bow and arrow for no reason and then find and capture old mate swampy I love how you have the option to hit them when they're tied up on the back of your horse but it would be hotter if it wasn't optional I mean what I take him back to Saint Denis the sheriff's like yeah now yeah now yeah cheers big girl and bam we're thirty dollars richer and QS cinematic shot of us standing by the lake motto so tragically drowned in earlier you love to see it also Maddy has joined us which is great as we now have a real crew going on here she's wearing a pink dress and has a unicorn helmet on her horse if I didn't actually know her personally I'd be certain this was a catfish it's almost too much also bounty hunters keep hunting me because I'm quite a wanted man but not in a positive lustful way it's more of a they want to hang me for my malicious crime sort of way my horse dies because it's an idiot it's actually useless so I jump on the back of Maddie's unicorn and ever so gently place my hands on her waist to ensure I don't fall off and scrape my knees I'm really sorry but I had to put safety above family-friendly content if you're being upset by these graphic scenes please look away Wow I just can't okay so Maddie says she looked it up on Reddit aka the most reliable source of information on the Internet and the good people of reddit said I just need to eat lots of mates like literally tons of mate this means we'll have to go on the biggest hunt Red Dead online has ever seen the first though I tried to lasso this guy up for a laugh but he's apparently got the fastest trigger finger in the West I'm not mad I'm impressed I then jump on the back of Matos horse again gently placing my hands on his waist and are you really bros if you haven't jet we placed your hands on each other's waists before I'm going to say no way Jose it's now time for the great hunt where we will gather so much meat that I'll eat my way to thickness and people will talk about this hunt for years and years the great hunt of Red Dead online where every single animal became endangered in one night mato then says he has to go to bed which comes in at number 1 on watch mojos list of top 10 anime betrayals he then throws a dead bird at my head which we both find highly amusing for some reason needless to say I take him leaving relatively well I clearly don't have deep underlying abandonment issues and yes I guess this is the first time I've ever been alone with a girl so exciting times for your boy the hunt is on and we are really about to go hard while hunting I asked Maddie what else she's been playing and she said the Simms I love the Simms it's so relatable like your baby gets taken by Family Protective Services your wife drowns in the ladder less pool you haven't slept in four days so you go to take a relaxing shower but you can't find your dick and trust me it's not there I once used a cheat to get rid of the Sims privacy pixelation effect and it's a grim situation down there but a relatable one so yeah we hunt like absolute crazy I've never spent this long gathering resources before but finally though it's time to faced well firstly I cook each bit of individual meat on my knife it takes a long time but we end up with about 100 kilograms of cooked meat I then ate all of it in one go and to my absolute disbelief my body fat proceeds to stay exactly the same I go and check my stats and I kid you not it says I'm underweight either I don't understand calorie intake or my game is glitched unfortunately Maddie has a solution for me and I think there's a lesson to be learned here whenever you're unhappy with the part of your body and you want to change it just don't you're perfect and beautiful just the way you are and kidding get plastic surgery which is what I proceeded to do I also add a beard because if your dad doesn't have a beard you have two mums said the guy who can barely grow a beard in real life finally though I've done it I'm a thick boy and I guess we can conclusively say eating excessive food does not make you fat but from what I read it definitely should have and now though I need a new horse luckily Matty knows a way to make a quick buck and that is by finding expensive bracelets my horse is still deceased so look away kids there's going to be a lot more gentle holding of the lower waist but this time I'm hella thick so it's even more intimate we travel far and wide finding all eight of these bracelets it's quite an expedition but finally we arrived at madam nurses house and tell her the collection a BAM 271 dollars in the bank this is huge as I can now afford an Arabian stallion I have been riding around on big day for months I really should have upgraded by now as I'm pretty sure it would be faster for mato and I to just take turns riding each other like horses so there he is the red chestnut Arabian what a beautiful base I appropriately named him bigger D I had outside excited and ready to meet him for the first time unclear why I didn't ride out on him but whatever I just whistle and he jogs on over you can imagine my disappointment when scrawny nag appears and so I'm so mad I punch it right in the stomach like a boss and then I punch it in the face because I'm actually off the rails and the toughest guy in Australia Maddie then shoots it for me and yet I realize I simply forgot to equip the saddle to bigger days so that's my bad violence against scrawny nags MP gaming says no the important thing is I'll finally be able to gallop for more than 6 meters I've barely processed my purchase before this guy starts opening fire on Maddie and so naturally I lasso him and he receives the shotgun to the face this kicks off quite an engagement and you might be thinking wow this game is so toxic and I can see why but no even these seemingly incredibly violent encounters are so wholesome I messaged Ellis one of the guys we were fighting with and he was a top bloke and a subscriber and this game is just all rainbows and lollipops the so yeah we did it we became thick men wait I don't think I can call my character thick man in my Hitman jti 5 and Red Dead videos but I mean dad asked though thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
