call of duty when i was in high school this was my life i'd get home from a long day fire up my xbox and then proceed to get into abusive screaming matches with people i didn't know it was a simpler time it was a gratifying time and it was most definitely a racially insensitive time maybe i'm just being a nostalgic boomer who's looking back on the past with rose tinted glasses but i can't help how i feel i mean for goodness sake i have over 2 billion wins in modern warfare 2. okay a kid from school modded my account but the point is life was good and that kid went on to become a pastor he used to charge five dollars to prestigious accounts and now the malacca charges five dollars to get into heaven his life took a pretty strange turn just like my enjoyment of this franchise i still love gaming just as much as i did back then but cod isn't quite the same anymore i'm not sure if it's me who changed or the game maybe you guys feel similar or maybe you don't but let's take a look at call of duty cold war i mean black ops 4. i mean world war ii i mean vanguard anyway they got t-paine to host the launch event pre-order pre-load [Applause] like the video the single player the call of duty campaigns are actually a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine you start off as a soldier on a top secret mission i immediately tried to jump from one train to the other but ended up getting brutally crushed underneath a quote about perspective then appeared on my screen to make my self-inflicted death feel more meaningful i then spray an lmg into the german houses because if i'm getting shot constantly then so are they surprisingly there was no censorship of the german propaganda luckily i'm here to censor it though so no one's feelings get hurt going forward stealth omado's head will be the new symbol now when people see mato in the street they'll subconsciously associate his presence with fascism it actually really tilts me the way pop culture portrays world war ii history it was a world defining war that had such an impact on the international landscape you always hear about the allies and the access powers but never the quick scoping big dick boys that really turned the tide the next mission we took on the role as a paratrooper one of my friends who was on fire selfishly burnt my parachute and i fell to the ground and became isolated from my unit this led to a stealth section where i witnessed several war crimes eventually i met up with my unit and we decided to go and win the war ourselves have you ever heard about those high-ranking military officials who sent thousands and thousands of men to certain death for the greater good of the country well now you get to be one of those high-ranking officials as you tell the lads to run directly at a fortified german position probably should have thrown a smoke grenade or attempted a flank using the thick vegetation to our left as cover but where's the fun in that i feel like cod is trying to see how many war crimes they can fit into each single player experience these days i'm guessing the bonuses for their staff are directly correlated to how many war crimes are in the game if the developers want to get a christmas bonus then we better see a lot of germans getting cooked to death by white phosphorus we destroy the enemy artillery and now the boys can successfully land on the beach now have you ever wanted to play as a young russian woman great because now you can in this next mission i pour myself a cup of coffee as i sit around the table with my family talking about communism vodka and further lowering the age of consent my silly brother forgot his molotov cocktails so my first objective is to bring them to him on my way out i noticed this malacca trying to get a couch up the stairs by himself i'm sure he's stressed due to the war but that's no reason to not lift with your legs no one likes a hero playing this mission shocked me as this town is actually really nice there are market stores selling fresh produce and warm personalities everywhere i always thought russia was just people with no teeth wearing adidas tracksuits and sharing the little wealth they had equally amongst their peers i think i could have quite happily lived in soviet russia i give my brother the molotovs and then head to work via some stereotypical russian rooftop parkour this seems more unnecessary than the guy lifting the couch incorrectly but eventually i arrive at my workstation it's at this moment the german air force arrives and it becomes immediately apparent that this isn't some midsummer air show they are here to brutally murder everyone as my comrades get mowed down around me it's quite clear that we are all doomed then i remember that we have a fighting chance because i gave my brother a dozen molotov cocktails we should be fine i end up getting bombed and the game tells me to flee from the bombing more quickly which seems like questionable english but is surprisingly grammatically correct i end up making at home but my dad has been mortally wounded by the germans this scene is quite emotional but surprisingly makes me feel a lot better as i finally found someone with a bigger nose than me i kill like 10 000 germans for revenge and i guess it just goes to show they didn't need overly complicated tactics to beat germany they just needed one angry russian woman who probably hasn't been laid in a while the next mission we play as a us pilot on a counter-attack following pearl harbor it actually looked really cool coming out of the clouds and seeing all the squadrons in formation we proceeded to bomb the japanese aircraft carriers in what was one of the most crucial wins for america in the war japan can take comfort in knowing that this is as bad as it gets for them well at least for about four years or so i end up crashing in the jungle and decide it's time to check out the zombie game mode so you have to pick a loadout and i go with the shotgun because i'm a big guy i get matched up with a clan called quiz and they all seem pretty chill we're not on voice comms but we do the sacred tea bagging ritual which cements an instant bond between us for me zombies has always been a smoke game mode there's nothing better than rolling a joint and seeing how deep you can go in a session of zombies with the boys so that's what i did well i didn't actually roll a joint i vape my weed now because it's healthier and i want to make sure i don't die before the next call of duty release you see i managed to get a medicinal marijuana prescription so my plug is now just my local chemist i'm secretly hoping i get pulled over and drug-tested just so i can wave the piece of paper in the police officer's face while singing you can't catch me my old plug was my hairdresser it was amazing i'd go and kill two birds with one stone getting a fresh cut and whatever else i needed one day i'm sitting there getting a trim and my dealer slash baba asks me if i have any weed he can buy i was like dude i think you're getting our rolls mixed up you're meant to be the one who has it he wasn't joking and just like that my entire town supply of weed was gone mostly due to all the lockdowns so that's why i got a medicinal and i've officially gone way off track here i'm actually not 100 sure why i'm telling this story i played with these quiz guys for around two hours and we got pretty deep into the game i ended up getting 1664 kills and the only time i went down was when the game glitched and i couldn't move either i'm a beast or far more likely they need to make this a bit harder we didn't even die it was just that it was 2am and we decided to voluntarily leave so we could sleep i warn you that i'm going to sound like a nostalgic boomer again but i kind of miss the old zombies just having normal rounds and windows to repair and such let's move on to the meat and potatoes of the franchise a call of duty's multiplayer has taught me many valuable life lessons over the years like to always reload even if you only shot one bullet and have extended max to blame your teammates for any death or loss even if there's nothing they could have done that claymores are a fun piece of equipment as dying to a small anti-personnel mine you can barely see is cool that whenever you accidentally throw a care package off the map it will always have a rare killstreak reward in it that the npc pilots who fly the attack helicopters are bandwagon fans as they'll only come and offer you air support if you get 7 kills in a row and that the voice chat in cod lobbies will never not be hilarious i'm actually so gutted as i got so many recordings of people just screaming at each other but for whatever reason my elgato didn't record game chat i did an accidental speed run of hearing the n-word literally the first lobby i joined before i had even seen the game yet and some degenerate was calling someone else the n-word 12 seconds any percent n-word speed run complete in my opinion the multiplayer is just call of duty it's exactly what you'd expect and that would be fine if it wasn't for skill-based matchmaking i could almost just repeat exactly what i said about last year's game the skill-based matchmaking means i play people who have the exact same skill as me in theory it sounds great but what happens is every game turns into an esports tournament there's never anyone better than you or worse than you everyone is at the exact same level it creates a weird gameplay experience and can get old very quickly when i was a kid i sucked at cod i lay at the back of the map camping my little dick off sniping people one day i got five kills in a row and dropped a predator missile for the first time i felt like the president greenlighting a high target kill in the middle east it was invigorating for once i had not died i had gone on a kill streak and the next day at school i walked into class and told everybody about my predator missile they were quiet at first but slowly everybody in the room began clapping and eventually cheering my hot teacher then flashed me and i was labelled a war hero i may be embellishing this story slightly but the point is personal growth i sucked at cod so i practiced and i got better and then was rewarded for my efforts eventually i learned that checking corners drop shotting playing the objective and breaking up with my girl would make me an even better player and then one day i got a tactical nuke it was the best day of my young life that shit's gone if you change your playstyle to try and improve you simply verse harder opponents and i'm not a fan of that system i think they need a ranked and a social playlist but i'll leave it there that's my rant done i am very excited to see the new warzone map and get back into that it'll probably be like 3 000 gigabytes and i'll have to delete all my other games photos and my incredibly tasteful adult video library a few of you have been asking for a fat tony update he's keeping the weight off which is admirable but he mostly just sleeps all day for a stray cat he's getting pretty friendly as he wants to sit on me quite a bit he actually just follows me around all day anna's been calling him my shadow it's actually really cute we adopted another stray years ago and she hates tony she bullies him so i'm trying to teach tony to stick up for himself but it's challenging trying to teach a small cat to fight might have to get him a tiny knife or something anyway let me know what you think of vanguard gta definitive edition releases soon and i can't wait to get videos out on those otherwise thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy baby [Music]
