[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with far cry 3. if you enjoyed this video please buy a minivan and paint the words modest pelican on the side and then proceed to commit vehicular manslaughter as this really helps spread the good word of my channel in 2004 the original far cry was released i didn't actually ever play it myself i was too young but i did spend hours watching my cousin play it and it taught me a valuable lesson during boring family events it's way more fun to play video games than spend time with your closest blood relatives in 2008 far cry 2 releases where you spend your time slowly dying from malaria which is the gameplay experience we were all asking for this game revolutionized the medical science world if you got shot in the leg chest or head your character would always pull a bullet out of his arm and it really turned what doctors knew about bullet entry wounds on its head honestly one of my favorite games of all time the amount of hours i put into this was obscene in 2012 far cry 3 releases and the series returns to its tropical island roots in this vibrant setting you can hang out around while taking in the sprawling scenery you can jet ski on the enticing blue water and connect with nature as you dip your toes in a little horticulture and if there's time save your closest friends and family from a psychopath pirate leader known as vas who's passionately into murder and torture we're getting ahead of ourselves though let's take this back to the beginning this is more than a game far cry 3 is a damn psychological journey we play as jason brody and have been on vacation with our friends as you can tell by this opening cinematic we're really cool adrenaline junkies and did i mention we're really cool on one of our skydiving jumps we accidentally land on a pirate island which seems like blatant negligence from our skydiving instructor and pilot grant who's also my older brother we immediately learn we've been captured by violent pirates and vas is going through our gopro footage it's honestly kind of sweet that he's taking an interest in my personal life but he's also giving off some pretty unhinged vibes why aren't you laughing now like you did up there what is this not fun anymore have i failed to entertain you grant manages to get his hands untied as the negligence theme continues these pirates should really look into mastering the butterfly knot technique as my bro is military he beats one of the guards to death through the cage and we start our great escape as far as situations go this obviously isn't great and can't lie though vas is one of the best villains gaming has ever seen and quite frankly i'm half hoping he wins we slowly make our way through the compound as we sneak under a wooden bridge our truck then passes over and we proceed to get reasonably covered in mud out of anyone on this island we're truly having the worst day ever even worse than those farmers who are in the process of being publicly executed at least through all of this we have our brother grant he's combat trained and he'll surely guide us through these testing times we sit down with an optimistic attitude and orientate ourselves with the map we're gonna find him we're gonna free the others and then we're going home run forest run never judge a book by its cover because thus gives me 30 seconds to escape which is objectively generous it's an extremely epic pursuit and by falling off a cliff into a river i'm able to get away i awake hours later and this guy dennis which is a strange name for a tribal leader pulled my unconscious body from the water saving my life he shows me around the town making sure to spend a lot of time focusing on all the beautiful tribal women dennis you scoundrel i head down to the gun shop as the clerk really tears down stereotypes got a respect for sunglasses at night inside this big girl is clearly the alpha sorry big d he asks me to climb the radio tower because this is a ubisoft game and therefore you climb towers he also wants me to fight alongside his tribe to defeat vas and he keeps telling me that i have the heart of a warrior dennis really lacks empathy my brother was just brutally murdered in front of me i need therapy not a handgun and uplifting words i reach the top and the nostalgia hits me harder than ever this game is so damn good the people who live here always leave their cars unlocked which is surprisingly trusting given there's a full-fledged tribal guerrilla war going on i drive down the road as i'm still in the hand-holding part of this game where they teach you to hunt gather and breathe i proceed to cap a ball like an absolute boss dennis says that i'm ready to go and then i'll now be accompanying him on a mission to take back a pirate outpost i'm starting to feel like i'm being gaslit into fighting dennis's tribal war i was sort of thinking i'd just hit the beach for 45 and then take off but no let's go commit our first murder his men say they will wait for me to start the attack me with no tactical training and a crappy starter pistol these guys are real [ __ ] at least wiping out vasa's men will make it easier to find my girlfriend my little brother and my mates which i guess is the morally right thing to do i figure stealth is my best option so i sneak around the grass to try and find an angle i come up behind one of the big boppers and drive my machete through his heart it's honestly alarming how easily jason did that my guy is clearly a natural killer but at least i now have an ak-47 every time i play a far cry game i start off trying to be stealthy but it inevitably ends up in a glorious all-out gunfight these pirates are no match for jason's slide cancelling as he almost went pro for call of duty i swear every gamer says they almost went pro for call of duty like [ __ ] man staying up till 3am pub stomping 12 year olds on modern warfare 2 doesn't equate to almost going pro and god it was fun though a sweet time before skill based matchmaking was a thing i can still hear those preview best and teens calling me the hard r because i dropped a nuke on their face and dennis thanks me for the carry and then i set off to find my friends one big element i love about this game is that you don't have to suspend your disbelief at all you're not just some rich tourist who picked up a gun jason is truly terrified at first but the more he kills the more he enjoys it it's like a drug whenever i play games i always have this need to see if you can actually kill the friendlies i proceed to murder an innocent villager which although uncalled for does align with the whole jason brady descending into a sociopath story arc so we're still immersed the time for myth busting and jet skiing is over though let's get to work dennis told me that there's this crazy doctor that lives on top of a hill who may have information on a captured girl probably my girlfriend he also has a really nice residence right by the water with those views even with the war going on this place is only going up in value what a smart buy i rush upstairs and find grant's girlfriend daisy which is hugely disappointing she's a nice girl but he's coming across as kind of needy still she's happy to see me i tell her that vass shot grant in the neck and he died a slow and presumably quite painful death she's really upset about it like it wasn't her older brother that died but okay the doctor says i need to get some mushrooms from the cave downstairs so he can make the life-saving medication she needs i buy myself a bow and arrow from the gun vending machine that all good homes should have and then proceed to go hang gliding because obviously i'm going to go hang gliding first seriously when you're up here it's so easy to practice mindfulness and live in the moment it's as if our brother's widowed girlfriend isn't hours away from dying of dengue fever of course i do eventually go to the cave and pick the mushroom they're plenty full but i only take one which seems incredibly conservative given how long it took me to find these little malaccas i give the mushrooms to the good doctor who i'm 100 certain has a drug problem by the way you should never do hard drugs unless you're at a party or bored speaking of i got my vaccine done i never knew you smoked it out of a glass pipe but the guy with no teeth was very assuring i give daisy a pre-marital arm touch as grant's dead and my girlfriend is probably going to die soon so we might as well start repopulating the island i mean focus all our energy on saving the crew i get some intel from dennis that a beached cargo ship has a radio on board which i could use to find everyone i also got myself a sniper rifle so i can clear outposts out without anyone being alerted there's something so damn satisfying about no one noticing your presence i love that right after i clear these outposts out dennis's boys rock up and then have the audacity to ask me to help with trivial items from the bulletin board honestly dennis can go [ __ ] himself i also just remembered that you banged voss's sister later in the campaign i don't know for certain how that would go down with vas but i can't imagine well he just doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'd sit down with us at brunch and welcome me into the family i reach the ship and hear on the radio that they're keeping my girlfriend and my little brother in a nearby cave so they can make ransom videos so cool that the pirates are taking an interest in vlogging i respect the creative passion filled with optimism i steal a boat and head for the village i run through fields of green grass and cross vast rivers to tell dennis the good news he proceeds to ask me if i can destroy a pirate armory first so that his tribe has an advantage in the war wow unfortunately i can't actually kill dennis he's got that thick plot armor i've already tried several times i go and kill like 20 pirates and destroy the weapon shipment it's exhilarating but feels like a poor use of my time i kind of assumed that after i helped him with that incredibly dangerous mission he'd help me but no i set off to the cave by myself i locate the camp and cave entrance and start doing work i can even hear my girlfriend's voice in the distance and she sounds distressed i've often thought about expanding my youtube business into also ransoming wealthy people it just seems like easy money especially with cryptocurrency leaving less of a paper trail you're a sucker if you're not ransoming someone a couple of friends a few ski masks some gaffer tape an iphone and a serrated kitchen knife and bam you're ready to go i'm modest pelican and i endorse and encourage leveraging people's lives for money i make my way into the depths of the cave and it turns out it's not my girl it's a recording of her this is truly horrific don't get me wrong but given the poor lighting conditions in here they've actually produced a really impressive short film great cinematography i'm then surprise attacked by a corner camper and knocked unconscious guess where i wake up that's right back in vosse's custody with my girlfriend and my brother and he seems pretty motivated to burn us all alive i'm also feeling like he may have skipped breakfast is it going to be damn on me after dosing us all in petrol he throws a match down and sure enough we begin to burn not ideal at all i've really got to start prioritizing not getting captured by vos it's a below average way to spend an afternoon unfortunately he's one for theatrics and over elaborate schemes and i end up falling through the floor and have a chance to escape when you're doing main story missions there's not much player agency i.e i can't abandon my loved ones and save myself so here i am in a flaming house with a weirdly deep basement inhaling way too much smoke i managed to save shorty but it looks like my brother is gone i'm now an only child my parents are going to spoil the heck out of me it's kind of exciting we run away and it's at this moment we start to realize just how fast jason is falling our girlfriend liza is panicking and afraid meanwhile jason is thriving as we escape in a jeep she's pretty shocked that i'm slaughtering our pursuers with a grenade launcher it's honestly coming across as pretty judgmental i've got literal and metaphorical shots being fired at me right now it's highly stressful i take her back to the doctor's house where she plans to stay and rest while i save everybody else i didn't realize i was in an intimate relationship with dennis 2.0 i've been uploading loads of gta content to my other channel papa peli last episode we drove a taxi and kidnapped our clientele it was good clean fun thanks for the support and for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
