[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with Grand Theft Auto if you enjoyed this video please start referring to the imminent World War three as World War Modest Pelican gaming as this would really help spread the good word of my channel seriously this war could be great for my youtube career if we all been together but I'm going to stop memeing potentially devastating world-changing events for a second to say that anyone who's suffering as a result of the Australian bushfires you're an absolute legend everyday I look outside and it's just thick smoke in the sky over 700 million animals have burned firefighters are working day and night with no sleep and homes and lives are being constantly lost any money this video makes will go straight to charities supporting those affected by the disaster so that we can start rehydrating Australia if you want to donate yourself I'll leave a link in the description and in the top comment I know any contribution big or small would help out a lot mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories alright so we're in the middle of the casino heist because we need to make money because money is the true measure of a person's self-worth also you might notice there's no snowfall because our game glitched out or maybe the developers got rid of it because snow is awfully Caucasian where's the black ice where's the yellow snow Wow anyway I head over to meet the lads and then start getting tagged up by a miniature tank that doesn't even show up on the radar the god damnit welcome to Grand Theft Auto online in 2020 worse still it was my mate Crosby who killed me what are you doing step bro apparently they gave this tank out for free on Christmas Day but I unfortunately couldn't play as I was spending time with my annoying clingy family like a chat so yeah tiny tanks that jump around I wish I had one but I don't so I'll do the mature thing and complain about it constantly we head out to Crosby's arcade to get on with the casino heist and currently I have 1 million dollars saved up but I need more the arcade is literally on the other side of the map which was tactically a pretty terrible decision and Crosby also insists that he drives his little hatchback everywhere which I'll admit is a pretty big dick play as girls love having sexual experiences with guys who drive pink and white compact cars but again in regards to the heist it's tactically questionable we arrive at the arcade and start drinking actually being served by the real doctor disrespect how are those limes going for our drinks doctor haha great to hear everyone loves slice to lime hey who's working tomorrow's shift mate No oh cool he's a really great guy in small doses who do you think is a better bartender out of you and roll well your confidence is impressive all right thanks for featuring on my videos see you later man so yeah we've got a lot of planning to do for this heist so we should really crack on and Crosby is the leader and he enjoys abusing his power by changing our outfits mate farmer 47 the overalls say that I really smell but the aviators say that it's just my hands that smell like your girlfriend's vagina well times 2 motto shows me where he sleeps and it's nice I love the way he's used to the rustic packing palettes complemented by bags of trash to give the dark dungeon a softly spoken Petofi oh and so the first heist prep is to get some unmarked weapons I find the first armored truck and blow that sucker open only killing one innocent civilian in the process unfortunately the truck is empty motto finds the truck with the guns and I give him a police escort except I'm wanted by the police and he isn't and if he touches a police car he will instantly get 3 stars and fail so I make a game out of it to where he has to dodge all the police chasing me and get back to the arcade and I think he really appreciates playing this game with me haha what good clean Twain minecraft server fun eventually he finds a way through and we pass the second heist prep is to obtain getaway vehicles now don't say I don't put insane amounts of effort into providing memorable cinematic moments for you look at the way I gracefully rappel down to the street like I was some sort of inverse angel descending onto earth bringing with me the gift of mediocre YouTube content it's meant to be a stealth mission but I'm the kind of guy to go loud when I take a leak I don't aim from the side of the toilet bowl I go straight to the water so the entire house sounds like my Agra falls using my advanced perception skills I identified the getaway vehicle by its vibrant orange colour and the large bobbing arrow heist prep complete Wow we are really great at high sting prep as suddenly all these other online players gather around our group and they don't try to kill us which is a pleasant surprise it's always warming when you can meet people in games that aren't toxic anyway I proceed to send a message to Big Boi day me kindly asking him to kill stealth amato this picado doesn't mean skids did you message him to kill me I think I enjoyed this a little too much but yeah thanks big boy day me also great work asserting your dominance by having the phrase big boy in front of your name very cool motto then takes out his revenge on the big boy himself and also made man we really need to get back to this heist so we can finish before 2021 I respawn opposite a fire station and know exactly what I have to do death by hydration again all firefighters are such brave legends but in Grand Theft Auto the trucks are best to use to powerfully force water into dehydrated players throats this isn't even griefing this is a public service so yeah seriously this time on with the heist and I guess we now have all these guys with us what could possibly go wrong heist prep 3 steal a hacking device that I'm sure will somehow help us rob the casino it's so immersive flying the military chopper across the map like this I mean this dude in the jet featuring a Randy anime girl decal does slightly hamper that immersion factor but anime titties never did anything wrong anime titties are reasonably wholesome so we have to take down the agent who is holding the access card we need I do this and then immediately search his body and start getting shot while I'm stuck in the search body animation like a boss and Crosby and motto save me and it's kind of beautiful as we don't often work well as a team as we cruise to News headquarters I notice Big Boi day me is back in his jet pack watching over us like a guardian angel I love his energy but he's objectively a pretty bad guardian angel as we proceed to all die horrific deaths we grabbed the device I pick up the guy from the anime titty plane we drive back to the arcade I give the anime titty guy a salute for sort of helping us and we complete the mission I then steal myself a vehicle and the dodgy Square puts a $9,000 bounty on me which is ironically extremely helpful as Crosby has no money to even buy ammunition I decide to let him kill me as a noble sacrifice but I demand a ceremony first ceremony our motto would you like to say a few words me what give like a shake in the center we've been a great four out that's the worst ceremony ever okay heist prep set up number 264 steal the vault key cards let me remind you we have to commute from one side of the map to the other every single time it's quite absurd as so the key card is at a hotel room with a guard who has probably booked out the room for the night so that he can read a good historical fiction book in peace the thing I love most about grand theft auto online is that it's the only game on the market that makes you truly feel like spider-man we storm the hotel room and there's a classy lady in here who must be reading a good historical fiction book with him finding a good book club is actually so underrated as reading is extremely beneficial for the mind actually you know what right after I upload I'm booking a hotel room calling a prostitute and hooking into some Charles Dickens classics anyway we want to get this heist er done so we only stop for the shortest swim hotel pools are a great place to cool off and to catch rare tropical infections heist prep complete and Damned we're only making $5,000 per setup mission so I hope the end payout is juicy next up we need to buy masks so no one can recognize us I definitely didn't need to explain why we need the masks but did you know Crosby actually owns this car we didn't steal it it's like an SUV minivan hybrid that he took the time to go out and purchase only reasonably hot stepmoms who wear high heels at inappropriate times and blow their tennis instructors should be able to buy this vehicle there should be a questionnaire you have to fill out at the car dealership and ship of picking a mask is a serious decision and I find the perfect one it's red which is intimidating that has the benefit of not covering thick Mane's impressive jawline motto goes for a paper bag that says please kill me which is cute and trendy and Crosby has like 60 masks because he buys a lot of useless items hence his lack of funds currently and the minivan SUV we literally couldn't be more ready than we are now I mean look at these whiteboards they have lots of pictures on them which means we're doing really well and just kidding heist prep 1420 steal some vault drills this casino heist definitely isn't what I was expecting but I like that they're letting us choose our methods well Crosby is actually making all the decisions well motto and I stand around looking pretty there's conveniently a heist in progress at the fleeca bank and they have exactly what we need vault drills I actually thought of the perfect bank robbery you just to get a job at the bank and then get promoted to a senior executive and then just steal everyone's money through hidden fees that are technically legal I call it doing exactly what senior bank executives are currently doing anyway heist prep complete and hot damn look at thick Mane's posture its outstanding he's not getting lower back pain anytime soon we continue doing heist preps like destroying the casinos security shipments in a chopper we also needed to steal firefighter gear as a disguise which ties in nicely to the theme of this video and Cosby insisted in dressing us up as slaves and then a guy joined our game and pulled out a rocket launcher so I shot him several times I love making friends but you were holding an RPG and your name is literally betrayed 1 2 3 3 8 0 1 it doesn't really give off a best friend forever vibe we get the fire engine and it all goes really well right up until I get the truck perfectly stuck behind a trade a Crosby and motto were less than impressed but this whole truck getting stuck incident acts as a metaphor for life sometimes a guy called modest Pelican or Jeff will screw you over but occasionally you will get out of that predicament and emerge stronger and then complete your life mission or some man that was an exceptional metaphor I should write a book as so eventually the lads get the truck out and we've done almost all the heist prep missions meaning next video we should be rubbing the actual casino and getting paid look at me building hype for the next video like a bonafide youtuber thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
