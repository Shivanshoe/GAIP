[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with the last of us part two if you enjoy this content please have many babies name the modest Pelican gaming and then put them up for adoption as this really helps spread the good word of my channel are the Last of Us a game franchise loved by people everywhere this sequel should be a slam dunk and oh my god three point six out of ten that's lower than my girlfriend standards but hey the critics gave at nine point five out of ten so I'm glad to say that there isn't a disconnect between the actual players and the critics anyway I load in and of course I'll avoid any major spoilers the best I can but I am you know playing the game so I start as Joel who's out patrolling and I like how he's taking a guitar around with him instead of a gun I might not be able to defend myself with bullets but maybe I can serenade the zombies with some family-friendly Christian music this is the city I live in and it's a safe zone from the undead speaking of I can't wait to get out there and start butchering them as killing zombies is good fun just kidding we're actually going to play the guitar this game really makes you feel like you're a guy playing a guitar 10 out of 10 IGN all right now we're le I guess and she's sniffing her clothes I do that too but it's usually other people's clothes and they usually don't know I'm doing it also Ellie is 19 years old now so there's going to be a lot of inappropriate erotic fan fiction written about her pretty weird to think about but at least we'll all have something to read I go and meet up with my main girl and as I'm chatting to her some kid throws a snowball at me well the absolute nerve of this little melaka how do I pull out my gun and shoot these rascals seriously I think I could easily get away with it I just bite their forearm afterwards and tell the rest of the town that a zombie got to them so I had to do it before they turned Shore zombie apocalypses have their downsides but child murder has never been this easy it's time to go on patrol as we need to find Joel he's lost look I'll be the one to say it but it's frankly pretty disgusting that they've stolen the concept of horses from red Redemption everyone knows Rockstar invented horses and I think it's just a blatant creative theft it's frankly more careless than Ellie leaving her backpack slightly open you think not properly utilizing your zip makes you cool why don't going forward we all just use our backpacks the way God intended and stop risking having our possessions fall out onto the ground big girl well searching this outpost I find some interesting discoveries a few parts I can use for upgrades a spectacular view of the mountain and all my days the only thing more dangerous than an infected beast trying to eat your face is Mary Joanna the guns don't kill people Wade kills people instantly I have two sisters and growing up they used to watch this TV show called The Saddle Club I sort of feel like I'm playing The Saddle Club except I don't remember the episode where a moose was disemboweled so that his blood contrasted horrific aliy against the cold white snow I think for its cause of death I'm going to take an educated guess and say natural causes that's how I want to go I decide I better test to see how Dina here reacts under pressure so I fire my rifle inches from her head and she barely flinches I'm glad to say I'm rolling with a truly ruthless psychopath here but that sure was a waste of ammo which is extremely scared we make our way into the supermarket and what do we have here who's the hungry boy as cute as this little famished critter is it's time to do what we do best kill some zombies Ellie is actually very good at killing as it turns out initially I was thinking it was pretty irresponsible sending two nineteen-year-olds out into the world with a handful of bullets between them when there's an entire fortress full of older more experienced people but hey Ellie do be kind of thick in regards to her appetite for adventure I find this employee-of-the-month bored and in July this dog won imagine working hard and then your manager picks her dog over you and that's such a current move trying to be humorous but instead undermining your entire workforces confidence and feeling of self-worth I arrived at the hardest encounter yet an intricate stealth section featuring a much more challenging mutation of zombi known as a clicker I decide to forego any stealth and instead showed the world how truly badass I am at defeating a horde of this size with brute force this will demonstrate that I am the alpha leader capable of one day leading my community to victory just kidding see you later oesophagus we decide to get out of here because a blizzard is rolling in and so we slide off the roof this again demonstrates Elly's incredibly careless decision making as falls like this can inflict irreversible joint damage the blizzard only gets harsher and then Dana rides away leaving me stranded in the forest like I was an illegitimate unloved child well the next time I see her I'm going to aim my rifle directly at her head I will get my revenge and it will be brutal oh she comes back to find me thanks I never doubted your loyalty we decide to post up in this abandoned library this actually brings back some pretty scary IRL memories for me I once decided to have a risky FAP on a library computer because my wife I was down and let's just say the majority of librarians aren't good at saying the funny side of things hopefully we can find some useful supplies in here some food maybe an upgrade for my gun hell even a good historical fiction novel to satisfy my hunger to expand my brain or you know a giant weed farm damn if our lives weren't in grave danger from aggressive zombies not to mention the threat of desperate humans we could totally light one up right now best to do the responsible thing though and stay so that Elie and Dana proceed to immediately get banked which I mean just wow remember Joel he loves you like a daughter he's lost out there but at the same time this weed has been alleged so it's a pretty challenging ethical decision fast forward months later and my lover and I decide to ride for Seattle as we need some space honestly I'm starting to feel quite emotionally suffocated and so I decide to put her down not the horse Dana the game won't let me shoot her though which I guess is reasonable as that would be a pretty extreme DIY plot twist alright then it looks like it's back to being a brave adventurer this actually looks incredibly cool seeing a highway like this being engulfed by nature it offers a visionary look into what the world might look like if civilization all but stopped we arrived at the border and there's a sign that says trespassers will be killed on sight Wow I wasn't expecting a welcome cuddle but that's a real emotional slap in the face I feel like whoever wrote that sign needs to take a long hard look in the mirror and consider how their provocative graffiti messages can affect others while exploring Seattle we come across an old music store which is the throwback to the old way of life at this point my brother-in-law came into my study and was like yo is that that new zombie game I heard about I was like yeah check it out but made the mistake of interacting with this guitar I found on the ground Ellie proceeds to play the 1984 hit song take on me by a-ha which i mean don't get me wrong is an absolute banger but come on I'm trying to show a zombie game here and this unskipable cutscenesthat's of her scene I could see my brother-in-law getting increasingly more bored as the song went on for about five minutes [Music] eventually he just made an excuse and left rest in peace quality bro bonding time anyway I need to find some fuels so we can open the gate and keep advancing I use my advanced logical reasoning skills to determine that the fuel distribution center may have filled the place is infested but fortunately I'm able to sneak by by crawling through the long grass I guess Deena didn't get the crawling memo and quite frankly I'm heavily regretting not putting her down back at the highway I'm forced to start shooting to save her life and god dammit that's my second esophagus this video it turns out there's not even any fuel here either which acts as a good metaphor for my life empty and unfulfilled Wow kidding I'm actually a pretty happy guy it's good to be optimistic like for example here look I found an axe in these fire engines so things are starting to look up for us maybe the local tribe isn't actually that bad and they'll welcome us with open arms just like they welcomed these soldiers who seem to have been lined up against a wall and shot dozens of times I mean it doesn't exactly scream hospitality but in the tribes defense perhaps these soldiers were more annoying than Deena the speaking of annoying Deena she suggests we go down this spooky elevator shaft into the basement to try and find fuel this Deena and this is why I hate you not only is it dark there's also a foot of dirty gray water which offers yet another dilemma do we drink the dirty water for the benefit of short-term hydration but at the risk of catching typhoid definitely staying hydrated is paramount with virtually no ammo left we've at least cleared the garage out and also there's some feel down here knowing these two borderline drug addicts I'm surprised they didn't start just sniffing the stuff I find an old coffee shop and decide to break in by throwing a brick through the window I remember back at school this crazy guy said he would throw a brick through my window because I talked to a girl he liked I was like chill man she's just a friend at my school but he was really mad he told me he'd kick my teeth in one by one which was pretty strange threat like does he have tiny feet or just incredible kick accuracy anyway he tried to befriend me in the end so he could get closer to her and even once asked if I wanted to try crack with him and he's borderline psychopath group of friends but I was like no thanks I just unlocked ancient magic on runescape so I'm going to PK in the wilderness with my clan and then your girl we get the main gate open and prepare to have more fun filled family adventures I'm going to stop the video here as I obviously don't want to spoil anything major for anyone I hope you enjoyed this was actually my first PlayStation 4 game I've ever made a video on which was cool for me I hope all you legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
