[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with hitman a ka thick man if you enjoy this video please become a DJ and at every drop just play hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here as this really helps spread the good word of my channel today we returned to Colombia to assassinate the three leaders of the Delgado cartel Andreea Martinez who looks like she's about to sell me a Colgate teeth whitening kit on instagram via a photo of her but the George Franco who was in charge of actually producing the cocaine and the kingpin himself Rico Delgado who likes his blow so white it has gluten free sex will be seamlessly blending into our surroundings by wearing an adorable tuxedo mask combination we'll be taking a silenced pistol a briefcase with a machete in it and some pills that make people throw up because agent 47 is the OG coronavirus so it's time to find a lead on one of these narcos I know there's a youth hostel in the center of town so we'll head there first my mates and I once stayed at this hostel in Barcelona called Cabal it literally had the same name as the capital of Afghanistan but that's not all it had in common this place was a war zone I left my towel hanging on my bed and it got stolen in the night my thongs also got stolen my briefs my virginity my limited-edition dark charizard all stolen - it was really rough anyway I learned George Franco has a guest staying upstairs and also managed to steal the hostel key I decide to eavesdrop on this hippie talking to the guy blowing hello seek vape clouds the hippie drug trafficker says he's doing a prototype cocaine smuggle test for George Franco but he broke the prototype and needs to fix it with glue not exactly a discreet guy but I let myself into his room I find the broken toy and also his drug smuggler mmm oh man this guy is truly an awful trafficker like who keeps memos I guess though if I can poison the toy and fix it we could have a real masterpiece in play here so just like every teenage boy with daddy issues I set out to find some glue is it just me or is agent 47 running particularly weird today I guess a tailored cocktail suit is hard to move around in but still it looks like he's about to have diarrhea anyway these two guards are highly suspicious of me so I just stand here pretending to enjoy the view they say Andrea Martinez is managing the construction of a new cocaine plant or something apparently the worksite is cursed and they need the shaman to perform a ritual to get rid of the evil spirits honestly this might be the smartest NPC I've ever seen I was planning to brutally murder him I find the shaman and he is cooking up some delicious hallucinogenics for these tourists who are absolutely tripping balls now obviously I need to get that shaman disguise and situations like this are best handled delicately it's time to finesse this dodgy wizard I snake through the bushes machete in hand and proceed to stab him in the back unfortunately one of the tourists wasn't tripping balls and saw the whole thing clearly so I do the only reasonable thing I can think of Slappy's face silly with a machete I can't believe these guys are still unaware because of the potent [ __ ] they're all on I guess at least this small scientific case study proves that despite what we're told drugs actually save lives I pick up a poisonous frog because why not and put on the shamans robes it's time to clap some cheeks well claps and evil spirit cheeks I somehow only just realised what that expression means well so I guess we're about to go and have sinful premarital intercourse with some evil spirits jesus take the wheel the guards take me back to Andres mansion and tell me to wait inside as she'll be back soon couldn't hurt to scope the place out I guess the meeting room has a water cooler and three drink bottles on it this woman loves staying hydrated I don't know if I want to murder or marry her she's also got a huge stockpile of toilet paper like damn these knockos live large for real though here's a life hack steal toilet paper from the office bathrooms well that's actually less a life hack and more just me endorsing stealing but how else are you going to afford life-saving drugs here's a diorama of the factory they are trying to build looks like they're planning on dumping the toxic waste straight into the ocean so best not let Greta tunberg see not sure what grete would be doing in a cartel mansion in Colombia but wait I bet Greta is a drug dealer it actually all makes so much sense she pretends to travel the world for the environment when really she's hopping about pushing drugs you're not fooling me tunberg also everyone keeps praying to me because I'm like a god to them I'm like the Church of Scientology except I don't want to help anyone I just want to take their money so wait yeah I guess I'm exactly like the Church of Scientology I decide to go check out the construction site myself and on my way a flock of tropical parrots spread their wings and take flight I proceed to try to gun them down because as you know I'm anti every bird that isn't a pelican they're just a little winged wankers I make my way to the site and again everyone is applauding and praying for me I've honestly never felt this important a by chance Andre er is here and so I go and tell her that I'm ready to bend some spirits over the cement mixer and now when banishing evil spirits confidence is key you want to thrust your arms up into the air like you just don't care and then lower them down again and then been no more spirits aundrea check so watch like sorry am i keeping you I just banished all the evil spirits in like 9 seconds you have unreasonable expectations of me if you did an employee satisfaction survey right now I don't think you'd be happy with what you saw it doesn't take a genius to figure out what I have to do next but this soldier stands in my way of the controls I decide to do what has to be done morph into his body and activate the control panel whilst inside him Andre er is subsequently crushed by the crate and somehow the guard doesn't realize this was all my doing who's checking their watch now Andre are not my girlfriend that's for sure one target down two to go alright so I need to find this damn glue or just find a fresh approach I decide to go door to door like a Girl Scout selling cookies but instead of offering delicious baked treats I'll be stealing their stationery when investigating this man's cabin he's quite rude to me not only as a guest in his home but also as the apparent god of this village and so I decide to epic prank him I sprinkle poison into his I guess sardine soup looks delicious when he comes back to do a taste test he gets a little surprised and then starts throwing up in the river ha ha what fun to add even more debatable slapstick humor to this prank I kick him into the river and then a school of piranhas eat him ha ha get pranked big boy somehow this woman didn't see anything and then she starts praying to me she then starts stalking me and it's quite full on but how did she find out my kill death ratio is three point six women are starting to realize how sexually desirable us gamers are and so you might find yourself getting stalked more and more in the future I don't have time for a girlfriend right now as I'm trying to dismantle a notorious drug cartel so I'll handle the problem like an adult by shooting her several times the hunt for glue continues and it's getting dire but then I just walk into a store and ask if I can buy some glue and she's like yeah sure he go mate wow I wasn't aware that that was a function in this game but there you go small goods transactions I head back to the hostel and smack the trafficker in the head I then take his clothes and place the deadly frog into the toy bus don't question the logic there it all makes perfect sense with the bus now fixed I'm ready for my meeting with George Franco I locate the secret tunnel the hippie talked about but one of the guards won't let me bring my weapons or briefcase down I need to stay cool so I don't blow my cover so using my enhanced assassin abilities I throw my briefcase past the guards which they quite clearly see I'm then forced to gun down one of the guards in a panic which triggers the second guard to radio base so I have to gun him down too I then destroy the security camera which should have been step one and as I'm about to sneak away a third guard comes down so I throw a wrench at his head but not before he sees my face so I have to end him - all in all a pretty smooth operation the problem is now I've lost my escort to the meeting so I'll just have to have a self-guided tour there's a pretty extensive tunnel system and I even come across some kind of submarine eventually I find the cocaine lab where they're packing the product into toys monkeys to be precise that's actually genius selling the coke straight to the kids there'll be that one guy in the comments that's like um you're an idiot they're smuggling the coke in the monkeys to get it to America not giving it to the kids the person who writes this comment also probably thinks Greta tunberg isn't an international drug lord I then randomly stumbled across Franco and he says he wants to test out my school bus all right made sure well to be honest this is all just working out fantastically and he's quite impressed with the way I've been smuggling the product around I wonder if you'll reimburse me for the glue I bought or at the very least if I can claim it as a tax deduction either way Franco's down which just leaves the big chief himself Ricardo Delgado hangs out at his mansion so I make my way through the plantation over to him it's a nice place he's got himself too so now let's find and kill the big girl I say these two girls tanning and one of them is in direct sunlight I tell her there's nothing healthy about a tan and she thanks me for the health tip I also assume she's doing a shitload of cocaine so probably wouldn't hurt to rein that in a little bit either the mansion God disguise is quite bad as many of them know I don't actually work here so I'll have to keep a really low profile I head down to the basement because there's always something good in the basement the kitchens down here I remember back when I was at school in Home Economics I wanted to do the fire frying pan thing but I didn't know how to so I just put a bit of burning paper in the frying pan and now I'm basically Gordon Ramsay there's actually a lot going on down here I stumbled across a strangely unguarded room with millions of dollars in it or approximately raid Shadow legends advertising budget I also find an accident report that says an engineer was injured at the submarine dock and is recovering at home interesting stuff it also seems Rico is trying to paint this chair fire engine red which i think is a great idea this painting workshop is a bit excessive but colorful furniture can really brighten up a room I continue to survey the mansion and honestly it inspires me to maybe start a side hustle modest Pelican trafficking the pelicans beak can hold up to 11 kilograms of cocaine and they'll just fly right over the border one of the narcos is throwing rocks out the window at the gardener's and honestly I don't appreciate that I recently started buying several pot plants and diligently looking after the so I can relate to these men and so I knock him unconscious I've got your back gentlemen you may now rake proudly and free I also find Rico's wife and she's one thick mama seriously god bless I Oh Interactive Studios for making all the women in this game so damn thick I want to ask her on a date but I also don't want to get rejected so here's what you do step one get a gun guns not only make you look manly but they're also crucial for step two step two you just shoot them and therefore it becomes impossible to get rejected because they can no longer speak what is my content look alright I promised I'd do another thick thumbnail and so there you go are you happy I hope you're happy I'm happy alright obviously I have to reload a checkpoint so let's follow up on that submarine engineer lead I don't know much other than the head engineer has been injured and the worksite is unstable sounds like an epic prank opportunity the submarine crew disguise gives me some access to the area and via overhearing conversations and reading reports I know exactly what I have to do I need to find the wounded engineer who must be back at the residential area so here I am back to home invasions checking house by house and this time I don't even poison and kill anyone so I mean that's some pretty outstanding personal growth at long last I find a woman praying for her injured husband perfect I hope he never gets better i rifled through their washing not even stopping to sniff one pair of panties because I've got to finish this contract I disabled the safety mechanism and then speak to the head guard to let him know everything is ready to go he calls Rico Rico's pretty eager to see how she goes and I'm like yeah mate she goes hard and he's like nice one mate he keeps telling me to up the revs so I just full send it and sure enough the sub flies off at safety rails crushing and drowning Rico in the cave what a poetic way to go the so mission complete and unfortunately I didn't get a rating because my internet disconnected while playing welcome to Australia I'm going to guess and say 0 out of 5 stars because we sure did cause a lot of collateral damage today but in the words of Mother Teresa mass murder is a necessary evil on the road one success thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
