some of you might know that i used to exclusively be a battlefield youtube channel i posted such classics as battlefield 1 or a girlfriend which is better in this video we discovered that nothing could beat the warm tender touch of a woman well nothing except destroying people with a hell regal 1915 submachine gun the point is i love the franchise and so i was happy to be invited to play this game early welcome to the battlefield 2042 beta in a nutshell the boys and i have been waiting for this game for years we've all been getting up every morning and praying that it was going to be good in fact we've been more than praying we've been taking influence from the mesoaztec civilization and sacrificing people to test cat lapoca the god of destiny and fortune in the hopes 2042 will be good i'm not joking we're probably going to jail at some point you wonder why you haven't seen stealth of fielder in any of my videos recently it's because the man strapped to a rock with his organs removed the point is there's a pandemic going on we're all in lockdown and i've been curling up and crying in the shower again because the gaming scene is so dry this game needs to be the shining light the ice in a glass of water the socks during sex the breeze during summer the guy who gives you a hit of his blunt during your little sister's tedious ballet recital the hands he priest at bible camp and the lawyer your parents get to sue the handsy priest from bible camp in summary we as oppressed gamers need battlefield 2042 to absolutely bang this is why i'm happy to report to you that the beta was incredibly enjoyable i loved every minute of it the community talk about this concept of an only in battlefield moment the perfect example of this is when a player called stun gravy jumped from his jet and while in midair shot down an enemy and then parachuted back into his own jet again i would love to see this man's dms because i can only imagine how many women are sliding in obviously i slid in that clip was fire so yeah the game definitely has more of these only in battlefield moments i actually hit a clip of my own during our play test that is honestly on a similar level to stun gravy's legendary clip so i run up to this zip line and you might be thinking hey pelican you can't go up ziplines well you actually can do that now it's called science so i briefly take this tactical position on top of an electrical tower but then decide i want to get back into the action and parachute off except i don't pull my shoot and i die on horrific death the dice feel free to use this in your next trailer graphically the game clearly looks insane i was playing on pc with an xbox controller like the 12 year old i am all my mates play on xbox and they don't want to switch i could never abandon the boys and so i only use my pc for specific things like this capture event and watching pawn i was switching between high and ultra graphics because i genuinely don't know what i'm doing i must be the most pc illiterate content creator i edit my videos with imovie for god's sake i need to go and take one of those pc lessons they give out to people returning to the workplace i'll go and take an excel spreadsheet class with a bunch of mums coming back from maternity leave it'll be lit we could only play the one map but it was a damn good map called orbital one of the things i love about battlefield is that it big dicks are the first person shooters the objective flag you need to capture in other games will be a house or something in battlefield it's an entire spaceport with a rocket ship i think the rocket ship even takes off sometimes one of my favorite features is how you can call in vehicles now you pull out an ipad mini and select what you want and then have to secure the area while it comes down from the heavens as the maps are massive this is such a good idea going back to the modern era has given the devs so much more room to be creative i don't think it will get old calling in tanks i mean i'm not much of a vehicle player but i figured i'd better play a few different styles the boys and i definitely don't say derogatory comments to people who only use vehicles and then brag about their inflated kill death ratios that would be immature and we're adults in all honesty it's weird for me to be making a video like this after switching up the style of my content so much it feels crazy nostalgic every time i make a battlefield video as the franchise has a special place in my heart i'm getting awfully sentimental about a video game but that's what happens when you're someone who struggles to get a tan i think i had maybe a hundred thousand subscribers when i made the decision to make videos on other games all of you og's really stuck it out with me and embraced the decision it was so wholesome anyway let's get back to my really professional and reputable review of this beta as you can see i went on a bit of a tear in this tank i started to feel bad for my opponents because we had such a limited time with the game for any of you vehicle hoes who never leave the safety of your armored machine feeling bad is what is known as empathy something you lack the environment is also cool the tanks leave track marks in the dirt i have no idea why i was so hyped about this but it's really got the blood pumping for some reason the next time i've had too many whiskeys on a lovemaking night i'll just load up battlefield 2042 and drive a tank around in circles on some muddy terrain you know when you're illegally streaming something and all those adds pop up on the side i definitely don't know about those ads as obviously i pay for all my streamed content but i wouldn't be surprised if the erectile dysfunction ads get replaced with footage of people driving these tanks over dirt i also wanted to test the destructible environment a little bit and so naturally i started destroying all of the flagpoles while i was doing this i realized it could be misconstrued as racially insensitive imagine if you were one of the staff in this early play test and you looked over and saw this tank committing hate crimes i can assure you i was merely doing a thorough job of checking out the destructible environment's no ill intent after a while i decided to not repair myself and instead just go down with my ebaya wildcat like i was brad pitt and fury that's my second fury reference in like two weeks what can i say it's a great movie they made war fun at the beginning of one of the matches i was commuting to work and this friendly tank just body checked me off the side of a cliff with no remorse could you imagine graduating from school joining the army getting through basic combat training and working your way up to whatever rank drives humvees only to be pushed off a cliff by a tank that's probably happened at some point in time somewhere around the world which i think says a lot about society you can call in other things too such as this ranger which is part of the robotics support unit this will surely be a fan favourite as it's a robotic dog that goes around shooting enemies for you i found it useful for locating the dodgy melakas camping in bushes i stumbled across one guy hiding in a bush who also had a robotic dog as well as a jar of peanut butter it was pretty weird there's other gadgets i liked as well like the grappling hook it just feels like they've nailed that fine line between too many gimmicks and not enough to do my main group of mates and i actually met while playing battlefield 1. i was sick of playing with randoms and so i joined their squad and eventually their voice chat party they proceeded to call me moist penguin and they laughed at that joke extensively that name really got a lot of mileage in fact even today it's not uncommon for one of the lads to call me moist penguin and it always gets a good laugh the point is battlefield brought us together as a group since playing with them we've all become close mates in real life we catch up in person wherever we can i even vlogged one of our trips and it was one of the most questionable bits of content i've ever uploaded i'm just like setting up a trick shot in call of duty and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins look at the champions lads i'm not putting this into the other cruises [Laughter] i'm not really much of a vlogger but the point i'm getting at is that we as a group really want battlefield to be good i love getting a beer at the pub or shooting hoops or whatever but when it's tuesday at 8pm there's nothing better than turning on the xbox loading up battlefield and chatting with the lads i'm sure many of you can relate to this situation i've genuinely missed playing this game with my friends sure we've been getting by and we'll always have a good time playing whatever but i'm not going to lie to you it's been getting kind of desperate one night i logged on and i saw stealthosimo and crosby playing peggle together what the  is peggle this is peggle i had to google it and i couldn't believe my eyes it's the year 2021 and the boys are peggling together it sounds like pegging crosby's only 16. my boy stealthosimo is about to go to jail for peggling a minor another time i joined the party and four of them are playing monopoly together virtual monopoly on their xboxes like that was a normal thing to do monopoly is a game you play when you're visiting your family and it's raining and the internet's dead and your weird cousin angus is like hey let's play some monopoly together you reluctantly agree and the next thing you know you're being figuratively molested by angus and the metropolitan he's built on mayfair angus if you're watching this i'm sorry for calling you out by name but you're a little snake in the grass who clearly cheats one time i joined the party not even a month ago and guess what the lads were doing talking they didn't even have games loaded they were just chatting like it was breakfast at goddamn tiffany's we can talk when we get a coffee or when we're sinking beers on the couch the xbox is for channeling our inner virgin and shooting people that's where the gaming scene is at right now you're reducing grown-ass men to peggle monopoly and conversations when i say the boys and i want battlefield to be good it wasn't some throwaway line we need this to be fun that's why i'm happy the beta was so damn promising it just seems they've recaptured what made so many people love the franchise in the first place they've taken a step back and spent a good few years designing a game that they can be truly proud of at least that's what it seems like i guess we'll only know once the full game's released but i'd say it's looking extremely promising i just can't wait to get home for a nice cold glass of god's nectar load up 2042 and chill with the lads well chill right up until a max level player who used to be a pilot for the australian air force rinses us a dozen times and we all get tilted i'm going to definitely set up a modest pelican server for this game that all of us should be able to play on together as its cross-platform the boys will likely be there as well so that will be a lot of family-friendly fun if you're interested make sure you join my discord server as that's where all the events like this get organized we're doing a roast to the pelican event soon and i'll feature the best roasts in a video so if you want to publicly flame me that's your chance also follow me on twitter as i'm going to give away a lot of merch soon i ordered heaps to give as i wanted to do something wholesome make sure your dms are open so i can hit you up for your postal address a few of you have been asking for an update on my adopted stray cat fat tony he's doing well mostly just sits around looking for attention and being a cute malacca otherwise yeah it's good to be making some battlefield content again thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy bye
