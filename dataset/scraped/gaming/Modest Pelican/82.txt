[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with hyperscape if you enjoy this video please hike to the summit of mount everest and destroy everyone else's flags replacing them with modest pelican gaming ones as this really helps spread the good word of my channel welcome to hype escape it's like runescape but instead of buying a medieval girlfriend for virtual gold pieces it's a brutal futuristic fight to the death the year is 2054 and society has really thrived and prospered this is probably what the world would look like if everyone stayed sufficiently hydrated at all times basically they've created this arena where humans can fight it out battle royale style to prove who the alpha is winning is tough though and to truly learn the scape and emerge victorious a contender will need to sacrifice sleep family basic hygiene and it probably wouldn't hurt to break up any relationship you're currently in i told my girl yesterday hey shorty the scape's calling i need to put a diaper on and get that dub so we're done here she was pretty sad saying that i ruined her birthday but the important thing is i'm ready to escape the first thing i have to do is select my avatar i pick karen because she's assertive obviously just kidding i pick this guy because he kind of looks like keanu reeves i'm then transported to a training facility where a robot talks me through the basic mechanics of the game not just any robot either this thick titanium mama do be looking good if i wasn't so busy becoming the next beloved esports hero i'd empty her recycling bin if you know what i mean that actually doesn't make a lot of sense like am i implying that i take her bins out and finish her chores hype escape there seems to be a vast assortment of abilities you can choose from like turning into a ball and bouncing around there's also a shooting range and i proceed to decimate a bunch of inanimate stationary bots these bots actually remind me of my good mate stealth omato well i mean i say that but i actually came up against stealth omato in a random game what are the chances and to my utter humiliation he killed me and trust me i thought about deleting my youtube channel and then kmsing but fortunately i was revived and managed to get some sweet sweet revenge to restore the natural order of our friendship but i'm getting ahead of myself i finish inflating my confidence at the training facility and now it's time to squat up with the lads so we can get that sweet dubs i link up with stealthorobo and stealthofieldo a lot of people ask why so many of my mates have stealtho in their name but i want to ask you why don't you have stealtho in your name you think you're better than us you honestly might be anyway this is the pre-game lobby and it's where you can practice jumping around or intimidate your opponents i jump onto this small cube and thrust my baton into the air to symbolize to the capitalist dogs that communism is the future i mean hyperscape we then all hop into small pods which kind of look like well let's just say there'll be no fertilizing of an egg today because we are here to game we are here to prove that three young holy australian men can rise up and achieve the impossible we have to win this game no matter what the cost and if we don't i'll give away my virginity to the highest bidder we decide to land at the voltaic lock and it's game on it's that time of a battle royale game where you must loot as fast and efficiently as possible we proceed to all loot to the same apartment building instead of fanning out obviously this isn't at all tactical but it's always nice to be close to your bros i guess still surprisingly with no weapon or ability in my inventory the lads call out that there's a dodgy malacca right on them and is allegedly being quite aggressive with little choice i run to the aid of my friends wielding a baton and do what i do best spam the melee button over and over again and against all odds we emerge victorious well i mean there was three of us and fieldo did have a minigun but hey everyone likes a good underdog story as i loot one of the ultra modern train stations i'm jumped and i guess some things never change bloody chavsmate shanks and shivs but fortunately i also have a wall ability and recognising that this man clearly has a state-of-the-art gaming chair i throw it up to ease the pressure there can be no more running though it's time to end the big girl's career wow i can't believe i just got done dirty by a man called hairless wheel it seems strange that he'd even have to specify that the wheel is hairless because i can't imagine a hairy wheel but at the very least i think we can all appreciate he's out here making us question life so yeah when you die you turn into a ghost and no one can see you except your teammates but you can observe others having fun and call out where hostiles are if you stand on an enemy's corpse your team can reboot you into the game so we need to find some bodies so here i am running around the big city as a ghost wondering if robbo will be able to clutch up as he's the only one left alive this is a time where i can reflect and wonder where it all went so wrong why did i aggressively push a guy with a shotgun but hey he was the better player and deserves my respect kidding never be the bigger man i hope he dies and he got lucky and is by anyone's definition absolutely trash i find a respawn point and robbo who did pick karen do be looking pushy thick he brings me back to life like i was jesus but this resurrection will debatably have a more influential effect on humanity i loot up again and now it's time to prove to this entire lobby why faze cloud9 and nrg esports won our signatures so badly i hear some commotion outside and the lads are in a heated gunfight with walls being thrown up left right and center i launch myself on a jump pad so that i saw to the heavens and then come crushing down upon my opponent while my minigun sprays out 6 000 rounds of righteousness per minute sorry champ but youth group's over welcome to papa peli's church of sweat we're not out of the woods yet though as gunshots have attracted other players who have failed to recognise that today we're gaming harder than my stepdad's peony on a sunday morning under fire i duck into an apartment building like i was an uber eats driver on amphetamines unlike an uber eats driver though i won't be feeding questionable fast food to those who don't enjoy cooking rather i'll be delivering the feeling of disappointment to the don420 as i rinse him like a dish bunch i duck inside and as i turn i spray some bullets into stealtho robbo thank god friendly fire isn't a thing in this game or that would have been awkward he unfortunately gets taken down so on the fly i decide to implement a stunning and brave tactic i like to call camping my little dick off unfortunately this leaves me trapped like a rat and i realize i've gotta make an exit so i duck away with the vertical leap and managed to finesse my attackers with both lads dead it's now on me to clutch up is this where you'd want to be close to the end of a game no it's definitely not but we're not going to let these unfortunate circumstances define us i sound like a damn motivational speaker but if we can win this game i think any of us can do anything then all of a sudden the miracle we need pops right up there was obviously a fight here and so he seized the opportunity and i proceeded to bring the lads back to life well before i bring robbo back i take all the good loot because between you and me i'm a pretty selfish teammate but honestly he would have done the same with this injection of positivity we are ready to bounce back and close this game out nothing can halt this momentum except a room full of enemies who are all shooting at me at once god damn it what were you all doing in there talking about your feelings camping's only okay when i do it read a book you neanderthals but at least i got one of them so yeah another twist in the tale and my fate is now with the boys once more it's super arousing i mean strange watching people when you're in ghost mode as you can observe their every move i momentarily consider calling out that i found a safe spot for a respawn as a joke but then i think better of it while i was busy not giving any helpful call outs to my mates fieldo dies and the situation becomes even more grim there's only 11 squads left and the zone is rapidly shrinking in every man's life he'll find himself in a situation where he must deliver the goods perhaps it's when your wife is pregnant and about to give birth and you have to get at a hospital in time so she can bring new life into this big beautiful world in this metaphor fieldo and myself are the baby and robbo is the dad and honestly this comparison was a pretty weird choice on my behalf to our delight robbo does it again and what top form the big man is in instead of a gas circle the map disintegrates which is pretty sick and yeah i decide to pick up this gun so i can get back in the fight and he can suck my average hype escape robbo somehow gets me up again and it's now or never for us at the final circle a crown appears and you can either hold this crown for 45 seconds to win or kill every other squad we decide to make a push for the crown but it's red hot as obviously everyone is thinking the same thing it's a total mind game of when the right time is to grab the crown if you pick it up too early everyone in the lobby wants you but i suppose it would be nice to feel wanted i position myself on the monorail so i can beam the crown wearer but as more players fall it becomes easier for the crown wearer to survive we'll need to make a move soon it's time to get sweaty in fact i'm so ready to win this i even pause half of my christian music downloads to minimize my ping robo swoops in and grabs that royalty drip and his plan is to bounce around as a ball while i cover him from above it's a bold strategy but not as bold as the time i pretended to be a lawyer to two foreign students when i was 18. i had this friend i used to work with and i went back to his place to get ready before we hit the bus he had better fashion than me and as i was borrowing his clothes i actually looked pretty good but more importantly i looked very rich and so i seized the opportunity i started to believe the lie and all of a sudden they wanted to take a cab back to my large house that i had explained i owned several of i started to get nervous and then one of them got a bit cluey and questioned if i was a real lawyer and so i thought i'd tell them the truth because i assumed it would make us all laugh i owned up and my facial expression immediately changed she stood up straight and went from like 5'4 to 8 3 real quick and then slapped me across the jaw in front of my mate it was the second best thing that's ever happened to me in one of the most beautiful comeback stories of 2020 we astonishingly secure the dubs it sure was dicey there for a few moments but we got it done and it just goes to show if you have a mate who revives you every time you fall anything is possible thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
