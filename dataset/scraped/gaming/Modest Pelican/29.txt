[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with far cry 6 early access demo if you enjoyed this video please hold people underwater at your local swimming pool to ensure they're sufficiently hydrated as this really helps spread the good word of my channel i wake up on a beach but i'm not alone there are other people lying around everywhere i assume they're all dead and probably should have at least checked for a pulse but then i wouldn't have found this handgun or seen these crabs they're so cute that you almost forget we're standing on a mass speech grave humanitarian rights are gone if you ignore the bodies this coastline is actually quite serene i'm happy far cry 6 has tropical islands as the first game did so it's incredibly nostalgic the blue sea and the vibrant vegetation create the perfect backdrop for completely ignoring the geneva convention i approach an old military bunker and inside i find some metal scraps and also a fella who seems to have carelessly slipped and fallen over i continue to creep forward into the jungle with my gun out although i have no bullets so i guess i'll be trying to kill people with my positive outlook on life i spot a soldier and sneak up behind him i proceeded to tactically slash the sandbags with my machete completely giving away my position i then aggressively button mash to perform some sort of takedown and then some skinny malacca kicks me in the chest whenever i watch early access footage of new games i always wonder why the person playing is so bad and now i seem to have become that person i continue through the jungle and eventually meet a militia group led by the female version of vin diesel funny her friends can be closer than family i decide to help her with her revolution if she can help me escape this island plus they've got a makeshift bbq going and a pretty good view so we could potentially salvage my vacation the first task is to go and recruit juan cortez who's an unstable alcoholic currently getting belted at the local bar giving an automatic weapon to someone who struggles with addiction what could go wrong i holster my gun so i can blend in and then using my exceptional situational awareness skills i head towards the bar i notice a guard is questioning some lass about the whereabouts of someone so i decide to try and help my philanthropy is not rewarded you try and assist the corrupt military with finding and torturing some guy and being shot is the thanks you get no wonder there's a revolution happening these guys have appalling people skills i'm pretty injured i smoke a cigar which is quite alpha and then use the burning tip to cauterize the open wound the healing animations in this game make me happy i quickly look at the view and then swim over to the bar as swimming is great endurance training and i'm pretty sure they still want to kill me i can see why juan doesn't want to join the revolution as this is prime real estate he's a pretty chill guy probably due to the alcohol abuse he's got a crocodile called wapo who proceeds to maul a couple of soldiers as you can imagine this kicks off a huge shootout but more importantly this little crocodile is my new favorite thing in the world it's a true blood bath and likely one of the most devastating days this coastal settlement has ever seen well actually this lady took it like a champ she's not going to let a few war crimes ruin her sunset me time i proceed to give her labrador a pat which is wholesome juan decides the next logical step is for us to take down an entire military outpost together and i agree he uses the term asks loosely however as he plans to sit and rest while wapo and i risk our lives i feel like the revolution needs to revisit its recruitment criteria maybe add a question on the application about addiction however controlling a tiny crocodile is a lot of fun we clear the outpost to like kings and i give the little guy a pat as a reward juan agrees to join us and we head back to camp i learn about the weapons bench where i create a custom silencer out of a water bottle it feels like blasphemy adultering a device used for staying hydrated say what you want about revolutions but these freedom fighters sure do love a barbie before i take on any missions i decide i'll head down to the town i don't walk like an idiot though i do it all cool and far cry like fire an excessive amount of zip lines i find a local farmer tending her cabbages and i attempt to get guapo to mull her to death but he won't do it as he thinks she isn't a threat i'm actually quite concerned that he doesn't respect my authority she's probably one of the fascist soldiers in deep cover living a double life as a poor oppressed agriculturalist i continue exploring the island i find more crabs but then i find something even better i locate a large winged big beaked majestic aquatic bird also known as a pelican i don't know which ubisoft developer put in the animation to allow me to feed said pelican a fish but i love you i decide to do what i always do when playing open world games and completely ignore the storyline and instead go on my own fun-filled family-friendly adventure well i mean if you can call sneaking through tall grass like a pokemon and slitting the throats of cubans family friendly which i think you can i hide the body and it looks like i've stumbled across some kind of outpost with radars and anti-aircraft cannons i grab a jeep which they've carelessly left unlocked risky as the island is filled with the worst scumbags imaginable like that cabbage farmer woman farcry is one of the few games that doesn't switch into third person when you drive and it makes you really feel like you're mowing people down with your vehicle i then spot a far superior form of transportation he's not overly happy about me commandeering his tractor but he's wearing overalls and i have an automatic weapon so my guy should go and plant some carrots and then fondle his cousin or whatever farmers do with their afternoons i go around robbing local houses of all their useful supplies which contradicts the whole revolution for the people mantra but i need spray cans for some reason i then climbed to the top of a lighthouse it's pretty clear what i have to do i dive like it was the olympic finals into shallow water but unlike those kitty cat olympians i don't need some ridiculously deep pool i head back to camp and my semi-high functioning alcoholic friend gives me a mission he asks me to steal some uranium which is a totally normal request he probably just wants to build a nuclear power plant so that members of the revolution can have air conditioning throughout the harsh summer i commandeer a horse which might not seem gangster at first but it is when i start popping locals in the head drive by style i'm too white to use the word gangster as an adjective but i make my contact who says she'll introduce me to a guard who we can bribe for more information about the uranium it looks like i'll be saging a castle but it shouldn't be a problem as i've got high-end gear such as a water bottle suppressor this is the guard she wants me to bribe despite this being a demo that i won't ever get to play again my inner loot hoarder won't let me waste the coins on this dodgy malacca i pull out my phone and start scouting the castle out and then i spot guapo who seems to have already infiltrated the fortress all by himself honestly it's pretty inspirational how much this little reptile believes in himself i find a note that says the docs are unguarded which inspires me to attempt a complete stealth penetration of the fortress i zip line down because only kitty cat olympians use ladders i guess also firemen and people who clean gutters and i guess several other professions also involve ladders what a great invention ladders are i take back what i said they're a useful apparatus the note was right there's only one guard here having a radio conversation naturally i wait for him to finish speaking and then eliminate the big girl in an excessively violent way i then dump his body in the water and execute a far less impressive dive relative to the lighthouse extraordinaire i honestly don't know much about uranium but it feels like it should be better guarded i managed to get into the castle grounds and i noticed they've taken some prisoners between you and i the prisoners are pretty rude they don't even say hi or give me a friendly nod and it comes across as pretty egotistical i work my way through the guards with each machete kill being more extreme than the one before it they did begin to notice the bodies and go on high alert but i snuck around the hallways like a sneaky stepdad i fetch the uranium escape the castle and one is like a good buckaroo here's a jetpack well it's not a jetpack yet but i can mod this to have all kinds of fun things later i wonder if there's a mod that would make my parents proud of my youtube career choice the revolution decide it's time we destroy two warships which sounds pretty good to me as i loved the movie pearl harbor could you imagine if pearl harbor had happened in real life it would have been insane and would have had likely huge atomic consequences we're going to use an attack helicopter so we'll need to take down the anti-aircraft gun i trot my way there admittedly taking down a few other riders on the way i think i'd be pretty great at dressage i arrive and gracefully dismount the horse if you're wondering why it's suddenly daytime i asked if they could please switch it to be a sunny day for your viewing pleasure with the aaa gun disabled i decide to run down this beach for cinematic purposes but then guapo and i are surprised attacked by a drove of wild pigs i proceed to pull out my flamethrower and everything gets a little sadistic i swim over to the first ship and climb aboard i figure i've done enough stealth strategy for today so i go full blown far cry mode plus i've got a helicopter looking over me it seems to be smoking a little bit but i'm pretty sure that drunk 1 is flying it so at least he hasn't crashed it into a school or something even guapo is trying to help but he can't climb ladders great energy though he's still inspiring we managed to clear both ships featuring a lot of casualties and even more satisfying healing animations it's kind of concerning that two days ago i washed up on a beach as a tourist to looking for a good time and now i'm a serial killer fighting for a rebellion on an unknown island for a cause i know very little about a great cardio though i hop into a boat with cara who tells me i'm now one of them so i'm excited to be bowls deep in this character arc who cares about my family back home or my job or my cat i really am all about revolutions and macheteing people's jugulars now i look to my left and see a flock of what i can only assume are more pelicans which has to be a sign the developers skipped me forward a lot so i could mess around on a larger island as much as i love guapo i'm also given a tiny new companion mate teresa a tiny handicap to wiener dog who is adorable this new camp i'm at lets me use planes i decide to visit one of the cities on this new island so i fly over the map and then jump from said plane i can't imagine it's easy for the revolution to afford aircraft but i really want to broaden my cultural palette palais i don't know i climbed to shore and it looks like teresa made it what an absolute unit the town itself doesn't exactly seem welcoming there's locals fighting in the streets and vulgar graffiti at every turn i'm getting a subtle vibe that the people here don't like the dictator castillo much i explore the town for a while but i'm not just here for pleasure there's apparently another larger revolution group operating out of a secret base i'm sent photos and managed to find their headquarters i joined the wrong group these guys are way more serious they have superior infrastructure and even exotic fish tanks they also want my help and i'm more than happy to lend a hand so that i can try and finesse a summer transfer they want assistance with destroying one of castillo's major naval bases this is turning into my specialty so i'm more than happy to do so i slit a gazillion throats free the hostages and then it's pearl harbor all over again and this is when my time with the demo was wrapped up overall it seems like an absolute banger you guys know i love the far cry games i've made content on the older ones and they've stuck to the formula that makes the series great i love you all thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy [Music] you
