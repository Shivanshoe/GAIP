[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with GTA san andreas if you enjoyed this content please become a homicide detective but only solved the case if you discover the victim was subscribed to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel it's been a journey for young CJ a quick recap of basically our brothers sweet was sent to prison and we reacted appropriately by visiting him and offering the necessary emotional support and now just kidding we've been investing in casinos car dealerships and mostly just banging escorts and impressively only crying afterwards some of the time today though we are going back to Los Santos - hopefully reunite with him and get the Grove Street family's gang re-established it's time to say goodbye to Las Venturas and make our way home Matt OH CJ my boy Mad Dog has a mansion in Vinewood Hills that has been taken over by a drug lord called big papa a man if I had a nickel that's what I love about this game it's so relatable the Triads and I decide to take the mansion back attacking at night we plan to parachute onto the roof but rather than landing there I pull my parachute late and land a couple of blocks away let's just say to secure a defensive perimeter this allows me to tactically Jack a car and then strategically arrive really late to the gunfight so many of the Triads are already dead I then have to use the car to get onto the roof and it's at this moment I realized that I'm eSports ready I also have an m4 assault rifle now which is incredibly powerful I've heard these a standard issue for all American citizens once they turn 13 years old the Triads also apparently forgot to tell me that we were all wearing black today Wow just because I'm a gangster that's committed like a billion unnecessary murders it doesn't mean I lack the basic human intrinsic motivation of being socially accepted anyway we clear out the mansion taking down all of big poppers crew he tries to flee but luckily there's a pink convertible in the driveway real men love pink an are just kidding they eat it and the world health dietary guidelines stipulates that you are what you ate so I guess I'm just a massive virgin hmm so yeah the mansion's ours now which is cool it's an impressive building it's got an indoor swimming pool that has this underlying ambience that you're about to be inappropriately touched by Harvey Weinstein's it's also got a huge indoor gym and you can play basketball here Kobe I'm never going to stop saying Kobe when I shoot my shot we sadly lost a legend a few months ago but his legacy should live on forever there's some thermal vision goggles also spawn in here not really sure why I'd need them but I sure am glad to have a pair I guess this government agent says I need to do one small favor for him and then he'll let sweet out of prison he wants me to sneak onto a US aircraft carrier steal a VTOL Hydra jet and then destroy a fleet of military ships with it I just wouldn't personally describe that as a small favor it seems more like an act of treason betraying your sovereign state where the consequences are almost certainly imminent death but hey in the wise words of Greta tunberg the sometimes you've got to go balls deep in a whale to get your brother out of jail I have a well-deserved beverage and then just get on with it for the record I did have to pay for this drink which cost me $1 which means the crew of this aircraft carrier have to pay for their sodas well out at sea people say I'm the criminal I destroy all the ships which definitely look like civilian lol war crimes I then fly back to Los Santos and decide to check in and see how the Grove Street is doing it's always extremely nostalgic coming back here and then my jet explodes for no reason Wow all right then a hundred dollars in hospital fees later and I'm good to go I look for a car and it just so happens I find one being driven by a guy from our rival gangs arboles I stab him for cinematic reasons and this guy just watches not even slightly rattled about what he just witnessed a more alarming is this and look I'm not going to tell you big girls how to do your job but you did just witness me viciously stabbed a guy in public not exactly a gray area of the law is it Tampa The Grove is dead and that just seems to be no one in our gang left my girl lives around the corner so I check in on her but she's apparently not home and that's too funny because my girl isn't home at the moment in real life either actually tomorrow makes it 78 days in a row that I haven't seen her last I heard from her was just some note she left on my xbox saying this isn't working but I turned it on and it was working fine I then tried to pick up a hooker to make myself feel better but even she isn't came and this could potentially be rock bottom but if there's one thing I pretend to know a lot about its how to get laid there's a lot of bad advice out there about how women want a man who's emotionally available who communicates regularly and who they can trust when in reality all they want is a guy who purchased a cheap car and spent way too much money modifying it that it begs the question why didn't they just buy an actual nice expensive car in the first place this car is actually disgusting but at least it's green which is our Grove Street gang colors and also the color of plants I actually have a lot of plants because my neighbor was selling them for cheap and I got them to use in my 500,000 subscriber video now I have all these plants and they're hard to look after bloody plants bro I don't know how they survive in the wild like I'm raising these little malakas like they're my children but they always get brown leaves and died anyway sorry I shouldn't be burdening you with my personal hardships I buy this mansion so I have a place to store plant car and I also change into CJ's original outfit as I want this reunion with sweet to feel as iconic as possible what we're about to witness is one of the greatest cutscenes in gaming history I'll have to heavily edit it though as these guys drop the n-word more than literally any twelve-year-old with an internet connection sup bro hey man we are at one spot we got max sweet you never did get a ditching car I need to go check out things in the hood y'all wanna being that's exactly where I wanna be what you done for our hood man what the hood done for me that's everybody dream to get out the whole a shop just like smoke right now did you just compare me to Big Smoke wow that's low are you aware that I took on the US Navy to save you for any of you that don't know smoke was in our gang but he betrayed us so that he could sell drugs with the ballers and most of the old members are addicted to dope and completely lost this guy even tries to sell us a blender but sweet tells him to leave I'm pretty annoying as he was selling it's really cheap and those kind of deals don't come around often for real it's cool to be back doing missions with sweet though I briefly ruin the mood by putting on my thermal goggles for a moment much like earlier in the game we must get rid of all the dealers around here so the old Grove Street members don't have anyone to buy off I feel so bad for dealers man like there's just not much job security you can get arrested or your clients can die when you sell a bad batch no sick leave my heart really goes out to them so if any dealer is watching just know you're in my thoughts and prayers chief annexed sweet wants to start taking back territory from the bowlers so our gang can re-establish a presence I absolutely love this aspect of the game of fighting waves of enemy gangsters and then after you take it over you'll see your guys roaming around that area anyway things are starting to look up for Grove Street of the bros are back together and I'm feeling exceptionally positive then I walk in on sweet about to smoke crack Oh everything is KKK I just wanna see was so good is this sweet's girlfriend because she is one beautiful woman Wow I think it's her eyes that get me I managed to convince weight not to smoke crack so let's celebrate the minor victories the word on the street is that one of our old gang members beat up has joined Big Smoke and is now selling to everyone it's time to take him down and it would be rude not to pop my thermal vision for extra strategical tactical calculated maneuvers a would you rather have to wear thermal goggles for the rest of your life I'll constantly be slightly dehydrated another one of our old member punches beta and then I guess we just let him stay alive which seems like a huge loose end but whatever I recruit some homies and again feel isolated as they parade their matching green singlets around even my gang excludes me it's pretty rough I recruit as many as possible and gather a small army of homies it's quite stunning and also quite brave unfortunately they're not the smartest or the fittest so actually getting them to stay close is proving difficult I guess you know the side effects of crack we go on a rampage taking back several hoods and after a lot of fighting it seems the only survivor is this big man a fun fact the guy who voice to this homie also voiced Franklin in Grand Theft Auto 5 I'm just going to call him Franklin because of this and him and I form a real bond as we fight together as one even after I meet back up with sweet to take back more of the city he comes along they also both get into the back of my car which i think is some sort of power play to make me feel like I'm there uber driver so for the record I've been through some pretty tough times in my life I had lots of key moments in Game of Thrones spoiled for me I once said thanks you two to a Pizza driver when he said for me to enjoy my meal and as a kid I told my teacher I loved her and the class thought I had simply misspoken and laughed at me but no I really wanted to smash that hole despite all of these traumas nothing could have prepared me for what happened next a big Franklin died right next to me on the pavement [Music] I'm pretty sure I accidentally shot him quite a bit - so I'm partly to blame we do get $10,000 though which definitely softens the emotional blow my girlfriend Denise then calls and wants to head out so I head over to her place so we can finally have our red hot date not even joking I'm pretty sure she's a crackhead too which is super adorable it just kind of shows that she's got an open mind and a real flair for adventure as she tells me she's dangerous and wants to do some drive-bys I wonder what it would be like if I picked up a girl for a date and they will like yo Jeff today I want to go and kill mother I'd be like yes we could go and kill some other is that does sound fun all we could go and watch Spy Kids 3d together your choice you see the thing about women is they simply can't resist a 3d movie from 2003 focusing on the adventure of two young but incredibly talented covert operative children anyway long story short after the date the progress bar with Denis only goes up like 1% so I pick up a hooker instead the moral of the story is don't be afraid to pay for sex actually no I can't leave it on that note it seems unprofessional and so yeah Grove Street is back on the rise and nexon ondrea's video will be trying to take down big smoke and the ballers for good oh thanks for watching you legends and a massive shout out to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
