[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with hitman if you enjoyed this video please become a paramedic and only deliver the patient to hospital if they subscribe to me if they don't then give them a firm slap across the face and let them be as this really helps spread the good word of my channel alright so here I am on vacation in the Maldives thinking about various complicated in intellectual worldly issues I also sometimes like to pace in my pool but I leave my shoes on because I know my worth the only people who are seeing these feet are those who PayPal me five dollars it's a pretty nice spot here and life is good just relaxing waiting for hitman 3 to release but then I realized the world needs my help once again I might not be able to talk to girls but if there's one thing I can do its pull off challenging assassination jobs with minimal collateral damage well ok maybe a little bit of collateral damage but the important thing is the job gets done that's why I'm flying out to a Christmas Fashion Show in Paris to eliminate hairy smokey bagnato and Marv sleek gone if you know the movie home alone of the one where the lead actor grew up and now looks like a junkie sort of looks like me actually anyway the two burglars from that movie are rubbing this mansion and an insurance company has paid us to put a permanent end to their crime spree which now that I think about it seems ethically ambiguous as they're just petty criminals will take in with us a silenced pistol some emetic pills and lil flashy a remote-controlled flashbang device that sounds like a soundcloud rapper who's been spitting hot sixteens for two and a half weeks so naturally just got his first face tat let's go before I enter the venue I firstly flex on the peasants outside who are unable to get in what's the point of having privilege if you don't constantly let everyone know about it alright it's time to find these fools and as this is a Christmas themed event the hosts of placed presents everywhere for the guests wow what a great mystery gift I'm taking this in with me there's heavily armed security absolutely everywhere so seamlessly blending in will be crucial I have very little Intel about my targets other than that they're somewhere at this state stealing things thanks for uh shirring me inmate without you I would have run full-speed into the wall ah Christmas in Paris I actually spent a few weeks in Paris with my mates right after we finished school we had travelled to Europe with almost no money so we were staying at the outer suburbs at a really cheap trashy youth hostel this woman kept hitting on my friend and he thought he was just so irresistible but it turned out she was an escort and after they'd hooked up he had to pay her almost all the money he had it was extremely funny for us but also deeply concerning because they weren't bound by marriage so this is the fashion show and I've said it once and I'll say it again I deserve to be up there more than any of these poses in fact I'm going to shoot my shot to my disbelief this woman tries to steal my moment so I use the mystery gift to liberate the stage it's exactly how I imagined it always would be bloody majestic security then storms the room and gun me down Wow pretty rude okay round two and this time we won't fall victim to our attention-seeking tendencies as I make my way through the mansion I swear I see Santa Claus teleporting away which demonstrates the importance of not taking acid minutes before an intricate double assassination attempt currently we only have access to the standard guest areas and there's still no sign of Harry or Marv I've got to try to find a less crowded Avenue and so I sneak into the East Wing gardens I momentarily consider pushing this guy into the pond but practiced some pretty impressive self-control and then slipped into the private grounds I am quite literally instantly spotted by a guy who I must admit is a handsome melaka I mean look at that hairstyle not many you could pull that off we look great we should totally make out I mean sorry for trespassing it won't happen again I decide to try and casually wander pass the bar in the function room and see if anyone notices which they don't it's the perfect plan until this big girl in a vest starts getting annoyed with me and says he's going to fetch security the little snitch I panic and look I'm not proud of my actions but this is a classic fight flight or freeze response and apparently my basic internal protective mechanism is barbaric I'm not exactly being a snaky stepdad right now either as witnesses and the death toll both starts stacking up I try to hide in plain sight while also living my dream out again but things predictably escalate I need to rethink my strategy and so I make them at yu-er decision to stop murdering people in crowded areas all right new year new maid this time we'll head to the west side of the property and here I find a buff guard and a fashion assistant flirting with each other Wow girls really do never go for the nice guys I'm out here donating women 95% of my salary directly to their only fans I messaged them hot daily anime drawings I made of us and I watched through their apartment windows from my car late at night to ensure their safety yet they're still dumb enough to go for other guys instead of a nice guy like made women a horrible anyway somehow I didn't get spotted dragging that unconscious body through a well-lit carpark and now with this disguise I can better explore in one of the outhouses I find rat poison and also another present with a flashbang inside it and that seems like a duty of care liability for the hosts spit anyway I tossed the flash grenade at these two waiters having a cigarette break see that's a good Christian prank as it's just harassment and not murder I then choked out this guy who's part of the crew take his outfit and well yes dump him into the river below where I expect he'll shortly drown at least he died doing what I assumed he loved having his lungs rapidly fill up with water this disguise sure does let me access a much larger portion of the mansion but still no sign of the targets the key problem is they're probably moving around erratically stealing artifacts or whatever so I could just be missing them and not know I decide to try to sneak up to the top level which is being guarded by two senior security personnel who clearly value the benefits of milk and time to load up GarageBand drink some lean and premier little flashy you see I've played hitman since I was a young kid it's one of my favorite game series of all time as a result of this I've learned how to move around scenarios as if I was invisible just kidding I end up completely surrounded and pinned down dying a pretty horrific death all right it's time to game gamers and the only area of the mansion I haven't properly explored are the back private gardens and the basement I love a good basement they're just such versatile rooms fun fact you can fit at least 27 children in a standard 1,000 foot squared council approved square basement I see a suspicious figure and so I decide to knock him out before he gets away would you look at that it's bloody mom that's what we call assassin instinct well I mean if this is real life I would have died like three times but still one down one to go if I was a betting man which I am seriously I predict a future gambling addiction will likely tear apart my family but I bet Harry is on the top floor I haven't actually managed to get to the top floor yet so it's time to secure ourselves and Elite Guard disguise as this current one isn't going to cut it as I'm making my way through the model makeup section I overhear this guy gossiping on his phone come on chief no one likes a gossip so I do what has to be done unfortunately his head shatters against a glass cabinet I feel bad as that looked like an antique I reacted just in time as this guy comes to investigate and come on champ no one likes a sticky beak moments later I go for a bigger balls play choking out an elite guard in the public halls my calculations tell me that I'm slightly out of everyone's field of vision just kidding dead again okay Wow I need a cuddle from doctor disrespect or something let's go straight to the basement BAM Marv eliminated I grabbed a hammer and failing to learn anything from what literally just happened seconds ago I decide to take down this man right out here in the open imagine getting hit in the head with a hammer like Jesus Christ your life would never be the same ah well the important thing is no one saw and now I'm in the elite guard suit which looks almost identical to the suit I arrived here wearing these guards must just have a real eye for differentiating the various nuances of black suits okay only a handful of guards around here know I'm an impostor so it's time to hunt down Harry unfortunately the man is nowhere to be seen and I don't like to use any of the games helpful mechanics but for example agent 47s instinct that allows you to look through walls and locate your targets I find it cheap unlike that annoying guy who thinks he's better than everyone for not using it but I guess there's something immersive about struggling I make my way out to the back gardens and see a suspicious man running against the night sky this could be the big girl himself suddenly fireworks start lighting the place up which is honestly welcomed being a hitman is frankly hard work and I truly believe that I deserve this little soiree we've found Harry and look at him smoking his cigar mouth cancer is a small price to pay for looking like the ultimate gentleman I can't just take him down here with all these guards patrolling so we'll have to stalk him as mentioned earlier this is something I'm quite familiar with there's this dope legal loophole where as long as you stay a hundred foot away you can lawfully observe anyone you like Harry has unfortunately decided that it's time to stop stealing and now he's going to be a social butterfly and mingle with the guests and this presents rather a large problem for us as those witnesses everywhere but fortunately he's enjoying a glass of what I can only assume is the blood of his enemies or red wine it's hard to tell I know exactly what I have to do I grab a shotgun from the Security office I then push this guy into the river as I needed a laugh both those first things were actually unimportant I then collect some rat poison completely forgetting that I had the emetic poison in my pocket I then snake into the staff change room surprisingly not to touch myself but to steal a waiters disguise you say people will get suspicious if you tamper with drinks and you're not some sort of food attendant I then poison Harry's drink and almost get caught by this guy but fortunately he was completely bamboozled by my slow jog I know chemical warfare is typically frowned upon but the plan has worked as now Harry is feeling quite sick and needs to use the bathroom you know how the old saying goes if you rubber mansion and your name is Harry then you'll get drowned in a one-piece porcelain toilet there's also a present in here which is nice it's an explosive duck proximity mine just what I've always wanted I decide to leave the duck here say that the person who discovers Harry's body gets a nasty shock and oh my god I don't want to talk about it okay Wow I reload and shoot Marv in the face I then do the exact same trick and take Harry down this time not involving any sort of explosive yellow water bird with both targets down I escape without anyone finding out and secure a 3 out of 5 star rating damn Call Me The Last of Us 2 because that's controversial as I just pulled off an insanely clean job anyway I'm so psyched for hitman 3 thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
