[Music] hi lads and lasses mars pelican here with watch dogs legion if you enjoyed this video please tell your local hospital registrar to record every new baby as modest pelican no matter what the parents say as this really helps spread the good word of my channel welcome back to london where our organization dedsec has been blamed for a series of attacks that have gone off around the city which is quite hilarious not the bombs the misdirection i must pick my starting character and i pick christian because jesus and i are best friends forever he's an investment banker so you also know he's honest it's time to lead this revolution and take back the city from the harsh military group albion they're pretty violent which is obviously wrong but you've gotta respect how efficient they are i'm happy that i finally got my hands on the full game so let's all pour ourselves a fresh glass of water and get into this sky blue hatchback i immediately realised i'm being incredibly insensitive at the moment especially as we now live in a politically correct climate i'd like to formally apologize to everyone who lives in london and i'll now drive a double-decker red bus out of respect to your culture england honestly does have the best traditions football teenage pregnancies i guess that's actually about it but anyway we've arrived at dead sec hq and it's time to re-establish our crew i head down the spooky stairs and turn the lights back on and just like that we're back i'm then told to go down to the fight club arena so that i can learn hand to hand combat in order to pass this tutorial i must beat up a woman wow what a stitch up now i look non-politically correct which is my new thing i also seem more relatable to rappers now though so some other members have rocked up like this lass who is wearing some neon foxiers she's a professional cosplayer but apparently doesn't know how to tie a double windsor we've also got kanye west conor mcgregor and of course my main man christian before i start re-establishing dead sex reputation i need to build up this team it's time to go scouting for some talent especially as i turned on a setting called perma-death that basically means when one of my operatives die they die forever just like in real life it makes things a little bit more spicy i locate a protest which seems like the perfect place to recruit a big unit for the squad it seems i frightened them a bit with the aggressive parking of my large bus but i decided to try and recruit this woman in the pig mask anyway i proceed to accidentally pull a gun on her and she gets down onto the ground and begins begging for her life as far as building trust goes this isn't a red hot star whatever we'll get on with the story and find some fresh meat later on for now we've gotta infiltrate buckingham palace our mission is to seduce and make sweet tender love to the queen of england and then transition our purely physical relationship into a deep and meaningful long-term commitment a look i'll be honest i'm not actually sure what i'm doing right now but the important thing is i'm a stealth master observe here how i take cover behind a transparent piece of glass i work my way through the compound skillfully eliminating soldiers and download a crucial piece of evidence that says like the video and subscribe or stealthorubbo will gently smooch your father's neck weird i'm honestly getting a little bit sick of driving this bus around and so i'm going to upgrade to a self-driving sports car i'm so sorry if this comes across as culturally insensitive i've also decided that this time i will actually play the game properly and rather than say pulling out a nail gun and shooting it erratically into a crowd of pedestrians like i did during my early access demo i'll be a man of the people i'm also a big fan of this invisibility cloak and i wish i had one in real life so i could spy on the male bathrooms i mean female bathrooms i mean i'm stunning and brave i sneak up onto the rooftop using impressive parkour and then change this electronic billboard to remove the albion propaganda are the people of london even being oppressed now that there's some youthful graffiti in their intersection i don't think so i then have a brief lapse in my new hero ethos and taser homeless person in the head obviously this makes me feel pretty alpha and gives me the confidence to leap off the roof onto the street below i somehow survive but this perma-death is going to come back to bite me i'm sure i can confirm it does make the near-death experience experiences much more extreme though i managed to lose the police but i can't keep risking christian like this i need to recruit some members who i'm not so emotionally attached to and they can be cannon fodder and happily lay down their lives for pakistan i begin the great search for the perfect disposable soldier eventually i stumble across a hippie commune and this should be the perfect place inner city stoners no one's going to miss these big girls a fashion designer an archaeologist how pathetic while christian's busy coordinating multi-million dollar hostile takeovers mark here is touching himself to a brachiosaurus fossil you tell me who the real hero is anyway i tried to recruit this guy in the yellow but my recording software glitched out for a bit and we ended up here i don't really know exactly how this happened but unlike me he wasn't able to survive a two-story drop onto solid concrete christian is just built different i finally find exactly the soldier i need a silly mustache a fedora what more could you want his name's owen and this gang is trying to frame him for a crime and he says he'll join if i can help him out i'll get owen to do the dangerous missions that will end in certain death because if he dies no one will care the problem is in order to recruit him i have to do by far the most dangerous mission i've ever done which is quite ironic also my shoes and socks are now soaking wet so i have to deal with that i'm aware that i'm trying to be a stealth lord but if you put an explodable switch next to a red gas cylinder i'm obviously going to send it the guards try to find me and after thoroughly looking on top of this crate they give up while i'm here i even rescue some prisoners who are wearing some mean drip i love the industrial prison tracksuits they have here i proceeded to free them all because i'm a great person and also because i can recruit them later on to be more disposable meat shields i discover that the gang is going to use owen's car as a bomb and i must stop them or he'll go to jail this is no ordinary gang though these are some bad malakas i mean look at this lad slav squatting so confidently truly frightening i steal the car and take it to a nearby crowded park for the defuse so that if i mess up i can share a grave with 40 other people and save on funeral costs the things really escalate and i probably shouldn't be using the car as cover but then i suddenly remember it's a car and i can move it around while the defuse happens god i suck the important thing is owen is now a part of dedsec i kid you not once i start resuming the storyline his first mission is to hack into a drone there was no life risk or bullets flying he simply hacked into a drone and took a photo of some plans and this allowed us to take control of the suburb which is great but i can't express my disappointment that he didn't have to lay down his own life i decide to invent a little mission of my own where owen must defeat the entire police force in hand-to-hand combat he fights bravely but takes damage and unfortunately it looks like this is the end for him then out of absolutely nowhere two carrons appear and start backing your boy up all i want to do is have him die in the line of duty but apparently that's just too much to ask as we defeat the police and no backup arrives i obviously also defeat the karens and i guess we'll just continue the revolution for now but this isn't over a dead sec have ordered us to recruit a construction worker to the cause as we need one of their larger drones i arrive at the worksite at 11am in the morning and i can't say i'm surprised to see everyone sitting around doing nothing way to break the stereotype guys god i sure do talk a lot of [ __ ] for someone who uploads questionable gaming content to youtube i decide to recruit arthur and he says if i can clear his debts then he'll join and basically the same gang that did the whole car bomb thing lent this guy money and he doesn't want to pay it back and now that i think about it it sounds like he's the problem maybe this gang isn't as bad as everyone seems to think they are they're out here generously loaning out cash and i mean who hasn't set off a car bomb before i'm not going to hold that against anyone i sneak into their hideout and it looks like a damn bloodbath in here but maybe it's just a big mix-up they were probably helping children who had scraped their knees out of the kindness of their hearts these tubs say human organs on them but they were probably filled with delicious fruity popsicles for the children i clear arthur's name and then flee the area with one question on my mind if you were a criminal why would you get callers custom made to say human organs on them surely you would write something else to avoid suspicion the tupperware company or whoever made these surely should have alerted the authorities alright it's time to find out who really bombed london i head back to the pub to meet the construction worker who thanks me for clearing his debts i then switch characters and proceed to repetitively strike owen with my wrench he thought bravely but it had to happen he didn't actually die he's just in the hospital and this man can really dodge death but we'll get him eventually i call in the construction drone which allows me to fly around with these i then steal some kind of server which will help us recreate some holographic imagery and hopefully uncover some clues i however am an intellectual and use it to make it look like this hologram is blowing me as you can see christian came back for the fun-filled family friendly missions these clues lead us to another one of the explosion sites but we've got a much more pressing issue on our hands none of my operatives have given their life for pakistan with owen in hospital for the next 49 minutes i turn to conor mcgregor you see i like khan because he doesn't mess around with any tasers or non-lethal weapons this big girl keeps a grenade launcher in his pocket i'm taking the fight to albion's doorstep but things are escalating at a frightening pace i end up pulling out my ak-47 and going on a bit of a rampage but eventually take too much damage and khan is dead forever i'm weirdly sad about this i turn to everybody's favorite cosplayer who's about to do the exact same thing again but this time far less epic as she doesn't have military grade weapons also this time they sent in riot drones which seems like a cheap shot and eventually i'm gunned down and arrested hooray for clinging to life but we sure did show them i've uploaded another video featuring stoddart and fabian chills on my other channel papa peli otherwise thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy baby
