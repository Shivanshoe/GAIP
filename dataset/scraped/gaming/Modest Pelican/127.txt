[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with GTA san andreas if you enjoy this video please invent a cure for the corona virus and then only give it to people who subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel sometimes people comment and say it's weird how I just jump right into the video midway through the story without much explanation so anyway let's just do that again currently we are in Las Venturas and apart owners of a casino it's called the four dragons and we are at war with our rivals the caligula casino we want to take them down and what better way to do that than by collaborating with investment bankers and slowly acquiring the majority stake by utilizing several shell corporations that can't be traced back to us eh kidding we're going to rob the joint and kill everyone we need to prepare carefully for this highest because Caligula is owned by the Mafia I decide to practice my skills as it's been a red hot minute since I've done some good old fashioned drive-bys grandmas make both exceptional handbag - goodies and live targets I arrived and it turns out I need to follow this lady who works here back to her house no guns needed I like it where opting for the nonviolent approach which is quite rare and this woman is also wife material for sure she wears a blouse buttoned all the way up it's very Christian we should get married I can't say she does a lot for female drivers though it also turns out she's visiting a sex shop and I sure hope it's to buy a naughty nun costume because all the conventional nun clothes shops were sold out is that a chainsaw with her wow that's disgusting I wonder if they exist in real life hey Siri add giant dildo chainsaw to my Amazon wishlist so anyway things get turned up to 11 as I put on my suit and get ready to I guess I quickly peruse the stock and they've got all the classics hamster love naughty nurses part to granny grabber 10a sadly because of my drive by earlier I don't think there will be a granny grabber 11 which is a modern artistic travesty sort of reminds me of when the ancient Mayan temple was destroyed in Belize so I patiently wait outside this woman's house for the real to arrive he does and so I pull out my chainsaw and show him what happened when you eat the Apple so to speak I also steal this purple toy I then seamlessly take his place in this encounter and well let's just say I could hear some quite disturbing sounds coming from inside the house if I had to pinpoint the day I became a man it would be playing this mission back in 2004 I was still in primary school but I went to class the next day and said mr. Baker I'm the man of this classroom now and I taught the class all about how to woo women that's exactly what the play is here if we can woo Milly she will give us the key card to access the caligula casino so we have a really cute low resolution date as she even wears her best to bowtie which is just my kryptonite and then I drop her home to the little Millie progress bar advances anyway I have a dream I want to go on a rampage with my new purple sex toy but to make sure I maximize my DPS I'll need to hit the gym a bit and so I get my sweat on thank the gym owner for a great session and then head to my hotel suite to change outfits I want to represent grove street again my gang from back home so i do this by wearing green shorts no shirt and a green beanie so that i don't get cold i gotta look fresh but also got to be sensible you lose a surprising amount of heat through your head I'm pretty keen to test my new strength out so I do this by beating her well look I started beating up the first person I found and it just so happened to be her in a way it would have been sexist if I hadn't beaten her and I'd waited for a guy and look she's an absolute unit I've never seen a chin like this on someone before she should get into amateur boxing okay look i'ma go shut off the city's power source wolves look at that he's Fool's fun I'll never get tired of hearing CJ's lions they're so iconic I would kill for a sequel to this game in my opinion it's the best JTA the so I need to shut off the city's power to get ready for this heist the seems kind of extreme but have you seen a man parachute this calmly in sandals and socks no less what a unit of fashion before function I always say who needs gel soles when you can just get ankle ligament surgery in your 30s the power is water generated through this dam I know I praise water a lot on this channel but I hope you're starting to see why it's such a versatile liquid I stabbed a fuse two guards who are probably earning $8 an hour I also stabbed a few engineers in the neck and then plant the explosives ready to detonate before the heist I'm pretty sure this is the definition of terrorism but best not to overthink it the cops rock up so CJ Swan dives into the water below this dive has a high degree of difficulty which he executes superbly by utilizing a classic forward Pike and the entry splash was contained honestly he should be extremely happy with his performance today and can expect to bring home a medal anyway back to the heist our way into the caligula casino will be by just driving right on in using one of their armored vans the vans also have a police escort so I'm tasked with going around and stealing motorbikes I do this literally flawlessly the very first time I hit the gym again which pushes me to absolute Max Muscle again and I'm a beast what's really interesting is I've bothered spending all this time bulking up and becoming overly jacked and CJ doesn't even have a small penis I assume I decide to beat the gym owner to death with my purple sex toy but accidentally accept his training I don't want to learn his moves so I let him kill me and I respawn at the hospital with $40 in my pocket that's barely enough for a  from a homeless person I assume these missions are paying me in respect not money so I'm pretty broke and angry the perfect time to go on my rampage so I start smacking the good people of Las Venturas I get a three star wanted level with the dildo which might be my proudest achievement yet which says a lot about my aspirations and just generally me as a person anyway time to take Milly out on another date so I can get this key card I head around to her place and she's not home probably at work or maybe she's out flirting with other men so I fire several rocket-propelled grenades at her residence to show her I'm a nice secure guy who cares I try to pick up a hooker for revenge premarital relations but it turns out this lady isn't actually a hooker that being said any one's a hooker if you have enough rohypnol back to high sting and now I need to steal the armored van for our sneaky entrance the van is being held at an inn explicitly unguarded park just east of the city that is fully accessible to the public so clearly the best way to steal it is to go to the military base wait for a soldier to leave the base in a Humvee the steal the Humvee from a soldier the slip through the gate in said Humvee shoot literally 27 soldiers I'm not kidding we are massacring an entire platoon here also shoot down the warships the military send in because they're not happy with us for obvious reasons the steal a helicopter from the base that has a giant magnet underneath it and fly 2 kilometers to the in explicitly unguarded carpark and then pick up the van with the giant magnet it's that easy I drop the van back in my airfield and some cold hard respect and then jump in a stunt plane you see in these stunt planes you can emit a trail of colored smoke and so I fly over Millie's house and write the message stop being such a ho please I reverse parallel park the plane like a pro and then discover she was actually at work the last time I came around so my apologies for the RPGs and the whole whole thing in truth it's good to see her as this is the most serious relationship I've ever had in a videogame or in real life I take her to the steak house which is sure to boost our relationship to that next level women can be hard to read but the fact that she throws a sprung cup at me suggests we're not vibing right now also the body language is a clear science steak was a bad decision a message pops up saying that she didn't have a great time I don't know Milly maybe next time you don't like a restaurant tell me before we beat in there use your words Jesus Christ communication is the backbone of any relationship I drop her home and the progress bar goes backwards so I blow up her car with a hand grenade because my feelings were hurt I need a new strategy as I just don't think steaks at the answer here so I steal a nice ass Porsche 911 to impress her pick her up take her to the same bar we went to last time and it's all Happy Days when I drop her home the progress bar proceeds to go up a miniscule amount I don't even know if you'll be able to see that watching on a phone this is just getting out of hands lads and lasses plus Melia hasn't even commented on my muscles once is sheer narcissist or maybe CJ is it's unclear anyway I've got two aces up my sleeve and it's time to the first one the suit we know Milly is a freak so it's time to start speaking her language they don't call me Papa Pelle because I'm a good father figure I'll tell you that much more inappropriate sounds as I just look at the outside of the house so hot to my absolute dismay the progress bar again only goes up such a small amount like what do I do here we tried steaks we tried BDSM the only thing we haven't tried is just sitting down putting on the kettle and just talking and listening to each other I'm kidding we're going to kill Milly I can't take her out until tomorrow and as I'm killing time she gives me a call and says she'll give me the card so great news regarding her staying alive you will not regret this I know because I'm getting a good right yeah I'm not too sure about that one chief I'm pretty broke and now I'm seeing you as a bit of a loose end so thanks for the memories I love how it just says your girlfriend is dead I head into her unit and I absolutely love what she's done with the place I very satanic vibe like a what did I just fap to vibe very in right now finally all the highest prep is done but there's still a couple of things I need to wrap up before woozi will let us begin I help government agent Mike Torino run a few errands mostly just murdering other agents you know how it is I also steal a jet pack from area 69 which is a clear parody of area 51 speaking of area 51 did you know 51% of you guys who watch my videos aren't subscribed to my channel wow these call to actions are cringe but as a youtuber it's my job to derive self-worth from analytics a jokes aside I can't believe we're coming up to 500,000 subscribers already you guys are such legends I just can't thank you enough anyway I also need to head back to San Fierro to help out Caesar he's still a pretty terrible human and he's still banging my sister but he does help me set up a car dealership I thought I'd hit rock bottom murdering scores of innocent people but now I'm apparently going to be a car salesman so there you go of course we just steal all the cars and now BAM I'm the proud owner of Whang cars with san fierro sorted I think all that's left to do is settle some business with mobsters back in Las Venturas and then we should be right to rob the kill gila casino if my memory serves me correctly after the casino heist ye then head back to Los Santos to reunite with sweet so that should be some good clean actual family-friendly fun thanks for watching you absolute legends and a huge thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
