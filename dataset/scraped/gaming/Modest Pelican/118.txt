[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with GTA san andreas if you enjoyed this content please write to Google and ask them to show my channel as the top search result regardless of what people search for as this really helps spread the good word of my channel GTA san andreas but it's Christian and Sun safe let's go I load in and we are currently in San Francisco as I had to tidy some things up here we've got some pretty sweet missions to do today but first we'll have to commute back to Las Vegas I Jack a ride as CJ unnecessarily punches the driver in the jaw which is extremely alpha as violence is the answer to literally every problem I decide I'm going to modify this saber before we go and for any of you kids out there with your tic TOCs and your teenage pregnancies and your clinical depression and this level of car modification was revolutionary for its time I roll out and immediately pick up a woman of the night but she keeps making physical advances on me and so I explained that I picked her up so she could be my platonic travel companion Wow some people sure are presumptuous just because I'm not wearing a t-shirt you're a hooker and I picked you up late at night doesn't mean I gave you consent because remember there's nothing hotter than consent anyway I installed some nos in this bad boy but I can't figure out what button it is to activate I then accidentally bail out of the car probably causing myself some fairly serious soft tissue damage then I kid you not my new friend refuses to get back in and finish the road trip wow it's cold sticking to a commitment how about you read a book on being a better pal or all your friendships will die just like you died today I find the nose button which is sick but then make the unwise decision to take a shortcut a man I knew this car would eventually die but I didn't think it would be this quickly look at me adding serious emotional depth to my content if you didn't just cry then you're lying to yourself I do eventually find another worthy travel companion for the last leg of this trip and she best respect my physical boundaries moments later I find a fire engine and the temptation is simply too much I decide to hose down and hydrate hooker number two and if you look very closely you can see the water effects are extremely outdated I'm not messing around though so I head over to the Caligula casino to see how my English friends are doing this is the casino we have been preparing to heist but first I need to help my friends get out of a jam as they've become involved with the Mafia any minute now some mafia bullet is going to splatter my brains all over the wall look man relax get a grip and show everybody who's boss I'm the boss I am the ball fight deal all right I agree to help them with the job I know nothing about hey Ken's also off his face on coke which helps turn his attitude around pretty quickly and focus did I just find the cure to ADHD anyway I could have sworn I drove a fire truck here but I guess at least this is still an emergency vehicle just an insignificant detail really like when my girlfriend asked me to turn the oven on and feed the cats but I misunderstood her and fed the oven and turned the cats on that was a weird afternoon we go and visit this in Darko mobster family and the second Johnny sees me he literally dies a kind of like a girl's libido when they see me at the bar anyway I guess he was remembering the time I tied him to the front of my car and sent him into a coma and it triggered a heart attack what a baby we have to shoot our way out and fortunately CJ is an absolute unit my boy Ken here most definitely isn't an absolute unit as he keeps spraying me with a fire extinguisher extended exposure to potassium bicarbonate can build up lactic acid and trigger cardiac arrest read a book ken look guys it's me reaching for high-quality content to post on my channel I clean up the sin d'arco family but on the way home I get hungry and stop at Burger shot is it just me or is this fast-food attendance the most beautiful woman in the entire world her eyes say simp me daddy and her hat says leave the lights on the so yeah mission complete an eight thousand dollars richer I then stumble across this rapper Mad Dog and he is about to jump off the roof a Mad Dog what you doing up there for the universe I'm sure I'll jump it looks like it's on little old CJ to save the day once again there's a mechanic distracted on his phone and I need his truck there's so I viciously beat him to death to play it safe as risk minimization is paramount I then have to position the truck under Mad Dog to break his fall the top quality gameplay this is the self harm prevention at its finest the big man leaps off the roof and unfortunately I got my angles a little off and he dies quite horrific Lee oh boy around 2:00 and I park in the right spot nice and early to play it safe but get it slightly wrong and again mr. dog splatters onto my windshield yikes I remember as a kid I did consider being a crisis negotiator and for the sake of society as a whole I'm glad I changed my mind I Drive Mad Dog to the hospital and then just dump his body on the pavement for the paramedics to deal with I'm not going to go in with him I don't want to get blood all over my white socks and then have to soak them in Bleach that's a headache I do not need this hospital is actually right near my girlfriend's house so I decide to swing by and see how she's doing upon arrival I noticed the love heart icon is no longer on the mini-map and then I remember I killed her last episode wow if I had a nickel the next mission is also right here so it all worked out it's officer Tenpenny who's been blackmailing me because he's holding my brother hostage in prison somebody steps on me I gotta step on you getting a little edgy fellas oh wow I'm helping these cops save my brother but I feel like I'm the one who needs saving and punched in the gut and then verbally abused a both physical and emotional suffering right now my hardship is making prison look good they want me to go and steal some Intel a government agent has found exposing them for being corrupt also don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do i sexually identify as a train now and if you tell me otherwise I'll go off the rails Wow don't forget to Like and subscribe for more great train puns anyway I shoot a bunch of police officers and then have a high-speed helicopter chase with the government agent as he tries to escape this guy was definitely not the hide-and-go-seek MVP as he just lands on the roof and I kill him and steal the Intel the MVP of hide-and-go-seek is my dad 17 years on and I still haven't found that crafty devil anyway my boy a blind woozi wants to meet with me and so I scoot on over to the four dragons casino he's prepared the paperwork and I'm now officially a part owner of this ethical establishment nice I get a call from my English mates and apparently the situation is looking pretty grim with the Mafia and they weren't exaggerating either things are definitely getting tense the mob boss Salvatore Leone has become quite the little mr. cranky pants and so I say I'll do a few errands for him to prove my trust the next thing I know I'm jumping from aircraft to aircraft so I can assassinate a hit squad that's out to get Salvatore a welcome to Fast and the Furious 25 actually now in Fast and the Furious 25 they'll all probably just have superpowers in Fast and the Furious 26 they'll finally all become the creator himself God so I take out their hit squad and jeez this man pays well you can't be mad the corrupt cops are in my ear again and want me to meet them in the desert which I do it's not looking great for old cow Johnson they want me to dig a grave for myself and this other police officer that they're not happy with I get a chance to break away and end up in a high-speed chase to take down officer Pulaski which is a real treat as I hate this guy he's driving the world's strongest car I swear I can't do any damage to this thing I wish he was driving the cyber truck and finally though I get the big girl and it's extremely satisfying any last requests yeah you were [ __ ] to the so I need to go and rescue my English friends ASAP as their situation has somehow gotten even worse they are now being held hostage I decide the fastest way to get back to the Caligula Casino is to break into the army base and steal one of their tanks the army are really good sports as they won't attack you until after you have the tank into leaving the compound it's this kind of fair play that gives me faith in humanity imagine if you were an FBI agent and were told to try and perform a PIT maneuver on a rhino tank and that'd be like sending children to war wait again mad respect to the army for not following me inside the four dragons casino and instead respecting my boundaries and the security however are not happy with me which makes no sense as I own this place so I'm basically paying them to kill me Kinki of the Mafia then asked me to go to Liberty City and wipe out a rival family I tell them I need my English friends to come with me for assistance and Salvador says that's fine I think he's misunderstanding the core concept of taking hostages here but anyway my friends escaped and now I've got to go to Liberty City for this hit it's one of the cooler missions as you actually have to fly across the ocean all the way there I really hope GTA 6 has different continents that you can visit that'd be really cool like imagine heading over to China and making out with a bunch of babes and bros and bringing back the weight now just kidding too soon so I storm the restaurant and do what I do best the spam left trigger and right trigger a CJ instantly snapped locks onto enemies with unbelievable ease I love the music that's playing while I carry out such violence I actually lost my virginity to that same song my uncle just loves classical music I guess so yeah this is all you see of Liberty City but still pretty cool that there was a little trip I like it avoiding two weeks of self isolation like a boss I get ready for the elusive casino heist and then out of nowhere my brother suite calls from his prison cell so man you okay not really I'm stuck in a Cell between two lunatics and people keep trying to jump me this [ __ ] ain't cool partner I have a nice life geez what a selfish guy I'm about to rob a casino and he chose this exact moment to pile on a bunch of emotional guilt tripping at this point I half hope he gets shanked does at least then my phone would stop blowing up with his [ __ ] for real though it's time to heist if you missed last video we prepped all this but in a nutshell I'm working with the Triads the girlfriend I killed was a former employee I took her keycard and now I'll pretend I work at the Caligula casino to walk right through the front doors I actually used to drive a car the exact same as this in high school I got suspended for drifting it in the dirt carpark and guess who ratted me out my little sister I still haven't gotten my revenge yet but as soon as she has a kid I'm selling it so I make my way through the Caligula blending in seamlessly by jogging at a moderate pace I don't think I've ever seen a car dealer jog in a casino before but they really should cardio is great for you I pop some knockout gas in the air vent and the guards fall unconscious and suddenly I get flashbacks of classical music I'm sure it's nothing the Triads then cut the power and I have a pair of night-vision goggles at the ready I then commandeer a forklift to let the boys boys boys in and it's game on as they're alerted to our presence I've gone over the layout to this place so I know it back to front everybody follow me I love how Rockstar just constantly make jokes at woozi's expense because he's blind so wholesome this heist was pretty revolutionary for GTA and you see the same formula being used in games all the time now I kill many more mafia members and cover blind woozi and the boys so they can escape incognito with the cash I have to fight my way to the roof as the distraction which is just the ultimate stitch up hey CJ we're going to calmly drive away big fella you go to the roof and fight the mob and the police by yourself man blind people are such dicks I enjoy a can of sprite as mass homicide is thirsty work and being dehydrated is the last thing I need right now I get onto the roof and the police choppers spotlight is brighter than my future as a content creator I just unleash mag after mag into the light it's almost as if I'm firing an m4 assault rifle into the gates of heaven which seems symbolic no idea however the game shows me where I have to parachute so I can escape in a chopper I attempt the jump but get it all wrong and fall extremely short again this could be symbolic like I'm leaping reaching for a better future a world full of love where you can pick up hookers and they won't assume you just want sex and instead they're open-minded enough to invest in a long-term friendship I arrived at the meetup place and it looks like the heist is complete as CJ then punches zero in the face you've got to love this man's energy so $100,000 in the bank and I'm now the richest I've ever been in this GTA series thanks to the highest I do get a phone call from mob boss Salvatore saying he's going to kill me my family and my kids but joke's on him I don't have any kids or at least none that I love anyway next episode we're returning to Los Santos and Grove Street to rescue sweet and take down Big Smoke I'm genuinely so excited for all that otherwise I hope you legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive shout-out to those who support me on patreon until next time and as always stay close [Music]
