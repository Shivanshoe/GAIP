[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta 5. if you enjoy this video please write modest pelican gaming on your bad chest strip off and then get baptized as many times as humanly possible as this really helps spread the good word of my channel michael de santa a former most wanted bank robber who faked his own death so that he could retire and live a peaceful life of luxury with his family in los santos i'm a good man now who upholds a strict moral compass and looks out for thy neighbor you see this woman smoking a cigarette well i gently remind her that she should find a healthier hobby and perhaps get a vape pen big girl so you can blow safe clouds just like the wee baby jesus did before i go home to my loving family i desperately need a haircut did you know it's apparently illegal to run over pedestrians in california they call it vehicular manslaughter or something hilarious like that anyway i get myself a new beard which looks thick and juicy just don't overthink the practicality of what just happened what do you mean i always give my video game avatar's facial hair as a way of vicariously enjoying the aesthetic benefits of a beard because i can't grow any hair on my face in real life i've got a pretty nice mansion i must say and now i'd like you to meet my family my wife amanda and daughter tracy who do be looking thick wait how old is tracy okay she's 22 years old so we're safe there now it's only weird because i'm her father also i lied about the loving family part we all hate each other but i do have a best friend forever old mate franklin and we decide to go and sink a few beers together it's at this moment that my disappointment of a son jimmy calls and informs me that he's been kidnapped it's always about him he's really self-centered see this is the key problem with having kids if you have a son they're careless and will probably end up getting themselves killed but if you have a daughter they end up dancing with their pants off on tick-tock while men in their 50s inappropriately comment about their physique and kind of like i did in the kitchen two seconds ago but it's okay when i do it because i'm rich we've taken my wife amanda's convertible and it becomes immediately apparent that the situation is far worse than we first thought you see that is my yacht being stolen and my son jimmy is inside of it and perhaps i could broker a deal where i swapped jimmy for the yacht it would be clean because no money would need to change hands but no best not to be selling teens to salvadorian gangsters i managed to save him but my car unfortunately dies and the boat is gone forever i choose to immediately forgive the boy and i definitely won't bottle up my resentment so that it comes out later in unhealthy and violent ways that'd just be poor parenting i head home and it's time to have some post-marital lights off missionary position physical relations with my gorgeous wife all of a sudden the penny drops and it becomes clear that she's been smashing her tennis coach i confront them both and then he jumps out the window breaking it and also breaking my favorite terracotta rectangular flower pot wow i decide to chase the man down and of course franklin is conveniently here as well i'm a bit of a mentor figure for him which is all sorts of ironic but at least he probably won't smash my wife too we're in hot pursuit and then this van pulls out without giving way first the sanctity of my marriage is destroyed by adultery then my petunias and now we're apparently not accounting for vehicles entering or approaching an intersection who have right of passage it's a slippery slope isn't it we find the tennis coach and he's hiding out on the deck of his mansion naturally we tie the cable from a winch to his deck and then use the truck to pull the entire front of his house off the cliff unfortunately it turns out that this wasn't the tennis coach's house it was owned by martin madrazo who's a mexican cartel leader when conflict like this arises it's best to embrace the conflict be open-minded and really listen without judgment to what each other have to say so common ground can be found i guess martin has never taken a conflict resolution workshop as he just sends some hitmen after us because he wants blood it seems that drug cartel leaders are pretty aggressive so i decide to take these backsies the destroying of his home he then comes around to my house and says no takes his backsies damn he's good he then hits me with a baseball bat which is pretty mean spirited so yeah there's now a pretty big issue as we owe mr angry pants 2.5 million dollars for the reconstruction of his property this forces me to call an old friend that you will know quite well lester the dodgy malacca who says he may be able to help us out i also beat these guys up as following the interaction with madrazo i now perceive myself as weak and the temptation to claim some sort of authority back for myself through bullying others is too powerful before we start thinking about raising the money i need to be a better daddy they don't call me papa peli because i'm a king in the bedroom it's actually much more literal in the sense that i strive to be a great father figure what better way to prove this than by spending a little quality boys time with my overweight son before we can properly bond i need to get even with him in regards to the lost yacht i proceed to take him to the luxury shopping district and find a suitable alley where i get out of my vehicle and kill him except rockstar are a step ahead and they don't allow me to actually pull the trigger when hovering over him i decide to shoot near him as a warning shot and fail the mission as jimmy got spooked what a big baby in the spirit of ivan the terrible if at first you don't succeed in killing your son simply try again i can earn the surprisingly fuel-efficient sedan off the pi in a noble attempt to drown my own offspring it's a sad day but no the big boy can swim wow you can't even murder your family in this game 0 out of 10 ign i'm really not having much success with drowning people on this pier lately ok fine i'll bond with him and we decide to rent bicycles and go for a ride along vespucci beach obviously i choose the bmx bike because this is basically an extreme stunt youtube channel let's be honest i momentarily consider letting him win but then instead take a shortcut and absolutely dominate him as this will help sculpt his fragile ego he then informs me that my daughter tracy is out on that yacht partying with a bunch of adult film directors i ask him for the company's name and also where they usually publish their videos so i can download them i mean i dive into the water so i can save her what great form on that dive as well i know there's a lot going on right now but michael should be proud of his form there was barely even a splash upon entry there's my girl i'm proud of the woman she's becoming i would normally be worried but thankfully she's wearing a fedora everyone knows it's physically impossible to get laid in a fedora i rescue the reluctant tracy and the psychopaths chase after us on jet skis firing at will i'm usually the one being unnecessarily violent so this is quite confronting for me i decide i can't be bothered out jet skiing these frat boys so i instead commit first degree murder in front of my child like i said i'm a pretty great dad my kids then have a fight on the public beach which is quite embarrassing and tracey's annoyed that jimmy snitched on her and quite frankly she's right jimmy you're a snitch who spooks easily i really am the glue that holds this family together and it's honestly exhausting unfortunately there's some live music happening on the pl which is just what the doctor ordered this man can strum like hendrix and has the voice of an angel what a treat my fellow citizens proceed to then turn on me for no reason whatsoever i literally just stood there in my sandals and cargo shorts keeping to myself and suddenly i'm getting gang-bashed by a bunch of men half my age i decide to pull out my handgun and do what i do best it's a shame too because beautiful voices like that are hard to find i feel like i just shot john mayer wow i really need to go and meet lester so i can start making some of that money back before the cartel bodies me i swing by the house on the way and amanda do be looking like a statue though seriously she just stands there like a statue for ages it's really weird i don't know if the game's glitched or if she's practicing mindfulness or something but save it for the bedroom at least tracy's working up a sweat and staying fit i'll position the camera here like this so that everyone can learn some great aerobic moves for their own workout routines i watched jimmy sleep for a good half hour and then hit the road while driving to leicester's house a woman screams out for help as a handbag has been stolen you know what it's probably time to start balancing out the old karma scales so i decide i'll get it back for her god i'm a great guy i return the money and she only gives me 50 dollars of the 500 as a reward sorry lady it's nothing personal just business this might look quite sadistic but don't you worry i reinvest the money into some solid investments with strong long-term prospects i arrive and for a big time bank thief lester isn't exactly living large he's quite a hermit and probably doesn't get out that much so i ask him if he wants to go for a joke he actually wants me to infiltrate the life invader headquarters aka the satirical company rockstar created to mock facebook first i've got to look the part and so i drive on over to suburban so i can dress up like a tech geek i also park my car correctly because traffic legislation was written for a damn reason i buy myself a red vest and combined with the bag slung lazily over my shoulder you can tell that i think big work smart i arrive at the headquarters and this man in the green shirt asks if i can fix his computer and i tell him that i can they've really gone for a chill work hip vibe office where people can unwind to maximize efficiency apparently they even have colorful glory hulls in the bathroom which is meant to stimulate casual yet productive conversation while employees are on break i assist this gentleman with closing his pop-ups and frankly the fact that he couldn't do this himself really makes me question his professional credentials i slip into the back room and plant the chip lester gave me you see life in vader are launching a new prototype phone and lester wants me to spoil the launch party by making the device fail the plan is to help him with this so that hopefully he'll help us rob a bank later i head home so that we can watch the launch and jay norris aka mark zuckerberg is up there speaking like a champion i proceed to activate the chief and all my days leicester you are off the rails mate apparently he did this so that he could short life invader's stock and make a fortune when the share price plummeted after this incident the important thing is he'll now help us rob banks and thanks so much to all of you who checked out my second channel i can't believe we're on the way to 100 000 subscribers already it's actually crazy i just uploaded a gta online video with the lads there yesterday so i'll link that in the top comment and description otherwise thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who
