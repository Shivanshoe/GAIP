[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with the Saints Row three remaster if you enjoy this video please commit several war crimes and then take as many media interviews as possible using your brief moment in the spotlight to aggressively promote my content as this really helps spread the good word of my channel ah Saints Row 3 what a throwback this is a remaster so the graphics aren't amazing and sure the framerate sometimes drops lower than the age of consent in Romania but it's a load of fun I also think we can all appreciate that literally every female character in this game has a thick juicy busty love through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can I get an amen alright so first thing I've got to create my character I accidentally make him look like an unlikable frat boy named chase so I try and balance out the cringe by setting his emot-- as the Carlton dance I am the feared leader of the 3rd Street Saints gang it's time to go and meet up with my mate stealth Amato and all my days it's genuinely hard to find the words to describe this you know the only thing sadder than this man's love life is the first 10 minutes of the movie up he is surprisingly agile for a big man though I'll give him that we seem to already be pretty hated by the feds because we shot loads of them in the face I guess but anyway first things first we need to buy some fresh clothes the storyline wise our gang has been kicked to the curb and we're trying to re-establish ourselves as the Alpha gamers this game is kind of like grand theft auto's hyperactive cousin who abuses attention deficit disorder pharmaceuticals but I'm ok with that we pull over and I try to coax Mato into jumping off this bridge because [ __ ] pranks are very in season right now he says the game won't let him so I try to jump and I successfully do so well bamboozled by a milady type that hurts we arrive at the planet Saints clothing store which is weirdly my own gangs brand labels we're kind of like a celebrity gang or something I don't know in the tutorial mission we robbed a bank with our right-hand man Johnny Gant and we wore giant Johnny Gat my to hide our identity disguising yourself as yourself that's a huge player during the bank heist I was even signing autographs people really loved us unfortunately for the fan Miguel Chandi is a bit on the jealous side which isn't fantastic for her overall health but still we're apparently kind of a big deal anyway my goal is to make myself look a little bit less like a frat boy and a little bit more like a respectable citizen I feel that I somewhat achieve this goal but nothing could have prepared me for this the Stealth our motto is the ultimate trol I think he's successfully created the worst video game avatar I have personally ever seen he's ten percent [ __ ] 20 percent refills 50 percent simple / online a girl's a five percent oppressor 15 percent lame and 100 percent reason why abortions shouldn't be illegal he says he'll change and while he does that I had outside to meet some of the good people of Stillwater city I've never been that great with the ladies that's why I was happy when my mum organised an arranged marriage for me I remember the first time I met my now wife was at the wedding altar she leaned over and whispered in my ear help your mum's crazy she kidnapped me this isn't even a part of our culture and I couldn't help but giggle in joy because in that moment I knew she was the one anyway things have really escalated as I've started some sort of gang war the Stealth Amato saves me and he is now happy with his appearance featuring a dominant green Fedora even though our gang colour is purple let's not overthink it we proceed to do what any real gamer does when they first play an open-world game run around being as violent as possible despite this being incredibly good cardiovascular exercise we need to go and meet our boy Pierce one of the gang's lieutenants he's found this sedan for us and wants to modify it and now I didn't just recently break in to the top 10 best eastern Mediterranean cooking YouTube channels because I lacked the ability to modify a fully sick car I proceeded to modify perhaps the most generic sedan you've ever seen but you'll get us from A to B but baby bang the planet Saints clothing shop again Wow but I guess this is what unscripted organic gameplay looks like I put a basketball jersey over my shirt which is questionable and then the Hulk attacks us this big girl is literally throwing cars around which is quite badass not as badass as me though the other day I scanned my avocados as potatoes at the self-serve checkout and when I walked out I looked directly into the bag checkers eyes and said thank you have a great day easiest two dollars and 40 cents I've ever saved jayjay mission complete and we get paid in the currency of the streets respecting women I'm liking mottos new ninja look but I'm not liking this apartment I feel like an internationally famous gang should live somewhere a little bit more luxurious that being said in one of the cutscenes earlier my character tried to withdraw literally 1 million dollars from an ATM so I believe he lacks the core concept of I guess money I test to say if I can upgrade the apartment and I instead access the garage and drive out and I kid you not a heavily third Street Saints decorated tank my boy Pierce just had me spend all my money on a family sedan yeah we had this stored in the guest car park all along we need a high rocky restructure but anyway things just turned up to 11 out of 10 everything about this gameplay moment is completely immersive except for stealth Amato's purple cat backpack I mean come on a purple cat that's not at all believable there's no such thing as purple cats wow they try to market this game as the most realistic world war ii shooter of the decade but quite frankly my immersion is ruined I decide to see if the tank is M fibia switch it is not the only thing that could beat us was a freshwater river how poetic the pier says he may know how we can upgrade our crib actually no I'm too white to say crib upgrade our principal place of residence for tax purposes first though he wants us to go on a reality game show and I'm low-key hoping for the bachelor I'd love for motto to be the bachelor so I could watch him get friend-zoned by 30 different women let's be real though this is saints row of course the gameshow is excessively violent we have to dodge traps fire and also kill these people in mascot costumes with actual real bullets what the holy heck is going on here are now riddled with guilt are taking another human's life for entertainment this is barbaric and honestly a human rights issue the commentator then says all of the mascots are just homeless people and thank God dude that's a huge weight off my shoulders with that done it's time to find ourselves a new home one of our rival gangs has a multi-story penthouse and we're about to crash what looks like an extremely non family-friendly event Kanye's song power starts pumping out of nowhere and quite frankly it turns this mission into one of the most epic things I've ever played of course for copyright reasons I can't share this amazing experience with you I can only describe how good it was so yeah if you could please just use your imagination and sort of envisage how dope this could be for you right now but of course it's not it's just my voice I think there's a lesson to be learned here though as a game developer if you want a mission to pop off just play a banger in the background the next time I have post-marital sex I'm just going to put on an absolute tune to try and make things seem more epic in fact I'll put on 25 second edited versions of the songs I play so it seems as if I'm lasting an impressively long time damn music is a beautiful thing isn't it it's at this moment motto and I discover our favorite game mechanic yet I don't know why this is so satisfying but sometimes the best things in life are the simplest we kill about 50 more incredibly thick villains I actually don't think the invention of the female jeans or Church sweaters ever made it to Stillwater but look these outfits are great for summer the mansion is now ours and finally the homies and I have a place to strategically plan our next calculated hostile takeover just kidding penthouse high which means it's a great place to throw watching a fat man throw another fat man off a balcony it's these moments that make you believe in a higher power I love our new mansion but here at moist penguin gaming we focus heavily on censorship and a little birdie told me there's a strip club down the road now unless the strippers have married all of their clientele in some sort of mass Mormon relationship it sounds like we've got ourselves a classic case of premarital lap dancing going on boys and girls it's time to investigate and what better vehicle to take than the customized Saints veto jet yes I said veto jet you'd think this would be an endgame reward but nope it's good to go right now I've actually got a lot of experimental weaponry now like this octopus launcher which I feel has so much potential in Japanese cinema I love how Saints Row takes everything so far over the top we had to help one of our boys with a drug deal and rather than ride in his car we sat side by side in an attack chopper firing rocket-propelled grenades at the peasants below when we landed we proceeded to rappel over the side of the building and snipe enemies from a mile away because that's just a cooler way of dealing drugs I won't even buy weed unless the dealer has to quickscoping alpha Chad's hanging off the side of a high-rise shooting my haters anyway it's time to pull out our Bibles and water bottles and head on over to this strip joint using my enhanced situational awareness i juiced that this is the location to let you in on the secret it's the giant swinging prostitute that gave it all away Wow look at the kind of people this sinful behavior has attracted you wouldn't expect a female-dominated crowd yet here we are so step one is to love the patrons into a false sense of security the best way to do this is to become one of them motto proceeds to take the stage and deliver one of the most moving striptease performances that has ever been conducted in public don't worry I'm crying emotional happy tears as well now with no one suspecting a thing we've received to teach these dodgy malakas a lesson they won't soon forget maybe next time they feel like going out they'll go to the book store and read a wholesome historical fiction novel about why communism is good I mean it was very nostalgic playing a saint's row game again feel free to leave a comment down below if there's any games you want me to check out in the future thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on
