[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with assassin's creed valhalla if you enjoyed this video please become a nurse and threaten patients that you will unplug their life support if they don't subscribe as this really helps spread the good word of my channel welcome to my viking settlement in england we play as evo and this is my crew of lovable scandinavians who might look tough but have hearts of gold well i mean we do murder entire families together and steal their belongings but hey we all have long silky hair worthy of a pantene commercial so it's kosher it's a pretty wholesome little settlement honestly here's a group of young kids enjoying the sunshine and sure in three months or so the boys will be laying down their lives for thor and the girls will be forced into arranged marriages against their will but at least we have a pet cat you can't upgrade this place but i have no resources at the moment so we'll need to head out on an expedition soon i spend the money i do have building wells absolutely everywhere for convenient hydration also look at the sleeping quarters this is pretty rough that's like eight people to one room and there's no mattresses just hey it's like we're trying to develop early onset osteoporosis but i guess this is just how it is for our kind our leader wants to speak with me and so i head up towards her hut she says we need allies and tells me to get it done what a tyrant also wow i guess we used all the pillows and blankets for her california king bed what a snake i'm literally sleeping one foot from an overweight pervert called lockheed hooray democracy i head down to the docks but unnecessarily climb everything instead of taking the path because assassins creed it's time the crew and i went out and did a little pillaging and so we set sail in our viking longship it's a bit of pill to swallow but i guess i'll just have to accept that i need to obey the orders from my superior i mean i did try and assassinate her before we left but she takes arrows to the face like a champ a short way up the river i see a small village and do what all good vikings should do a blow into my horn to pump up the crew for some good old-fashioned pillaging i really feel as if we could have run to the front of the boat and jumped straight onto the land completely avoiding getting soaking wet but i guess it's not nearly as cinematic the village has a surprisingly large resistance force but i focus down the tougher opponents in an attempt to keep the rest of my crew alive i don't mean to disrespect my opponents but their last stand might be the fastest and most pathetic thing i've ever seen in my life and i've made love next to a mirror i mean i do obviously train my glutes pretty intensely look at this vertical leap it was one-way traffic i want to loot the monastery but it's bad so i climb up onto the roof unfortunately the enthusiastic malaccas have already started lighting everything on fire and it's like they learned nothing in basic raiding training the first you kill everyone then you loot and then finally you burn everything it's really crucial you don't confuse the last two steps unfortunately we get the booty just in time and pocket some of that sweet sweet raw materials you know that classic proverb take only what you need and leave the land as you found it i'm pretty sure the vikings didn't hear that one it's back to finding an ally which means back to the open water well rivers aren't really open water but the important thing is i figured out how to shoot arrows while sailing i'm not sure how useful this will be yet but i do enjoy the viking life because being unnecessarily violent increases the immersion for once i decide to make a quick stop and proceed to dive into shallow water which can easily cause injury on impact or even hypoxia aka low oxygen to the brain way to think it through evo anyway i stopped so that i could climb this tower and do the iconic swan dive into an implausibly small pile of hay at this point i can't tell if my mission is to form an alliance or do as much damage to my spine as humanly possible i do gather some iron ore because women love a man with 99 mining as it shows dedication and then we continue downstream i arrive at some sadie city and proceed to completely miss the dock because i failed to press y in time eric the red eat your heart out i'm not exactly welcomed here so i put on a sketchy hood to make myself seem more friendly and approachable and then head into town there's this drunk guy stumbling about and there's also an option to lure him which of course i do i feel like one of those 40 year old guys who hangs out at university bars preying on intoxicated women aka real estate agents the architecture of this city is nice but it's frankly pretty disgusting that they don't like having my kind here so what we don't conform to a traditional western lifestyle if this was 2020 you'd all be getting the worst punishment imaginable you'd all be getting cancelled on twitter i don't want to overstay my welcome so i steal a horse and start the long ride to find my friends in the city of repton the journey is long and harsh i even paddle a small boat for a bit which looks picturesque as but is wildly inefficient i finally arrive and everyone here is pretty weird of course these are my allies god forbid we get some majestic city no we get the muddy tent palace but i guess this is way more viking-like maybe the people here are nice on the inside and after all that's what matters the most it turns out they're definitely not and are also really into prolonged torture they will however ride with me to threaten and or negotiate with a king down the road about the whole alliance thing i'm actually starting to think that the term alliance is being used very loosely by my people but it's best not to ask too many questions we ride out and i accidentally trample a small fence which i feel terrible about someone lovingly crafted that and there i go ruining it all i know we're vikings but there's a line i also remember that you can slab squat on horses which will never get old for me we reach the castle and begin negotiations which in a nutshell doesn't go very well and basically we let them know that we'll be sieging their fortress this afternoon i'm no warlord but giving them a heads up like this seems like a strange decision i.e the element of surprise ah well there's no such thing as overconfidence and that's coming from someone who faps with the lights on and the curtains open i ride off to meet our captain but on the way spot a simply idyllic country cottage wow talk about location only 250 meters from the city which of course is about to be saged but imagine the long-term growth prospects it's got a little field out the front of what i'm hoping is opium and you know what maybe i might just make a little life for myself out here i could become an opium farmer and be the first ever vikings narcotics dealer now we better sage this castle and so i head on over to our war camp and let them know that i'm ready sieging thoughts is good clean fun you can use the ram to batter doors down but i'm obviously just going to climb everything i then just sneak around and let my crew in easily think big work smart maybe i should rebrand to one of those cringe cryptocurrency type motivation channels where some knob wearing a tommy hilfiger polo tells you what you're doing wrong in life in front of his mom's 2006 bmw i sometimes get interested in the price of bitcoin and for like two weeks after i google the price i'm bombarded with those type of ads you know what i'm going to become one of those guys so i encourage you to invest smart buy my financial ebook releasing fall 2021 which will be 248 pages of copy and pasted wikipedia articles and spongebob erotica fan fiction the fight is getting pretty hectic so i decide to sneak away and kill the big girl in charge to put an end to this once and for all after a long gruelling fight we successfully seige the castle and put the guy who likes to torture civilians in charge what could go wrong my work here is done and it feels good to be successfully playing the game of thrones like the show get it what a cool pop culture reference in a youtube video how relatable except every time i think about that show it gives me clinical depression because season 8 hurt me more than any of my childhood traumas ever could it's finally time to go back to my modest cottage and smoke a little opium now i mean it's time to go and lead the viking invasion some more first i decide to head back to my settlement and just check in to see how everyone's getting on you know install a few more wells that sort of thing you can build all sorts of things here that can improve your stats and the well-being of your camp and crew most importantly the local sculptor ensures his statues have their clothes on not like that unholy statue of david not only is that statue inappropriate it's also a huge flex like geez dave we can't all have massive peonies you show off i get some ink put on so that i can look like a troubled teen and i sure hope the other vikings don't judge me for it this guy i went to school with has face tats and he always puts up posts saying that people judge him unfairly and it's like aaron bro you stabbed your brother and went to prison for it they're not judging the face tats you're just genuinely a psychopath in truth only good people have face tats mother teresa face tats jesus face tats barney the dinosaur no face tats but a hectic stamp i had to remove and hide some armor pieces to show off this ink otherwise what's the point not ideal for battle but i look great okay i need to get some information off another leader but first i eat some mysterious mushrooms of the magic nature no joke i had a pretty good trip saw some seals flopping around but they don't belong on land what fun that's the base where the journal is being kept and honestly i just want to sage it as i'm not that into diplomacy my friend has other ideas though so i guess we'll try talking first this is the leader and she calls me a lovely dove which i imagine is pretty misogynistic in this era well obviously not misogynistic as she's a woman but you know what i mean she wants 520 coins for the journal and so of course i say no this is an early access tutorial and i won't be able to keep any money so it's kind of pointless trying to save my wealth but it's a decision based on principle i also think she forgot that i'm a crazy good climber a beast assassin i have some vision that lets me see everyone and i can also whistle to lure people closer did you know around 50 of people can't whistle so if you can be proud of that i work my way through the camp this time finessing the situation rather than starting a full-blown medieval war it starts to rain which at the very least will be great for the wells back at the settlement that's definitely not how wells work but i mean whatever it can't hurt i stormed the main cabin and i'll admit i forgot i was here to steal a journal and not kill everyone anyway the camp will be easier to search with everyone incapacitated so it's not like i'm wasting my time this is definitely not a great way to make allies like my well-rested leader wanted probably should have paid the 520 coins this lass is pretty tough so i do the mature thing and climb up onto the roof and then shoot her with arrows from above just like a real viking would i also burn the body to ensure there'll be no open casket funeral for the family which again won't do a lot of good for the whole alliance democracy vision but it's quite amusing i grab all the information i can and sneak away without any trouble so it looks like everyone lived happily ever after and we're all allies now well not really at all i think i made relations much worse but i did build a new bakery so fresh sourdough loaves for everyone thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
