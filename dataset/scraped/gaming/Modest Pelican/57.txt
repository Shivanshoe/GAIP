one of you intimately and i can't thank you enough i asked the good people of my discord server to ask me any question they wanted and so i'm going to answer those now yeah so i'll get rid of my face now because you're probably sick of looking at me uh patette starts us off with why did you start youtube i've always loved gaming and i've always just enjoyed making people happy with my mouth as in speaking of course but um yeah and i just thought i'd combine those two things together and then seeing people just be happy when i uploaded my videos i was like oh [ __ ] like this is really fun i want to make this my job what made me choose the name modest pelican i usually just give meme answers to this so for once i'll answer it seriously i wanted something that wasn't at all similar to anything anyone else had and then modest pelican just popped into my head and i was like this this could work do i enjoy making videos oh absolutely man absolutely love putting stuff together uh the feeling of pressing publish and just seeing everyone happy is yeah it's the best which youtubers would you like to get to know and play with the most well my favorite youtuber or streamer is t90 he does like age of empires 2 commentary which is really random but he absolutely slays it i'm a massive fan of his so it would be great to get a beer with him for sure why are my parents clapping uh they're just they're just so proud of you and the man you've become what are your future plans for the channel and where do you want it to go well i'm really grateful and happy with how things have gone but i sometimes get like almost not overwhelmed but it's like oh my god we just hit a million subscribers and i'm just still some dodgy malacca just banging these videos out on like my computer and xbox and stuff but um i really just want to keep improving the quality of my content keep having fun with it like i really enjoy what i'm doing i'm really happy to have the second channel papa peli like talking to you guys live on twitch and then turning that into content is really cool so yeah just yeah i'm just excited for 2021 for sure when was your first girlfriend and how long have you been with your current my current girlfriend and i have been together for about five years she's the best we'll probably get married eventually but um my first proper girlfriend was probably in year 12. i remember i went over to her house and she was trying to like orchestrate some alone time for us and her dad just came into the kitchen like two meters from where we were sitting and just starts chopping this watermelon with the biggest knife you've ever seen and just looking me dead in my eyes i was like be careful you don't cut your finger off like you're not even looking at what you're doing and it was it was pretty intimidating he was like ex-military but i still hit it can you send me water i live in africa um and funny that you bring this up i really want to do some uh like hydrating africa charity streams so look out for that in 2021. what did you study in college uh well i studied architecture for two years but i was kind of pretending to be a student just to get my family off my back and then i went ahead and completed an accounting degree it was actually really fun and enjoyable accounting is really cool no i'm kidding it's terrible i was the only caucasian in my classes it was like me and 29 indians who are probably smarter than me and yeah really questionable choice where did the sons of virgins mate we actually all met online which is pretty crazy uh playing battlefield one but since then i've met them all heaps in person once or twice a year we try and like rent a house and have a big party which is really fun and yeah they're all absolute legends except maybe stealth omado when's the face reveal i'm just not quite ready to show my face yet i mean there's been some there's been some slip ups like this vlog for example i accidentally filmed myself doing all these different channels and then i accidentally edited it together and uploaded it to youtube but yeah like i'll show my face when i'm when i'm ready are you really a christian i'm a i'm a i'm a christian enthusiast what will happen if someone is dehydrated look it's definitely not where you want to be that's for sure but i think you take them outside and you you put a gun to their head and and pull the trigger the favorite part about being a youtuber this is going to sound kind of corny but it's just genuinely the community like you build a brand and a channel and then it's like you know a community forms around you and you just get to like interact with them and like people joking about hydration and jesus and that is some that's some wholesome [ __ ] what are your cat names well i've got two cats we've got mochi who we saved from a rescue shelter and we've got fat tony who just showed up at our house and wanted food and then he lost the weight so we changed his name from fat tony just just to tony where do you get the sarcastic australian virgin voice from well when i very first started making videos i couldn't figure out how to like record my voice while i played live it just sounded terrible um so i just did the post commentary because i was just messing around anyway and yeah here we are today have you ever received an accidental dick pic from one of your mates and got secretly aroused oh for sure i think you know multiple times a week we'll accidentally send each other a dick pic i accidentally got in the shower with one of them for like 10 minutes and yeah i've accidentally made obviously sweet love to all of them so yeah there's been there's been a few slip ups what is the hydration memes origin well i genuinely do drink a weird amount of water like five six liters a day like i'm so thirsty all the time and i can't tell you how privileged i feel to be able to drink so much water and i want other people to stay hydrated and stay healthy and i know it's a joke but like i swear to god i actually really want to want to hydrate the world have you ever been sexually aroused in church it's kind of a weird question because like imagine being flaccid in church that'd be so embarrassing what's your favorite game now this is a really hard question but i think it'd be out of either grand theft auto san andreas or rocket league i play so much rocket league it's i'm so addicted it's the best when you reach one mil will you continue to read comments i think instead of doing that i'll just develop an ego and become like really unrelatable and like flex my like women and money and my like average sized dick all the time and like become like a cringe youtuber i'm really excited for the future what's the dumbest thing you've ever done slash regret the most i was once riding around on a quad bike on a greek island mykonos and i rear-ended this car and there was like this big scene the police came they took out passports and phone and they were like flashing their guns around because we were pretty unhappy because it was like a low speed chase there was no damage i mean crash but yeah they were like trying to make me pay like a lot of money so i tried to come up with this scheme where we're gonna sneak off a greek island and i tricked them like phase one worked i tricked them into giving our passports and phone back and then i was gonna sneak off on this ferry or i was trying to get a speedboat and then mum called and she was on the phone with the like a three-way call with the australian embassy and they were like who the do you think you are jason bourne like pay the money you can go to jail for this so yeah i guess i regret almost trying to escape a greek island make and only fans i don't think there's a market for it but should the views drop and i get desperate i'll start spreading those butt cheeks how tall are you i'm five foot one is your mic broken or did your voice just decide to be lower than my self-esteem look i don't know what goes on with my voice i just whatever whatever's happening i just talk and that's it is what it is what's been your favorite series you do on your channel i think my ongoing favorite is of course the sons of virgins because i just love playing with my mates and getting them involved why are you so into hitman uh it's one of my favorite franchises of all time i've been playing hitman since i was so young and i love making content on it and playing it plus like just man to man respectfully agent 47 has a great dick on him are you dating stealth omado look i don't like to put labels on it but we do go out for a lot of dinners we do have a lot of lovemaking we do introduce each other to each other's families as our partner so make of that what you will how does it feel to have gathered a large following and do you ever feel overwhelmed if so why i was talking about this earlier i think there was a brief moment when i started to get traction where i started to feel a little bit stressed because there was like expectations but fortunately for me that really didn't last very long i'm really lucky that naturally i'm a pretty happy person and i just like making other people happy so if i can make someone's day a little bit better then and that's my job then what a great wicket to be on and yeah i think i'll wrap up the q a there i just want to say thank you again so much for helping me reach this milestone and just being so supportive like i do just have an insane community you guys are amazing i hope you all have a great christmas or had a great christmas and a good new years until next time and as always stay classy
