before i get into the video i need to address the elephant in the room i don't often get involved in internet drama but sometimes i have to in order to protect my brand so as some of you know i photoshopped my friend stealth omado's face onto the queen of england i innocently did this to boost engagement on my last video marta didn't appreciate it and he went ahead and photoshopped to my face on tamir khalifa's body which really upset me as i'm pretty sure she's had premarital relations before i guess it's official stealth omado and i are beefing i ask that you all please take the high road though be mature and if you see him in the street please physically assault him thanks guys we have the best community in the world here meet thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories i wake up in my auto shop ready to kill some kids because that's kosher and gta online i would never try and kill kids in the real world as i imagine they'd be surprisingly fast and would escape and tell their parents who tell the cops and you'd wind up in an interrogation room trying to explain why you had a rope duct tape and a straight back knife in your car it's time to go and meet the boys i find will and he's driving shaniqua shaniqua is obviously the ute and was the first ever vehicle i purchased in gta online mine was painted green so it wasn't as racially insensitive but she was a good car a bunch of gangsters proceed to attack us because they're jealous they're part of the family street gang and it's sad that they went straight to violence without first exploring alternative conflict resolution strategies read a book we go and meet mato who's also driving his car and so naturally i blow it up [Music] you're literally on fire [Laughter] reminded me of the seat of the scene in fury with it you just reenacted the scene from fury dude if you haven't seen fury that was a perfect recreation of an iconic scene in order to get ourselves mentally prepared for the prison heist we decide to hit the golf course this is also great for our mental health because we can't go outside as we're on lockdown i've been in lockdown for three weeks and i'm not joking carbo and mato have been in lockdown for 248 days i'm lucky not to be living in their state right now but please pray for my boys and maybe write a nice message for them in the comments i've just committed capitalism the nice messages will boost my videos engagement and help me get views and i think that says a lot about society let's segue to an exciting golfing segment [Music] i love the tribal tattoos you're like the widest guy i know if you hit this you win everything you can have anna if you win this you get anna she's like i'm just people trapped here to you yeah all you gotta do is just put the ball in the whole wheel it's not that hard oh he's done it boys he's done it thank you ladies and gentlemen um i may have just bet you in a game of gta golf to will and um he hit the shot so you're his now say that again i bet you in a game of virtual golf to will and he won so now you're his he's what he is like you're his person she sounded relieved almost that was weird now feeling energized and relaxed it's time to break into prison after [ __ ] around for an additional 45 minutes or so we head towards the auto shop some of you might know a content creator and a professional speed runner called dark viper au he's a good mate of mine but i've been subtly trying to push the narrative that i'm the better speedrunner than him i've never actually attempted to speedrun anything but i'm not going to let that get in the way of my agenda okay who do you think's about a speedrunner me or dark viper are you have you ever speed run anything i'm trying to push a narrative that i'm the better speedrunner and you guys aren't backing that up yeah but it's a narrative i want to push heavily all right jeff sorry let's redo that jeff hey do you think who do you think's better dark viper or me i like dyslexic to the question [Laughter] we arrived back at the auto shop and we couldn't be more ready well maybe not mato as he's curled up in the fetal position questioning his life choices hashtag pray for stealth omado our first mission is to get our contact little d purposely sent to prison so we have a contact inside the facility lil d wants us to first help him with some of his errands the big guy only has a two seater car though and so of course i try to take the boys with me but they have terrible balance this is probably one of the saddest moments that's been captured and put on the internet they'll have to take a separate car it turns out his errands are pushing drugs and i can't help but feel like we've been swindled we decide to big dick the narcotics deal by shooting some bullets but mato decides to use a grenade launcher therefore killing everyone and failing the mission on top of that he still can't balance maybe he really is the queen of england a thick handsome but terribly uncoordinated i go and grab lil d again and help him with his deals the great thing about pushing dope is that it's profitable yet also a victimless crime meanwhile the lads have been getting themselves a new ride are you ready to see how fabulous we look right now i'm ready fabulous [Laughter] all right we're going to go to this gang hideout lil d may have bitten off more than he can chew here as it looks like he's selling straight to the los santos vargos gang predictably it goes horribly wrong you might be thinking hey pelly how do you know so much about drug deals while i actually used to sell the devil's lettuce i was basically the australian pablo escobar you see i got transferred to a really christian school halfway through my education and a lot of the students there were super innocent like these kids had never seen a bad thing in their life all of a sudden they wanted to experiment with alcohol and weed and that's where pablo peli came in i'd buy the goods off my public school friends and then traffic it across to the private school and sell it for inflated prices there i'd sell one puff of a joint to kids two years older than me for like ten dollars and they'd thank me profusely anyway we drop lil d at the police station so he can turn himself in and then eventually get sent to prison we then head back to the auto shop stop right there burglar watch out stop right there burglar you sound like an npc we have got you rounded quick follow him why do you sound like a robot they have actual voice actors they're not robots stop write that quick why are you putting on a robot voice you sounded more like an npc when you weren't trying to be an npc [ __ ] [Laughter] it's time for the second heist preparation where we must steal a ramp truck so we can jump cars into the prison the good news is gezzo decided to join us every friend group needs someone like jezo he's a top bloke but also a weapon at any game he seems to play and he carries our group on his shoulders like he was a tibetan sherpa we arrive at the movie studio to steal a ramp truck and start eliminating enemies mardo proceeds to pull out his grenade launcher and i'll admit i also got a little carried away we destroy absolutely everything again including the truck we're here to collect a great energy but change is needed pull out a melee weapon no melee weapon i don't think did i [ __ ] stutter no nothing explosive you're being down you're being here you're being downgraded to a torch stop right there that's your this is your life now take two it's dealing the ramp trucks and the dodgy malaccas have perched up in the drains amato and i exit the car and rush the enemies with our torches out which is low-key stunning and brave whenever i get torches i think of fleshlights because i always get ads for them not even on adult websites or anything i get them emailed to me i also get a lot of christian dating sites always emailing me that i've apparently signed up for you guys are very funny anyway the boys and i were talking the other day and we came up with an invention that i honestly think could take the adult toy market by stop flashlights that are also flashlights we'll call them fleshlights it's so genius that i'm surprised five-minute crafts haven't already done it we steal the ramp truck as moto majestically commutes to prison with gezo in a helicopter i realize i have a chance to do something kind of cool there's no real point to this but i feel like it's important to make your own fun sometimes like for example you're taking out the trash but it's dark so you take out your flashlight and then realize you're alone bam flashlight comes in clutch i need to pattern that asap we head back to the auto shop as it's now time to break into the prison the description for the final part of this mission gave us all brain aneurysms get in clip them and get these fat ass out of there we bout to hit them rats with lil pied piper [ __ ] we take off in our cars and get ready to jump into the prison yard we all line up as we want to make sure this is as cinematic as possible i feel as if the prison might also want to brush up on their security a little bit i don't know how long this ramp truck has been parked here for but the fact that no one sounded the alarm since we rocked up is worrying not quite the remarkable entrance i had envisaged but fortunately i'm a bit of a wizard with imovie and i was able to seamlessly splice the two clips together we drive around the prison looking cool for a while before eventually locating the targets gone are the days of slipping one of the inmates a packet of cigarettes in exchange for shanking someone in the shower the future of prison murders is absolutely sick drifts we even stop using guns for a while and only take down targets with our vehicles then in a moment of pure sadness stealtho-cabo dies and we don't have any lives we continue on to the last target but the big girl is smarter than the others and has gone up high where our cars can't do sick drifts we head upstairs and i try to organize a quick team building exercise whereby we all shoot this guy multiple times with our shotgun at once the stealth omato however has other ideas with boys boys boys dead everywhere i can safely say that today is comparable to 480 bc where 40 000 persians drowned in a single day we escaped the prison by shooting the control panels next to the gate because that's how control panels work and trust me i'd know i'm the guy who invented fleshlights our boy lil d is being transported in a prison bus so that he can get the electric chair this seems a bit much for a guy who turned himself into the police station but he doesn't have to worry as we're on route i take out the driver and say that lil d is the only person on the bus yet he still chose to sit in the middle and not the back i respect sitting right at the front because that's efficient and obviously at the back because then everyone knows you're a fully sick drift king but sitting in the middle on an empty bus is like putting milk in the bowl before your cereal maybe little d should be locked up we arrive at the drop off have an awkward cut scene where thick man's glasses are off which is a violation and then receive a call 157 thousand dollars for our troubles not bad i'm sure quite a few of you already know but stealth or cabo has a youtube channel if we could all please go to his last video and leave a mcdonald's order so that he wakes up to a bunch of orders that would be great he's one of my closest friends and makes great content so definitely recommend checking him out i love you all until next time and as always stay oh classy [Music]
