[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoyed this video please buy a cargo ship name it modest pelican and then get it stuck in the suez canal as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories before we get into finishing the heist i have a dream that i want to turn into a reality i've always wanted multiple thick men that could definitely be taken out of context but the reason is i want to pull a wholesome family-friendly prank on my good mate stealth omado originally i was going to sneak into his apartment in real life and put a bucket of water on top of his door so that when he opened it he got all wet once he was confused and soaked i was planning to slit his throat with a butter knife and take the cash from his wallet but due to travel restrictions i have to prank him in gta online instead so i reached out to the faithful members of my discord server calling for six or seven brave volunteers to assemble a thick man hit squad meet thick men fun fact you can't change your character's gender so we have some thick women who did their very best we all pile into a stealth chopper as it's important my mate doesn't realize what we're up to until it's too late the plan is to isolate mato in an open area and repel down from above taking him by surprise we do a few training exercises and then i ask if he's down to game he most certainly is i ask him to meet me at the casino car park so i can show him an easter egg and innocent stealth omato doesn't suspect a thing this plan reminds me of operation barbosa from world war ii but with far fewer war crimes although just as many cheap laughs as we approach the lz it becomes apparent that the thick man clone flying us isn't exactly pilot of the year as strange as he volunteered for the role but i guess that's the kind of confidence i strive to have one day we approach stealth omato as more and more thick men come out of the shadows in no time at all we have him completely surrounded i imagine this is the most intimidated and turned on he's been in his entire life we start to beat his car as a show of dominance there was most definitely some friendly fire between the thick men but their sacrifice won't go unnoticed then when he thinks it's all over when he thinks he can take a breath and relax i turn the boys on motto i wonder how much of my youtube content is mato and i going to elaborate lengths to kill each other the great thick man mato war raged on for quite some time we love you give us kisses now god counts [Music] eventually we decided to unite forces and take over some public servers we all pile into an suv and things were looking exceptionally cinematic until you guessed it one shot by a heat-seeking missile from a flying car now we have a new enemy amy1131 we head to the local gentleman's club but not to get cuddled by strippers while we cry or you know whatever normal people do at gentlemen's clubs no we turn the venue into a damn fortress so we can try an out toxic tactic the big girl amy is no match for our overpowered alien weaponry and textbook camping strategy as you can see we find this highly amusing oh my god i only just got one of our boys after a long day we head back to my yacht and all relax in the hot tub for a while a well-earned break and i sure hope everyone here gets recognition from their appropriate nations military as i think the medals should be handed out it's now time for the heist finale but first i finally got around to organizing some merch wow i'm sure glad i bought the new modest pelican match i wonder how this will affect my life going forward damn is that the new modest pelican t-shirt because if it is i want to have physical premarital relations with you that sounds great as you can see i also have the new hoodie wow that's impressive can i bring my hot european friend with me hi i'm the hot european friend and i love mozzarella wow my life rocks since i got the new modest pelican match so yeah we've got an embroidered hoodie and t-shirt and of course the much requested water bottle it's only available for two weeks so if you are planning on picking something up make sure you put your order in asap while waiting for the lads to arrive i chill in a public server unfortunately this man in tiny black shorts and a chic skivvy keeps shanking me he just b-lines it for my position and i'm forced to keep fighting him over and over again you've got to admire the lad's dedication to achieving his goals then out of nowhere stealth oh cabo arrives oh my god what is his lobby we drive over to my facility while waiting for stealth omado to finish watching hot tub streams or whatever sus activity he said he was up to imagine watching hot tub streams i would never i i honestly don't think a lot of her viewers realize she's even in a bikini in a hot tub no i think he was cooking dinner for his girlfriend because she wasn't feeling well what a symph i would never sin a big man english dave coles he wants us to go and retrieve some skate merchandise we've been helping dave out a lot lately and apparently there's a pretty cool reward when you finish all these tasks so we agree we arrive tactically and decide the best course of action is to slash everyone up with a machete i sometimes think in a previous life i was an african warlord you see i love slashing people with machetes i love nature i love the song africa by toto i'm an aquarius who according to people's choice means i'm a visionary and see potential aka the long-term investment of child soldiers the great white pelican lives in africa i try to sell clothing and water bottles and they try and sell people via their extensive human trafficking network and i love a sense of unity the similarities are uncanny we deliver the skate merch to david and make our way back to the facility just one more heist prep and we'll be making millions or more like a few hundred thousand dollars but it's about the journey the last prep involves a large jet and a whole lot of bombing runs i'm not the best pilot in gta online but fortunately i have my two encouraging friends who believe in me i know i joke around a lot on this channel but these lads are more than just friends they motivate me to be the best person i can be if you fly this is going to take so long well this is so jittery to i feel sick you just really bad at this that's it [Laughter] we are now ready for the main event i hop into a helicopter at sandy airfield and english dave calls again i like him but at this point it's a little suffocating he makes roman bellic look laid back he tells me that he has a reward waiting for me at the airport but i'll grab it after we're done with the heist i give the lads a generous 35 cut as i'm trying to get more into philanthropy for example last week when i was fapping to my best mate's girlfriend's instagram i made sure to like a few of the pics we decided that it would be fun to drive all the matching jugulars we bought last video as it would be extremely cinematic boys let me just get in my chocolate boys roll out [Laughter] moped as we'll be infiltrating an incredibly well defended underground facility guarded by strong highly armed clones we get a special vehicle a god only knows why but we decided to choose the cool looking truck with a machine gun rather than the futuristic railgun tank we actually started paying for this decision before we even fought a single enemy it's hard to know who the worst driver in the group is but it's safe to say we're all pretty incompetent after cabo rolled the truck marto insisted on taking the wheel it was having a sack stop eating stop eating all your snacks man i'm just i'm just snacking stop eating all your snacks get in drive drive all right let's take one more second all right dude if you guys can have like stomach cramps bro all right give me smoke no why did we not take the tank i will never know look i'll expose you to her oh no after dying numerous times trying to get through this alley of hell we eventually make it to the finish line we immediately have to fight juggernauts and again it would have been incredibly handy to have a futuristic tank to obliterate these guys but we made our bed unfortunately that aimee girl isn't the only thing laser guns can drop quickly it's now time to make magic happen by sweating it up we are up against tough competition but it reminds me of a good story where the underdog came out on top back in the day i was having a gaming session with some viewers and then two really young people joined and started going at each other so hard me and all the other people just didn't know what to do i was trying to mediate these two little kids who were straight flaming each other they were so aggressive one of them starts crying and i'm thinking okay i've gotta separate them before i get the chance the crying kid gets called a [ __ ] at this point i'm pretty worried but then this little malacca balling his eyes out says through his tears you are what you eat it was so beautiful and one of the most heroic clapbacks i've ever witnessed and now usually we have crosby with us but given he's going through puberty or something the boys decide it's on me to do the hacking part of the heist i was far from efficient i get it done though but you can see how long it took from all the blood on the walls and flaws looks like a horror game with all the clones eliminated we get to use the orbital cannon which is fair and balanced unbelievably we are on track to do this first time but then cabo tragically takes his own life this triggers a potential rift through the sons of virgins as cabo claims he didn't cause the explosion yet when we restart at the checkpoint it doesn't look good for him and put that rocket launcher away will that's what you did dude you had that that's what happened i had to [Music] all right let's have a look at these boxes huh don't shoot them [Music] it turns out cabo was telling the truth i knew he was but i just love a good old-fashioned ruse we track down big boss avon but can't shoot him as the heat from his jet pack is too severe i guess getting shot a thousand times is fine but potentially seared eyelashes is where we draw the line but plus it sets up a cinematic finish which you know i'm obsessed with at the moment target eliminated now it's time to get our bag and also see what english dave's reward is we arrive at the observatory leicester says way too many lines and then we get paid 1.2 million dollars for our efforts i only get 360 000 though as i took a smaller cut because i'm selfless but now i've ruined that selflessness by saying that i'm selfless i then spawn back into the server much faster than the boys so i lay a trap and detonate it as they come in the pranks never stop and dave's reward for all the help is a hippie vw beetle which i can't be mad about it's pretty unique and has a surprisingly large amount of customization options thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
