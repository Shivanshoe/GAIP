[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican herewith journey to the savage planet if you enjoy this video please become a cruise ship captain and then only give people lifejackets who subscribe to me then sink the boat as this really helps spread the good word of my channel a massive thanks to the legends at 505 games for reaching out to me and sponsoring this video the games available to download on Xbox ps4 and PC right now so I spawn in as my avatar wakes from a nap naps not only increase alertness and creativity they can also reduce stress I guess this is our spacecraft and I'll be playing cooperatively today with my boy stealth Amato whose characters looking really skinny so we head over to the vending machine to get him a little snack kidding natto is the only little snack on this spaceship it also seems to be more broken than my parents marriage and on the pinboard there's a flyer that a guy called bill chanc has put up and he is looking for love he specifies he's a gentleman by day and a bad boy by night he's not lying either I can tell by his beard that bill here is an absolute freak in the sheets anyway it's time to exit the ship and explore basically we are a new recruit for the fourth-best space exploration company and our goal is to try and figure out if this planet is fit for humans mato gets busy fixing the ship and I get busy slapping him in the back of the head I give the javelin a quick diagnostic scan and learn that it really has seen better days I'm starting to realize why we're the fourth best interstellar space exploration company and not the best we crashed our spacecraft and as the only two survivors all we've done so far is slap each other silly it literally only took two minutes of us being stranded to resort to kinky violence we make our way into the icy cave and to ambushed by some chubby owls they're probably just scared and afraid so we kill them quickly by kicking them into the air the last thing they see before they splat onto the ground is the world cruelly spinning out of control underneath them wholesome content we're blocked from moving forward by some purple crystals so we used the resources we've gathered to craft a Nomad pistol back at the ship the pistol will be perfect for during our expedition I also used this opportunity to gun down motto because last week he sent me a message saying Pelle you're not even in my top 100 youtubers man I wish I was playing this game with mister steal yo girl aka Bill Chang we emerge from the icy caves and the journey to the savage planet title appears in the world I wish I had cinematic motivational messages like this appearing in my real day-to-day life like if big letters popped up and were like hey Jeff your nose might be exceptionally big but so is your heart anyway we begin exploring and our first inclination is to just start shooting all the plants us humans did this on earth and it wasn't like there was any repercussions lol good luck generation Z some of the plants even have hallucinogenic effects so I can confirm the dumb little birds from earlier enjoy getting absolutely lit stealth amato somehow dyes from said birds and so I go down to save him and immediately after I revive the big dog he shoots me with his pistol which I respect we continue slapping birds and eating orange slime but then we discover a new biome and decide to take an epic shortcut I wouldn't often advise jumping off a cliff unless you're hung like say Bill Chang but I decide to send it and remarkably using a well-timed clamber I survive I hate to toot my own horn but I'm eSports ready somebody signed me the world is aesthetically pleasing to my baby bloodshot eyes except for the flying octopuses so we kill them to never trust an octopus because once they started making their way out of the oceans and into the anime you knew it was no longer family-friendly content I asked mato to try and jump this gap as it's where we need to go and he does this doesn't go particularly well for him I find some fresh water and waterfalls so you know that I now love this planet they say all you need is love but that's quite frankly [ __ ] all you need is fresh drinkable water so basically we need to try and climb to the top of this tower and determine if we are truly alone here or is there other intelligent life we find the glimmering cave of wonder which is actually what my uncle nicknamed his basement there are little cave Birds down here and so we killed them all as seriously we're on a rampage these little malakas are going to be extinct in about ten minutes the game goes full Indiana Jones and we locate a temple shrine I extract what I can only assume is real fruit apple and blackcurrant juice from the shrine which will allow us to craft jump thrusters the stealth amato and I slap each other silly to celebrate but somehow both died at the exact same time meaning we can't revive each other and thus spawn back at the ship do you think given how long we've gamed together we would have established some sort of unity but yeah now we use the 3d printer to craft the thrusters and I adapt to using them like a pelican to water kidding i disappoint just like I disappointed my entire family when I said I was going to try and be a youtuber I mean it's a step up from being a cryptocurrency trader but a step down from dealing weed we get the hang of the jet thrusters and keep exploring this whimsical planet well at least it was whimsical right up until I kick one of the birds and it gets stuck into this vine plant of death and minced up into tiny little pieces Wow the game went from peaceful to full-blown chubby bird saw simulator in 10 seconds which I respect we continued climbing the tower thrusting around and occasionally slapping each other down for a cheap well-earned laughs all of a sudden though we come across an actual dangerous opponent balanced fights a lame I was enjoying statistically mincing small birds but I guess we've got to take these spinny boys on I tried to choose the fight by standing up on these rocks out of harm's way but these dodgy rhinos are way too smart for that and again I fall to my death as I respawn back at the ship I can't help but feel lucky because I get to see Bill Jenks face again what a modern-day hero we killed the Beast and to celebrate aggressively teabag the spot where it died we then attempt something beautiful something revolutionary the exclusive synchronized teabag that not many epic gamers have successfully been able to pull off you guys are witnessing history being made right here we retrieve the alloy and put it into the javelins Hoover 9 thousand as we begin to repair our spacecraft once we get this bad boy up and running we should be ready to explore each other's bodies I mean explore other planets as we continue climbing the platforming sections get harder and well let's just say platforming games aren't our strong suit it was pretty hilarious watching motto trying to make these jumps though I am editing out my mistakes and showcasing his because I'm just that kind of friend moments later we encounter our toughest opponent yet a strange living eye with a laser scanner that fires high explosive cluster bombs out of its head that kill you instantly so to answer our hypothesis of determining if this planet is suitable for a human settlement I'm going to pencil in a soft yes I figure out how to take the big girl down by simply poking my fingers into its eye I wonder if this strategy could be used on actual battlefields like if a soldier has an RPG you could just charge him down and then poke his eyeball GG well played we make our way through the lava caves not on each other and then buy a proton tether of the proton tether is great as it really makes you feel like you're exploring the savage planet this has been Jeff for IGN we'll see you next time don't forget to Like and subscribe and send me your icloud login details so I can look at your risky photos alright remember the birds from earlier well now they have armor and I'll tell you what they are angry and now quite strong we really have been tormenting these little critters but like come on we were just joking around it was just a joke when I kicked your cousin into the mincing plant why do you have to be such a big baby about it of the grumpy birds dare I say Angry Birds were the least of our worries though because do you remember mr. Krabs from Sponge Bob Squarepants well life after the krabby patty wasn't always good for old mate crabs II this is what eight years of steroid abuse looks like and it's not a pretty sight is it everybody always asked how the Krabby Patties were made but never asked how mr. Krabs was going and this is what happens when you lack empathy people turn into monsters and try to burn you alive with molten lava we continue exploring the world finding new areas the platforming sections are really enjoyable as watching motto continually fall to his death it gets old seriously I think the mole we played the worse he got at these sections it was quite hilarious like we had to navigate these mushrooms and the one he was on just sank and I've never seen a man's spirit break so quickly but then all of a sudden he did it 18 years of gaming all paid off at once as my boy began leaping like the 29th of February I'm kidding he fell to his death again I'm actually sorry for roasting you about your fine motor skills so much this video bro but how can I not we keep forging forward and the wild beasts we encountered kept getting more angry like brah we are just trying to wipe out all the native species on this planet using barbaric violence so that eventually we can build a wholefoods here and sell grapefruit granola to insecure University students what's the problem my favorite ability we unlocked was the launch booster which let us do these super jumps to high places this lets us access random walkways and live our best lives now though Marteau and i have to settle who's the better space recruit obviously the only way to measure such a thing is a slap off I don't know if you have seen slap competitions but I watched a Siberian slap off once and it was perhaps the most majestic thing I've ever seen anyway we did jump slap shots drop slap shots it was the sweatiest slap off of the decade and somehow I narrowly came out on top until of course I revived motto and he instantly kills me and then proceeds to flex on my corpse until I respawn you know what I'm going to say it motto is just a poor man's bill chanc the thanks again to 505 games for sponsoring your boy thanks to you legends for watching the video and thanks to those who support my channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
