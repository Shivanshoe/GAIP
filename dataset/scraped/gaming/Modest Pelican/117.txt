[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with cuisine reals if you enjoyed this video please change your last name to modesty Pelican gaming and then marry people have them take your surname and then divorce and repeat as this really helps spread the good word of my channel the so cuisine Royale was originally developed as an April Fool's joke but is now an entire beached of its own I love the origin story of this game basically the developers took an existing World War 2 game they are working on and turned it into a battle royale to make their community laugh next minute cuisine Royale is rated nine out of 10 on Steam and has a cult following you love to see it also thick none so definitely on brand for me being an educational Christian music channel so yeah I was really happy when I got talking with the legends at gaijin publishers about cuisine rail and a huge thanks to them for sponsoring today's video you can download and play cuisine right now for free on dex box pc and playstation using the code in the description and pinned comment if you use that code you'll also get some exclusive bonuses and who doesn't love free stuff except for free chlamydia thanks stepsister and now though i want to take you back to the beginning my mate stealth Amato and I decided that today we are going to get a win what you're about to witness is quite the emotional roller coaster the first we have to pick a hero I picked this unit because he's a Viking I buy some sunglasses for him and also a crown because every big boy deserves to feel like a queen we spawn into the map and motto looks just like me but malnourished and scrawny I tried to bash his head in with a baseball bat but it seems friendly fire is off and probably a great thing for our chances of success I find a handgun in a nearby barn and further confirmed friendly fire is definitely off a man I don't know why but I want to kill Matos so badly we continue searching this idealistic village for weaponry and I locate an MP 18 a fun fact the MP 18 was introduced in World War 1 by the Germans and the MP stands for modesty Pelican which is pretty incredible given my channel didn't even exist at the time I head into my local church to see I can find some holy water to drink as I'm a thirsty boy instead I find more loot and at this point I'm ready to take a fight I also swapped my crown for a helmet because even big boys get concussions first though Marteau and I have a well deserved to pray slaughter lie down as being properly rested is crucial for effective killing I take the bed with the mattress as a power play it seems there's been some light snowfall and I don't have a pair of shoes on so rest in peace toes motto has found a premium loot fridge and inside was a saucepan to cover his thick booty a wise choice as my boy has one juicy ass and it'd be quite distracting for all of us but feeling pretty confident I begin to venture but then spot my first opponent so I channeled my inner Kaiser Wilhelm and gunned him down I just popped my Cuisine ray alkyl virginity and it feels good I wonder if pong 400 will call me tomorrow or if it was just a one-time thing I sort of want to meet pong for hundreds parents buy a puppy and settle down most importantly I take his kneepads of speed I am the speed now the seriously I am so fast the pickups in this game are a real game-changer wow what great use of the word game multiple times game we locate a Christmas tree and that sure is a fresh slice of festive spirit Amato says he loves Christmas trees which might be the most wholesome thing he's ever said I proceeded to shoot down all the decorations because if I can't kill him physically I will at least kill his spirit I can't describe how questionable this decision is as ammo is extremely scarce we have another well-deserved nap but this time with a little bit of snuggling because real bros snuggle it's only weird if you make eye contact Amato opens a window to let a breeze in as fresh air is underrated I speed around the map at an unprecedented pace and then come across a bit of a crime scene we loot at all and motto finds himself a Cuban cigar which looks quite badass and actually raises his health by 10 so I guess the lesson here is that we should all start chronically smoking in real life with the zone in closing we decide to post up on top of a water tower which is incredibly poetic given my strong ethical beliefs around hide there's actually only four players left and winning our first game would be a great way to start off the day and a real confidence boost we begin taking shots from the final two players and they get mottos but I know exactly what I have to do use my unique ability when you kill players you harvest their souls which is cute and then you can use these souls for each character's unique ability and also to cast spells I try to land on the rooftop but ball spectacularly and slip off I do however manage to down one of the final two players now using this momentum I tactically gain that position confusing and dominating my opponents and we call this the snowball effect and just kidding I retreat into a nearby barn for a while allowing him ample time to revive his teammate and and then quickly gun down earning a second place medal Wow all right round two and a change of character I also pick a tactical outfit so my opponents won't be able to see my chest legs or the top of my head a 1000 IQ play there are two maps and this one is the world war 1 themed Normandy in the French countryside so we keep finding bunkers and machine-gun turrets I really want to have my World War one moment where I gun someone down in a turret I also find another special item in the way of an IV bag which slowly regenerates my health now that's just smart thinking the Australian military really needs to implement something similar we say to dodging malakas running away like cowards and so we pursue them with a kitchen mixing bowl on my shoulder I'm feeling pretty confident as not only will this deflect bullets once I'm done I can use it to cook up a mean souffle I proceed to engage taking down the first Chad enemy number 2 tries to evade me by jumping around a bit but is no match for my mp40 GG well played moments later I die while looting GG well played motto actually has a really good solo run without me and keep sniping everyone he's weirdly good at cuisine Royale but eventually he dies and we get a 7th place I now feel like Martos parents disappointed round 3 and I put on a bikini because this not only appeals to my female demographic who might be King for a new summer look it also appeals to my male demographic who also might be looking for a new summer look I do manage to get my World War One mounted machine gun moment and it's pretty spectacular only 5th place in the end though we need that win so I have something to put on my resume around 4 and we've got to start playing smarter not harder we unlock some spells which will cost Souls to cast but unlock bonuses of for example all enemies in the vicinity will have increased recoil which is pretty cheeky I'm also a big fan of Vipers - ability and I can definitely say this coming in handy I find a waffle maker to cover up my booty shorts which is great as it keeps things family-friendly amato then undoes this by drawing a penis in the snow with his footprints inappropriate but his artistic talent is undeniable we decide to bunker down but then start hearing lizzo being blasted out of a boom box which is one of the pick ups you know that song I do my hair toss check my nails well I can't play it because of copyright but it's surprisingly one of the most intimidating and unnerving war tactics I've ever experienced I cast a spell to help give us an advantage but with lizzo living rent-free in my head I proceed to die almost immediately around 5 and it's time to bring in our secret weapon crows B 7 8 8 5 he's the youngest in the group and therefore I assume he'll be able to carry us to a victory we're also playing the new mexico-- map which inspires me for some reason we get off to a cracker start winning several gun fights in a row this is quite the action filled round with many altercations but unfortunately we lose both Crosby and our other random teammates dr. lam big 29 and dr. lamb big 29 is probably shroud on an alt so it's a big loss motto dies and it's just me and then I kid you not the words zombie apocalypse pop up on the screen and it's exactly what it sounds like someone has used a spell to summon a horde of zombies I use my special ability to gain a height advantage and do my absolute best to win but ultimately I die again second place I think I'd rather come 10th than second in a battle royale again you know so close yet so far but I'm more motivated than ever around six and I predictably die immediately but the boys gather my heart and bring me back via campfire ritual and I die again shortly after this nice again motto who truly is proving to be freakishly good at this game fights well but it's rushed by a guy with a pen and beaten down for yet another second place over the next ten rounds we start to really figure out our strategies and utilize our characters unique abilities wherever we can it's an interesting game because it combines a serious feeling Battle Royale experience with some more hilarious elements and you can really do well utilizing either playstyle of the more we play the more spells we unlock and slowly but surely failed to win a single game seriously we keep coming so close but just can't get that elusive W it's been a real test for the boys boys boys round 17 and we decide to pull out a strategy that not many will see coming something so stunning and brave that we deserve international recognition for our intelligence we decide to bring out the thickness meta we will win a battle royale game using the power of squats and God and the enemies don't know what's hitting them as we rinse challenger after Challenger it's an absolute masterpiece and quite interestingly our teammates die pomato and die who harnessed the power of the thick none survived coincidence I think not I head over to a campfire to resurrect the boys and I'm exploited by someone who set up a frag grenade trap which is such a sneaky stepdad play but I guess JJ my friends have to go to bed because they sleep eight hours like what are they trying to live a healthy balanced lifestyle or something how pathetic I play one Gio's with this guy and we vibe together in our bunny slippers it's one of those moments where neither of us can be bothered talking in voice chat but we're basically best friends forever and I can tell they're an absolute legend unfortunately I'm not here to vibe round 19 and I want to get that win so I head over to the solos playlist I engage absolute sweat mode I'm going to play this like it's real life and also damn this lass can swim what great seriously I'm about to set the record for the 50 meter breaststroke a while looting I hear two players fighting it out and rather than running in I patiently wait around the corner for one of them to die while their guard is down I burst around the corner and spray them down with ease this is some guerrilla warfare while I'm looting someone tries to do a similar thing to me but they miss their snipe you can't snipe what you can't see that would have made more sense if I was still in the camouflage uniform but yeah anyway segue I rinse a third player who's snooping around but I wasn't joking about treating this like it's real life I'm keeping a low profile and hunting down that wind also does anyone else suddenly feel like booty waffles I survived until there's three players left but rather than engaging I instead watch on from the shadows as I know this is my moment they both use their unique abilities and expend an enormous amount of ammunition and it's quite a spectacle honestly they both fought so hard and deserve the win unfortunately for them life isn't fair and I emerge at the last minute gunning down the final big girl for the most long-awaited Battle Royale victory of my life I guess the lesson here is that you should ditch your friends and just do things by yourself as they're probably dragging you down again
