[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this video please normalize identifying as a pelican as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories ah thick man look at his juicy lips perfect for kissing mothers with as in your mother haha got him but no just kidding of course i'm referring to saint mary mother of jesus christ aka the og son of a virgin today we'll be pretending to be npcs again as i find doing this highly amusing and to clear any confusion up about how this works you can pay 12 000 dollars to activate ghost organization for three minutes and this will completely remove your crew's gamertag and icons from the minimap this means providing that you behave like npcs people will have no reason to think that you're an actual player of course we have to change into some civilian clothing so we look the part i head into suburban and the saleswoman says that i'm handsome excuse me but i'm not an object please keep it in your pants young karen i purchased myself a red hoodie which i guess isn't that inconspicuous but i definitely look more like an npc than stealth or theodo and he definitely looks more like an npc than stealtho robbo i forgot about that strawberry mask he bought it's so silly but i think we can all agree that strawberries really are an aphrodisiac i'd hit that i go and steal us a boring npc looking car to give the lads some time to change and well besides the tactical balaclava and night vision goggles you can barely tell that we aren't just everyday civilians so now it's time to pick a target we notice that there's a dodgy malacca downtown on a bit of a killing spree and it's time he faced the wrath of the boy's boy's voice i drive all normal so that he doesn't suspect a thing and then the second we're out of his peripheral vision we move in is this ethical no it's definitely not but neither is stealing from homeless people and we all do that you've got to admire fieldo's energy the body has despawned and yet he's still out there swinging his heart out i do some deep analytic research walking among them to investigate and learn the behavior patterns of the npcs i'd be surprised if i don't get a nobel prize for this work honestly i then get myself a new car but this time with an added surprise for later perfect an unsuspecting player has paused their game and so i drive up behind them and honk my horn this triggers them to drive away quickly and did they really just get bullied by an npc i'm your daddy now they then try to enter the casino but with only seconds left before i'm back on the radar i do perhaps the bravest thing i've ever done in my life i detonate my car heroically taking my own life to stop these good men from gambling their money away you're welcome i find two more players and i just keep driving past their house in the same car to see if they notice they don't notice and so i decide to see how far i can push it this is actually my house too and there's always an npc standing around here smoking i become that npc this woman exits her house and i'm pretty sure she doesn't have a clue that i'm a player either that or she just doesn't care i just want to feel wanted i continue my new life as a bot and honestly no one can tell as who would be expecting this i decide to stalk this guy in a van for a while as he certainly has an aggressive charm about him he's busy running over a green alien and i just play it nice and cool watching from the shadows and honestly i just can't believe my eyes this man is running the alien over repeatedly and although i'm pretty sure the meme is dead now i was once a green alien and i'll always be there for my boys one thing you should know about me is that basically any car i drive is also a bomb get pranked i pick up stealth omato who's got himself a snappy suit but as he's getting into the car he punches a fellow bot excuse me mate but that's our brother now and you will show him respect wait the intro clip of this video is just me running down dozens of npcs whatever i'm a guy who posts stuff on the internet from his bedroom it's almost expected that i'll contradict myself frequently as i'm grabbing a suitable car the guy mato punched chases him down and if you're under the age of 65 please look away there are some things you can't unsee like this and your uncle's peony we locate two big truck boys near los santos customs and i'm aware civilians don't really drive down here but we're pioneers doing what others are scared to do we drink water out of teacups we host strip poker tournaments at daycare centers and when we ask for nudes we never say thank you because no one ever sends us any unfortunately our small sticks are no match for these big girls who would have guessed at this point i think they may also be suspicious that we're not in fact npcs mato proceeds to get run over several times it's quite brutal to watch but let's be honest he deserves it we then decide we best further research the daily routines of these mysterious creatures and so we pick this group of intellectuals but no truck boys are back they actually don't seem very hostile which is good and then they take off their shirts it doesn't take long before we're all shirtless just standing in the street together getting semi-naked with dudes you just met is the fastest way to become best friends forever i guess it turns out they're green aliens too and so we decide to whip out our costumes again what do you mean dead meme one thing leads to another and we all start making out i mean beating this guy's car who came to say hello imagine noticing a youtuber is in your server and so you're like oh okay i'll come say g'day to this guy and he proceeds to just beat your car with his boys i imagine meeting me in a video game is incredibly underwhelming and disappointing but hey at least we didn't kill him kidding we did the pac mentality is incredibly toxic i did message thanking him for the support though and i mean it what a legend i'm so thankful for the community that i've got around this channel the jokes aside i love it when you guys come up to me and mess around and do random things and then i can put that in the video it's cool a brb crying emotional happy tears anyway i then remember you can do this thing where you attach sticky bombs to other players it allows you to have the power over them you become somewhat of a god and you get to decide if they live or die at any given moment i pick this moment this is actually one of my favorite tricks because the game is third person so they say that you've attached a sticky bomb to them like my boy here kills mato so i just detonate the bomb and he has to instantly atone for his sins goodnight sweet prince the big truck boys and mato and i enjoy some quality time in the hot tub there was like so many girls that joined us my recording software just glitched but yeah so many hot girls were here with us i promise yeah but basically this lobby has entered a new level of hostility we now have pilots who i'm pretty sure fly for their nation's air forces carrying out strafing runs on our position as soon as we spawn in i can't say we don't deserve this though and quite frankly it's pretty impressive how accurate he is anyway ironically as i'm getting slapped right now the whole premise of this series is to become the kingpin of los santos i think i just need to have a little recap as much for my benefit as yours just to see how far we've come over the last year or so so this was the first apartment we ever got it has a lot of sentimental value but also if you sit down you'll almost definitely contract some kind of tropical disease we then purchased an inner city apartment that is honestly quite nice but i didn't realize it had a view of a construction site at least it's kind of metaphorical i guess like i'm always trying to build up my collection of questionable anime that he found would probably land me in prison i've then obviously got my main mansion that i spawn in these days i've got my deluxo that i fortunately won on the casino wheel seriously that was a lucky play we've got the yacht moby thick this was 100 a pointless flex purchase and the captain is the most cooked cobba i've ever met where are you sailing bro this ship hasn't moved in like two months both hands on the steering wheel at all times i guess you've got to admire the old fella's dedication i've got the nightclub which again questionable purchase but it raids well on my resume we've got the office building which reminds me of my 250 000 spelling mistake every time i walk in this is my executive assistant hot karen not sure what she does all day the place is a mess seriously how hard is it to hang up a couple of pictures we've got the motorcycle clubhouse and of course junkie karen the bartender the bathroom here is absolutely disgusting but at least the paper towels are always stocked hot karen could learn a thing or two from junky karen we've got a literal military bunker for some reason i mainly got this so i could weaponize the deluxo it was a really expensive process of course there's the laundry detergent workshop and the new tomato farm that's really popping up we've also got some nice sports cars and yeah we've actually built up quite a lot of things the problem is they're not being properly utilized the bunker the office the nightclub and the narcotics operation need to be nurtured better and upgraded i also want to expand into new businesses such as money laundering i want military vehicles like jets and tanks a facility and an avenger basically we've made good progress but still have a long way to go i'm then destroyed by a player on a flying motorbike you know what this time i'll let him have his fun and turn the other cheek of course i don't mean that and i proceeded to hunt him down and destroy him and his little motorbike as he attacked first it's only fair that i get him back numerous times check this little flick missile shot i've been doing get wrecked did i really just flex a kill in which i was in a flying car while he stood helplessly on the ground yes yes i did i can't just murder him all day though as mato and i have business to attend to we need to resupply the coke factory and what better way to get supplies than steal from the lost biker game they're hanging out at a fancy nightclub and they look way different than i would have imagined but hey it's 2020 i should open my eyes we get it done and then this gamergirl comes out of nowhere and i think i might be in love lads and lasses i salute her which shows that i care and then i can't help myself and i attach a sticky bomb to her back she's not going to let no handsome funny athletic intelligent white boy tell her how to live her life though and she ends herself well played i head back to the deluxo so we can continue resupplying the lab and she murders both of us in cold blood i'm getting mixed feelings from this woman who's almost definitely a teenage boy as we're flying away i hear that she's locking on to us and so i give her the little deluxo special enjoy that you toxic hater oh my god i read my text messages and she says i love you she also then says i'm a real woman my g i don't know much about women but that seems like something they would definitely 100 certainly say we deliver the final supplies so that they can start making the good stuff and look who's still here my new hopefully e-girlfriend she's a bit taller than me which for now is fine but i'm sure over the years will drive me into a deep insecurity i decide to conduct a social experiment to truly test if this player is a woman or not she hops into my car and i fly out a long way into the ocean and then empty all the passengers out now this may seem harsh but if she's actually a girl she'll forgive me and if it's a guy he'll obviously kill me to my absolute surprise she forgives me and the realization sinks in that i may have just found my life partner all of a sudden she has brought a bunch of her friends around to the beach and it's getting really steamy i think i might be actually making group love gta online style right now i really don't know it's time to find out which one of these lucky ladies will be the one in the only reasonable way i can think of the bachelor shotgun edition obviously not you as you have glasses and that's my thing obviously not you either as i can't even see your face and that's a gamble i don't want to take you might be thinking oh it must be her she's perfect for you but no not today because i pick stealth omato he's my bro and will forever be my first choice and chapo mcmako proceeds to gun us both down i understand her frustration as we were perfect for each other but stealth omato stole my heart many years ago thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
