[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta 5. if you enjoy this video please kidnap jeff bezos and get him to rename the amazon hit series the boys to the boys boys boys as this really helps spread the good word of my channel meet thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so you may have noticed i eliminated myself in the first intro clip i was just driving my go-kart around living my best life and i saw someone had a bounty on their head so of course i did what i had to do little did i know i was killing myself this random player called cleaver henking is a clone of me i guess naturally i call a cab so i can vibe with thick man 2.0 for a while i tell the driver to take us down to the pier but he gets confused and so i gunned him down and decide i'll just drive the taxi myself we head down to the carnival the sky clearer than post-nut clarity and ride the roller coaster honestly kind of hurtful that he didn't sit next to me but we have a pretty fantastic time we even go back to my apartment and drink fine wine and sky gaze together i get sapphire to come over and he sends me a message saying sapphire in the house an accurate statement this guy's good the evening arrives and i fly us back to my yacht but you see there can be only one thick man we both know this all too well and so i messaged the malacca letting him know how this has to go down he's up for it and immediately takes a cheap shot which i quite frankly respect i know this is probably pretty difficult and emotional content for you to watch as i'm sure we all love this guy's energy but i proceed to do what i have to do kill a child and please like the video to pay respect to cleaver henking today i'll be playing with stealth omato who's best known for carrying this channel and stealthocabo who loves a pair of tiny shorts he wore these bad boys in the middle of winter women love guys who pretend they can't feel the cold not as much as i love these lads though today we're going to attempt the heist that has given our group the most trouble we also decide to plan a public server because that always goes extremely well i currently have around 1.2 million dollars in the bank and thick man couldn't be looking more ready to meet hot young christian singles in his area like all gta online characters he might never talk but who needs a personality when your super car has scissor doors i meet stealth omato who's pretty proud of his new uppan atomizer raygun i'm no physicist but what the optic slug 1 then rocks up in his ramp car and i'm no esports enthusiast but i don't think he's actually an optic gaming he does however have some innovative ideas when i was in year 12 i made this stunning and brave decision to stop studying and instead focus on becoming the best call of duty modern warfare 2 player of all time i failed to achieve that goal and i also basically failed school when i was opening the envelope containing my final grade which was handed to me by my school's principal he looked me in the eyes and said that's the grade you deserve well now look at me sir launching supercars in grand theft auto will you fantasize about miss k because your wife stopped loving you years ago well that was kind of dark but in his defense we were all fantasizing about miss k what kind of teacher explains algebra and yoga pants speaking of cabo rocks up wearing pants for once which i'm sure my 4.9 female audience is pretty upset about this guy chappy also rocks up so i give his car a little nudge with my ray gun more and more players arrive at the scene and surprisingly everyone just chills and enjoys each other's company of course this doesn't last long and predictably mato is the first to die he's like a baby gazelle vulnerable and uncoordinated the lads and i were talking about how insane public servers are but upon reviewing this footage i'm starting to realize that perhaps we're a big part of that insanity let's not overthink it as i don't want to risk becoming self-aware and having to change myself anyway i feel like this perfectly encapsulates every gta online server ever see what i did there it's in reference to the title of this video we've sure come a long way from when every one of my youtube titles had the phrase and then this happened in it kidding i still sometimes do that for the nostalgia and honestly it gets a pretty good click-through rate we begin the drive up to my new facility as we have actual work to do do you remember when we attempted the doomsday heist it was episode 3 of the sons of virgins and it took us several videos to complete unfortunately because i said a couple of allegedly insensitive things the final video where we actually completed the heist was removed from the internet out of my control i constantly get asked where it is and so i've decided it's time we do it again lads and lasses welcome to the doomsday heist remastered twice the fun twice the laughs and twice the milking of three-year-old content we have a well-deserved rest in my ghetto break room and then get ready to start planning i'd forgotten just how big this heist is but nothing a group of intellectual gaming bros can't handle first up we've gotta collect the marked cash from the airport cabo rudely left without us so mato says he's going to walk in protest my ex-girlfriend once literally walked out on me she had a fight with her parents and my mum was out of town so she was crashing at my place for a while she knew i was going out celebrating for one of my best mates 18th birthdays that night so i get home in a rush to change my clothes and leave and there she is on the bed candle's lit and she's in lingerie any other day this would be a great moment but she knew i was in a rush to go and meet my friends i knew she knew that and she knew i knew that but she didn't want me going out drinking so she was pulling out all the big guns i tried to finesse the situation using my non-existent charm but predictably it didn't go too great so she walks out into the night with a little suitcase but the timing's terrible as i really need to use the bathroom i take a little too long because i'm pillaging people's clash of clan villagers on my phone hustlers never sleep and by the time i get out i can't find her anywhere i wasn't emotionally mature enough to handle this kind of situation so i literally just took out the nesquik the milk and a glass and left it on the bench with a note saying you're a wonderful person smiley face and went out and got lit i didn't know it at the time but i was speed running a breakup you see leaving the ingredients out for chocolate milk by anyone's definition was a classy play but i forgot to leave her a spare key and canberra winters are no joke given we've completed one of the heist preps we decide we've earned another break we take out my new supercar and look how far mata can throw molotov cocktails they look like asteroids just when you thought he was already as alpha as humanly possible he finds a way to step up i'm aware a few minutes ago i referred to him as an uncoordinated baby gazelle so this is a contradiction it reminds me of when i stream and you guys in the twitch chat either give death threats or say incredibly sexual perverse things about him and there's absolutely no in between we arrive at the casino and hit up the spinning wheel i proceed to underwhelmingly win a black no retreat tank top but i decide to embrace my prize the drip is so fresh that you barely notice i'm far too white to be wearing a singlet we have a little party in my penthouse god knows we've earned it and then make our way down to the music locker nightclub i keep getting notifications about this place plus i now have the perfect look so why not party up top business down the bottom i look like one of those guys who's been lifting for a week and a half but still has the confidence to walk around the gym aggressively staring at people i decide to do a little social experiment with mato and ask him to join me at the urinal to test if he will stand an appropriate distance away from me he crushes the test flexing his social acceptability awareness by standing half a foot away and staring directly at my peony the music locker is fine i guess but there's nothing really going on so i make my way up to the roof i then slide into the hot tub so i can aggressively hit on these two christian babes who's not going to give this man a smooch and cosmopolitan magazine actually did a survey about the top seven things women want in a man they were a bald head a tasteful anime back tattoo relentless and unnecessary aggression impressive cardiovascular health wearing a versatile suit everywhere owning a yucca house plant and being legally named thick man some other players rock up on their flying motorbikes to say g'day which is nice i proceed to steal their bike and put it in the swimming pool because we can't be having those flying around he then messages me saying something kind so i apologize and blame the whole bike in the pool incident on stealth omatos suggesting that a suitable revenge would be to kill him sometimes you've gotta make your own drama a cabo picks up a truck which i imagine is the rolls royce of bush bumpkin culture as we make our way back to the facility to get working again we invent a game called grenade roulette basically the passenger throws explosives out the window and tries to explode the vehicle while the driver tries to dodge this is peak innovation right here all of a sudden moody man wants to be picked up because his car was stolen he's a dj at the music locker and he thinks he's better than us we've just driven across the entire city and he won't even look up from his phone we reluctantly help him recover his vehicle and i will admit this man has nice taste i honestly think the grudia tally might be my new favorite car it costs 3.5 million dollars so we'll have to save a little bit but i'll put it on my wish list i proceeded to drive the car off the pr because moody man didn't make eye contact which is a crucial part of active listening i was planning to roll to safety but i exited the vehicle a little too late i begin freestyling back to the pr with exquisite form sensing how vulnerable i am carbo pops me in the head this triggers a full-scale war and it becomes apparent that this entire time we have only done one heist prep i call the mechanic to bring me my suv because we can all fit in it i feel like mentally we need that kind of unity right now we drive the whole way back to the facility without one grenade being tossed we are ready the first thing we have to do is scout out the dock before we raid it and cabo flies his helicopter over and i take some tasteful selfies for lester no filter no makeup no hate as i'm finishing up this reckless individual runs in and attacks me unfortunately will and i are able to beat him to death through the power of friendship we head back to the facility to get ready for the raid playing a little windmill roulette on the way which goes well we get into our tactical gear and i hop into my saber custom lowrider which isn't very tactical but almost all my other cars have been destroyed in grenade roulette it's got hydraulics though which more than makes up for its lack of stealth i know we were most likely meant to be somewhat sneaky but it just feels right doing a drive-by in this thing the boys boys boys and i begin wrecking everything and i just want to say that i love you guys the support my content gets here the live streams on twitch and the love the new gta series on my papa peli channel is getting is honestly overwhelming i don't know what i did to deserve such insane support but i can't tell you how much i appreciate it i just love making content and i've got some cool video ideas coming up that i hope you'll love as well as plenty more sons of virgins thanks for watching new legends until next time and as always stay classy i'll play grenade roulette ah that feels like it's gonna be close you're driving around oh
