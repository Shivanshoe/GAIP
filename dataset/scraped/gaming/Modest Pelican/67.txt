[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with thick man if you enjoy this video please kidnap lebron james and forcefully make him play for the new orleans pelicans as this really helps spread the good word of my channel today we've got a double assassination that hits a little too close to home for me as i'm passionate about hydration this dodgy malacca known as aj has been selling bottled water but ripping off his clients he's taken something that's meant to be so pure and wholesome and turned it into a pyramid scheme so we're going to visit miami and take this morally bankrupt lad down i'll be bringing in with me a chrome silenced pistol a lock pick skinny pills and of course a cowboy hat blue suit combination that'll make every girl ask agent 47 to smack their booty like a drum in time to a willy nelson country classic there's a supercar race going on and so i decide to have a look but accidentally somewhat romantically lock eyes with this security guard this is pretty unprofessional as i'm trying to keep a low profile i need to stay focused but it's honestly quite difficult as my kryptonite is yoga pants i guess my other weakness is apparently this hilarious head in hull wall gag where it looks like i'm holding an alcoholic merman by his tail i'm not a part of this system i quickly handle a personal vendetta i have in my overarching mission to ensure pelicans become the alpha avian species and then get to work i use my lockpick so i can cross this track via the access bridge my intel tells me that aj is going to try and pitch his water company to one of the race teams as an ongoing sponsorship unfortunately for him a well-dressed muscular caucasian man might have something to say about that i pacified two race marshals and look away if you cry easily but i'll have to ditch my suit and hat already i try not to upload too much sad depressing content but this is a necessary evil this disguise allows me to sneak around in the restricted area but i noticed something peculiar there's a mistake on my hive is orange vest they misspelled vagine slayer i accidentally arrive at the main show event via the red carpet and the crowd doesn't even pretend to care i'll have you know that without me or you know whatever the guy i knocked unconscious earlier this race wouldn't even happen wow what does it say on that fence over there geez let me zoom in and wow it says like and subscribe so this budget australian morgan freeman can feel validated like the bible we must obey fence graffiti i spot one of the drivers and decide to stalk the guy in the hope of catching him alone i then realize he's part of the wrong race team and seems to be flirting with this lass they proceed to leave the venue together and i'll tell you what i don't see on either of their fingers a goddamn wedding ring and these motor enthusiasts are about to have premarital relations i've got to do something quickly as the sexual tension between these two is so high i've even got a semi i pull a crowbar out of my pocket and throw it at him but accidentally hit her in the face it doesn't matter though as my work here is done i'm a guardian angel first and an assassin second and somehow i didn't even get caught speaking of it's quite concerning that i haven't even found my target yet also now the guards are on high alert searching for a guy who's strutting around throwing crowbars at women i spot another driver and this time he's even from the team aj actually wants to sponsor i follow him into this bar but everyone starts yelling at me as apparently i'm trespassing wow i stand out in the sun all day waving checkered flags and many other common race marshall jobs god forbid i come inside and refresh myself with a lemon lime and bitters i turn on the ice machine so the floor gets all wet as an act of defiance and then a guard walks in and pulls a gun on me this seems like a massively unnecessary escalation and it forces me to fly the scene and that man would actually make a great teacher as i bet he understands that sometimes you have to shoot a few bad apples to ensure all the produce doesn't rot a weird metaphor but it seems like i've escaped as i hide in the crowd of people or so i thought as more security collapse on my position and they all just begin firing into the crowd i literally turned on an ice machine because i thought it would be a humorous family friendly prank and this is the thanks i get well let's restart i gather some more valuable intel knock out the race marshall and bam we're back in business i then walk in front of a news reporter to disrupt the broadcast because here at modest pelican gaming the pranks never stop all of a sudden i found the big man aj and his water display this is honestly not too far from devil worship and i will derive great pleasure when i take this man down i overhear him saying that he's waiting on one of the drivers to come and meet with him but they haven't shown up yet here's our opportunity i head back to the bar but on my way i see another flamingo strutting around like he owns the place obviously i take him down but a waiter sees me do this and i'm forced to become a flamingo and hide inside of a baby disposal container this is quite humiliating but i'm playing the long game after the heat dies down a little bit i patiently wait for the waiter to take a cigarette break and then stab him in the neck with a screwdriver i don't know why he got involved in bird on bird crime as it doesn't concern dirty little snitches now as the waiter i'm allowed to access the bar and approach the driver he's talking to his wife about the whole water sponsorship ordeal as he's considering pulling out as it's not ethical i may have found the only other good person at this entire race i put some poison into his dry fully bodied matua valley chardonnay almost getting caught he drinks up like a champ but as we speak his stomach lining is beginning to dissolve from all the acid a poor guy he probably didn't deserve this but as they say in the industry collateral damage happens even though sometimes it's completely preventable i head back to meet aj and look at all these people drinking water they're not staying hydrated though they're suckling on the tate of corruption he's excited to see me and wants to go and check out our workshop it sure is lucky agent 47 is a master of disguise as the guy aj wants to meet was definitely ethnic let's not overthink it though and i invite the big girl inside he's pretty impressed with the cars we've got and then heads over and stands in an extremely precarious position with his little sweater neatly tied around his shoulders symbolizing daddy issues i proceed to lower the car and eliminate aj but the job is only half done you see as i escape the area only briefly stopping to check out a little booty i'm told by the agency that the mastermind behind it all is hiding out in a quiet suburban neighborhood also i literally got a zero star rating for that part of the mission plenty of room for improvement i travel to whittleton creek disguised as a construction worker our target is gallon voles which is quite frankly a stupid name i'll be taking in with me a pistol and of course some ninja stars i'm not actually sure which one of these houses he's hiding out in so we'll have to explore a little and converse with the local residents a look at this man just sitting on a park bench reading that is so wholesome it's nice to see is these days it's just kids with their ipads and glass pipes i do a hot lap of the street and conclude that this house on the corner must be the one you see i have an eye for detail and notice the four heavily armored police officers offering to guard the premises were suspicious also the futuristic green laser security system and the final clue is the company's giant cyan hanging on the porch there's gallon and he doesn't seem too keen on exiting his property so we'll have to figure out how to get in the places like fort knox with all these lasers there is a tree house at the back and if i brought a sniper rifle i could maybe clip him through the window but i brought ninja stars no regrets i decide to do something quite brave and go right through the front door this guy's like nah mate the only meeting gallon has today is with the mailman well now all i have to do is find said mailman i still just love how agent 47 never runs faster than a slow jog it's so alpha i search far and wide with no luck but locate something debatably better i find a hatchet in a bush which i naturally use to swing right into this police officer's head a completely unnecessary risk in broad daylight but at least i may now be able to access the house i look like a high school camp instructor who's way too invested in his job i remember we had this one instructor in grade 10 who always tried so hard to get everyone involved in the games it was inspiring well at least it was until we found him spying on the girl's dom he's organizing games of kickball in prison now anyway there's a guard on the stairs who never moves but at least i can access the ground floor i find a key card to a vault but besides that there's not really many opportunities down here i can't go up internally and i can't climb up the outside because of the lasers as silver lining though i find the mailman and he's looking to hit up a garden party my dog probably just double dropped he's absolutely munted and ready to rave as the big man polishes off yet another beer i'm pretty sure he's still working which is honestly quite unprofessional but yeah he's hungry and there's no gas for the barbecue and this is my moment to save this mid-afternoon soiree i explore the whole map searching far and wide and suddenly there it is as i install the gas cylinder the host turns to me and doesn't say thank you jesus christ this man has a complete lack of respect i just committed petty theft for you the guests go crazy as they now know food is being served and i stand there receiving no credit whatsoever i know we're here to eliminate gallon and we will but there's now a second target barbecue guy i wait for a long time for the mailman to show up and he never does in fact the guy is nowhere to be seen he's probably delivering a bit more than mail to one of the hot suburban wives if you know what i mean and get your mind out of the gutter that's disgusting i was merely implying that he was probably being dominated in sickening and kinky ways well if the mailman isn't going to return and eat a burger that i can poison i don't see any point of this barbecue going ahead if you don't show me basic mannerisms then no one has any fun you did this to yourself i decide the best play is to go back to the house and start thinning the security down a little bit i turn on a sink so that it will overflow and hopefully lure a guard into the bathroom these men tried to use water to succeed but in the end were defeated by water that is the most poetic thing ever said period my guy had a house key on him as well which allows me to access the basement and disable the security system a gallon then comes down to the kitchen to sip his vintage tuscan merlot oh perfect i can poison his wine but then a guard almost spots me and i kid you not i bump into gallon and he drops his glass i didn't even know that was a thing in this game until just now but suddenly things just got more difficult i decide my best bet is to take down as many officers as possible just in case this ends up in a violent shootout using the same trick as last time i even managed to eliminate his bodyguard this man thought water was his ally but he merely adopted the water i was born into it i didn't see another liquid until i was already a man by then it was nothing to me but disgusting the water betrayed gallon because it belonged to me a target down via call ninja star and now only one more thing to take care of wow a bit stressed about the lack of gas there chief well maybe you should have thought about that when you showed a complete lack of appreciation apparently you can't just ninja star someone when there's like 35 witnesses around and i get into a pretty hectic fight unfortunately i managed to slip into a disguise and escape the drama to earn a one-star rating one of our best ever results mission complete and the water industry is once again pure and our work here is done also to my boy jim smithers i forgot to put your comment on screen when i used your intro idea last video it was blanton fraud and you should sue me thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
