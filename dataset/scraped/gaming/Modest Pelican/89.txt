[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with assassin's creed valhalla if you enjoy this video please cancel literally every other single youtuber so that i can be the only person left still making content as this really helps spread the good word of my channel a huge thanks to ubisoft for inviting me out to the early capture event so welcome to war savaged england and also a game that interprets the definition of what an assassin is very loosely that's alright by me though because vikings are thick boys we jump in as evil ready to explore laugh learn and maybe use our axe to detach an innocent bystander's head from their torso i noticed two guards are conveniently looking in the wrong direction and so i sneak up on them and do them dirty they could have been great guys but starting a conversation with strangers gives me social anxiety so yeah get well soon i then arrive at the town of theater and i'm going to be honest this place is pretty depressing also the people here have square shields while i have a non-virgin round shield which demonstrates that i'm clearly the alpha chad here this guy oswald tells me an army came through here and burnt all their homes and killed dozens of locals so i say i'll help him get revenge unlike these guys who are too busy wallowing in self-pity crying like little babies or worse still napping together which is the definition of a bad attitude also the average life expectancy of this time period is like 40 so if a bandit's arrow didn't get your husband it would have been typhoid a week later grow up i also rob some of the local's houses which is ethically questionable but they've clearly prepared too much food for the small group of survivors the real crime here would be rancid produce i ride out and realize you can actually slab squat on your horse like this somebody give this game a i see a group of guards patrolling and this guy looks at me wrong i'm honestly not entirely sure if these big girls are my allies or what but look i'm finally playing a game where it's socially acceptable to attack anyone on site and i'm definitely going to milk that i then find an old church which is on brand as i'm the number one rated educational christian music channel in the oceanic region i frequently bring this up as it's an extremely impressive achievement of course you can still climb and i remember as a kid playing the first assassin's creed game and being amazed by the climbing mechanic i also love how you can dive into small piles of leaves or hay influenced by this my brother once tried to dive off a nine story building into some leaves and let's just say he splat himself seriously though he died a pretty aggressive death it really broke my family anyway i find a nun and if there's one thing i know about nuns it's that they can't get married and therefore everything they do is pre-marital she proceeds to make intense premarital eye contact with me and then tries to pre-marital kill me she's actually a beast fighter too so i do the manly thing and climb up onto the roof of the church so she can't see me and then jump down on her from above damn that actually wasn't very kosher of me so i decided to do a little fishing to take my mind off the nun murder i reel myself in a big old bullhead how very cool i then remember i've only got a limited time with this demo so why the hell am i spending it fishing i instead blow into my horn and call in my crew and longship now this is epic your crew and settlement are a big part of valhalla i'll be able to recruit people i find around the world so i hope i find someone worthy my criteria is that they must be witty family orientated and have an ass thicker than the bible i proceed to sail the long boat around for a while because it's cool but in reality i was basically right next to where i needed to be it's time to get revenge for oswald and his beta square shield i creep around the rooftops consistently dropping 20 or so feet which i can't imagine is quiet unfortunately everyone in this village is deaf which works out perfectly for big boned me if i can clear this village out oswald can move back in and i'll have an ally there's a lot of enemies here so i decide to do assassin's creed again for a while like the title again intelligent and witty jokes aside it's interesting to see how the franchise has evolved getting to play as a viking is just good clean fun for the first time in perhaps my entire esports game in korea i managed to successfully be stealthy right up until i burst into this room where three big mamazitos are waiting you guys surely would have heard me leaping around on the roof and what were you just like nah probably the wind not to mention the last guy i shot in the face with an arrow literally shrieked and you didn't even think to check in on your bro you guys are bad friends and that's coming from a guy who put an ad on an escort site for one of his best mates without him knowing so that a bunch of seedy old dudes kept sending him inappropriate messages and unfortunately several images a questionable banter on my part but at least oswald is happy and now his troops can go back to their sad little lives now this looks like a pleasant city to visit i hope it's a happier place i honestly think the real victim of all these horrific war crimes is me i don't mean to sound self-centered but take this woman who's chosen the literal entrance way to throw up everywhere hey welcome to northwick where this woman is single-handedly crippling the local tourism industry it's not all chunder though there is a bit of a vibe here i help a boy chase his lost cat which is really good of me then rather than giving it back i actually take the cat to my ship so i can have a pet i guess did i really just steal a kid's cat vikings truly were the ultimate badasses but hey that cat do be squatting though i explore a little more even throwing a pot at this soldier and he catches on fire but doesn't seem to care which is super chill of him i can't stand around lighting the townsfolk on fire all day though as my people need me they need me to pillage and raid a local warlord stronghold my army is waiting for me to give the order i'm actually kind of a big deal around here and it makes me feel special as i briefly forget that i don't have an army at my disposal in real life unless i don't know do you guys want to pillage some villagers with me irl we'd probably go to jail or die but we'd definitely have a cheap laugh or two at the expense of others first i give the order and it's time to go hard now this feels extremely viking-like battles were so much more epic in the middle ages let's be honest the tactics and weaponry were so creative castles were nearly impenetrable fortresses and again you could pillage and not go to jail in fact let's start a contemporary political movement and make pillaging great again say if my neighbour gets the new ps5 or xbox before me i'm pulling out a big axe and i'm pillaging that privileged malacca for everything he's worth don't believe the hype don't be a sheep kill your neighbor and take his possessions or you're a sympt to the system so yeah this raid is pretty damn epic and it's actually surprisingly challenging too which i enjoy the boys and i have to find a balance between fighting and ramming sometimes we get lit on fire too which is simply a horrible thing to do to another human a huge fighter wraps right outside the inner bailey and i'm so low on food that i get worried i might not make it then i remember i'm playing an ac game so i just climb up this tower so that i can try to assassinate their leader if i can take him out the rest will surrender which will be great for us but unfortunately for them our people are not really in the prisoner taking business i find big sexy and shoot arrows at him from up here for a while this isn't too effective so i decide to go for one sweeping blow but i miss by quite some distance and it's incredibly awkward he also has this fire sword and he's really quite an angry unit somebody needs a snack like perhaps munch down on a banana champ imagine carrying a child in your womb for nine months raising them and giving them all your love and then they turn out to be a big angry fire sword guy who doesn't appreciate the benefits of one's daily intake of potassium i realize that he's crazy strong and so i do the mature thing and shoot arrows at him from a distance again this wins me the fight and now i get to decide if he'll live or die to forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that prisoner was you all along and just kidding i kill him in cold blood i do however give him a warrior's funeral because he was a worthy opponent you've gotta show respect to the dead or you'll have bad karma anyway this victory means these lands need a new king and so we marry one of our soldiers to a local 14 year old boy don't overthink it it was a different time where this sort of thing was fine and dandy now we get to enjoy the festives of the wedding i shoot arrow pots and win a wager because gambling is fun for all ages it also seems as if i've had a bit too much to drink but i don't let that stop me from dominating the d floor in australia we have a sacred tradition known as a shoei this involves emptying out your alcoholic beverage into your shoe and then sculling it i think the vikings could have learned a thing or two from australia's rich modern culture the wedding was a huge success and oh wow i swear i tried to kill a civilian earlier and it didn't let me but apparently you can you know how the saying goes don't get shot in the head with an arrow a lot of that going around today i figure i've overstayed my welcome so i take off i then climb a statue of a half-naked lady and i'm definitely going to say that we banged i ride my horse through a spooky forest and a bunch of savages mobbed me which is pretty rude i then raid an incredibly well-defended fortress by myself and i'm struggling as there's simply so many guards it was at this moment i realized you can blow your horn in the air and your crew will run over and raid and pillage with you i guess the lesson here is that if you're ever beating someone up and they start to fight back get your friends to come over and help to ensure that you remain the bully i'm really interested to see how this game turns out thanks for watching you absolute legends and thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy you
