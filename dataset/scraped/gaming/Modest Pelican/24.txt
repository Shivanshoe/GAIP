you all know this stray cat that rocked up to my house called fattoni well they made a trading card for him this is a huge moment for my cat as he's now a pokemon they also made a custom xbox controller made of a water cooler and a shower head obviously both water related objects as i'm pretty pro staying hydrated it's not a dead meme it's holistic life advice the controller actually works which is impressive i imagine this is what god uses when he games originally i asked if they could turn a human into a controller but ubisoft are pretty pro-humanitarian rights hello and welcome to another fun-filled family friendly video today we're going to answer the question what happens when you leave the island in far cry 6. it's definitely not what i expected but first we need to go back to the beginning i load into the game and meet up with my friend stealth omado if you like the video marta will come to your home and give you a deep tissue massage so we're part of a guerilla rebellion group fighting against the fascist government the group is called libertad but my dyslexic ass always reads it as libtard i feel like i'm fighting for the ben shapiro cause momato and i decide to ignore the main missions and do our own thing we grab a boat and head out to sea as it's time to go and libtard some soldiers we eventually reach an island and execute a textbook beach landing if you don't launch your boat unnecessarily far up onto the land when gaming you're a psychopath the sun begins to rise and we realise the island we found ourselves on is gorgeous there's a few soldiers patrolling but we're more than happy to take them down the dogs on the other hand are a much harder ethical issue as who wants to murder a puppy dog it turns out mato wants to murder a puppy dog and with a flamethrower too which seems unnecessarily aggressive but great energy honestly if you ignore the hostility and the corpses this would be a fantastic place to take a little vacation imagine like oh my lord imagine that's the outfit you get hung in like you wear three coat of jean shorts that's what everyone has to look into war crimes more like fashion crime so yeah am i right oh crap rave oh we head deeper into the resort and all mado can talk about is how much he wants to take a trip to an island like this mato is a dictatorial sympathiser confirmed we work our way through the island stealthily taking down any guards we can find eventually a car stops for us and the soldier just straight up surrenders his vehicle the only thing i respect less than a fascist is a fascist who doesn't die for his cause so i put one into his head while driving us to the main mansion mado decides to role-play as a woman and he proceeds to drive the car off the road and then pull to safety wow you thought he was going to crash didn't you it's 2021 we don't make jokes like that anymore because a lot of vehicles can park themselves now we clear the gardens and i'm actually pretty surprised we haven't been detected yet well at least the alarm hasn't gone off mato loots the mansion and finds a secret weapon the blood drunk pistol i love it when you can go off on your own seemingly pointless adventure and still get rewarded we decide it's time to move on so we can save the poor locals uh drive at this student where throw baseball let's do it up here he was covering his face he was he was like he was like depressed or something he's all he's all the way oh my god who's this man where'd he come from whoa was that you no did you not light him on fire no i didn't i threw a baseball at it oh my gosh it was just a you throw you took baseball at him and he caused a horrific barbecue accident bro whoops our actual mission is to make contact with a lad called philly we're basically slowly moving up the coastline to where he's living on the way we see a no diving sign and so naturally we dive because we're not going to obey a totalitarian propaganda designed to control us marto and i are not a part of this system we are lib tarts the revolution also gave us these rocket launcher supremo backpacks that can take down patrolling helicopters they really knew how to get us on board with their cars the journey to philly's camp was a rough one crocodiles attacked us and of course we had to stop for a quick fish motto was nice enough to shoot the old sea mines to help attract the sea creatures to the area i'm no i'm no pro fisherman but i'm pretty sure large explosions help okay got one it worked no way oh my god wow whoa whoa whoa whoa eventually we find the big man's hideout and discover that philly is day drinking it's like 8 a.m people are being hung on posts and this malacca is getting lit i guess here's a facebook mum meme that makes chronic alcoholism silly and fun philly says that he'll reward us if we save a woman and we agree we all pile into a plane and i'm not a great pilot at the best of times let alone when it's in first person remember malaysian airlines flight 370 when all those people disappeared well i was there i was the plane it turns out there's a lot of anti-aircraft guns around and was shot down almost immediately we crash land right where she's hiding and there doesn't seem to be any soldiers in fact it's a scene from a horror movie it appears this man was doing arts and crafts and then ran with scissors and fell and stabbed himself seven times in the chest cavity we find camilla torturing people and it appears that no one on this island has adequate conflict resolution skills the army then surrounds us and collapses on our position so i just ran out the front and have a far cry moment i just start shooting absolutely everything to create explosions i almost went down a few times but getting injured is a treat thanks to the healing animations far cry 2 lives on forever we escape on horseback and it's one of the most scenic moments i've had in recent gaming history well at least it would have been scenic if marto didn't keep exploiting my horse with dynamite we arrive at the camp and meet carlos who's basically steve irwin but instead of saving crocodiles he violently murders them with a machete he does it son safe however with a wide brim hat which i think we can all respect we're now allowed to use carlos's base of operations as our own we equip a bunch of new weapons and then proceed to have a fashion competition and we end up wearing the exact same white suit i swear mato understands me more than my girlfriend does anyway carlos wants us to go and destroy some poisonous chemicals the soldiers are using to grow their tobacco and to make weapons i guess he's only down with people smoking cigarettes if they're organic gotta have a code i've also got this new ability to have someone deliver me a car what the hell that was our car delivery guy oh my god that was a soldier right we arrive at the first facility and start going to town little does carlos know that i've replaced my rocket backpack with a poisonous gas projectile backpack good old-fashioned chemical warfare it's not a war crime if there's no one left to write the history books we clear the first objective and then get a picture message from carlos and it's surprisingly not a dick pic it's further instructions of places we need to saboteur i try and secure a ride off this local but she doesn't want to give up her motorbike she's a tough cookie but she's the only thing standing between mato and i having a legendary side card drive-by moment these blood-drunk pistols we found light enemies on fire and are quite frankly my new favorite thing in the world i think this is the first time i've ever ridden a motorbike with a side card in a game we continue to cancel chemical warfare by using chemical warfare i also adopted a stray cat in honor of fat tony because it just felt like the right thing to do the way we run through the tropical hills together can only be described as majestic we even found one of the anti-aircraft guns that have been causing us issues but we had no explosives to take it down in probably one of the smartest moments in human history we lured a tank over and had it shoot the aa gun for us we put our lives on the line and upon our return to camp we don't get so much as a thank you back scratch from big carlos there's only one thing to do in this position and that's  fighting [Music] oh my god oh my no way [Laughter] that is so funny man and carlos has another mission where he wants us to sneak into a high security prison and break his son out it's not even his real son it's his figurative son i feel as if there's two more figurative sons right in front of carlos's eyes that he's just not seeing marto and i have feelings as well we arrive at the facility and know it's of the utmost importance we stay undetected we sneak around eliminating the guards with our machetes and what is clearly not the most efficient and quiet stabbing method but is definitely the most horrific i proceed to hide her body perfectly in the bush so no one stumbles across it i guess when you see something like this though it just makes you think wow even though they're enemies the evil soldiers are still finding cute little hoods for the prisoners to wear so they don't get sunburned it's the little things that make war bearable i'm not entirely sure how we got spotted but all of a sudden it suns out guns out we quickly find the prison key and break him out i don't really know why he was bitching as it's a nice cool room and there's even mattresses on the ground when i crash at my friend's houses i end up sleeping on a deck chair and using a pair of football socks as a blanket there's a dude out there who's been attached to a stake with barbed wire i think it's time to humble yourself we murder a billion soldiers and escape in a humvee when we arrive we are finally rewarded for our efforts with a party even carlos tells us good job it's all very wholesome but all of this libtard freedom fighting has distracted us from our core objective you see while we've been out and about we noticed there were cargo ships far out in the sea we thought to ourselves what would happen if we were to travel to these ships would there be loot out there would they simply be low poly models that never render would my dad be out there there was only one way to find out we call in a ride and the new driver is somehow worse than the original driver his one job is to deliver cars and he forgets to put the handbrake on somato appropriately executes him we drive down to the airport and this commute looks sensational the second we get airborne missiles begin locking on it looks like there was a second anti-aircraft gun making the whole tank trick completely pointless this might be the saddest thing that's happened all year including the pandemic in my gamer rage i slash two guards to death with a machete and steal their boat the boys are finally going to see what a cargo ship looks like we approached the border of the map excited scared and a little aroused guess we found the edge of the map three months later wait what what we just we just escaped you can just leave and that's it so when the rebellion asked us to fight for them they said it was our choice and we could technically leave at any time i didn't actually think you could i just thought it was implied that we'd stay and fight and not get in a boat and leave and go and relax on some beach i guess this is an easter egg but whatever it is marto and i found it hilarious after the credits roll you can go back to your game and spawn at your original apartment that you used to live in right at the beginning but the problem is this area of the city has been sanctioned off and there's high level troops everywhere mato and i managed to break out and the actual city is really cool it was brutal if you got into an all-out gun fight as these guys were tanky we did find loads of high tier weapons and we even saved a priest so it looks like we still might get into heaven after all i hope all you malakas are doing great we're going to do a roast to the pelican event in the discord this week so i encourage you to come and roast me i'll put the best insults in the next video thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
