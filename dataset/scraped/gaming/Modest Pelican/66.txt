[Music] hi lads and lasses mothers pelican here with assassin's creed valhalla if you enjoy this video force all the children in your basement to subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel today i want to tell you the emotional and pretty inspirational story of how i invaded england so i spawn in and finally we have a game that lets you assassinate people as a child this truly is next gen but now it's actually just a bunch of adults heavily drinking while their mood becomes increasingly aggressive what is this my childhood they even force me to dance it's pretty weird and cult-like unfortunately a rival clan crashes the party and slays everyone so i can escape i am now an adult the quickest puberty ever but yeah welcome to norway and it's now time to find my crew who've been captured i really like vikings in fact i even have this plastic viking helmet i own when my girlfriend and i make sweet love kidding we don't make sweet love in fact i don't even have a girlfriend i usually just rub one out and then cry myself to sleep it's not pathetic though because i do actually wear the helmet i proceed to kill this crow because pelicans are the only bird for me and then i come across something truly strange drawn into the snow it's some kind of symbol and i just wonder what on earth it could mean one thing i know for sure is that whoever made this is very artistic and talented and probably has a great personality if you get to know them wow my content really is top shelf entertainment these days you should like and subscribe if you want to see more intellectual humor but for now it's time to focus on the task at hand i eliminate these two hostiles like a champ and it seems they were both sleeping in the same small tent that sure is cozy but i guess real bros snuggle speaking of bros i find one of my crew members who seems like a gentle soul we agree that i'll storm the fortress and save everyone while he gets the ship ready it seems like i drew the short straw on that one but hey the girls love a hero especially a virtual gamer hero i approach the fortress and judging by the footsteps in the snow it looks like either 12 men walked on this same track or one man with 24 legs it's almost impossible to tell i decide to get an aerial advantage i then spot an unaware soldier which is absolutely perfect as i can now flex my assassin skills i leap down with my axe drawn flying through the air and land about six feet from my target wow this is more awkward than the time i was ordering from subway and the sandwich artist asked what cheese i wanted and i leaned in and kissed him i mean cheddar moments later some big bearded malacca tries to kill me but i do what i always do and shoot arrows into his face from a safe distance this may seem cheap and that's because it is i free my soldiers and now it's time to burn this village to the ground just like the clan would the viking clan we are a viking clan that is a crucial differentiator we all charge out and it's a glorious battle but then again it's actually not it's just me swinging my axes and i'm getting absolutely belted i kind of envisaged us all running out together and there'd be this huge clash but only one of my guys comes out i then just straight up die and it's a pretty full-on death wow alright it's time to set sail for my village so that we can check in as we've been missing for quite some time as we fly along the open water the lads set the mood by singing classic sea chanties such as notorious big's hit song big booty hoes upon arrival i disembark my boat in the most elaborate possible way because this is assassin's creed and that's just what you do everyone seems pretty excited to see me because they probably think i've plundered riches but no we've all just been in sadistic norwegian prisons in fact this expedition probably cost our clan money as we'll all need pretty intense psychotherapy i then no joke get into a rap battle and spit some absolute fire bars if i tell you you're foolish and stupid and dull then i'll tell you you've nothing inside of your skull the only rappers eminem is afraid to battle i talk to this lass and she gives me some new clothes such as this bear mask i'm not sure about it though it seems like a bit much my next task is to go and speak with a wise person that lives on top of a snowy mountain they can't be that wise though imagine grocery shopping you'd need two sherpas and a mountaineering certification to grab a gatorade i hike for ages and ages and eventually reach the summit and the wise woman's house she gives me a bowl of warm soup which is nice but she also spiked to the soup which is less nice and this triggers me to have a weird out of body experience you see back when i was a kid and my village was raided they killed my father in front of my very eyes and now i have daddy issues apparently my subconscious copes with that by visualizing women without any faces doing chores which i guess somehow makes sense they're kind of terrifying but i bet you under those eerie dresses they have dump truck booties the troop gets really weird and next thing i know it's morning i'm sober and in my underwear i don't know what happened last night but there's a good chance i'm no longer a virgin so we're making moves i also feel as if descending an icy cliff in this attire is a real alpha play there's a big meeting going on today between all the viking tribes everyone's getting ready to set sail and i engage in a little light-hearted banter with the team not only does this build a sense of community it's important to show the peasants at the workplace that you value them we set sail once again and nothing can distract us now well i mean we do raid and pillage one outpost on the way i don't know why i bothered ever using a shield as dual wielding axes is way cooler and not as cool as the lads desire to burn everything even before the fight is over it's kind of inspiring though they keep lighting me as well i'm so charred i look like a character that hasn't been unlocked yet after we finish celebrating the win the viking king rocks up and this could be an awkward meeting so i do what i do best take control of the situation i wear nothing but my underwear for the ultimate negotiation power play it turns out the big dog wants us to take down another crew so there's a lot more bloodshed it's pretty glorious to celebrate the dubs i drop an octa tea bag on the corpses some of these guys are my soldiers but it is what it is more important than the fight i decide to attempt something no man has attempted before i will scale the outside boundary cliff of the map and see how high we can go whenever i get an open world game i like to test the limits of the map for some reason unlike those lame game review channels that focus on the quality of the gameplay and graphics which in turn gives you actionable information you can then use i answer the real questions in conclusion you can climb pretty damn high and in true viking fashion i leap because i have faith in the chief god odin he proceeds to let me down pretty massively which i can't imagine helps with the daddy issues alright it's time to go to this big viking meetup this is like hillsong for vikings but hopefully with far less exploitation of vulnerable miners apparently they get up on stage and pray for the group and no joke behind the preacher on a big screen are instructions on how to donate money to the church wait maybe i could get a juicy hillsong church sponsorship i take it all back it's an amazing organization i was blind before i went but after opening my heart to hillsong i can see once more use codepellie when donating we finally arrive and i can't wait to make a good impression on everyone i notice this poor woman is freezing and my heart breaks seeing her shiver in the cold wind unfortunately i have unlimited tortures so i'm more than happy to warm her right up i feel like this is on the same intellectual level as the peony i drew in the snow you need like a phd to understand the multi-layered comedic genius of my videos i have some good chats and even tried to assassinate another viking leader as a practical joke which he takes quite personally most importantly though i let everyone know that norway sucks and will be heading to england to make a new life for ourselves ah yes crossing the atlantic ocean it's kind of crazy to think that these longboats made their way across 900 kilometers of rough seas the voyage typically took between three and six days and there were no beds and more alarmingly no iphone so you couldn't even play a little old-school runescape to pass the time all of a sudden i'm transported to the present day to a cabin in the woods that's actually my remains in the grounds that i'm now looking at if i do say so myself i have exceptionally aesthetic bone structure looks like i also drive a white van not the kind you'd abduct kids in but i mean you definitely could if you wanted to so yeah if you're not familiar with assassin's creed sometimes you come back to the real world let's get back to invading england though so we set sail as the sun shines brighter than my future as an internet personality this country has a lot of strange traditions such as baptism where a priest dunks someone into the water i thought i'd break the mold and be an individual when i got baptized so when the priest went to dunk me i performed a textbook ufc style clinch reversal and dunked him the whole room began clapping and chanting my name because i showed them that you don't have to conform unless it's a communist agenda then yes you obviously have to conform we search for the perfect spot to build our settlement but a chain blocks the river i volunteer to take care of the situation as it'll give me a chance to practice my stealth gameplay i can't say the captain did a great job of hiding our boat but you play with the cards you're dealt i run up this tree that has grown in an incredibly specific way almost as if the developers planned it all looks like all those extra late night training sessions are starting to pay dividends as i'm flying i clear the way for my crew so that they can pass but the dodgy malakas don't even bring the boat close enough wow i just risked my life but odin forbid you scratched the bow of your boat a little bit i'll just freeze to death we finally find the perfect little patch of land to call home that sounds a little too wholesome we are merely setting up a base so that we can have a central point to pillage and murder from in fact these guys asked us to leave and our response was a fight to the death we just sailed along miles of uninhabited river but no we want this one specific spot that these kind gentlemen were already living on we're like a communist government forcing people out of their homes oh wait we love communism so that's a narrative we can all get around we're going to make a life for ourselves here and then start the invasion it's just like when the lads were singing notorious big in the ship earlier we finna going to the spot do our thing like we always do don't take him to the crib unless they bone in thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
