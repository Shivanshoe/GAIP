the worst is behind us gentlemen so the question is where now i know this country a little i told you we should set up camp in horseshoe overlook near valentine we'll be able to hide out there no problem as long as we keep our noses clean well then let's go clean noses and everything else arthur you're in that one bring hosea i know you two like to talk about the good old days and what's gone

look all right whoa what's going on ah i broke the goddamn wheel all right let's get it fixed you need help i reckon we can handle it all right charles you and me hold the thing up while you try and put the wheel back on after you still strong enough to hold up a wagon shut up i'm just saying don't say less pick the wheel up there see you ain't so useless after all not quite what do you think if they wanted trouble we wouldn't have seen them poor bastards we really screwed them over down here come on let's not push our luck what happened well get in i'll tell you not too far now stay on this trail we'll follow the river then cut left inland hurry up we've got work to do so yes the indians in these parts got sold a very raw deal this is the heartlands we're going to good farming and grazing country they lost it all stole them clean away from them it was every blade of grass killed or herded up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere and how's that different from anywhere else well maybe it's not i just heard some of the army out here was particularly uh unpleasant about it unpleasant how do you rob and kill people pleasantly we don't despite it that's just talk i fear i was perhaps trying to simplify something more complicated for the benefit of our block-headed driver here hey don't blame it on me never forget this here's a con man charles born and bred just cause it sounds fancy don't mean he knows a damn thing about what he's talking about yeah so what happened to your trap i don't even know if i have one at least not that i can remember my father was a colored man he told me he lived with our people for a while a number of free men did when we were forced to move from our lands the three of us fled i was too young to really remember much my whole life i've been on the run a couple years later some soldiers captured my mother took her somewhere we never saw her again we drifted around he was a very sad man and a drink had a mean hold on him around 13 i just took off on my own that was about the age we found young arthur here maybe a little older a wild or delinquent you never did see but he learned fast not as fast as marston apparently wait i don't understand what's the problem between you two either it's a long story we still heading the right way that depends are we still heading west in search of fortune and repose in virgin forests as we plan no are we heading in the correct direction on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountains yes i believe so you know this area a little have been through a couple of times there's a livestock town not too far from here called valentine cowboys outlaws working girls our kind of place driscoll's probably them too pinkertons let's hope not in this place we're going wait what's it called again horseshoe open it's a good place to lie low it'll do for now and how low do you think dutch is really going to lie it's just you know maybe it's me who's changed not him but we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right you and me had a real lead in blackwater that could have worked out maybe it just isn't like dutch to lose his head like that things go wrong sometimes people die it's the way it is always has been me you touch we've all been in this line of work a long time and we're still here so i figured we must have got a ride a hell a lot more than we got it wrong what are you working on there anyway just some yarrow and ginseng good for the health better than that stuff you buy in the store yeah you can have all this i'm at the point where i can do it with my eyes closed okay thank you [Music] there you are brother head in there follow the track for a bit thanks hey slow up i'll jump on so okay let's go any trouble getting in here javier nope it went well this is a good spot excellent i think this will work for us either for now anyway here we are gentlemen home sweet home you weren't wrong jose this place is perfect i hope so gentlemen we have survived for now now it is time to prosper our third i were about to prosper in black water we're on to something big then micah got you all excited about that fairy and here we are we have all made mistakes over the years hosea every last one of us but i kept us together kept us alive kept the nooses off our neck i guess i'm just worried i ain't got that long dutch i want folks safe before i go me too and now we are stuck east of the grizzlies and out of money and a long way from a dream of virgin land in the west i know my brother but we are safe we make a bit of money here then we move again head out around them be west of uncle sam in a few months buy some land i hope so would you just look around you this world has its consolations gentlemen i'm going to head into the local town and uh you know see if i can strike up a little business of course hair strauss i prefer robin banks to usury seems more dignified somehow now everyone put your tools down for a moment come on gather round quickly now i know that things have been tough but we are safe now and we are far too poor so it is time for everyone to get to work get to work but stay out of trouble remember we are itinerant workers laid off when they shut down our factory to the north now get out there and see what you can find uncle reverend swanson no more passengers it is time for everyone to earn their keep there is a town little way down the track name of valentine livestock town all mud and morons if i remember right that seems a decent place to start and uh we need food real food that means every day one of you and remember whatever it is that you find the camp gets its slice now be sensible out there now the girls have your tent ready mr morgan come with me you two will be ready shortly we put you over here i'm sure everything will be fine miss grimshaw it should be most your stuff from blackwater got saved everything apart from my money oh don't remind me well we can always make more money we're gonna have to miss jackson i've seen [ __ ] with more common sense if you do it properly [Music] [Music] got off the mountain rode east into some pretty enough country called the heartlands ain't been this far east in many a year dutch seems a little better his eyes are sparkling once more i can see he's thinking a little clearer i think we all feel a little happier spite of black water in that whole mess right there jose quite a day let's hope so there's a bunch of the boys already in valentine bill charles and javier and swanson found something down at the train station by the lake apparently and strauss came back with that creepy little smile on his face i'm sure there's a whole list of unfortunates he's forced money upon thank you and you i'm gonna read a book
