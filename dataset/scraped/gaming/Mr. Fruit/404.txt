heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to some more modded among us and let's dress the elephant in the room i finally got a haircut it only took a lot of months but it finally happened and i lost a couple pounds so anyway in today's video we're playing cops and robbers inside of among us you know what the game mode is you're gonna love it but essentially the way it works there are three cops and the rest of everybody are thieves or robbers and the goal is the robbers thieves are trying to get all their tasks done before the cops can capture them all and all that needs to happen is one thief needs to have done all four of their tasks and he's if that thief is the only one outside of jail or if all thieves aren't in jail have done all their tasks the thieves win but the cops are obviously well trying to lock up the thieves so they run and as long as they touch a robber or thief they get thrown into jail and other robbers can come save them if they touch them while they're in jail and if they're not already in jail you know like if they're free so to speak but that's the way it works you'll notice too though because of how we were able to play it we were playing like 8 million ping so some of it doesn't make any sense and i think that kind of makes it even a little bit funnier but we had a ton of fun i hope you guys enjoyed this video let's get into it i think cops and robert sounds like a lot of fun i don't know how it works but it sounds uh i think i did that don't like to be handcuffed from the back okay all right maybe door [Laughter] robbers okay how does that work how does it work i don't know if this is what we're supposed to do wait so oh oh i think we have to do our tests avoid the cops and you know maybe save each other i don't know so you're not supposed to kill us when you're cops costume change but it's still a little crazy rest in peace to play cops and robbers and among us all the players in the lobby will need to be on board and cooperate with the house rules since the game does not officially support this mode this is the kind of minigame players should attempt blah blah blah in this minigame each map is imagined as a prison and imposters are the cops the crewmates meanwhile are the robbers trying to escape one room because a holding cell where the only way out is to be rescued by a fellow crewmate or robber the cop with the powers of imposter can you enter the vent and count to ten the crewmates as robbers will all need to find a place to hide to escape the prison the crewmate robbers must finish all their tasks they can't begin working on tasks until the countdown is completed and the cop is left event they just say stop and then you go to jail and follow yeah no i i i think you know you run away tap them yeah i feel like yeah what do you mean you run over them you run over them and they go to jail automatically oh okay so who killed me as a cop last round i i killed somebody oh yeah whatever oh well all right boys we gotta go find these guys uh you're like head head honcho dude you're like oh i'm like head guy yeah yeah your head is what does that mean no idea like you can vent and we
