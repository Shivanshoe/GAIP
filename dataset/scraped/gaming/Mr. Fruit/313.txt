heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to super smash brothers ultimate i debated opening it by introducing myself as that guy that needs a haircut but no more that's right your boy got a fresh cut just in time being able to see this absolute honker yeah you're welcome so super smash brothers i get an itch to play it every now and then believe me just a little bit satisfies that itch and then it quickly turns in the mold so i decided let's play some smash brothers until i get to that point and then i just cold turkey cut it off until the next time i get a hankering for it because it never goes something about me in nintendo games man i don't know it awakens something in me that i quite frankly i don't like you know so enjoy the video uh last time i played smash whenever i rage quit i don't know whenever i played pyro and mithra i think uh so i'm little i'm a little cold quite literally gameplay wise and my hands they're cold uh so instead of warming up i'm just gonna to immediately hop into online and i know i made a vow that i would never do this again but there's there's a reason i don't make promises i can't keep and that was a promise that i did not plan on keeping so here i am it has to kind of be like guilty gear you know uh so it's all a matter of who do we want to play i'm feeling i'm feeling spicy no shame in my game baby he i think he got some buffs at some point i couldn't tell you what patch yo what up girl oh we're just oh oh now we're playing oh rude okay look at me just starting off with the the smell okay all right i've already thrown out approximately too many smash two too many smash attacks are you kidding me she's too low for me to oh my god i already hate this game why that she automatically low profiles my smash attack does that even hit her i have no idea wouldn't be surprised if it didn't okay all right all right i'm a big body that's what she's looking for yo take this oh okay i will not fall for your sorcery okay i don't i don't know how to punch that so i'm just gonna it didn't work that's as meaty as ever though and i'm throwing okay okay okay okay we got down smash do not forward smash remember that because it does not work all right i see what kind of a game you're trying to play here and quite frankly i don't oh no again okay okay heroes never die are you okay all right now i'm playing the game i plugged in my controller i'm good to go oh look at me i can sit here and just bring it okay i meant to do an aerial and apparently the game input that is uh nothing cause who doesn't love a little online lag okay i don't again i don't know what to do there so i'm sucked oh my god oh my god she could arrest me there yo your shield's looking real tiny there girl that knockback is actually insane

way or the other i tell you what brother take that oh what i think i've yet to get him with a oh oh darn it it went the wrong way no oh wait i guess if i'm too close it doesn't hit he's low profiles but the farther away i guess i kind of the smash attack gets angled stupid i wonder if there's a better punish i could go for there it's probably right get one of those uh-huh not today trying to fall asleep what'd i tell you what did i tell you yup we adapted baby it took what three or four hours but there we go before i've made two people quit see i might have lost that jelly puff a lot but he
