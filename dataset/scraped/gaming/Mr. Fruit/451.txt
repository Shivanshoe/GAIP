on me shady i go in i'm fixing lights you come in and right outside of lights you can report a body and you didn't report it there was a body there wait the other the other thing that i have is that shark was the one saying in round one oh i wanted to show you how good a scan looked on me yes and i followed him he followed me crafty killed it home all right dawn killed crafty and specimen i think there was no body why'd you say that yeah because i was running down this basket no there wasn't it was running from the top there was nobody i ran to specimen to go check and to check on crafty is because i thought crafty was going down to kill you don we're not voting right now the last person i saw with crafty was you i'm voting for wait so we have dom pointing that rob wrong pointing at don shady pointed shark shark pointing at um i'm pointing at kevin anymore are we voting for skipping who's being accused is dumb no i am so confused not doomed i'll following that i'm pretty done not doom here i guess i'm going bald cuz call me mr clean all right that worked out pretty well i didn't even have to say anything which is nice because normally i have to say stuff okay great man people just point your fingers i'm like yeah let's i'll point my finger that way why not you want to point your finger that way sure yeah go for it oh kevin i know what he was trying to do and i respect it i'm doing this again that's great i'm event goblin bro i'm a vent fiend wait so it wasn't omen what oh my god where was the body the body is like where you like the map room thing like by where the bookshelves are now i think because what do you mean who was next to me you were on me like white on rice yeah like what is this full how did i happen to leave and then you just happen to find it where are can i ask a question how fast can you like is there a cooldown from if you kill someone to self-reporting no you could just there's no no so it could have been don who killed crafty at the very beginning but it it was it would have been so fast okay but but the body was found bridge's body was found i think dawn killed crafty like literally right as the body was called but it was yeah because that was found as bridges rob and dom were pointing at each other for the med bay killer they're both alive so one of them has [ __ ] i [ __ ] watch you try to figure out what to fake you walk to the bottom and went oh wait there's no task here and then brandon the weapons were like oh i'm gonna fake weapons and then sat in front of weapons for two seconds and we're like oh wait i'm not gonna do that either i'll sit in front of upload for 20 seconds it's gone where's the moddies where are the bodies that works for me i think it's asteroids it's either rob or don you gotta tell me where the bodies are i'm going dogs i'm going dawn what's where are the bodies where are the bodies please tell me where the bodies are done where's the party maybe i am third is like in the little map room where like the bookshelves are like right next to me a vote for crewmate is a vote for don let's get this over please i'm not voting okay then your imposter got out robbie is like who was it o2 nice we got him let's go what let's go boys [Music] dawn impostors and two other people fighting you were getting nothing there nothing at that point the votes were cast dude you were scared it was let's go baby got the content now we get the detective who said that oh whom you want to talk about you want to talk about that oh my god i'm so good at that i should become an astronomer rice could have killed me and he still could still cook no good bryce if you have it do it right if you have it bryce rice you want to talk about this is he going to kill me bryce why would he sit on there to pretend like he's checking and then not do when i'm like please go ahead i'm gonna i'm gonna die here although he could have just killed me there too was there two kills you the oldest trick in the book robbie and you fell for it twice this is your second time i you're just mad that i just caught you with the sandy move and now you're like oh [ __ ] no no no wait all right here's what happened rob well first off rob what move do you think shark did no he's trying to claim that he did the sammy which is high no i did the sammy you see he's trying to claim that he did the same way why would you ask robbie first what move he did why didn't you ask me because i reported about it well because i believe you more friend well no i was trying to see if rob had the same idea okay so what what are we talking about okay i'm gonna always do it now to try and catch somebody who's doing it but i did it and i caught you jerk what happened tell us okay here's the play-by-play all right the start of the round i forgot what was my first test i don't remember then i i hear whatever the goes up i went to the left tower i hid behind it i was holding the button and then uh while holding the button uh i don't know who was it that was up there but robbie killed it was bridge it killed he killed bridge [ __ ] can i tell you what really happened now i'm running up to do i do the left reactor and then i'm like you know what i'm actually going to pull the sami here i sit back relax wait a little bit up comes poor little bridge and then does it and then who comes up afterwards the shark kills him and then shark sees that i kills and reports the boss that's literally my s the same story yeah you just said that he saw you kill him yeah rob yeah you literally just said he saw you kill break i've had three quarters are we are we gonna i'm voting it is up to you guys did i freak you out i was like this is it i'm dead and i was like if there's only one kill it's like oh i didn't have that task no for once you guys listen to me and i will kiss all of you honestly the way the way shark came at it immediately makes me think rob was caught in his like how am i going to play this or like like he didn't see it he took a little while and he goes oh you're trying to that's why i think it seems like one of rob's tells he usually does that so that's why i initially assessed him and he just says and then shark comes up and he sees me kill him and i'm like sorry you just you just admitted to it so you just admitted to killing him like all right yeah i'll vote off that i already assessed you ah kevin and rob huh [Music] don't fix lights kevin you're gonna look weird unless you report it oh okay where was everybody so crafty and don tell me why it's the other one i don't think it's i haven't seen jesse this whole time i'm in columns i'm in the little uh water filter thing where what the water wheels just came out of decontamination uh did my task in there but mr fruit and i was scanned together at the beginning so that's why i knew it wasn't mr fruit where where was the body uh outside of electrical in the hallway going down towards like the tree i knew it that's all i avoided there so i trust shark with my life thank you i don't know who the other one is bryce why you could still be a 50-50 man who voted yeah and there was only one kill killed and won the game why wouldn't you trust shark k-snide because you didn't trust me what i said for the horde okay that's meta because that's the other game all right where does this is a new game all right i totally forgot what happened last game this is this game all right kevin okay i'll i'll do my best throw everything hold on we got 18 seconds left do we do we want to throw a vote shark who do you think it is uh shark you have four seconds to say it's price i'm just kidding i'm kidding i don't know who it is [Laughter] oh my god this is really how it ends what the fudge this click's so bad i saw him he's running down made i'm feeding oh it's he only needs two more kills and no everyone kind of vouched for where they were and no one was really placed around electric except for kevin the self-report of all self-reports all right but just like that oh my god wait i have all these tasks wait i thought i was close to don it's kevin i told the reason i know it's kevin don is all the way in specimen shark and i were hanging together kevin i'm sorry bud i literally okay hold on i literally came from weapons up and then fixed the lights and then i went back out so you wouldn't have gotten out of specimen it was ten percent like twenty percent fifteen percent why did you earlier think it was either don or crafty well i thought you wouldn't self report but now i understand that you did and your omega brain but not omega brain not unless bryce is omega braining and self-reporting himself i'll just say say marriage baby crap cause uh kevin where did you what side did you come from did you come from the outside or the inside i was you're outside liar get him out of there i'm not lying i feel like it's not nice we have the evidence i think this is so funny i can't believe rob lost because of that please let's go [Music] rob do you really not remember when you said you literally said like yeah shark came up and saw me kill [Music] him [Music] you
