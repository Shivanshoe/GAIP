hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to today's video and in today's video i didn't write a script for this ah shoot i got the paper something here in today's video um all right hey we're playing a whole bunch of different demos on steam because it was like demopalooza or whatever so it's a variety video and i'm just gonna go ahead and warn you seems like every game coming out in the future is a sandbox survival game apparently that's just the wave i mean what do we have here we have rust has been popping off uh valheim has been popping off minecraft has always been popping up but i feel like it's got a surge again all these samurai survival games and now there's going to be a million more so let's go collect some stones and some branches baby tree of life audrey audreya i'm not really sure this is a demo and the steam upcoming game festival where there's like 8 million demos it's supposed to be a multiplayer survival game the demo is only single player but i like the arch style look there's a freaking boat it's a survival game i'm a sucker for him but i'm going to say it seems like there's 8 million survival games coming out so we'll see hydration break oh that's good [Music] hello g wilkers seemed very much like the uh tf2 soldier hold me jack ocean man take me by thy hand take me to the land that you understand the greetings motion blur needs to be turned off okay it's a demo i don't i don't have that option but that's okay what do we got going on here should i be opening these things up i don't know there's a fellow survivor though let me talk

don't know if it's an infinite map or it's just randomized to whatever it is here okay yeah all i know is i should just start picking things up start picking up some branches literally just need like one more stick and then i can start killing the local wildlife not that that's of course what i'm what i want to do but it is what i'm trying to do and over here we have um well quite frankly i don't

see i assume this does should do more damage right okay maybe not this is not oh okay you know we killed one guy and maybe we i got a little ahead of myself maybe we cut our losses i'm thinking that's what i do what's this little gravesite there's so many cool little things this looks so cool oh we got raspberries okay that's probably you can probably eat that right uh eat as you all know i i do

a workbench seems pretty nice uh let's get the torchlight it is getting a little dark that seems smart i need leaves it wouldn't stick there's so much to do this is so bizarre i'm finding everything except for things i feel like i should be finding like rocks and apparently leaves i'd i don't know where i find those you'd think they'd be on trees right can i climb nope okay there uh appears to be

furnace which lets me get steel ingots wow astute astute observation mr fruit did you figure that out yourself yes actually okay well turns out we like caves they have a lot to offer wow look at this we got a little okay i don't know how i'm supposed to normally make it up there we got uh lakes love that i love water we got holy looking temple things love this what is this exactly a portal into another dimension perhaps oh my god wait this map's huge that's all we've seen okay i'm i'm into this i'm digging it what you are a tr what are you oh my oh my he's asleep it says oh oh oh it's it's kid the bear okay i found him oh okay you sir you have yourself a nice day all right well for the most part my friends that appears to be uh [Music] what was the name of this place the game tree of life audrey of course of course personally i'm actually really looking forward to this when it does come out 100 i want to play this with some of my boys i think co-op and this would be a lot of fun honestly our style and everything it's also super early alpha i think it's pretty promising so one of the demos i played that has my my approval look into it if you want to check it out next up on the long list of demos i downloaded during the same demo crazy thing frozen flame i know little to nothing so wait why is nobody on seems sass i don't know apparently it's [Music] supposed to be subtitles okay i'm just gonna skip because quite frankly i don't know what they're saying oh look at me i am a flame welcome to your life wanderer neither dead nor alive only by the magic of lame you continue to exist you must seek the dragon chronos and leave this place just follow the path ahead okay thanks the magical tree the magical what is this actually requires blue crystals okay i got nothing i guess just keep walking and i'll figure it out as it go oh i can kick oh shoot come here okay i can't do any okay i'm just gonna can i open this nope okay i am so confused should have figured out i should have realized what i was playing i am you know whoops okay wow i shall meant a lot of health i can only punch you oh okay well death i really hope they don't expect me to be able to make that jump oh i got an error bow and arrow okay that probably probably supposed to get that earlier huh oh okay now i'm actually doing damage do i have infinite arrows i'm unsure but i think i'm killing it right now i apparently have a lot of arrows so i can loot you which gave me bones and oh i think more blue or okay so i should definitely go back and open this stuff huh okay are we getting this was i supposed to get close yeah it's probably important huh oh yeah i guess i was supposed to look at these and uh okay it's about using a sword i didn't have a sword i well i would have gotten and that's how i would have gotten it if i just okay and then it just told me to open it i would have gotten a sword okay i wish we could just kind of rewind this and pretend i knew all that from the start i guess i need to start shooting this dude he's a big fella okay he's just looking at me menacingly so hardcore oh okay i don't know how i didn't get hurt at all oh my wait is he dead oh okay guess i killed him wow this is probably something i need to get across the bridge a wooden glider yeah what do you know wow oh nobody said i was the brightest and that appears to be uh the dragon i think that we're talking about hey hi how are ya the curse cannot be lifted yes only by fulfilling your goal can you achieve serenity but i will give you a piece of my power right i'll be sure to do that now that i have a better grasp of what's going on oh title drop already frozen play the game that mr fruit has no idea what it is or what he's doing oh i will say though i love the aesthetics here it's supposed to be like big like massive multiplayer or whatever you know like 50 100 people on the shirt or whatever i'm assuming maybe because if it's a demo i'm only by myself but yo what up um blacksmith oh very original another wanderer distracts me from work here to my my craft whatever man yeah yeah oh he did not like that i'm kind of out of stammer though oh okay we got him it's good to see well uh first you need to learn the truth collect the shards of broken memories and bring them to me sure do i have any of those skill trees am i sp am i supposed to know what i'm doing here uh ancient chest okay it says right here is an altar this thing an altar oh it is pray oh i get an upgrade oh there's lots of things to upgrade oh this is overwhelming i'm just going to do vitality i pray for more health now let me go open up the chest oh there's a cube of something in here i don't know but it had a green crystal oh there's another oh ragged gloves they didn't think i would see this they didn't think anyone would find this but i'm a keen one yo yay yay i'm out of stamina give me a second nice get destroyed dude oh they're fighting each other let them fight uh okay well i guess i'm dead you know what let's just go to the next demo all right trail of ayash i'm gonna be honest i didn't read what this one was either all right i don't know who i am but i'm double cheeked up word trail of ayash build 2.0 press h to see the tutorial i would like that oh it's a lot of reading anything i can read it's crap die oh boy all right give me a second it's a good thing i got glasses they gave me plus free intellect okay well that was confusing i got a legendary tomahawk hey how you doing buddy kind of look dead are you one of those savages what are you doing here the invading tribe from the north still might be here that is bro these lands are lost you can find nothing but death here i see that look at my chest bro i don't know how much time i got left who are you doesn't matter dude scream also what is my posture wow that's some great posture i told you a little too far back i'd work on that anyway yeah what am i doing no stop using your magic bro you're ruining your your mana or whatever okay we're moving forward to search for items nearby area hold v that looks like a bow to me no you might be like oh scrapes how do you use the bow and arrow not a clue thank you for the stone knife okay not sweet moses horde above i swear i'm i'm swearing bro i'm crouching i'm crap no don't go to the eagle crouch crouch oh heavens heavens what crouch left control find the world okay oh hey that look you look friendly voyage to the mainland oh would you look at that you are not friendly ow oh jesus okay i don't know what we're doing right now buddy but it looks like i'm winning oh my god get pooped on i'm not looking at my phone i swear i'm very engaged i'm pressing crouch dude so you have to put your weapon away they don't tell you very strange that's a so uh what's up dude what's up what's up talk to me talk to me thank you thank you friend die well in peace or uh valiantly did it oh psychedelic mushrooms nice purple pretty good i'll take some more of that why not never have too much of that stuff okay it's ultra bright you can use your ammonist powers sure okay um okay there's stuff way out there okay so now the fun's about to begin it looks like looks like i'm about to be left out into the wild old by myself to take out weapon all right guess we're gonna have a couple of baddies here a lot of people died here oh shoot okay very intimidating very intimidating take this oh you are bleeding so much dude all right your friend stood no chance i don't know what i'm really doing but it's working press buttons i need a little more feedback that you know what here's some the combat isn't very visceral you know it's not there yet it needs to pack i feel like it's packing a punch hit stop or whatever you know time freeze on some big hits or something some delay and whatever it's not important oh the old chef how do you do get to know i'm just pressing buttons i'm gonna be honest i'm a horrible person um okay so i'm gonna assume he told me something important but i says here reach the camp that's what i'm gonna do i'm assuming there's gonna be some baddies waiting for me here oh there's a crafter there's a travel man ah hey i need to travel you guys know who i can talk to ah go see the travel man uh you know i didn't think about that okay so i guess this is the map or something all right you know let's try the next [Music] i demo it's another open world survival game like i said there's quite a few of these in uh these demos uh it says right here we can survive two days in the demo all right let's see if we can make it that far love the cinematics production value it's a nice tapestry they have a nice rug oh the rug's gone okay oh we got uh what what is this called gr nugna spork i click on the water bottle don't let me drink oh that's good find water i don't have much left actually wow yeah this is desolate okay this is nice and inviting i'm gonna go straight because that appears to be the only thing i can see so why was i running in the middle of the desert that's the real question well isn't that convenient i'm i missed the oasis by oh i don't know like 100 feet if i just gone a little bit more what is this stone oh whoa wait whoa whoa what did you bake can i whack this thing ow okay sorry gave yourself a nice day press to drink i'm pressing but it's not working okay press r to refill okay so you want to hold it it didn't say that but that's open the crafting menu not available in demo there's plenty of other stuff available okay i don't have anything but it's good to know oh crap the raw knife oh now i'm gonna mess that oh i need one more one second crab you're about to go down or crap what that's a scorpion all right oh shoot yo what are you you're a frog died yeah now you're demonic looking fry that's what you are i'ma take you on come here yeah i find a scorpion who wins me a venom sack give it to me all right cut down a yuca plant i'm gonna assume that's just the tree looking thing right in front of me how do i how do i do it how do i do it oh no that's a date palm oh banana banana tree palm yuka yuka there we go i don't know the difference between all those obviously the the banana i do okay we got stems up the booty okay i'm making a marker extremely high low temperatures deal damage over time okay you can rotate the item with arrow keys uh so i point this way i guess that's the op that's the opposite way where i spawned press m to open it flag will appear this has a flag whip here where i place the marker is that a flat uh i thought that was me that's my flag okay uh same sort of remove markers from the map well that's unfortunate and there appears to be locusts or bees or something keep mosquitoes get away from me you know i'm just gonna start running and we'll go from there oh okay i don't know what that is but that's a building oh there are some goats billy goats what are the differences um clearly i would not survive out here in the desert i have oh heat exhaustion that appears to be what i have i'm getting very tired wow survival game indeed my survival everything is draining very quickly which is understandable it's hot as balls mentally too i'm probably exhausted and quite frankly if i was in his position i probably would rather just keel over and die i get the premise of the game you know big open desert hot and stuff but i know inherently it's kind of i don't mean to sound mean but kind of boring just desolate not much around i mean i guess i haven't played a survival game we're in the middle of desert but maybe that's for a reason i don't know or maybe i'm fatigued the fudge was that fatigue on survival games and i'll go fight that thing what you want oh my god oh jesus oh low oh what happens i don't know what you are but you are the devil reincarnated into weird tapeworm form yeah i'm dead i died and not only that i farted and it stinks that was star sand um you know maybe you just need to get going a little bit more but i it just didn't really hook me i guess the tapeworm thing was cool but yeah another demo feel free to judge it on your own or try it yourself or you know it's early with a certain thing all much watching have yourself a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
