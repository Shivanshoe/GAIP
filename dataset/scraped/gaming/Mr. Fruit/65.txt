what's going on they made some great changes but do it again you know i just want to craft some cool guns man stop stop what are you made out of god oh boy heidi ho everyone my name is mr fru heidi however my name is mr fruit welcome back destiny 2. i got i got i got the emote i'm sabbath i'm savatusi this is the kids i'm on my warlock as you see here yep yep i know it's not a titan forgive me i've betrayed you all but what's really happening is i've been grinding all my characters in fact just to show you how much i haven't had a life the past i'm rank 103 in the battle in uh season pass battle pass whatever the fudge you want to call it and um it's a couple days before the raid so yeah i've been playing a good amount of destiny maybe a little too much frankly but we'll get into that some other time so then what in the 90 we're doing here right now what's the deal here well the deal is the last sector my friends here's my walk and i don't really have much of a f well actually hold on i don't this is fixable there we go we got the whole warlock ornament fit i actually really dig this warlock helmet if i'm being honest with y'all look at that look at me go and warlocks i gotta say as i've been playing one and trying and just messing around with my fate you guys got done dirty with your little armbands man compared to hunters i think it goes in order hunter cloaks titan butt cloth butt wipes butt towels whatever you'll call them and then these armbands man like i'd rather have a butt towel i know i know i think you guys would too frankly so anyway if we go over here into exotics here's the deal boom titans got it all got everything of course because i ever played titan hunter oh i've gotten a little bit here recently actually quite a bit i was missing a good bit warlock however is starting to shape up and that's because i've been grinding lost sectors i got every exotic in the season pass with this i've been buying the pre-destined engrams whatever from zur yesterday i went through and got all the arms in the lost sector so we got all those today's helmet which means i'm chasing after the dawn chorus cause i obviously don't have one then i'll have to wait for chest and leg day don't skip leg day you know what i'm saying plus i need these things they're ridiculous your empowering rift grants you devour like bro and i gotta say it's it doesn't feel fair man i swear to god bungie bungee favors warlocks okay there's definitely some bias there if you're a warlock player you're probably inclined to disagree which is understandable you know but hey man shut up you're gonna give it away i haven't looked at this stuff though i hit rank 30 with french on my titan but i haven't looked that's just geez i'm telling you man what are these warlock bonds the villa is also interesting i know how i feel about this was this awards sure [Music] anyway today's lost sector is in the throne world which is very fun i haven't done a throne world lost hector yeah and slight problem i actually haven't done the lost sectors at all on my non-titans so first mission if i choose to accept it is kill this high value target real quick also by the way i got the osteo striga catalyst i actually got it about the second day of the dlc i deserved right for it so good it's oh my god this thing's one of my favorite guns i tell you what it's just it's so satisfying so yeah i have to do the lost sector on normal first and then we'll knock out master shouldn't be too hard the mask the master or the well i think i might just do it on legend because frankly the drop rates between legend and master aren't that different but the amount of time and effort it takes are vastly different so probably just gonna do it on legend i'll do master eventually but going on over here what's going on on my how's it going today hold on we we got another bogey i'm taking i'm taking the bogey out by the way gotta say big fan of the light bearing knight just enemies frankly they're fun to battle they don't need like mods or anything i don't know they make you play different but at the same time they don't make them fun to fight does that does that make any sense am i making sense probably not what is this doo doo i don't actually know i just have so much stuff and yes my vault is full again so just kind of auto dismantling a lot of stuff because i don't really the real estate for anything else the throne world aesthetic though oh oh i'm all about it i love it i've been grinding ladies and gents okay and again i briefly alluded to it earlier for better or worse um because currently there's been a lack of uploads here and there recently uh just gonna be honest with you all my mental has been in the dumpster as you all may know i deal with depression anxiety adhd you know everything between here and there but it is what it is however despite dealing with it and trying to learn to live with it for over a decade and a half at this point or even more i don't know i really break it down i'm gonna start to feel older than i am but some it's sometimes you can only do so much and sometimes it just really sucks and recently it's really really really suck normally i but i've been able to at least work through it not recently also get absolutely pooped out it's the power of the ostrich so free in fact recently i've the most i've been able to do is get out of bed frankly so the fact that i'm here right now finally recording something feels like a big step to me for you just like okay whatever it's just another video mr fruit well for me it's a little more than that hopefully i can find my groove again or i don't know i need to do a master eventually right why not for the content i'm gonna regret this aren't i okay i don't know if i'm sold on this loadout but it's the one i'm using we got of course the gucci salvador salva which i do need to infuse but we need ark for shields and also the guns pretty good um it's chain reaction or vorpal i think i think we'll go chain reaction demolition is why now let's go major respect you know what no because it's been my crutch all the time but not today i haven't used this but it's my highest level scout rifle explosive pair that tunnel vision doesn't but explosive payload seems pretty cool okay i think it goes to that same we're probably going to go stag here and i actually know if this will get us up a level but because we're 15 so we're still going to be 13 like below did this fit 1560s okay let's put this guy up to 53 maybe 66 okay i'm getting trolled but you know it's gonna pay off because i'm getting exotic first try baby 100 oh look at that arc shield absolutely decimated this knight is in shambles and he's also lagging a little bit okay perfect i don't think i need to kill these guys but i'm going to anyway remember i will want to kill all the champions regardless holy damage batman because they will give me platinum score which gives you best chance at rewards which queen has been pretty good so far but i think there are a couple things that are going to make her break it first off the campaign yeah i think it's just the best bar none i don't really think there's much room for debate there is incredible ow but what is up for debate is frankly i think it kind of screwed up gambit even more they made some great changes but the stuff that hasn't ended up working like some of this galley spam and stuff from heavy ammo being available to everybody i think has made it insufferable at least for me pvp being dominated by like permanent invisible hunters everywhere those aren't great but the pbe i would say is in a pretty good spot minus and i got it oh no no i was reloading let me stagger okay hold on this is perfect that was not as much as i was hoping that would do okay no stop stop why do you always do oh my okay see that one didn't finish him whatever all right i'll find ammo oh my god what i have the ah jesus oh my friend don't hurt me please she's like well i did not like that now did i pump um go for it must make it but my biggest it's like what i love and hate about this expansion so far is um is the crafting system simply because the the way the system's set up the craft can't get in your garage that's cool but the the weight in order to get okay i can almost finish him i can punish him like i like the wellspring until i realized i needed patterns and had to farm those and then spent like eight hours getting absolutely nothing from it i'm like you know i don't really like the wall spring anymore kind of tainted it for me you know i just want to craft some cool guns man and not only that it's just a little strange to like want you to be able to make your own god roll and experiment except you make your god roll and then you want to change like one thing oh by the way it's going to absolutely destroy you financially emotionally mentally you little boners no come on is it still it's still there oh okay all right he's practically dead oh boy okay all right mistakes i've made a few okay he's dead he's dead and i and i'm gonna die okay all right but i still have plenty of revives we're gonna beat this it's just a matter of when am i gonna beat this i only want g horn so don't don't do your little armor thing over you just had to be a boner huh all right all right kill kill the kill the plebs then we'll focus armor dudes after that yo yo get out the weight that's not enough damage oh my god i thought more of you were dead what is this no stop it stop it please spare me are you essentially the power level i'm gonna be fighting the raid at to this are you kidding me i have i have my super i'm just gonna have to whip it out not much else to do here i'm gonna wait for him to do his thing maybe i should just open with g horn i don't know okay yeah maybe we're just opening with g horn from now on and of course this little boner you've got to be the reloads man what are you trying to do like preserve your life bro it's cringe yeah screw oh you kidding me oh oh my god oh i ain't doing it come on give me the new what what i didn't get anything well you know we got a triumph so at the end you know it's the friends we didn't make along the way i hate everything yeah we'll get my postmaster too if something messed up nothing nothing all right screw this dude see this is like what why do master when ready i'm gonna i'm gonna do lunch i'm gonna do legend i'm gonna speed run it okay i'll see in like 30 seconds also side note i'm pretty excited for today after this i'm gonna work out and then i get to go see the batman i've been waiting so i think robert pattinson's gonna kill it okay everybody had their doubts about them but they're wrong okay he's got chops he's about to prove everybody wrong it's gonna be a great movie i'm excited just thought i'd share that with you you know after taking mentally a lot of l's recently i'm looking forward to a dub all right i'm excited to go see and that's all that matters well chain reaction easy peasy and then pop you should be dead are there any more champions actually i don't know maybe maybe there aren't well you can do you go oh you're going to do freaking oh dude stupid i shouldn't have to kill these things i should ready i'm going to open the chest and bottom left is going to say like reward tier platinum rewards platinum one enhancement coil a little upset about it but also ironic it took me about a third a fourth of the time and i actually got something from that literally just just one helmet too i just need one drop it's not even like oh gotta farm 80 million gauntlets like i did the other day which by the way went pretty quick actually i had to get like six exotic gallons you're dead maybe like two hours yeah so current pace ain't looking great comparatively but yeah just screw you i just need to make sure i have three rockets for the last room check this out did you guys see that i'm sick this little little head peak he doesn't know what to do nevermind he's managing we're close just need to be able to finish him that's enough right it's not enough it's not uh no i don't have a problem finishing and even if i did so what you know it's a completely normal thing all right all right come on pick it up here we can shave some time off this lost sector i need to get used to a coot too because i'll have plenty of hunter helmets to grind for all right i was gonna say fire away but he's hiding far we far away he's gonna do his little thing but that's oh my god he didn't which actually means it's free real estate come on come on guys it's what come on ain't nobody got time fo dish i'm skipping this what the 90 a what a pop yeah there you go dummy all right all right it's actually happening holy more rocket ammo ah stop stop what are you made out of ah dude these acolytes are the hardest part i swear to god [Music] just gotta grab my exotic real quick lads don't mind me [Applause] all right come here all right we got him this time all right here we go here we go here i am i'm dead i'm dead get away from me oh god he's super no take this throw that dead if it first shots the scene do it again huh screw you please please please don't armor don't armor don't why why are you the way that you are oh my my hope that here goes the speed i don't have it stop you are everything that i hate all right that's fine because my pain will be rewarded with my exotic helmet as seen oh there was heavy here the whole time where where is the god in actually you know what i don't even need to where is he oh there it is are you two and a half minutes surely an insane pace like this will be rewarded with the exotic that i am searching for [Applause] first try baby first thing god okay i'm outta here holy so how many let's see how many um hunter exotic comments am i missing here i'm sure it's not that bad excuse me i was in the menu rude only two wow there's not nearly as many oh it's just warlocks have a lot more helmets shift instead of dodge the fudge is that me oh yeah i've heard this is just absolutely troll sick looking mask though what's this thing i got even do it looks pretty dumb i'm gonna be honest with you daybreak projectiles cause targets to burn unconduct and deal more damage to them all your benefits are slightly against my manager each time when you burn damage your target yeah ooh that's kind of cool that's all there is to it baby it's mr fruit the reformed pve god i know i know now in the meantime i gotta can continue to get day one ready is that gonna is like this is that gonna help me day one no cause i'm probably just gonna use my titan however i do want to have my warlock and hunter ready in the event that in some encounter we're like hey we need more hunters or more warlocks and then i can switch be that guy you know what i'm saying but either way i'm looking forward to it i'm also incredibly anxious i also love you all thank you very much for your support and watching been having insane imposter syndrome but you know what that's another discussion for another time i'll talk to you guys in the next one very well [Music] [Music] you
