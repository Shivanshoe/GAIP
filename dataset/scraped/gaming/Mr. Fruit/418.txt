heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and i can hear myself reverberating throughout this helmet this is so odd anyway welcome to the greatest game on the face of this planet the greatest esport and i don't know why more people don't play it you might remember a video a long long time ago cue the flashback today everyone because today we're fighting terrorists we did play this game once upon a time and quite frankly surprisingly it did not take off as an esport yet so i thought i'd throw it back in the mix remind people um hello free to play intense strategy game of game of the dec century and i'm here to defuse some bombs game we can make a beginner what do i look like to you huh couple of scums look at this they disgrace me by doing something like this do they think i'm merely able to pleb because apparent look at that look at that i just made a high score i just made a high score okay maybe it wasn't a high score but that's not important it intermediate why would i even waste my time no because here we go baby expert i'm an expert bomb diffuser okay and i got a better helmet this time for bomb defusing although it kind of made it a little too tight and honestly like it's too late to go back so we're here and we're going to win an expert game i'm going to show you hall how it's done now i have to warn you i play aggressive i play fast i play nuanced it's hard to keep up but okay with the trash map if you don't know how minesweeper works where have you been your entire life look at this ready this one tells me there is one bomb and the eight surrounding squares well there's only one square we don't know so i'm going to flag it which means i think there's a bomb there i think there's a bomb here and then i can click this two if i'm sure of the surrounding area and sure enough oh hey look at that not a bomb oh god i gotta figure it 12 seconds later okay so anyway like i was saying i am gonna go as fast as possibly and undoubtedly that will absolutely be the downfall of me it always is i always get a little hasty and then when i think i've finally got it that just means 100 i don't and then that ends up boning me so i know it can't be there why don't bother don't worry about it okay i just know these things some things you just learn in time and you know me i'm omega brain at all times um this is why i need such a big helmet because my brain is so large clearly uh so that can't be one i am nailing this can't be here you know what i'm gonna be honest i don't know if that was actually true uh but i clicked it anyway okay two oh god okay so there no it doesn't oh my god okay it can't be here which means here oh there we go now we start popping off uh uh and then the popping off stops it stopped the popping up um okay okay okay okay oh wait that's this is you know just a tough board but i like challenges okay people buckle it strap on in all right this is getting serious oh i had this done the whole time that's embarrassing there um so this can't be okay yeah i'm gonna be honest totally guessed on that one too okay um you know the more i uncover the more questions i have so there has to guarantee there has to be one here so this can't be it okay which means that's it which means that's it which means curses foiled yet again so then that fulfill so that can't be one which means there's one here which means it can't be this has to be one of these and then that's three so okay just breathe when you're not strong i'll be your friend i'll help you defuse somebody there has to be one here dude this board sucks man hoping to get a little bit more of a banger board but you know i'm just gonna say that okay ready speed speed oh oh nothing more an esport mine's player like myself loves to see than that oof there's one here and then um something and then that should but oh right helps if you make some ninja noises uh those are only choices only choices only choices i don't know boosh boosh these are the bombs exploding metaphorically this is what they would sound like if i was wrong but i never am i'm helping you all out here you could uh give me a little bit more thanks you're welcome you almost caught me being a little too fast little too gung-ho oh just like that fudge oh that's great that's great uh-huh that's the way um they might be wondering where did i get my bomb diffusal degree uh full sail university yeah turns out they offer that too crazy right they offer everything oh but that's dicey that's a little dicey uh no you don't yeah you fooled me last time but i'm not gonna let you fool me again oh that has to be that boom boom uh i ain't playing no more i'm playing no games oh no that has to be that which means that has to be that oof well that's that's kind of unfortunate that's good uh that's good i am the very best this is the map this is the one oh i am feeling it lads no one's blowing up today you can thank me later oh yes yes yes yes yes this is my moment something blah blah don't mess this up mr fruit otherwise this video is going to take forever like i said i'm going until i get one i win an expert which obviously won't take me very long because i am an expert they made this game up specifically for me to challenge one such as myself because the other ones well quite frankly where elementary got you boom okay now i need to start playing a little slow okay this if i've messed up one of these mines we are in trouble there has to be one here which means this has to be safe lord oh god i don't know there's still a lot of bombs left geez this place is littered okay um there has to be two here so that's i'm just gonna leave that corner alone for now one here now has to go here and here because if they're both here then that would be four let me do my math again okay one of them has to go here but then i can't put another one here the one has to be here oh okay oh oh yeah oh yeah keep going i'm almost there oh what okay man if somebody isn't watching the visual of this they're like what is going on right now don't worry about it yeah which yeah yeah okay which no that doesn't that's not what that means oh okay so that means that has to be here means that okay 12 more bombs until the world is set free what i didn't tell you is if i fail the whole world blows up irl wait a second what am i doing those are the only places they can go one two three four five one two three four yes yes yes yes yes yes one two three four four bombs left which means that's good that's good which means that has to be that that has to go there and then that and then one two three one two three one two one one two two okay that has to be that oh my god yo esports win sign me up dude 589 seconds that's got to be record nothing
