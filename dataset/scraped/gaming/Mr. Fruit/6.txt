hey yo four times the charm baby yeah oh man i'm with you my brother like you're gonna get arthritis man careful heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video a new location why well um could you i'm trying but that is how i know it is important work are you done because i'm here with aydah you know she kind of burned she i i have no idea i get it too why am i mad at her i'm the one intruding this is true this is this is her place my place is on in well you know the you spot maybe i'm trying to spook her just like this auto rifle spooks me quite literally fills me with dread despite being surrounded by guardians you have to have other audience i don't know how they felt last time you asked and i still don't know okay anyway this is the scariest weapon in the game fire fright ah i guess you get it one of the brand new weapons introduced in the season and the season's a couple weeks old now so you're like wait but you're super late to the park holy no no no no you lost your bread we'll just can't focus i need a quiet spot to think here we go right in the corner all alone just as it always should be yeah look i work on my own timeline all right here's what i've kind of realized about my destiny content with all the other stuff i got going on you know like eight million other channels that's not entirely true but the point is i'm always juggling a whole bunch so i'm i'm never gonna be able to compete with you know the the committed solo destiny content creators you know like this is their thing and i've never really tried but it's just become more apparent that like why bother you know what i'm saying i'ma just keep doing me i'ma do what i do best and for me i think that that is using weapons whether they're good roles or not in the crucible for your amusement and entertainment and maybe figuring out if the gun's good or not while i probably misused the gun you guys make fun of me we shake hands we have a laugh see you tomorrow arrowhead break ricochet rounds or times of charm this is troll okay you want no no no no no no time out time out i don't know why this is it it's not scary because of the name fire fright it's terrifying because of the roles this it's perk pool it's perk pool is garbage are they gonna do my auto rifles like this all the time every time a lot of rifles just ain't okay let's let's go through hip fire grip threat detector air assault well-rounded four times the charm fragile focus i have one i don't know who thought that this trait was helpful that's that's the entire first pool by the way then we got surrounded mulligan elemental capacitor adagio osmosis focus fury frankly there's just like nothing here there's like decent roles but there's no god roll to chase like what is this popular trade comments this is all trash trash crash stretch of trash trash trash trash and if you disagree that's your opinion it's a wrong opinion i'm just kidding anyway yeah adagio and then it's origin trade of course the new season extrovert not me uh put that crucible tracker on so that we can end this video with like a count of seven crucible opponents defeated no idea what to put here you know what sounds good counterbalance for that stability or me or maybe a little aim assist targeting gesture is not going to do much i don't know the aesthetic of these weapons are sick though and not only that they sound great they sound sick you're going to hear it soon before i forget on i do learn from my mistakes it's the hallmark of a good man kind of sick at convergence after iron banner rift which i know is like two weeks ago but i'm still mentally recovering oh i like your skull helmets guys so many skull i feel like i kind of missed the boat here okay i'm ready for oh wait wait wait you want to hear you want to hear it oh that's meaty isn't it oh jesus christ hey yo four times the charm baby hey yo yeah come at me oh oh oh that's a nice snake but my name is better oh my god oh my god wait i procked four times the charm now adagio is go okay hey yo what is that this is his um card thing is that like new trials thing that's kind of sick then so anyway uh hey uh still waiting for somebody touching my spaghetto to come back you know is that a rocket that's yup that zone that's a good job that's fine shake it off baby i shake it off i shake it off shake it off i'm feeding he must be trolling they say and i agree what am i doing where are they these plebs seriously want to shoot them up the butt papa there we go fire fried is the very best i

guy and that's uh that's what he oh get hammered that's what he always has to say um i always seem to take the bit a little too far and you know what i take that as a compliment you know let's say you and me we meet you know we we kick it off we're having fun we're bantering we go the banter you know make maybe our little inside joke i will run that inside joke into the ground and then you'll be like wow that's played out let's move on but then i don't and as i keep going you're like okay well that's like it there's no way like you don't even think about him like that joke to you has already died it's six feet under you buried it you forgot about it and there i am resurrecting it it's it's screaming please let me die wait hold on let me shoot with the ah adagio what is that not really uh a wordsmith today are we having a little trouble finding my way around the words the words they escaped me and his bullets do not yeah no they found their mark right in between me eyeballs he's like what is he doing he's ranting again oh jesus make him stop rude dude okay although we've gotten some kills but if that's the hallmark for a gun i got some kills well then maybe we should reevaluate some things is this dude gonna peek ah there you are you stuck really really why why isn't this a mercy by the way i didn't look jesus no wonder everything's on fire nothing is going our way opponent power play yet let's just wrap this one up here baby boy oh my god i'm better i'm better and better oh he doesn't know that i'm restoring my health there's two of we got one we're gonna we're gonna have the biggest comeback of all time this has to be up there right like this is what what hit me oh he has a wave frame doesn't he hey yo if we all gang up on him there's a chance get it boys punch him get him everybody i had to die for that whatever could i have shot his sword yeah but if everyone just fished to them you know a little group fisting like whoa hey don't knock it till you try all right just gotta keep an open mind oh he's getting the heavy eyes and okay he only got a sword honestly that's i'm sure it has there he is i'm sure it is eager edge but that's that is not a sword he'll baited it only told me one of the first person to pick it up grabbed which was a sword probably everybody else picked it up too because why wouldn't they you know watch this nope i've been here before yep that's why i said watch this because that's a normal play that happens all the time no need to draw extra attention to it okay like i've already moved on i've already why am i pulling this out no we've already seen the firefight is would have actually maybe stood a chance had his friend not been there but you know what what in the spawn batman i don't even know what to say dude um get

choice i'm a solo slayer i'm gonna clean up this fight no i won't all right check that oh that's cornball the wisen review clearly not okay that's a spawn clear or not that wise otherwise you'd put that away and 1v1 me like a real titan we'd fist each other yep you heard me i had to itch my nose hold on i mentioned my nose don't peek thank you and that is painful but we're better y'all see right there though that's the sweet spot for auto rifles where we're still at optimal range but we're out of optimal range for hand cannons that's where you want that's home that's safe we like that oh get pooped up cleaned up cleaned up oh my annihilation i love sloppy seconds somebody spawned behind me are you sliding hand cannon the the sheer amount of just hello hello where where my dude my brother yeah nice why should rebuke get wise to that i'm with you my oh he's pissed he's pissed i'm gonna get banned look it's not my fault he won't shoot me i unfortunately rules of engagement i can't shoot somebody not shooting me okay let's just rule the rule the way he's that's just look i didn't tell him to do this he's following me i'm not following him this is not my fault okay i'm not trying to set a precedence here okay yeah why doesn't rebuke these nuts nice joke me nice joke was his 2012 killing it oh where you going where's that wise and rebuke yours now huh that's don't shoot him just cause he won't shoot back not that i'm what it was holy red back more like throwback that's what it was doing to my neck dude red back throw it back shoes my neck oh no no i didn't mean i didn't i was

the name okay that is a no no i just had to have a heavy man no oh i was trying to kill him to get the snap of course he's the one with that heavy you hate to see it best combat efficiency though yeah we kind of popped i'm popping i'm popping we're going in control do it again just forget about the first game be the goldfish pretend you're a goldfish you have short-term memory loss first game of control what game that's the spirit it can't hurt us if we can't remember it maybe there's some deep-seated trauma there you know maybe there's some underlying issues there that will probably present themselves in 10 to 15 years and i i you know i pray for that psychologist that uh or therapist that's gonna have to deal with me then but for now out of sight out of mind what am i i don't know i'm just my brother in christ he has apparently abandoned you oh my god that was that's funny okay but they brought in the big guns they said we have a whole canadian we have mr fruit oh my god they were down bad and now boom we're in the lead it's what i do i'm a cleaner i'm the finisher yeah that's that's what i do they bring me in the finish the game the game that's that's what i finished nothing else certainly not horses what wait yeah i said that during a game i don't remember what am i talking about yeah that's we traded not like is it no no it is this gun it's this gun's raw potent latent ability it's power it's over 9000 i don't know other ways to describe power scaling you know where are you and i am so sorry i cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight i'm gonna predict you now oh my god that was way too much he's like where did that go i don't know i don't know i gotta help myself didn't i oh hey yo adagio a dodge a yo oh my oh imagine imagine if we had that that would have been pretty sweet another guy left 13. why to make the win look more impressive or maybe that's why i joined the game they're d-doshing it's chilly rabbit tricks are for kids okay can i oh oh oh oh it's magic that was a mistake why can't i stop singing what is wrong with my brain show me that that is not the golden peepee it's a different kind of pp i did not ask for that pp that was non-consensual ha keaton back yes let's throw back i don't know why i remember that the golden penis ah when times were so much simpler what had that second one not hit he's dead though right did the first one not hit wait okay if that's good how did none of them hit you can't beat this strafe the best kind of strength you should try it i'll i'll put up a video here soon i a little video tutorial i know it can be a little tough it can be a little tough to figure out the uh the team shot strafe but don't worry i'll i'll break it down to six easy digestible steps maybe i'll write a book on it new york times best selling list here i go which which by the way i i recently learned this so i don't know the specifics but like like new york best-selling list apparently it's like kind of pretty easy to do and like the metric for it is just kind of like oh my god that was pretty sick is um just like really messed up i guess it just doesn't really make sense so it's not that impressive however make no mistake if i ever write a book please buy it secondly if it says i'm new york times bestseller i'm popping off dude we're getting a champagne i don't know how to make a good cork popping sound bottle i'm sweating uh and then i'm not gonna drink it because i hate alcohol especially champagne it's disgusting um but i'll take a sip of my advanced gg that i'd gotten previously with a ten percent discount using code mr fruit whoa maybe sip home mr fruit cherries limeade that's right double down the humility on this man crazy so we're pooping on this ditch dude you ever just deuter cause i do wow that was where is that one going oh here she comes where did he go okay actually yeah wow that was a slippery escape ah but you don't escape these ah wow i got the trespassing thing i got an exotic qualifier hard oh that was great i'll i'll remember that control game okay you know here's what i'm here's what i'm thinking we just like we maybe you guys will never see the first game or maybe it should be a real quick spark notes tldr kind of like boom boom boom here's what you missed here here are the amazing commentary parts because you guys know me i'm always spitting gameplay who right let me put it let me put it this way okay if you come to this channel for the gameplay bro you're in the wrong place i'm telling you i'll tell you that now it's never been about the gameplay i'd

ratio plus
