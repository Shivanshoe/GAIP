hi eddie how's everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to gartek phone if you don't know what it is imagine the game telephone you play it as a little kid perhaps maybe that maybe never heard the game that'd be weird telephone is where you like whisper something somebody else is here and then they have to i can't kind of forgot there was a telephone this is awkward you like do it and it eventually gets like it usually becomes wow i can't explain this all right kids all right a classroom please we have a guest coyote why coyotes quiet llamas do we want to make sure that person here too mr fruit i have to pee he's definitely yeah somebody uh put in his chat or i mean send him a carrier pigeon alright send him a note because we're in class quiet llamas uh yes uh dork with your hand raised uh yes uh do you know ligma okay this is daycare you're two years old how do you know that honestly dude i wouldn't i wouldn't put it past some two-year-olds today who knows that's true all right are you guys are you guys ready to actually do this if people are recording are you recording yeah i'm still in the shower are you ready are you ready you can draw you can just use your phone in the shower and for this oh okay great yeah you probably could uh all right let me explain how the game works so welcome to garlic phone the basic way this game works is very similar to the childhood game telephone where you whisper one thing to one person they whisper to the next so on so forth and it gets horribly mutilated by the end but in this game instead of doing it with whispering to each other because we're all in a call we're gonna be doing it with drawings the way it's gonna work is the first person is going to write down a prompt the next person will then draw what they see and then the next person after that will have to guess what the original prompt was based off of just the drawing then it'll move on to the next person until it gets all the way through the list and at the end we'll get to watch like a little slideshow showing just how horribly we screwed everything up it's gonna be amazing i've heard you guys are all great artists so oh some of us have like drawing tablets my my tool my art tool of choice is my mouse and i think pretty much everyone else's oh yeah i'm left-handed and i use my rice on my mouse it was unfair so i had to be like a jack box announcer by the way that was that was yeah that was good i'm actually playing with that effect yeah i'm gonna drop my fights gonna be okay for this you probably could use a fighting stick but um that we do i don't know if you guys will want to do them as well but while you're drawing we have everyone mute up that way it's sort of like a more individualized thing and at the end we'll all unmute and enjoy the slideshow together also we we try not to draw penises because youtube doesn't like oh that's hard okay at least he told me before we started i wasn't thinking about it until you told me [Laughter] oh my god this is are you guys ready to get in oh i'm doing it i mean man i think i'm just gonna get owned all right guys ready because it's time to get it wait what is i have come up with a great prompt i'm excited to see what you guys do with this i i've i've deliberated about it all about five seconds and i think i have a masterpiece so okay i like the confidence there's a timer in the top right so keep an eye on that oh jesus oh my okay mute up and enjoy your drawing time of course it's okay okay um so i need fudge i want to draw a tomato but something tells me fudge this kind of looks like a oh now it's a tomato okay and then we need like a little building oh wait is there an undo button there is okay uh i'm gonna have this be like the sign to the city you know there'll be like little buildings uh-huh these are windows as you can clearly see okay that might actually confuse people cheating way of putting windows i don't think i need to put all these but i'm committed all right then we have this guy over here with his gun gone um that that's a gun trust and then uh uh he's angry and then uh just dead people everywhere they make the zombie noises for minecraft and apparently some dead bodies are floating oh fudge they're all in a sea of blood pew pew pew pew uh and then fortnite uh so i'm gonna put a little uh that might mess people up uh you know what screw it done uh oh how did you guys throw on your first drawing i was sweating i was panicking i i'm gonna be honest i should have used controller not looking good the crazy thing is this i think somebody had the same exact prompt as i just got oh no okay i'm i'm very confused by what i'm looking at right now it makes me kind of sad that so many people stoop to this but what does i just want to say whoever did this one is a genius and i love it i don't know what's going on oh yeah i have an incomplete sentence can i buy some vowels or something like what the [ __ ] um licking the oh that looks like not what i was hoping it to look like here we go it's a tongue see and then um it's going to be licking the um god i'm like a modern artist i could hang this up in a display i think okay so then gotta show like saliva wait what this is not blue okay yeah like because it's a tongue licking the that looks like a tongue right if you if you saw that you would think it's a tongue who wouldn't i can't show a person well whatever you know what it's uses negative space whatever they have to use their imagination which i know is asking a lot of this group but if if it's not this i don't know what the fudge um we're gonna do about this stuff okay i like my second one a lot better than my first one i wanna i can't tell if like someone's trolling me what the fudge dude um [Music] i i love this one this is the only thing i can think of this is kind of beautiful so dork i got two words and i just made something up to go with the two words do what you will my son oh people didn't finish oh my god it submitted it i was deleting words again simpson [Music] so he'd be like like this uh and then his eyes would be something like this uh no a little bit more like [Music] like this and then i don't know it'd be something like i need to make it more dramatic and then he has a red shirt uh and then okay so he's puking on the eel what the fudge what color should i do for an eel okay first off i need to fix this and then uh he's like oh my god so there should be water so i'll make the eel like this [Music] he's a happy eel even though he's being spat out you know because if it's an eel it's probably some water right and then do eels have like little stripes i know this one does the kind that gets thrown up do you know why honestly i i think i did pretty good with what i was given i'm very proud of my throat i had to draw something about myself and i'm very confused about it i don't know about this one at all what um you you had like a minute and a half you guys are all such good artists what am i looking at has never looked at one of mine dude she hasn't got i think i got yours um i'm so sorry whoever i don't know i don't know i had to go i was thinking like i can't believe it's not butter but like it looked like an astronaut i don't know give me your what give me your foot juice okay i guess i should draw a juice bottle i'll just draw like a just a bottle uh give me your foot juice and here we see foot juice yum a dual ally like this uh and then uh this is the cap and then i need a hand like give me that i guess it's already grabbing it uh fudge i

nightmare ladies and gentlemen i don't either is are the names blacked out they're blurred out what's gonna happen now is we're gonna get to see a nice little photo album to see how things have gone they're gonna start at uh the prompt of the person uh and then you'll see the whole journey it goes on all the way through are you guys excited to see what we've done no yes absolutely not yes well i decided to start us out strong with something nice and easy which was mr fruit but he's made oh my god wait a second i did this so good yeah you like that oh that's pretty okay that's not bad empty oh

i know exactly what he's talking about shark how did you get that screwed up it was a watermelon i didn't get it screwed up because the watermelon said howdy instead of hiding okay so why didn't you you completely missed the entire fact that it was a watermelon you're like imposter right there when the artist is saucy what the fudge are you guys ready to do the next one we got joey's problem a man dropping all of his tacos right prom why hey that's pretty good he's way too happy about [Laughter] simpson oh my goodness my drawing was good [Laughter] you guys all sound the same that is a

yeah yeah that nipple how did john stamos turn into a mogus i feel like this is just what it's going to do you know this is going to be the night video there's that there's that wikipedia game where it's like all things lead to like hitler or whatever yeah well in this case all things lead to among us i don't know why dork decided to go with among us batman but i like him i mean you know when he drew me it was mystery is a watermelon that was just the among us with the watermelon skin yeah i'm seeing a pattern here dork did you draw everything as the mungus character yes and that's why it all leads back to among us [Applause] okay [Laughter] oh talented one so this was the first round where i didn't know there was a timer on the writing so i was sitting there like okay jesus getting ready for a hot tub stream and then press then it just it just happened so quickly yeah thank you jesus thanks i could have gone way worse so all right mr fruit what'd you pick 69.99 kool-aid man out of
