in today's dream team the dream team is back themselves and it's like we're we never left it's destiny 2 baby guardian games and you're like what they're like over yup fashionably late but they're not over that they're about to be the real one just started that's right saving the best for last destiny just like square knees is late to crypto dream team games 2022 dream summer games right my bad dream team summer games boom boom explosion a multi-part series the most ambitious okay not entirely a multiverse crossover of mr trump ed benedict cumberbatch as blue westlow wait who am i and rob as himself wow who's playing you yeah who is i forgot oh wait oh who's playing i want to be played by you no i don't want to be you know who i see you as blue you always hit me with it with your personality after watching multiverse you're wrong i think you're wrong oh i'm down for that i could see it i'm a mild inconvenience i'll take the cop-out answer and say michael sarah wow i forgot i forgot he's in the avengers video guys uh let's go over how the points is yeah guardian games in the first episode first part of destiny the crucible we're going to go away and we're going into final fantasy yep get it out get get the final fan shot why are you sorry any any more parse okay there you go gun breaker gunbreaker yep okay um it's going to be this this part of the summer games are going to be very similar to iron banner bats we're going to open up the party and the first of each class to join the party then becomes our partner so i'm going to get a titan who's going to get a warlock rob's going to get a hunter we're gonna go into crucible and play probably two games because it should be doable in two games and what i mean by doable is we need to go in there we need to not only try and stay on top of the leaderboard but also complete the gold medallion contender quest at the same time so for instance for me i need to make sure i'm getting solar and stasis blows and enough in two matches to get the gold medallion at the end of the two matches we're going to take the points because in typical fashion wherever you land on the leaderboard that's how many points your team gets so if i get first and my buddy gets last for that round we get seven points at the end of the two rounds whoever's the least amount of points wins however after two rounds if one of us has not gotten the gold medallion from the quest automatically disqualified do not d and then once we get there winners then get assigned points depending on how they finished in the crucible for the overall games next gonna be strikes and we're saving the best for last baby part two you guessed it gambit we're going to live punch ourselves in our ball oh well yeah exactly same thing so look forward to that at the end of it who wins there's also possibly going to be some rng rounds with weapon rolls brought to you by daryl song however we did not talk to him nor did we get the budget so i can't make any promises there in fact you probably just won't know about it this is how he makes his living so we're going to get him regardless because he's already looking for content he doesn't have a choice so with that we're opening up the part there is a warlock you would get and that's uh another word like oh oops uh chewbacca is hey okay we got we gotta close it close good all right so there we have our team this is fitting blue gets the chad the warlock rocking the pink strang i love that this guy has a game cube and has a kylo ren mask and has a camel toe on his foot oh my god that's not those are like sandals anyway you got drew baca the hunter that's a cool emblem how do i get that wait he has a vid master thing that means he's like been featured no no no it's that's the sweet summer child oh okay i toom a bit master whoa crazy wait you look cool oh no oh no is it reckoner don't do it no i do like your fit though i like mr fruits way better though oh thanks rob okay but like yours is cool but i didn't yes yeah uh lastly shadows my teammate rocking the hawk moon haha dead meme let's go shadows and with that we're hopping in yeah okay i can give you guys a spoiler warning fruit's going to win this one no teammate yeah he's going to really think about it if you get a good drop here blue you could win points that's true that's true i mean yeah but like and if we know anything a teammate who has never touched another person and i don't have that on my you you have always got rng unlocked okay controlled i believe in you really nice good balls yes so this is like an actual like playlist game the guardian games or something no this is this is crucible oh no this is just controlled the garden games playlist is a pve place which we couldn't play because you haven't done the questions oh wow this is going to go so bad this is not apex dude i'm flying right now okay but first blood is going to go to me i'm going to give first blood that's what i meant rob's no stranger to captain hey that's cool but okay that's cheating you're not allowed to double dude okay now we all fight for this poor soul that decided to push us he's invisible and i am feeding you're tactically throwing dude toxic massive difference oh he's killed nice shadow's sick who has shadows go chewbacca contrary to popular belief tactically surrendering forfeiting and dying is a skill oh my god get pooped on what can i say what can i accept i oh i got the kill i haven't gotten a kill i gotta quit you know hunters we can all find solace that we may have not won the guardian game me to the moon i want to win but i don't think i will um wait for the ultimate capper no no no no no okay it's no longer a power play shack's relaxed it's a good thing you showed up because just like me when i tried to cancel my planet fitness membership you have to go in for whatever reason can't just let you normally kick i'm using my garage suddenly suddenly they're all like uh guys i forgot how to shoot my gun how come every hunter i'm shooting at they go invisible is that just something this team does or is that like a normal like kind of secret rob the devs have no other design direction for hunters so that's all they do that's that oh my god i just go invisible yeah what am i good for going invis oh my god speaking of which there's an invisible hunt but it doesn't do anything like they just look stupid well it's kind of in the name you go you go invisible this is kind of awkward okay where okay this is how did he already rep thanks i guess got you dude you are shadow's so ahead he's a gamer so much i'm just going to b to a to c to b to a do not turn that corner yeah what the fudge i gotta kill i got my first kill let's go boys attaboy blue no longer double 07. i think elon musk might need to purge me because i'm feeling like a bot right now i'm why are three people holding the same angle four four what mr fruit sounds like when his drive goes a little bit left it'll be funny if i play golf but you he's frozen someone get him why did he let me dude i can't did where's my r301 dude mozambique where's my mozambique stop shoving me you thank you jesus oh i'm so bitter oh i guess that like counts as damage let's go chewbacca i don't know who you are but you got to kill she's my homie uh i'm dead oh you're so big bro dude why are they spotting you yeah okay what's your guys's progress out on that quest not far i was gonna say mine's at six percent well i am currently at eight percent get pooped on okay see okay we might need three games or we might need to take the rule away oh my god i got a kill oh my god oh oh yeah ah and i need help kelly go get him go get him oh my god you just got super off the butt my dude why don't you trade me out why do you wait for me to die first and then throw a hammer at him nice super stupid go through yeah just avoid the question okay to be fair there was no ah i sometimes i'm decent people said scouts aren't meta ah dude why do i i don't just spawn into one dude though it's it's uh the whole army yeah but it's not me i'm not ah oh my god i got a laurel oh there we go rob you have to come with abilities which is why might be a little slow and then you also have to pick him up because if he did you have to and then they disappear with that i can't hit a shot for life please die please die please die please die everything's not awesome that guy's level 382 he needs to find 382 bit i'm sure i mean i'm not that far off but agreed a couple more of those thirst traps on twitter big guy you'll be there i'm almost there i can feel it i'm just i was looking to see if anybody on our team was hired in 382. dude i'm glad that we have been homie so long that we're now in mr fruit's slot era the ultimate i've been waiting for this one yeah this one's been a long time coming dude i mean everybody does have a [ __ ] oh a hundred percent we've been waiting for what it was screw you i'm skill intensive that didn't kill him what rebaca is still holding it down for you though i know but i was holding it down p.o.p nah i can't wait to go fight for the lightning all of our stunt doubles by the way are doing bad news yeah well guess what are we the stop doubles okay well four thirds i somehow like jumped omega up i went wait what i was just third now i'm sixth what happened wait you're below me that's embarrassing wait what just happened what i rarely looked at it right before game finish i'm like oh cool i'm third six how i don't know hey man hey dude you guys that you've got to play the board right wait it's ordered by kd what i can't control i can't control how it's how it's ordered my man so it's not based on the amount of kills you get what hey dude you know what they say hey are you kidding me you suck so it's kd it's based off of i have third most kills second most captures and i'm last well stop dying bro okay but shadows got first so you're good literally people people are saying that the scoreboard is random for match to match so this game they decided combat efficiency no way that's sick has this always been a thing bungee i love this change good good hot fix update all right so we thought the rng round was the rolls apparently it's a scoreboard all right with that that changes my play style totally yeah i'm getting a kill and hiding like what no that's only one mr fruit okay two you don't have one literally two and i would have been like second this is stupid what's the point like total score or something i think they have that stat in control well we've always just done like ordering of the scoreboard and now they're just like screw you this year's stream team summer games 2022 brought to you by advanced gg and the brand new

got tea bags through the wall this guy knows exactly most people have to get surgery to shoot blanks but me i i if i t bag and d2 i might not be able to play d2 anymore oh true expandable offense frankly back to the twitter dms oh copy that down i'll let you know after this is a huge [ __ ] [ __ ] he was like yeah stupid ass wall i have my head to start capping maybe it'll do i mean what he keeps saying that i don't understand okay i'm capping nice nade didn't do anything sweet he's rushing me with a shotgun don't kill me i don't even care about anything now it's literally just don't die please don't die katie okay here we go here we go here we go what about like points given to the team that's that's a beta i'm this is [Music] oh and it took my son i can't even cheat i mean i guess i'd rather have blue no i'd rather have mr fruit because mr fruit is lower i am very low i'm down bad right now on his group i think he'll be fine i'm down but well even with my heart carry if i keep getting six it can only help so much and if everyone keeps taking my freaking kills swimming freaking mom oh we're plopping off now wait a second here cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese yes wait a second your last word i hear your last word all of a sudden we have sex drive what stop picking my kills what is wrong with you all you're heathens so tasty sorry bro okay what is this is so cringe this is my map but now it's going to be kills it's not going to go off kda i s if it is i give up like i says it's random so i believe or it might go on that was sad what is this what is this right up fudge i can't do anything right that's not true mr fruit it is true it's so true i think if i plugged in my controller i'd be doing better right now and i'm not good with my controller anymore oh my god wait a second here folks oh you just stole that oh i just you know how many kill you know i'm not gonna say i'm not gonna say anything nothing good to say you know whatever i haven't sold any of your kills yeah okay okay guy i can't even get to the kills the only thing you've stolen is my heart hey yo when do i get to eat when you have to find yourself we are hunter gatherers mr fruit and right now you're just gathering look now i'm going to hunt it's going to be 1v6 a lot of people over here if you want to know nice name rob okay go shadows all right go shadows shadows go go shadows go shadows go why didn't you hit him [Music] why aren't you dead what that's incredible okay okay okay wait a second wait a second we can't we're we're feeling it now mr i don't know how i'm third i feel like i should be higher but that's what i'm saying i feel like it's okay right i feel like it just reorders at the end by whatever random thing it decides to use okay like gambo like let's see what happened if i'm not if i'm not second boys i better be like second oh no but look at my efficiency and now it's score you might have gotten more you might have gotten the same it makes sense but i got higher score so sorry big guy i'm time for the best efficiency mr fruit like mr fruit was like actually playing the game of his life dude and he's actually random it's actually random are you hey yo we had a great we had a great game i'm out here on like a 15 kill spree i'm like i'd better be taught what is it fourth holy [ __ ] fourth do any of us have our metal thing done uh uh i'm almost done let me see okay oh i was at 68. three games it is um but i can't wait for this game to be like zones captured and with that said i'm gonna capture every zone and it's not gonna be zones captured this is the stupidest thing you see the worst part is fruit literally has a guaranteed number one every time and he's just like he can't make it worse we've done iron banner bets for years i've this is never i swear this has never happened i swear this never happens i'm sorry babe no i swear the scoreboard's never done this it's okay mr fruit like even if i win right now it doesn't i'm just this is throwing me for a loot man you take a little dumpy in your mouth right now i am i just i just pooped my pants again it's all right that's okay okay that's the entire enemy team okay and and okay great that's a quick death can't wait for this to be rated by combat efficiency i swear if this one's combat efficiency so far we're owning so far dude and they just spawn keep this up rob get in there wound them die yourself ah no it's like what do i focus on do i focus on that dying do i focus on capping do i focus oh shadow's just choking okay one game stole that one nice why are you stealing all my kills you did you told them i'm second okay but i don't have the best combat efficiency so what is it this time i'll spin the wheel oh it's screw me oh that one's my favorite top ten mr fruit having an emotional breakdown live on stream we're getting close to the the your name man yours [Music] see i'm top of the leaderboard why is it going to shuffle at the end again i don't know hey yo shadows let's squat up my dude this is the hunter redemption shadows i need your help shadows i need your love i need your touch oh my god we're at the top dude has not touched anyone my man i don't know you signed up for a dude who has not touched someone weakness hey and you know what he's not gonna have an expose though okay it's okay you're at the bottom but i know you're just saying back for zones captured you know it's coming your dad works at bungie you know he's like yeah sort of yup stupid i just got owned okay that's he's weak okay yep there you go take that kill we're in unparalleled territory iron banner batch never goes through a game and the scoreboard is never random this is truly something starting for but are not usually done but we're wrapping it like it's we're re-wrapping it it's a new gift we're not dude show yourselves you did they oh they're all hiding they're all hiding bird in my name just like you need to burn it where are they i was like damn that was kind of badass yeah don't land shadows do not like it yeah stay left shuffle it around say let's shuffle it around no no no no it's gotta be a shuffle take it back now y'all please don't one hop this time did i get that kill okay nice nice nice and it's about to get a lot nicer pissed on i don't know what's up with me at pee right now yeah you keep saying golden shower yeah i don't know oh do you like piss all six of us were here and all five of you ran away from the cat point all five of you welcome rob welcome we've been expecting you die die die ah oh golly god okay okay well almost there did shaq just say kiss them oh god i hope he doesn't okay it sounded like he was like kiss them bro i got my gold medallion i did it who did it i swear i'm not if it shuffled that just oh don't think paul jones oh of course there's no there's no what is it what is it going by i would have been third is it efficiency this was combat oh my freaking big like i told you even if i win it doesn't feel good let's let's do some math quick in my house titans three points myself hunters one point rob warlock zero points blue however you know what time it is rng roll appraisal time oh wait we do one of these at the end of everything yeah bonus round bonus bonus bonus oh bonus bonus now it's datto time for the final round of this we're we're all gonna look at whatever loot we got in these three crucible matches you need to tell us which one has the best roll and that person wins rng roll appraisal around so we have to check our postmasters because we filled all of our weapons so let's see did i did i even get a gun i did i got two guns okay oh all right all right what we got uh a survivor's epitaph uh so osmosis rapid hit extended mag this thing is sick huh okay so are am i just judging the role on this gun yeah well so i'm saying like i was gonna say survivors epitaph imo is literally just an l but if it's just the role then okay all right what else you got okay um we got a queen breaker pretty sick right that's an exotic bonus points why did you get that uh and then we have another one of these okay okay killing adrenaline junkie okay and then what's that last gun a funnel web with a stinger frenzy killing wind a mag and a small bore and that and then a red thing okay that funnel web is actually pretty good i i'd probably say that's his best okay okay so then we'll compare that again and was also okay i put them pretty close together okay okay let me be honest i think i've already taken an l here uh blew what you got hey guys uh so this is this crisis inverted which honestly is amazing you know it's focus fury compulsive reloader so not amazing yeah those are kind of counter-intuitive perks however there is a really good pvp crisis inverted right here okay rapid hit rabbit hit snapshot the final web is like a friend dependent mag okay okay and then i got this one uh yeah i don't think you have to worry about that one okay well yeah so this is my this is my biss right now all right for me i'm gonna be ash i did not many options uh crisis inverted to crisis and burden the first one i haven't looked at the roles we got vorpal shoot to loot what a fun niche pve role he doesn't like those i said that and he was like very fun very okay second one opening shot demolitionist ooh pvp anybody extended mag appended mag polygon arrival and corks rifling is that a range masterwork sheesh not that i'm trying to influence you i do like that one a bit better not that i'm trying to influence these these are a little tough uh so it's wrong so i'm gonna i'm gonna use a special criteria called uh looking up the guns on a website and uh and i'm gonna i'm gonna see a couple of factors here that's what datto says when he just searches his mind guys just away it's not an actual website he's just shifting through the yeah that's what i call my brain copious amounts of information yeah yeah all the synapses so none of these come out to me just like screaming out the gate like okay this is the best one this is like the best gun um and again this is just an overall just like if you had to use one gun for the rest of the franchise kind of roll what am i picking i can't believe you're going to shoot the loot verbal that's crazy not going with the shoot to loot verbal okay okay i'm not going with that one oh man it is it is really so close it is really really really so close between i would say come watch out for us but between it's between the funnel web and probably blues crisis yes so there's that's good that's good for the point all right already eliminated believe it or not rob you have the second most popular trait combo on your weapon on for blue's weapon he also has the second most popular trait no way according to light.gg oh and the hey we all know that that's the well that's why we have the data factor which is why that being said me personally i would prefer rangefinder over snapshot i think i'm going to go rob on this one yeah hold on hold on if it's that close hold on hold on if it's that close then it is within reason to take into account the masterworks the mags and the rifling i think that it is i didn't make the rules of the event i will leave that up i mean i made the rules i mean handling a deep sight renaissance or um resonance and and you know what and it has counterbalance stockholm deep sight renaissances how about that just kidding i put backup mag on it because no matter well you know what fine then [ __ ] you daddo the the pawn stars expert came in and just liked my item a little bit more blue if rob is like a nine blue is like an 8.99 it's okay you know what if that was that torn blue you get half a point yeah you have a point there you go all right if you need me let me know yeah i'll let you know let's go and i still got a fat okay but you still got the w though so true i got that so it's not damaged it's wherever we finish on the thing yeah because you get points for like killing sprees killing x amount of people getting assists you'll see them all pop up it'll make more sense oh but also it's oh wait i also didn't check but yeah your quest probably wants you to use specific types of attacks and i didn't think about that uh oh my god oh my um oh my god i'm owning look at all these medals i'm getting died what the oh what did you do mr proof i was so focused on getting rob worlds i forgot to buy my card ah not my finest moment nah my finest moment hey will you uh come here often oh i missed the thing no but i come on here often hey oh jesus i'm gonna i'm gonna i already got a fire team spree even though i think we all get that oh my god i'm cracked the amount of worlds i've gotten is illegal that's another fire team spree again i think we all get that let's go i do not want to lose i'm just like killing everything i've never tried so hard in my life you like just kill everything this is mine oh nice okay thanks for the free res points oh wait wait wait wait wait no you sassy packer stop it there's one you guys just find yourselves over there it's pretty sick what are you doing over there wrong that's not fair that's a power spree okay shoes throw some of this throw some of that freaking i didn't get that kill okay but for the record i am the only one doing the obj so that should be some bonus points i don't know i'm just saying oh no oh my god how did that stop it no no oh no i got it yes wait how many points did you get 1800 oh i assisted [ __ ] oh give me the power good good i've never been so zoned into pve before and i'm doing all this and we're gonna end the screen and it's like blue westlow with eight million well we tried no colors oh give me that no no i need something i'm destroying right now titans weren't meant to pve i don't know what we were meant to do i was i thought like it would be like a rift dude okay they're not i don't even get time to shoot them stop this is my oh my god it was already dead then why would it let me stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop no that doesn't make oh my god it's he went stasis that's literally cheating that's cheat you're cheating you're cheating he's cheating no well void burn everybody's oh my god look at the war it's it's not it's rob we're fighting for second right now what do you mean a hundred not even remotely close you don't think so blue's over here not talking using stasis dude it's not gonna be a competition what are you talking about yeah this it's it's a wrap no maybe i'll win this rng round kopium we did chase the bro or close the bronze threshold though that's huge way to go guys what you guys are scoring and their moms all right well yeah it's shared we won't know differences until the end and i won't want to know okay true i won't want to know let me tell you that i mean i've been counting and those are all warlock which means he got all the last hits this is competitive strikes was a mistake god god has abandoned us that's not my no you got that one listen man you're talking to the guy who literally logs in does a strike logs back out to play final fantasy okay i was built for pve no if you guys beat me i'm going to be proud but also disappointed in myself but then again but mainly i'm always disappointed in myself oh no come on bring it in here stop really really sorry that was like you didn't even try to hide the fact you were sniping that but like it's a doggy dog world mr fruit yeah well what the dog eat did you guys know the term okay so some people think it's doggy dog world who thought that someone like tweeted it out like oh my god i had a revelation and it had like a bunch of retweets it was like one of those what yeah it was like just found out today that it's dog eat dog world and not dog eat it was a doggy dog like a dog like doggy like a small doggy no i get it but yeah god wait where's the things to kill because we're all good we're already at the

weapons good weapons good weapons oh okay the reason it's silver is because it's not the other one that gives us more score yeah we just got to let it end please i was fighting i was fighting for my life computing in my mind there dude i was literally like seeing like like algorithms like i thought i was solo podcasting that's how i knew oh god yes let's go i'm trying so hard and i lose out by 6k still how did i get i got three less kills in blue 40 more than you i need 12k more you ain't getting your vanguard brother robbing your vanguard yeah i feel like i feel like you didn't believe me
