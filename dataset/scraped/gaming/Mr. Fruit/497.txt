heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to among us why can't we be friends why do i download i still don't know what to download what are these codes are they the nuclear codes god hopes they're not in trust okay okay okay i know who it is no idea what's up hey what were you doing is this another joke i'm just curious blue how sure okay never mind i i'm not doing this say i'm voting for you um no i just remember there's a metagaming comment i feel like it's been five seconds and there's nothing to work on wait for what did he say i'm just saying i got meta gamed i'm you want you want me to met a game no i would never wish it upon my worst enemy but i'm not going to stop you but when i push the button i get voted off first rule of fight club is whoever clicks the emergency meeting first gets kicked off remember right now don't worry guys fruit is nice or not fruit dork is nice so what was ohm going to metagame about i wonder because i know there are some visual glitches or something where like i don't i don't know exactly how it all works though but like you're in a posh or something you start something then like it'll look like you're but i don't know i honestly thought it was afk but i was gonna i was gonna sauce on him that's what i was like wait a second okay watch blue if you know he's going to play off this no i was afk at the beginning but then i you know i'm going to pull the wound in reverse like no you weren't also why would rob unless he's looking for bodies why would rob go down and then up around here at the beginning of a round wow okay before anyone says anything before anyone says anything blue walked me through what just happened i'm i'm not saying just just give me what happened wait a minute wait you found the body because it's rob i'm pretty sure yes okay okay here's what happens here's what happened okay no no no no fruit is right okay so what happened was i do my task and then rob dashes right past me past o2 so i go down i cross paths with fruit as i'm coming from the north fruit immediately goes in that room and reports so that means rob had to have came from that room and here's the reason okay i was i was down i went through shields going through comms in the storage and as i'm going though i see rob run down through storage to the right and i was like that's a weird way to pass immediately if you have a task on the right so it's like i'm just gonna run behind see if i find bodies sure enough i run into blitz the intersection and he wasn't coming out of navigation i see the body of navigation i reported figured blue i thought you had seen it you're there i'm literally running you're lying no you're lying you just came from now you're lying you passed me i passed him as well i just passed rob and like not even a second later i'm literally running across paths it's you so bryce are you you're backing up the story right now you're lying it's rob this is pretty dead this is a self report i need i need ten seconds i need an omega self report omega listen uh i have to say the start of the round i went directly to navigation and somehow bryce was there i'm telling if there's if anyone thinks later on do not let him get away with a cell phone you're done rob you're done wrong let them get away with this no i think the story is learning i just want to let you know i do i do a lot of cardio that's how i made it how did you know there you do a lot of crap see there we go the detective's back i knew it i was like that is such a weird way to pad you're either one going omega detective like i do sometimes and being like i'm gonna catch someone getting a kill but the thing is if you're trying to get a kill if you're trying to do a task from the beginning you're always gonna go through right 99 times out of 100 that immediately sussed me so i was like all right he's either looking for bodies but like and then yeah and then i saw blue and thankfully i saw blue at the perfect time which was right at the moment i saw that room and knew he could not have come out of there thankfully because otherwise okay was it rob and rick dork's dead oh that was when rob killed dork i'm dead so oh the perpendicular why do i say perpendicular to parallel and of course rob sees the body so he calls the reactor thing all the way to the left so no one's going to find my body for a while so they can't place anyone here it's a good call yo what's up okay i'm not yo i saw versus vent i saw freaking versus vent i tried to race through the thing and then he hit the hit the emergency report right now vote rick because i saw him come out a [ __ ] vent and then oh how okay oh so i see you vent and then now it's okay all right hey i wasn't expecting this i was so surprised right now and a lot of you guys saw me chilling in the [ __ ] cafeteria the entire last round like this last meeting so i'm not for it right now vote rick vote him he came out of a [ __ ] van and he ran i guess bottom right saw vent i ran to go like emergency report then he did the thing he did the reactor right you guys solved it no yeah but versus called it how did you how did you not be verses because i was running i i i really hard rick and that's dope you can't emergency when there's an alarm going off right yeah that's true so as soon as i was about to get there that's crazy that's crazy oh or you called the reactor so he couldn't immediately embrace it and he dips back and does it himself like he saw me he i had him dead to rights because you were gonna kill him right no i'm assuming he killed him oh my god i should have killed me but he didn't so now he's getting voted the problem is if we get this wrong they can double kill him you're probably going to be wrong no i think you got one right right you're wrong blue there's literally i didn't see the entire game it's caccus why you can't sweet talk me with your syrup with canadian voice it's not gonna you know what just because you got dork as a as an imposter teammate last round we're gonna throw you a bone i just got caught i guess oh i know i was like smooth as [ __ ] i'm out for a second i actually thought rick might have been innocent when he called me a [ __ ] papaya i was like oh [ __ ] don't get me wrong yeah you should leave with that next time rick i'm really debating on doing another max round and saying i had to feed him real quick i was just really thinking about it but then among us but we get but that's why i was like i'm not i'm not like immediately i just want you to walk me through and blue's like oh oh it was like you saw rob didn't you he's like yeah he's like yeah i did do i get a treat i guess do not let him get away with a self-reported gun rob you're done let them get away with the self-reporting well sometimes uh you get how did they get me dude i didn't even like see anybody i guess i should have just hopped an event and shut the [ __ ] up like i said you were mad taxes and rick's the imposter let's go mr fruit we got this we're playing an opposite break oh should i call on that everybody does that though everybody's always okay i'm imposter like i don't try you're really gonna ruin my passion you do that you started that okay i goofed up sharks okay listen okay okay i made a mistake but so help me god oh if it is youtube don't ruin this for him come on just pretend you didn't hear it please do it i need to win dude it's been a while do it for the content don't worry guys i know i [Laughter] what did i say hey first rule fight club first person click emergency meeting no deaths you're out that's i should jump true that's what we said last time now we're gonna start actually adhering to it i got some posh stickers yo so my day is going pretty well room's already here a fake strip [Music] unless they're both knee evil doers or nerdwells or what what actually is the word nerdwells nerd i'm feeling pretty wait a second it's got to be cactus he didn't download that long enough gabby it's copy caccus again dude i'm telling you i'm telling you i'm telling you i'm boy i filled in my niblets i feel it in me niblets [Music] hello there's nothing even left i'm telling you what so help me god is ricky ricky ricky oh yo yo ab explain yourself where was it i'm just running around there was no body when i went through there i wasn't able to kill there are too many people in edmond if you ran by electric door you would have gotten a report not if it happened after i passed by it there was no one there and i looked no one went to a vet okay this i'm doing this is my fourth lap around the entire map i'm literally not doing any tasks nor am i helping someone so then did you say are you he wrote me up well hold on a second that's not good it's a loser either way you either vote me off and i don't do tasks or you leave me on and i don't do tasks why don't you do test versus because i'm the imposter with mr fruit is all obvious right rick do you want to say anything what me who what wait what tell me do you want something do you want to talk about the thing that you just happened oh about the vents i don't think he wants to if he's you're really definitely trying to push him and he's not going there i mean if you don't want to talk about it we don't have to talk about it but like wait okay honestly i can feel the death in the abs voice so it's totally believable and here's the thing i have been suss on caccus since the beginning of the round when he faked a download i didn't fake it down yeah he may not want to talk about it but i want you to okay that's i just you know i don't want to you know offend someone in 2020 okay so so i walked into um cams and there was someone just you know coming right from the bottom of cams just right out of nice little vent all right that sells it cactus any last words yeah [ __ ] this game dude [Laughter] how's it feel getting voted out by imposter i'm not dude i'm not venting anymore this is [ __ ] what do you do to literally get impossible it gives it to the people who don't make content out of these games that's what it does honestly i freaking called it i knew it was like i was like if he ran from o2 went there and i mean it's his fault like you just get a better tell on some of the tasks like download is one of the most obvious ones some of the other ones can't really tell but that one i know fosho i'm so glad shady popped up because i was like how how would you not but maybe like magically did right then or something okay simon says takes forever sorry okay do i have any more tasks i have a couple let me see rice going cafeteria dork going admin blood navigation shady going into the cafeteria bryce went to nav was that even possible shadys wait my my head hurts york went into med bay jd went white price went out a nav that checks out shane blue and abs doing laps om is back and shady's [Music] dancing they're just having a little mingle sesh they're talking having a good convo blue just pops up out of nowhere abs still doing his laps hey wait where you guys going wait no oh no up she's like where'd everybody go all right now it's a party hey i want to get in on this i like watching now okay bryce and shady went in there it left blue one up bryce is still in the reactor dork is a nav blue isn't bryce is gonna kill me maybe abs still

haven't i seen in a while dork and jd and uh i don't know i give up bloody hell you monsters um uh wait a minute did we not see bryce and cams in your security we i saw bryce go down and somebody go after him but i think wasn't it wait blue didn't you go down he did yeah but i went to go do lights i went there before wait hold on what was the timeline did he go before or after me and dork where's the body well we're reacting lower left engine yes all right dork did you do this kill are we sure dork can just do it york was this a self report very nice that's that is not a yes or a no to be fair okay if okay if you didn't then drop me a yes if you didn't drop me a very nice yes okay wait wait wait i i'm dork did blue kill the person that you found he's gonna say yes oh let's go all right here's what i'm thinking cackus got out we know dork he's like i'm not doing this there's too many of you i gotta agree i feel like dork is just making the smart decision here and if the game's not over walk up the blue's looking back that's what i'm saying i'm gonna drop kick you if you don't look you're mad sus though no but i'm saying well whatever your mom uh i'm gonna i'm gonna oh i'm falling off of that i'm blowing innocent and i think mr fruit is as well those are my uh those are my calls so associated who do you think it is i honestly i'm leaning towards door cause i was feeling gas and he like dork almost killed me he was really close i was sweating and then uh he ran to the left and then he there was a body why did you kill this man wait a minute that's a new soundboard i haven't heard that one shark [Laughter] [Music] can you make it so that if you're paired with dork it adds a third imposter she actually that would be nice i mean oh i'm trying to third imposter with the okay mr fruit let's do this he saw me just come from the south that's all he needed well i mean like no one ever goes there there's nothing down there's not a light show there's no authentic bro honestly i just want dork to be the imposter every time it's comedy gold it is literally comedy gold 100 [Music] yes [Music] you
