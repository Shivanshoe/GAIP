three two one go go oh i'm dead we just have to wait 13 fireballs again later so watch out for the interceptor because it will one shot you hi eddie hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and it's here it's been a long time coming and i should have done this before but it's my first grand master nightfall so i brought with me my friend kevin and my friend datto i'm ready uh for those unaware too this is kevin hi chad i'm gonna need a little help i think it's time i actually like specifically make an armor set for pve instead of just one armor i just use everywhere dim's new loadouts work with mods so you're in luck you can make a really good set right i need one that's good for pb but also should be good for a raid you know it's time you can you can tap your friend datto to teach you his ways and then if he's busy i can give you about 10th the services that he can but i can but you charge double right of course premium services right you get what you pay for around here okay or both what's up daddo how you doing christian needs help with this loadout oh yes i do have i have that you do okay do you have arbalist not necessarily christian do you have the arborist got that equipped bruh come on then you're ready that's all you need okay uh but actually the thing mr fruit okay well i need i need i need you to help me pick from my armor a new set to match to work for pbe okay i've never i've never bothered to make i just like this set i just use this everywhere all the time no yeah okay are we doing that right now or are we doing the do we doing the gm right now by the way i've heard it's like the worst it's it's one of the worst but you are 1341 right now i can infuse so this is just sort of like a general use sort of yeah okay hmm let me see here so what we're going to need is like do you want to save this loadout in like destiny item manager or something or like are you just looking for something for right now because what's what's really going to be the ideal is if you open up destiny item manager and um what we're gonna do is the the stuff that you currently have equipped um your your armor pieces we're gonna turn that into a loadout and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a set of items that don't include any of the items that you have equipped right now unless we just wanna say f it and just make a whole brand new set because i'm i'm looking at your stat distribution right now and it's nothing remarkable so i do feel like we could start from scratch and then you could just re-redo all of your fashion for this new set with what you have right now yash all right so what we're gonna do first is we're going over to uh loadouts yep and then we're gonna hit on the left side of the screen loadout optimizer like that and i know what you're thinking did they name that after me the answer is yes so we have a good amount of options here generally speaking a good idea to have pretty high recovery so let's set your recovery minimum to a tier six so no matter what we look at we're gonna have at least six recovery this is fancy i didn't know it's existed it's pretty fancy uh next what you're gonna do is you're gonna click on select armor upgrades okay and what you're gonna do is click on ascendant shard um this basically says the optimizer is going to assume that any item that you have is masterworked so this way we're just already automatically looking at what your stats will look like when it's fully masterworked good idea so that way we don't have to do any extra guessing okay i was gonna go one by one through my ball this was already great yeah um let's actually click you up and go to seven recovery um and so what we're gonna do usually in a gm experience on titan i am on ursa furiosa because banner shield is pretty good um but if you're not on banner shield if you want to go ward instead you pretty much have pick of the litter in terms of what exotic you want to use i don't think uh your exotic matters that much when you're using ward um so for now let's make our exotic um actually you know what what i think we're gonna do just to play it super safe is no exotic i like that and then make one with an exotic as well in case you ever want to swap things of course you can make a bajillion sets with all the different exotics that's a huge pain in the ass we're not gonna do that nobody wants um so now we're gonna hit select exotic okay and i want you to find ursa furiosa got it so now it's gonna give us a build uh but we have to have ursa furiosa equipped in the arm slot no matter what it appears i don't have a great versa um well you know we can you can always go get a new one what do you have right now what does it look like you know they're not the best but they could certainly be worse i'll take it okay so now what we're going to do is we're gonna increase our resilience to i wanna say at least tier five because there are some situations where having tier five resilience in uh a gm experience can be a lifesaver in this for example a lot of what you need for gm would be good for a raid right uh yes yeah um okay so we we do want to try to avoid any um 0.5 stat increases because you know that's only giving us uh you know like we're if at 5.5 resilience like that that essentially means you're a a minor stat mod away from the next tier um but we're going to be using a decent amount of our of our energy on recovery to get us to 10. now we we could click up your recovery and see like what what are your sets look like at tier 8 tier 9 tier 10 so what so why don't we do that why don't you click on recovery let's just see what tier 10 looks like or actually no it says your max is 7.5 so let's go back to seven i mean it's not a big deal that you don't have uh you know seven usually in pure stats is where most people land it's where it's where i am right now um so seven is good so in a gm situation i like to go higher discipline lower strength because you're not really gonna be punching a lot of things in a gm if you're punching something in a gm you are either doing something very wrong or you're about to die or you're punching something that's that's like literally one health right um mobility we also don't need a ton of we're gonna keep that around probably three i have mine at three you could go up to four anything higher than four i don't think you need so why don't we okay so your discipline and your heist can be 5.5 so we're basically at the cap in terms of discipline where you can be um so honestly like any of these top ones that you have here these tier 30s they're all looking pretty good um very well balanced a little low on intellect a little bit lower than on discipline there i'd like to see a little bit higher strength but otherwise this is a pretty good starting spot for uh for some sort of gm situation so if you want to take the you probably take the top one because we're going to want the the 0.5 resilience more than the 0.5 mobility so what we're going to do is we're going to hit save loadout and and then just name it like gm nightfall raid pv hard mode whatever you wanna name it and then just save it and then we can go back to the inventory menu and you can uh hit equip and it will change all the items to what we just did is that a doggy showing what really matters right now that's right no one wants to see me let's be real truth so now we're here now you have this so the next thing we're going to need to do is at least get every armor piece to five energy that's usually uh what i tell people to start with because it doesn't cost anything more than uh legendary shards so that it's just super super easy and then the next thing we're gonna do is just kind of figure out mods now fortunately the the run that the build that i run with just demands uh protective light which is a void mod everything else you're pretty much free to do whatever except chess pieces you're definitely gonna want one of each element because you're gonna want probably the elemental resistance at some point so like you're gonna want one void chest one arc chest one solar chest and that's just so you know if there's a lot of arc damage we can go to arc mods um i must warn you yeah um i have just about every mod apparently except for protective light that's okay um because eventually you'll get it and uh you'll you'll want that one void armor piece and make sure it's not your class item either because your class item historically will be using an artifact mod from the season and usually those tend to be pretty expensive that or you need to essentially give up your stat increase which isn't a huge deal um but it's just something to keep in mind just to increase for what um like what's another one you typically use on your mark uh it just depends season over season uh you would use maybe special finisher if you don't have anything else you'd probably just cram one of the class ability mods in there or like a distribution or something um but usually the class item you want to keep available for a seasonal mod because if you start marting it up with other stuff and then a seasonal mod comes in it's going to throw off everything in your build um so you can just uh what do you have here solar okay you have void on your chest that's fine um your chest piece typically is going to have the most amount of energy so that's where you're gonna want to put more expensive mods into it in terms of the combat style mod um but for now uh you know you can probably just leave it as is put in some sort of a stat mod um actually probably go up to six because we'll probably put recovery on it since recovery's so cheap uh or sorry since the defense mods are so cheap so slap a recovery in there and then you're gonna put in trying to think of what we're using for for this i think we use double concussive see the double concussive or maybe arc concussive let me check oh solar avoid resist depending on where your troubles are void resists more for the boss solars for taking less damage from grenades tanks and interceptors okay um if you want to run double concussive i think that's totally fine as well i don't think you'll uh be be too penalized for that and then your combat style mod like you don't have any energy right now but that's where another mod would go um i don't know what your materials are like if you have a lot of materials if you maybe want to wait until oh which queen and then maybe a couple days before the raid that's when you start to sort out your armor sets because you might get some more good items um you're you're a pretty blank slate when it comes to like making new armor sets and everything so you can afford to like hold off and you know get some potentially new armor from witch queen and then make some sets like that so sorry i'll go back to your inventory real quick so you have three 305 and 28 and nine shards okay so you're not you're not desperate over here for uh materials so it's good uh what we're gonna do in the rest of your items is essentially just making sure you're getting up to 100 recovery and then filling out everything else as you need to your gloves this season are gonna need some energy uh because of all of the champion mods like unstoppable fusion um so that can be pretty expensive you can forego doing a stat mod in your gloves for now if you just want to get up to six just so you have uh unstoppable fusion um and then in your helm you're gonna want to get a stat mod and then you're gonna run two finders in your case you're probably gonna run one or maybe just run double finders and no stat mod yeah so you're gonna have to go up some energy to uh to run the finder mods probably just linear no i run a linear and a regular fusion but that's usually when i'm running fusion i'm running double in here right now so i only need you know i only need the linear fusion finder binder's gonna be on the first page there you go linear fusions on the bottom left okay chillin uh leg armor you're definitely gonna want to run a stat mod and the fusion scavenger mod from the seasonal artifact so that's gonna be seven total and then boots is where i have protective light um and it has to be void for that it has to be void yes uh you don't have to have your boots be void it's just like just what i have just because that's what i happened to have it as when i got the boots um but it's i i wouldn't worry about it for now until you actually get the mod and then class item you got particle and then you got probably like a grenade mod on there somewhere um you're at 92 recovery so you can't afford to put in a uh a recovery mod uh nobody can i'd probably just go with grenade because suppressive grenades are very very strong on titan and then i i think we're i think we're good with your with your set in terms of mods you know unless you want to start infusing or not fusing but uh you know upgrading the energy on them uh which i you know you'll want to do that eventually um but this is a pretty good starter set for for what you got you are going to need to infuse all of it to uh to 1330 but uh for for now how much doesn't it take two shards to match to work um it takes like three shards to mess work on exotic yeah i would do your exotics probably last um i'll do the helmet i'll do everything else right now okay and that's also gonna get you those stat increases which is uh pretty good like yeah if you masterwork all of your armor including the exotic you'll be at 100 recovery i'll get the recovery that's optimal that's pretty good and uh the next time it's like an easy gm i don't know what the next gm is but if you really want we can we could probably just run some easy gms and get some more materials i'll go ahead and match to work this thing no i gotta get more okay hello yeah this this this happens oh my god this is riveting uh i'm gonna bring it real quick is there anything else i need here though uh in the tower i don't think so yeah let me see what the next uh gm is the next gm i can't do conquer in a day because i don't have concrete now because i don't get the ketchup until i have it right uh correct so tomorrow is oh my god tomorrow's hollowed lair so that's not great it's another pretty difficult one um but the week of the 15th will be lake of shadows so that's gonna be a week to go just farm a bunch of gms and load up on materials so you'll have 10 on your character and then 10 your postmaster for your ascendant charts that's a bigger a big i'll need to do this yeah that's that's something you're definitely gonna want to have going into uh between i don't mean to brag but i am um i'm uh bounty storing i've got three currently kind of a big deal pretty good yeah what can i say next level backs level on launch yeah i don't mean to brag but it's hard when i look this good uh these are all not even a thing anymore right yeah so the the ones that are on the bottom row are for materials that don't exist anymore oh that's pretty easy then look at that a hundred recovery and we hit 60 differences are you running on your titan as well daddo i'll be on titan but i can swap what are you on warlock i'm on warlock yeah i got uh well okay um i mean we could go the only thing i'm worried about the boss room but maybe two ursus is the play i haven't tried it before uh i'm not worried about boston at all oh then there you go that's the only thing i worry about so we're good i'm more worried about tank room but we're gonna have a lot of defense so i'm not yeah that will be fine you uh do the cheese where you sit at the top and kill the interceptors before you drop down or no never heard of that in my life oh i can teach you something um i gotta nc in the chat please basically before we fall down in that room you can just like crouch and shoot the interceptors it takes a little while but you can kill it before you go down if you want to need to get my fit one sec looks so good over there thanks man um okay so i assume i'm gonna be running arboles i am also an arbalest i mean arboles is just so strong so it's not the worst idea um why what else what else honestly nothing like our blessed is just so much better than everything else in the slot right now at least this season um the only time i would have you not run arbless is if you're running like mythic last in in the middle slot or like an exotic bow or something which we're not doing you you do you want me to swap garbage stuff no if you're on vex that's fine i think it's good to have one vex just for the uh for the fireballs um yes because like you could do triple bow for the fireballs but it's it's not that fun to deal with um so what else do you want what else should i run so middle slot doesn't matter too much uh i'm on a bow just because bows are good um i was gonna say i do overload bow uh we're not gonna need overload we need unstoppable and anti barrier okay i got that on stop is handled by the mythic class very very easily so yeah i'm on a bow if you have a primary weapon that you really like using uh go for it otherwise i'm on a bow not really what would be a really good just pbe uh primary bag if you have it it's pretty good uh honestly like maybe not a pulse because pulses are a little weak right now unless you have like messenger um with desperado i don't have desperado yet uh then i would run a scout i'd run a scout or a bow uh actually messenger is in the primary slot never mind i'm [ __ ] dumb um scout in that slot you have a vision of confluence that you like that is the only thing that has not dropped in blog for me okay uh so you have a contingency plan what's that contingency plan uh big elemental capacitor subsistence okay not fantastic i would just put on a put on a bow what about that eternal blazing which one either one what do you got we got one one full oh quick draw we got one for all killing win we got kill clip slide shot um anything with one for all is pretty good i just don't know if like well i mean we're getting boosted to 13.50 in two weeks right so i guess it doesn't really matter um if you really like using that scout like what do you like to use that's a great question though this is just recently when i'm doing pb this is just what i use it covers all my mods and my game just just stick with pointing the stag that's fine punish that's good bow was this stick with this threaded needle uh threaded needle is good yep okey dokey are there any read regrets that would be better uh you could run triple tap vorpal reads uh but like you have the vorpal or you have the uh i've triple tapped firing firing line um that's also fine you just need to make sure that you're near us um cooties when you're when you're doing it um which is not always gonna be the case but if you want to that's fine also i don't know how much you're really gonna be taking advantage of triple tap because the amount of times where you're just gonna be able to sit there and just shoot shoot shoot shoot with no interruptions whatsoever is pretty low at least in this strike um it'll be good for other places in the future though if you want to do that all right let's go with threading now also there's a couple void shields sometimes versus no stasis so it can be helpful okay and i need to infuse 1301 mr fruit but i don't want to infuse my ass loom we can we can get you a better one than that let me see what else one of those pregnancies yes get rid of that a drone junkie freedom frenzy or adrenal junkie no distraction uh feeding frenzy you can infuse that one keep the no distractions one look at that what about this retro futurist one for all duel loader get ready okay uh 1330 what about this negative space get it out of here that's right we hate it i mean it's it's my role but like you need you you can get another sword with a good roll on it it's fine okay i'll get rid of the sword yeah sword sword is gonna be easily replaceable dana needs to set up a monthly vault cleaning plan can i get a subscription 4.99 nano vault screenings cleaning subscription what do you got now what's your spaces um i can't imagine you're too much higher you got up to so we've managed to put a hundred items in your vault since the cleaning probably over a hundred just a little bit they're all probably really good rolls too so don't worry about it chris yeah they're really they're really good hey i'm doing it just for another video don't like like clearly right i guess yeah my vault's worse than yours christian don't worry i don't know mine was pretty bad i don't know what i'm doing over here i don't delete a thing it's it's true i barely do my space is full i throw in the ball it's a problem 13 hey i should be able to hit four how close anything over 1345 doesn't matter for gm's no it doesn't you are locked at 13.45 no matter what your level is he made it we jam ready hey you got a good armor set there let me see let me see my stats compared to yours so yeah i mean like we're pretty close like i have two more discipline one more intellect but three less strength so we have like we have the same stats uh they're same amount of stats i just have less strength and and more into discipline and intellect but for you're for having a starter build like you're basically right there yeah which is sad i've been playing destiny for since day one it's starter i mean you're you're three tiers of stats away from having my armor set which for just grabbing a bunch of [ __ ] out of the vault it's pretty good and then number i just haven't bothered i'm just swell i have to grind so much i'm slowly doing cattles but i'm only halfway to completion arbalest is good enough that you don't need like i'll put this right i don't even have it i don't have it unlocked yet it's that good on its own that it's like if you don't have it it's not a big deal okay shadow do you want me to change anything on mine my build i'm new this is my first season ever doing gm's so if you have advice i'll take it you got the drip um you could probably get off the chrome rush uh we have two arboles sweater which are instantly going to kill uh barrier shields and and anti-barrier auto is terrible um i would just switch to a sniper and you can kind of use that pretty freely to take out some uh some junk enemies that might be out of reach or just being really annoying and then otherwise i think you're you're set okay oh i didn't even mention well i forgot since i matched work too i have unused energy on most of these things is there anything um we could put like uh so so put on um put on uh put on taking charge and like high energy fire what's that one taking charges on any any element it costs three any any armor piece any element piece though oh that's a that's a combat style mod which one has three left over perfect what was it called taking charge let's see if it's right there you should it's like green dot ones you ever get right there uh and then i guess we could just put on high energy fire for you because you don't have uh protective light i literally all i do is have protective light and then all my other mods are just uh getting more charged to make sure i have that proct so uh where's hiring recharge do i not have it higher energy fire it costs four so we're probably going to put that in your chest armor that's it you went by it's the top left there on the fly there you go and then i got another thing you could do is like empowered finisher it gives you charge on a finisher it costs 10 of your super um but if you really need some charge in a pinch like killing uh killing an enemy with a finisher can get you some charge um but not not 100 necessary um shield brake charge is good but it's better in other gm's where there's actually a lot of shields uh otherwise you have to get a lot more specialized in order to really take advantage of certain builds and i don't want to spend all that time uh doing it um legs yeah go to go to the other leg what's what's the leg slot let me see what you got yeah cause we're not using more mind cells uh yeah put on um put on was it better already recuperation yeah yeah recuperation so that's like you see an orb on the ground you're low health you just pick one up and you get some health that's pretty good and then just do empowered finish with that if you want uh you know you don't have to well i got extra things right yeah the only time i can mess you up is you know it takes a tenth of your super energy to do it so if you just don't realize that you're doing it that often you can drain all of your super energy for like nothing to be fair i have to consciously remember to finish things so i don't really do it will enough okay we're good to go let's hit it it's time gamers even though apparently it's a bad rotation to start on it's uh you know it's a tough game it's a tough first one but i did this with danielle and jazz and we got it like pretty quick so i'm pretty confident okay well now there's pressure no there's not well don't worry christian i died 13 times in the boss room one time on the strike so the bars maybe maybe not die 13 times because i don't know if i'll have that many rises the bar is left so first thing we're going to do is uh go past all this [ __ ] so follow me okay main thing we got to do here is uh make sure we kill both champions watch out for the scorpius turrets and we got two champions to kill before moving up just do what you can here bless you all right let's uh turn around real quick we're gonna take out some of these ads over here and we're gonna get this champion okay let's rest on that champ and we're just gonna finish it off there you go nice okay so we don't have to kill any of this but just it it's reachable well now we gotta send them out so now we're gonna move up a little bit and get rid of the scorpius okay we're gonna kill barry very barry come on what did he do you fell for it all right let's finish up these ads around here because i think they're gonna stick with us so is this included with the vault subscription service uh this is you're on a free trial right now for the uh gm gun okay that's a 30 day free trial i probably should probably should add someone on aeons it's all right yeah rookie mistake i i did i didn't think it was my place but you know no that's it's all right we'll be right okay so be careful because the boss is showing up we're gonna come over here to the left and we're gonna keep getting rid of some ads here we have an unstoppable easy nice great shooting kid so let's get rid of this guy it's gonna get rid of you hello okay so do we just have eight revives each for that's eight revives combined you get more every time you kill a champion though okay yep every champion you kill is another revive uh okay so boss is shielded we're gonna get some ads out of this door right here so wait for my grenade there it is i swell it's big thanks it's really hard i had to hit a button my god i've never seen someone click it better than you okay so this part's a little annoying because we have to go knock down this dude shield so do we want to just use one of the ursas and just barrier protect it all uh we probably could do that here i'll do it i can do that okay he's doing it um my thing is gonna run out super quick though so do it fast okay back up back up wake up wake up wake up wake up if someone can get that scorpius as well yeah and i'm out all right now just kill him oops nice grenade kevin just so you guys couldn't see trying to add some cinematic effect yeah um by the way i'm gonna let you do a lot of lens flares when it comes to like flinking down targets because effects mythic class just absolutely destroys everything in here and plinking with bows is slow so anytime we need to really conserve ammo just go nuts with vex method class you got it that's all i've been doing the whole time anyways yeah like any any unstoppable that's all you and any sort of ad situation that gets close by just plow away at them with the with the myth of class because bows are good but they're quite slow a lot of responsibility you're giving me data i'm not sure if i like it i i think it'll be all right okay i'm going to stop you giving me anything i'm going a little more instructional than i usually do because i assume fruit is going to upload this so yeah you're helping me you're helping viewers you're mainly helping me i feel like everyone who's already tried to do a grand master they're like wait i've already tried agreement like it took them how long i don't need this all right we'll one shot it we got it okay um so you were talking about like some interceptor stuff jumping in jumping out yeah we're not doing that at all um we're going in and we're doing this uh okay so fruit what i wouldn't want you to do here's what we can do is we we can kill some of these dudes uh up here that this is fine okay i can do that yeah you're right what i'm gonna have you do is i'm going to have you pop your uh your ursa yeah and we're going to go off to the left side uh we're going to have now before we do jump down let's take a look at what we're going to be working with here so on the left and right you got your snipers we're going to take those guys out immediately um the interceptors uh hurt pretty bad so try to stay on the line of sight there's going to be a giant like wall panel that we're going to be standing behind that's our cover for it in the middle you can see we've got that right in front of the interceptor uh that one there's another one further back that we can see actually it's over here see that one oh okay um so we got a couple berries here a couple of regular champs and then throughout this we're just going to be having a lot of uh just ads spawning in just listen for my call and uh i'll tell you what to shoot and all that otherwise just be careful of literally everything just be very careful curious sir three two one go go good you want my well yet or uh fruit fruit you pop first uh you can drop us a riff though that's right i didn't see it kevin it was waiting for the for the the protection fruit i blame you yeah that's fair i'm revivable whenever you're done there all right let me know when your shield is gonna run out yeah running out now all right i got one of the berries i am a little low on green though um so i'm gonna let you handle the next shield break i got i got it working on some close by ads here nice all right so we got some more ads coming in we're gonna be watching out for doggies as well not the dog um this first wave is not too hard what's the dog doing uh you got some more adds over there uh where are the doggies dog said nah dogs ain't doing nothing they really aren't they're afraid of the bear fruit okay now we're gonna have something from the right side as well just be ready one more this is what comrader this is great all right so the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna make sure all the ads here are dead um then when we start the next wave by killing the last interceptor we're gonna have a barrier champion uh spawning in down the ramp on the left so there's this door uh right here that he's going to walk out of like should i kill this by the way right here um we want to insta-kill this guy and then when we kill a tank another one of them is going to show up but i'll i'll make a call out for you all right so take some time to go get some ammo right now while you can i watch out for the interceptor because it will one shot you no one sucked no one saw it yeah the uh i don't know if you know this but the interceptor will yeah uh all right let's uh kill this thing should i be using anything in particular or just i gotta shield off oh okay we got it okay back up back up back up we got this champion down low well right away yeah well it well barrier go nice okay now we're working on junk ads kill any little shittos because they're gonna keep throwing grenades at us be aware of the tank shots if you're standing too far back the tank shot will one shot you you know i'll take your word this time watch that tank shot jesus christ all right we got one more legionary in the mid i want to make sure we kill another one let's try and get some damage on this uh berry it's doing that shot real quick so hang on one second one shot nice okay so now i believe we can go after a tank all right over here just take care of what you can don't worry about that you're good 25. all right let's start to scoot back scoot back let's work on barry in the middle there i i have my ears about right whenever you want just tell me when you want me to pop it uh i think the tank is the only thing left beside dogs okay okay we got really lucky because both of the other major enemies just didn't do anything this whole time so here comes the other dogs do you want my well or not uh i don't think we'll need it okay i want your love first you'll always help my love i'm going to try to take the tank out or wait yeah we can take it out good shot cotton vala's in the middle almost dead there you go get him nice is that it uh one more hat over here small ads i think we killed the scion boss right yeah yeah that's everything yeah damn that went really really well hey mr fruit's uh all right gather i was pushing gather your ammo or moving on uh from here to the bosses pretty smooth sailing just killing stuff copy so what what what makes this one everyone hate it so the first time this was the gm we didn't have something like particle deconstruction to just absolutely dominate the boss nor did we have arbalest and arbless i i cannot emphasize enough is like so insanely good so what made it tough was just the very rigorous timings that you need to hit killing champions and then dodging fireballs and all that kind of stuff because your damage is just so low nowadays it's not that bad at all it's actually very very good so it's not as bad as it used to be the tank room's probably the more stressful place just because there's such high lethality in there that it makes it tough to survive sometimes um did you just eat that guy off the cliff somehow was that did you know that oh the big tanky boss literally just fell into the to the gravel and died oh that's good because there's a lot of help um what i want you to do is come over here go forward and as soon as the door opens walk it and pop your super and just hold up your shield oh i thought you were like get hit by a rock nope okay yeah shield wall boys oh they can go through your shield just be careful uh 20 10 percent dead they're down i apparently my shield isn't as good as statos no well they can still lunge through it yeah i got hit by a sword through it that was yeah that was not datto that was me or not about your fault is my fault i just like to die through shields it's one of my specialties it's my kink don't shame it uh there there is another scorpion turd if you can kill that i got it great shot wow look at the keen eyes over here is that what it's like to have 20 20 yeah it's pretty great actually all right so now we're ducking in this guy and then next room right all right okay we're all ta do we know if i ever tried a solo gym i don't know if it's gonna be this one what's the easiest one quote unquote uh probably devil's layer all right a lot of cover i'll just kind of long but i'll huff some copium and say i'll wait for that yeah you know that's went off so i can't see this penis yeah that's so relatable you sound like my wife okay so as soon as we kill this guy we're gonna have ads behind us uh i will pop my shield should i oh you did okay i hear them they don't seem very happy or maybe i don't okay okay going on the offensive i love it and i'm out okay there's an empty barrier in there nice okay great stuff lads all right here's the skill ads yes me lord okay doggies did you ever play starcraft sir i played starcraft 2 for three weeks so i could understand what was happening in pro play oh fair you know it is true i wanted to learn star cap but i was so bad at it it just made me enjoy esports yeah same dude we should play the heart play like 2v2 against bots or something [ __ ] you the bots will win probably the difficulty man those hard bots clap so well um that's why like i i've met like force gaming um i met him but that's why his time was like yeah i i watched you when you were force starcraft 2 strategy game and that's how i learned starcraft was him and dana uh gather ammo before we hop on um yeah dude me and my two roommates in college uh would just play like 3v3 against bots just for fun and i was doing it so i could learn how to play uh learn how to play starcraft so that way i could follow what the professionals were actually doing or at least just like the units and like the concepts behind what they were doing this is where the champion is um fireballs if they hit you they basically kill you you have double concussive so you might be able to survive one but i don't recommend being hit by one at all ever um so let's just explore this room real quick it's gonna be a lot easier to explain when we're in here um during the first third of the boss's health the boss is basically gonna just stay right here like they're not really gonna move uh during the second third the boss will be a little bit more mobile and then on the final third it will be very mobile getting all up in your face um so we're gonna be hanging out back here okay yeah we're gonna be hanging around like kind of this archway um if you're ever in danger of the fireballs you need to hide just come into here because if they crash into a wall they explode so here don't land here this is this is just like it's totally fine uh sometimes it will ignite and it'll do like very very little damage over time like burning effect but you generally shouldn't have to worry about it and also you can just run along these edges and also be totally fine okay generally you're gonna pop your super like i trust you to make a judgment call for running into danger you know a lot of fireballs are coming we can't handle it pop your super if you're in super by the way and you're holding up your banner shield you can eat all the fireballs no problem say less which is part of our strap so uh that thing summons the boss ads are gonna come down from right here up here and they're just gonna jump down just kill him there's gonna be three more on the other side as well so we're playing plong the boss playing plonk playing plonk plunk and plunk in 66 at 66 health they're gonna put up a shield right here that we need to kill is like that whole barrier thing at the beginning of the boss fight so uh and they're also gonna be spitting out a ton of fireballs they're also gonna be doing that during the fight but just not as often as the shield is coming up we're gonna have two unstoppable champions one's coming out of this door and another one's coming out of that door over there we are all gonna gather probably about here-ish uh the champion is gonna come out we will stun the champion we will immediately kill the champion and i am probably gonna pop my super to protect us from all the fireballs the next champion will wander on over here probably uh taking like this path right here so it's just gonna walk up and be like hey guys what's up i'm gonna stun them again kill this guy and then we are going to uh take out the the boss's shield and that 33 health the exact same thing's gonna happen except this time the boss is coming up here and they'll put a shield here and we'll rain fireballs from up there so the same thing happens we're gonna hide in here we are gonna uh kill the champion i'm gonna pop my super and we're gonna run to the opposite side way over there and we're gonna kill the last champion from that side and then we're gonna kill the shield and then we're gonna kill the boss okay now important to know uh with the whole fireball situation thing they're gonna be spitting out fireballs at a rate that basically makes it near impossible to get into the shield to blow it up fortunately eventually they'll stop shooting fireballs i don't know if that's intended i don't know if that's the game just being like i don't want to risk a memory crash here so i'm not going to keep spitting out fireballs so yeah so we're just gonna wait that out sometimes i like to go in and try and get it done a little bit faster but it's no idea here we go okay um when a champion walks out of the door and it's not aggroed on anything if you try to stun it uh it will not actually get stunned but it will still use the stun cooldown uh you need to wait for it to aggro on someone before stunning so we're gonna have ads coming in any moment here hear the ads nice and we're gonna take out the other ads on the other side as well uh for the boss try not to be directly against the wall uh because if a shot hits the wall and you are next to the wall it will probably hurt you very badly or kill you i prefer to live okay all ads dead so now we're just plinking the boss this is now we're talking until they get to about a third so go nuts with a vex mythoclast all right so let's get ready here after this wave we're gonna tip the boss we're gonna do what now like a cow we're gonna tip well to the health oh okay that okay there we go so we're going to hide right here hide right here and i'm going to stun the champ good kill right get all these can we dps during this oh no uh we're gonna we're gonna hit the champion over here okay good i'm gonna eat all these fireballs you guys dps the champion i'm coming back nicely done okay so here's the part where we have to wait out all the fireballs there's 13 by the way yep 13 waves 13 13 waves of fireballs yeah um in fact fruit if you want me and you can go up and you can just soak all the fireballs and i'll kill the shield all right i'm ready yeah yeah okay i'm good just keep eating them keep eating them he got blasted away that is an instance where you do want to use your melee attack to not get flung into a wall but uh you know what we're gonna be honest it was so i was like okay well that's funny i'm dead should we go back to the safe side over there or uh technically these are both safe sides okay my brain doesn't like change but i'm dealing with it yeah so we're just gonna we're gonna keep just waiting this one out [Music] all right i think that might be it so i'm gonna go take the last you know what that one you guys can go back over here oh yeah now we have the drum solo best part [Music] he wants to help you want to distract him are you good doing that by yourself i got it all right fireballs hide in the uh cover if you need to i think they're only going after you oh hats i'm welling hey i don't know we have to wait 13 fireballs again later so someone who has died it's better to trust there you are well's out in two seconds by the way well it's gone my safety net for the last ads my 401k account just crashed all right we're back to plankin oh i've been oh you stopped oh i know i have a decent amount of ammo on the ground so again i'm just going to speed this up i'm also going to hide the boss is very close okay so hide under here i'm going to give you guys the stun and then we're going to run uh wait there's a shield okay okay and we're running and we're running and we're running i'm running we're running i'm running we're all running i'm out i'm outtie oh i'll stun this oh the is on me i got him there you go kill champ champ dude nice and we're on fireballs again now we just do it from back here uh and wait if you cover me i can get enough orbs for super okay oh he's also shooting sorry i'm currently watching winners pov and there go the orbs it does feel a lot safer up there at the right i normally play at the front of the room and that's how they explode like their uh purple explosions normally kill me there's a lot safer up there it's a reason they call it the god of strats i mean i think a little saucy here oh it also just makes the balls like go straight into the floor yeah worry about shooting them so all right you have to be at getting balls here i'm going i'll play safe so that is at the end of the day we can still clear this what do you mean after this wave oh the boss is right here we'll rope and dope him oh i'm dead i'm alive oh my god you're the best all right balls are done all right let me see okay so i got two shots off oh i got two shots as well okay uh getting it itch down oh you got it all right hide hide hide are we going up runner in the back here i went the wrong way okay it's okay i've been there i can super if you want to get the reds okay uh let's kill these ads first okay i don't oh okay we're not going he's coming for you i've been baited he's coming around he's in the middle okay a lot more mobile here for me all right good players we're good do anything anything else spawn or we just kill now do we go to the front this is kill this is just killing i'm killing i'm killing it i'm running not again i'm melee that time i did it i did it again oh oh i forgot to turn on prosperity dude first try first completion you never told me grand masters were so easy oh my god i think this season is probably the easiest it's gonna get when it comes to gm's why is that particle because of the part of particle uh arbalest is insane yeah i think this is probably a golden era of easy gms because unless we get more of these mods i think we're going back to it being pretty tough oh much low i got warcliff catalyst oh that's good i i still don't have that um i also i don't think my palindrome drop was great but yeah i got a bad one too i got quick draw unrelenting with armor piercing i guess amber forged we did it yeah that was pretty good that was easy we all died one time oh no datto didn't die he just said he was he said he all died one time and then i died a little extra for all of us so here we go yeah that went uh that went really smooth hey a couple of gamers gaming you know what we do [Music] [Music] you
