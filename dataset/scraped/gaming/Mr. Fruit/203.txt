only person i saw before i can tell you it was not rice that's pretty solid as rob i'm gonna skip yeah it's only one i'm okay with that as joey i'm gonna dab and i'm gonna trust everybody that's this is right i've ever seen mr fruit are you just going to dab or skip oh [Laughter] i i didn't know dab or skip is that not your answer [Laughter] we need something that's going to grab the kids [Laughter] you can still die yeah do you want to use your dab or i don't know can i dab a friend assignment's offline they haven't been fixed where's my dab buddy there he is dab dab we're not gonna get anything done and that's the way i'd want it i lost my dad buddy no oh he's gone on to live his life i'm happy for him i think is there am i supposed to be able to like oh just oh it doesn't even oh what block loot locked in we walked in nowhere dude if only i had my dab buddy not just a bunch of dabbers oh no we should have stayed together dab together who's that oh that banana should run back oh is it bridge i think it's bridge he's always the one throwing things that are now i'm pretty sure it's bridge yep definitely bridge and derpy oh self report that's the second body you found well you know so we got peely partied right and i i grabbed the dabbers are dead but are we i grab a hammer and i start whacking some crystals in the bridge and then i look up and the second the dabbers leave each other we all thought of the bridge whoever killed the dabber duo i'm yeah i'm upset i was with bridge and joey so i trust those two i just don't know who was the dabbing banana that was me that was because i was that was the default advancement yeah so i was the default thing okay so we saw we we saw derpy for a little bit you know what we didn't see bryce it kind of looked like your price says bryce has pointed back already he was near the first body also and and he was near the first body but i was not near the the second body i was in loop control i was hiding behind the terminal so i didn't get murdered while we were all bananas interesting interesting interesting things but i mean there was also a line of sights we don't know where fork was on his phone the whole time he's playing fortnite can you come down and show us what you're working on aunt joey wants to see i i i i traveled i traveled across the country to come see you dork and i really just i wish i wish we could see that little little fortnight way more of you you know what i'm saying like joey i think it's and rob was three he was by the first body and now who are you all that's us i voted for brice right i swear to god literally joey and bridge voted him and then should probably keep him alive see that's how he what he does he just throws endless tomatoes at you to disarm you i wish i could like kind of like poultry guys something you know there's a army outside and around your oh we need to get back to this because he's telling us as we learned earlier it's price how did we learn that earlier you kind of just excused me i skipped uh four one and six are the people who voted me which means you accidentally skipped rob and oh dark stop microwaving that burrito and vote oh my god it's on fire don't tell me put tin foil in it dork you have to take it out [Music] wait can you do that like six more times at least what did i tell you about squirting at the table [Music] anyway we also haven't we haven't discussed it the fact that it's bryce again voting joey i'm voting bryce correctly all day you guys can vote me out but you'll lose unless you're in the impostor in which case you'll win wait so i don't like you saying that but also it's price i kind of got to stick to my guns at this point oh see now derpy's throwing the blame on joey even though they dork why'd you vote for me because you kept throwing  at me [Music] i should have known oh rob is waiting well technically they can go with two kills i think right because there's five of them so i mean it's not overblown it's over you know i'm saying uh oh saucy bakas making everyone translocate oh he's running back oh derpy he's not gonna press he's looking for a kill amy yes she is no you want to keep joey alive oh all right well never mind yes the numbers didn't work out let's go joey you were a pro gamer you were a third imposter there that was impressive what the hell our names because derpy yeah he reported like six bodies okay we should have realized that so who is well what's funny is i didn't kill either body that i reported that's actually they were bros bridges kills [Music] [Music] you
