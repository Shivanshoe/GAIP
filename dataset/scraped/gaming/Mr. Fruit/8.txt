hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. in this remote's rather fitting we're looking at the brand new trials gun the sidearm to be specific but egad what's going on i don't know they have a colorblind setting on it's disorienting me too i'm using yeah i can't believe it just made that noise they got the trial sidearm and let me use it and their in-house fruit the clan so shout out to you the forgiveness which is what i'm about to ask of you four please wait what we'll get to that in a second paul i got a rifle for an increased ability he'll love to say this ricochet rounds for that increased stability but mainly the range demolitionist kills with his weapon generate grenade energy rapid hit for the i don't you guys know these traits right like alacrity i don't have to tell you counterbalance um no why not right it's a hard-hitting two-burst fire the reason i'm on somebody's account and not my own because i haven't been able to play trials this week in fact i haven't been able to play much of anything or record much of anything for the past week i'm currently undergoing some clinical trials if you've seen on twitter then you have some idea but i'm doing it in hopes of alleviating some depression it's a long story short that's not the important part because of that i have been exhausted and unable to do much or function uh as far as like recording and playing it also gets super motion sick so today is a little respite before i start trials again uh this upcoming week and yeah we didn't have the chance to get this but yeah i can't wait for all the people in the comment sections jesus christ he could work he doesn't even use his sidearm from eight miles away and complain you're so bad that's right yes it's a sidearm so you know the drill i am undoubtedly going to use it out of its intended range then complain why it's not killing people and so on and so forth because you know the drill or maybe you don't i didn't check sensitivity ah whatever i can yep that's definitely colorblind the enemies are yellow mellow and when i'm dead what what's that color yo take that nade oh that's a nice that's a nice looking nade and everything okay everything hurts hey yo no wait what am i doing and well you know what i bro i broke my rule i broke i was about to say you know the drill it's a mr fruit destiny weapon review and it's not a power weapon which means we exclusively use it even to our own detriment but i broke the rules there and see hopefully now you're like wait yeah that's weird i feel dirty good yeah that's why we don't do it all right you should feel filthy also ooh sheesh that's a lot of damage i mean sure he was already weak but we don't have to really focus on that that is not happening uh so yeah i'm just gonna shoot you'll see oh my god i didn't kill him i didn't kill him and they have fusion rifles and uh how am i not dead actually oh yeah well i didn't live that's how but yeah you probably like yeah i use the pulse and you know what he's right it doesn't hit the same it's just different because we're here to get this so i ask for your forgiveness for using the peace of mind once incredible kill me we do got that that rapida hit the goin this is the dessert helper mr stark imagine he didn't even get to say it he's just me it was very nice of thanos to uh snap him last so that he was able to have that tender moment with uh our beloved iron man okay that's you know i'm convinced there's literally zero tracking on the throwing hammer against guardians in pvp and i refuse to believe anything else cause like there wasn't or maybe i don't maybe have to be like a certain range there we go okay doesn't matter we got the kill oh my god what are you using ah ow okay i don't actually know what's going on it's not even i'm not even playing anymore yo tactical pause is valerian csgo can i something get closer to me oh my god the crouch shot you embarrass yourself because i'm just how did that
