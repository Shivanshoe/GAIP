explain to me why I should choose you to be a super bow that's genuine you know I've been there and that's very important yeah yeah I've been to Florence and honestly you talk and brings me right back oh yes and second of all I have the besties fear okay and how's that gonna help but I like to strike fear into every single person they come back they will remember my name as a they will fear me of course because I have here as that is important for a villain what else can you do oh yes well I am I am a bit uh bit bipolar so some people like to think I'm a nice person but that's because they haven't seen the other like seven sides to me you see I could be nice and then I could want to kill you like and no no remorse the next second you'll never know okay you know what what's a supervillain without a complicated backstory yes for my final card I have I am uh I am shaved what's a good is very true that's very true but I have a question says here you had a sad childhood what's that about I'd rather not okay okay I didn't mean that I was just just curious just you okay all right calm down it's cool it's cool all right Danielle saved me what would make you the greatest super villain I have and as we know every super villain and their henchmen as well just can't hit the broad side of a barn that's true they sound also my signature weapon which I have extra bad aim with is a boomerang so wait wait where are the cards which ones well no sorry those are dados cards minor hinge okay so put them out here swings here perfect really bad aim oh wow a boomerang there you go okay I'll leave that Wow okay I also have very poor judgment if you give me a decision it's likely that I'm going to pick the worst possible that's a good outcome so you know I would hope you would they just they always they always get fully old their plans their plots and mine just are executed with terrible judgment so given we can't have you making smart moves I mean plot armor the hero's future has attained a fruit take this out the real question though is Sonic what would your super villain name be okay Daniel what would yours be I need to monetize this as soon as I saw your hand I was like oh data possible future super villain well start out you know I watch a lot of what okay I thought you're throwing my cards off the table I was like I can't hello thank you yeah for starters I have a lot of free time which means I watch a lot of telenovelas and you know they they are they're pretty dramatic and I feel like so are our villains that they're their job is to create drama through their villainy and you know I have a lot of references watching telenovelas I also like to swear a lot Oh like a lot yeah I'm just doing I'm not swearing right now out of just professionalism for the of core the interview but bruschetta um I you know villains get really angry and they need to swear a lot so that people know that they mean business otherwise are you a villain you know what I mean when I was in training um I actually got my merit badge in evil deeds and sewing actually Wow so I said I don't remember that badge you know it was a different sect of it I didn't go to your normal Boy Scouts it's pretty top secret you know specifically for super villains right so now you grow as a villain I mean I would know as a super villain myself but it's just a test and then as soon as I got my Eagle Scout I went to college and I got my associates degree to it masterminding a lot of a lot of accolades here yeah well you know if you want to be a good villain you have to play the part and in order to play the part you got to know the part what what it what was your associates degree in again master mining mastermind hmm that is important now tell me the real secret how are you able to do that and keep a six-pack I mean what good is a supervillain if they are not to be envied and how else can you create Envy amongst the men of the population you get shredded okay they that creates fear that creates Envy you maybe maybe you start to pull some people towards your side like oh my god he's so evil he's ripped no I mean if that's what it's like being a villain sign me up now

negative trait all I got is a dollar so I really need this job if you could do me need a dollar a dollar is a dollar all you who you know I'm very uh I have this condition it's kind of like being lactose intolerant but it was like booze but I love booze so much that like I just like drink it but like I don't care for like it's just like have this uncontrollable gasp and maybe maybe I could use that for like my advantage fighting like the you know you know the people were fighting oh yeah are you yeah I have a pretty cool name like you know cooler than all these people's name you know I think I really they call me the bone man because ha ha I like to bone yeah man Wow so pointless we really have a way with words has anyone ever told you that okay yeah but I got to tell you one thing

trying to make some money man I blew all my money on booze and all II have this dollar so now here's it's all ER make it into more dollars so I could get rich man more like homeless man I see what you're trying to do here all right that'll be it I'll make my decision thank you was somebody will get in touch maybe probably probably not thank you for coming in here bone man appreciate appreciate that you know I was looking for a supervillain and I think I found the man perfect for the job or woman because turns out it's none other than the attorney general brick do J's goat you back bro guess what always they're a fake planted family because I knew they'd be a liability I love no one we are applying for German teacher jack-jack Ahmed yes may I join ya ask me all right I'm looking for a gym teacher show me what you got buddy all right well I got this I got this giant sack of apples I got these Sakura apples I'm gonna teach these kids some archery you know put an apple on top of somebody's head and they gotta shoot the arrow off their head you get it next I have my sidekick his name's Jim he helps me out with the with the bow and arrows and the supplies mainly the apples it's mainly mainly the Apple he he goes out and grabs all the apples that I need so uh so you know he's he's quite helpful so I think that's like a two-for-one package but you know if these these kids they start getting out of line on my hand cuff them i'ma handcuff them to this tire and they're gonna have to drag that tire back and forth across the field now really strengthen them up really really strengthen them up I don't know you well you know what it's not Notley illegal and I think that's all that matters and finally I'm just very high all the time which means I tend to be pretty relaxed but you know I don't shoot the bone arrow so that's that's really the main thing I just tell them to shoot the bow in the arrow so so I don't shoot it because I don't want to accidentally impale one of these kids with with an arrow I mean your methods are questionable but a result but it looks like the bow is not the only thing you don't want to be shooting because apparently you have a you have a sawed-off shotgun you know that's for the that's for the next class up once you master archery and then we move into into guns and sawed-off shotguns just a real fun a real fluent English shoot we got like 17 apples for that one you know you see how many you can you can grow up in a single shot it's just a lot of fun I give that for the kid to get a nays do I Apple didn't have an arrow shot through it is fresh thank you for the offer but I will humbly decline is your loss could you forgive the next person for me on your way thank you hey you are you referring to me yeah I think so how you doing oh hello hi how you doing shucks I am fine how are you good good you talk about being a gym teacher huh yes well as you can see I am an attractive older woman oh and most people would think that is um walking the line of inappropriateness but I can tell you the kids are gonna pay attention to me especially on days when I wear my fishnet stockings Oh what okay you know the wrestling days when we dress up is our favorite you know indoor wrestling and wrestling boxing I love it all and that's why my motto is fly like a butterfly sting like a wasp whilst just her a man myself and as many good Cougars and wasp people's hair I believe in spaceships and I have one and I would like to teach the kids about being healthy and that way if the aliens do come they have a good fighting chance and I think that you can see the wisdom in that yes I guess there isn't any questions for me yeah out of sweat it's a bit yeah sure go ahead there is one question consider as you say you are anywhere fishnet stockings I kind of don't want to know if I want to ask but uh says you're here you have extra credit programs yes these well these extra kind of programs in fall exactly I know that you are curious and that your brain may be going to the wrong place but it actually has to do with the aliens want them to be caught unprepared so we do extra credit we research we look at what the government doesn't want you to know I know but man this is this is a gym class we're talking about well yeah you must be in peak physical condition to deal with all the unknowns oh no I know I do now a week on a shag or do I need to leave uh-huh well I think he could leave now I think we're good I will take your application into consideration again what you're coming Robby Robby underscore VD to come in here on your way out please oh I thought she was gonna get me okay how you doing I heard you're looking for a gym gym teacher correct gym teacher correct okay would it like what something like you're looking for like one quality you're really looking for like III do really care about these kids cuz I'm like somebody who's like really trying to make something happen yeah yeah yes of course I think the most thing I would want them to pay attention to class the most okay they always seem to get distracted I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest with you I'm looking for some athletes all right I'm not gonna go to school that doesn't take you seriously first of all I guarantee you I'm more qualified than anybody even those little bozo sitting out there even that walking cat that just walked in here uh I have an online degree okay so I don't mean to boast have you heard of Phoenix no okay oh my he with the Phoenix we can't compete I went there oh good now mister I'm sorry I didn't catch your name you just call me Sammy Sammy is fine okay mr. Sammy Chen now how much do you care about these kids athletically uh well as long as they're in shape I know I'm not expecting them to be like have like a 16 pack in like a day all right okay but what if they did have a 16 pack in a day because I'm gonna inject him with steroids oh well I don't think we can do that okay okay but like I will make sure everything works and nobody gets caught and everybody shuts up especially you because I have obsessive-compulsive this disorder and I make sure everything is done the way I need it to be done this operation is set they become athletes they'll become pros and then they will give us money because we will be important figures in their lives we will have money and whenever the FBI or the NCAA or anybody comes after us I have the best poker face ever look at me look at me look at me damn it I looking look at me I'm looking what do you see what do you see Sammy what do you see you see your poker face bro you're right all right have to make sure you won't crack under the pressure either this is a two-man operation [Music] you do make a pretty good argument I mean if you could hide the fact that a whatever you're using doesn't get caught and that is a pretty good argument but uh there's one thing I kind of am worried about that you you slip on money that's it's that you have a peg leg and I'll be honest when you surf if you have a peg leg I feel like the kids are gonna be poisoned you have something all right hey I used to be a pirate 20 years ago sure I sailed the seven seas okay yeah I Sperry some treasure and put an X on it and then put the mat somewhere and gave someone some bury treasure yeah what of it I made some mistakes in my past but yeah it's something that sticks with me to this day I also have a parrot on my shoulder that you haven't even noticed yet Wow any other question thank you yeah thank you for being quiet actually II actually dressed up for the occasion as well uh-huh all right all right all right well I mean it's not about your past that I'm worried about like you know we all do stuff in the past that way uh you know we wish Bette I don't outrun you right now this peg leg I don't I mean I honestly don't think you could what do you see he's scared see a peg leg let's go let's bounce out of here let's hobble out of here hey I think he's ready for you guy well hello there it appears

call me the Red Sea because it is a bloodbath oh I am going to be absolutely brutal to those kids I'm gonna teach them that their dreams their hopes and dreams are worth absolutely nothing because if it were up to me I'd still be playing high school football out there every single day but I'm a 34 year old man and I can't do that anymore and it's worse still no sir or a trench coat just to remind them that I'm not their friend Oh and that their best years are gonna be behind them soon it's the truth and I have the perfect alibi the alibi is that Becca dumped me when I was 18 and she went to Harvard and I stayed here and that's why I gotta be her gym teacher any questions sir I will not take no for an answer yes actually I have one yes they have been reports I got reports all right I saw reports of a someone who knew you were applying here that said you have a really weird-looking shed yes Mike Rotch head I go back there to cry oh to remind myself that I'm a failure but you know what

graduated 1947 with second class honours at a four year chemistry Bachelor of Science degree specialising in x-ray crystallography under the supervision of Dorothy Hodgkin do you know Dorothy well the other thing is ice also specialized in politics which is great because I am passive-aggressive if you need kids that I won't need to be a little a brought up correctly I will slack them right in order

especially the British accent except for one thing and you've been lying to me and lastly I'll get you tired of people lying to me when they're applying for this job it's here that you actually have an Indian accent so where are you who are you telling truth about everything I know Dorothy and she never spoke of this man it's all a lie I am sorry I must be going now whoa no is why Americans won

complete please give me the job okay but but anyways I like I said I'm very patient okay but please don't ask me about my background I know you probably are wondering where I'm from or what am i but I just don't want people to find out what my secret and he is a pain please so okay anyways I I'm really excited if we if please do call me I have these spandex okay it's the only thing I have sorry though again why's a fire alarm going off please um don't let it scare you I guess I should tell you my what my secret identity is I myself identified myself as a dragon I actually got a lung surgery I replaced my actual lungs with a with a fire tank thingy from from Tesla company what is that little fire gun saying it's it's literally inside my first but ever since I was a kid I've always been wanted to be a dragon and I need I need this job this gym teacher jobs who I cover those fees I mean I don't fault you for being a dragon all right that's fine by me but uh there's again a lot there's one thing that you have been holding out on me since you got here actually and I've noticed them uh right next to you but you have yeah too often what to me it's so freakin brownies how how how you walk into the room and you don't offer someone a brownie off your plate of freaking brownies explain that to me uh listen those are prescribed brownies that I forgot it needs four like I should have

oh my did you smell those brownies Wow yes those smell delicious excuse my my Walker here I'm my old age evidently caught up with my body doesn't quite count yeah sorry and come again young man sir how old are you if you're in a walker and you're trying wait you're trying to do it but you're gonna Walker and you're trying to apply as a gym teacher I'm not the one that has to do the physical education son I just have to instill good lessons and values into and to other kids which is why I've known as the red panda because I teach kids not everything is so black and white you see the world is a very complicated place there's no room for obesity but more importantly hate it teach them the value of friendship adulthood love family because personally to always bend my life's work to work with kids from shelters you see underprivileged I like to give them something to hold on to hope with because I don't have much myself my love of my life I had 36 years ago and every day I miss her so so I pour that love into the kids you see I'm but an old man waiting to die well okay I mean after books can I can I confess something I I like to work with the sheltered kids because I like seeing their underprivileged nests because then I realize how much better I have off than them stupid little kids and I go home and thing you stupid kids even one but they don't know that but I hate them maggots those comments about the kids kinda worrying especially uh you have this thing that you didn't tell me about as well uh night vision how much do you hate these kids are you following them home at night because you hate them are you like haunting them bro no no I only see them at school nothing more the night vision is just a side effect from the nuclear fallout many years moons ago it claims my wife and it claimed my legs just why I have these Walker's just so happens I have night vision every old man does you'll figure it out one day all right hate those kids interesting applications here [Music] I'm just like a logical one here be honest I'm gonna we're gonna give it to I'm gonna give it to Danielle because listen in the end she's probably gonna keep the kids attention let's let's all be real she's got fishnets Stamper car Cougar Danielle and I are gonna do a combined execution your first target will be our door - guy who literally forgot an entire entree from our orders so that's big talkers why is literally everyone on door - incompetent we have done six orders in the past two months from door - guess how many of them had every single item guess guess I guess I'm through I would hope at least three one one order had every single item and every other order has had something missing how difficult is it as a delivery driver to look in the bag of items count them make sure it goes up to the amount of items on the receipt before leaving the store I don't give a [ __ ] about this food or delivering it but maybe iota of thought into looking at it kind of seems like you guys already had an education I'm sorry well that's like my street name my show well this is for the executioner job correct it's correct yes cool show so my parents said I need to get a job and I starts to executioner which sounded like way better than like movie Caesar so if you could just really roll with roleplay with me here that would be great can you do that for me I am the Red Sea I make the blood of my enemies spill as I burn them alive and their blood spills down the stairs and I'll be a great executioner because I cannot lie I am very honest and because of that I have to tell you you're probably really wondering hey Red Sea you may be a badass pyromaniac who can't lie but what's with the costume yes my costume I am a wolf also called the Red Sea and it actually works out perfectly because my first onna is actually the executioner and as well on the name of Malta but that doesn't bet this is important yeah no I love the costume I'm a huge leaf and I'm also I'm also really sorry to hear about your door to a shortage that is that guy is really tough if I was your George eyes hoarder I probably would have looked at least dekai I would have liked a little touch test because I like before I give the food cuz I used to work at so I like to take a bite of it of each food so you I would have known if it was there or not yes but a great way to check all the items mm-hmm take a bite converse with my colleague for two seconds we should you know occasionally we're more calm your voice is wave calm and deeper and more southern there's two yeah but speaking of making coincidence all right it's kind of embarrassing because yes it is a sex den but not a lot of sex actually happens in it it may be called a sex den but I know I'm I've never actually done it so it's just kind of like a thing I'm into but like I like actual sex happening and it doesn't happen but like I there it's air and like yeah but I like it I mean that's no problem at all actually yeah that's my business too with the execution of duties I mean I you said is there anything that I think adds to my job saying and I think that me being in some of the positions that the people who I'm executing I've been in I can kind of see what they're going through no empathy yes yes doesn't often have that quality yes yes excellent we'll discuss amongst ourselves okay the next person yeah yeah hey they're ready for you guy Oh God okay hey that's me so if you need like an executioner have you okay look I just want you I want you in your head what an executioner does right so have you ever used 64 trigrams 42 palms and cut off the chakra points of a person and then murdered in cold blood because I don't think you have lady you have you cut off the chakra points and then they can't use ninjutsu unless you're a stupid [ __ ] nine-tailed Fox [ __ ] that dude anyway thing is I've learned so I can execute the share someone so if anything happens I have a weapon I have a mace now amazed okay a passed down from generations mace dude I will beat the [ __ ] out of whoever you want me to kill I got this I'm slimy because I haven't showered I'm an otaku I don't shower I don't believe in it all i watch is crunchyroll that's what I do I live for that [ __ ] [ __ ] cog the new attacker time looks so [ __ ] good holy [ __ ] okay and then finally I have no sense of humor

just like my father it has been a hell of a day for us but we appreciate you waiting tell us why you are fit to be an executioner oh yes well uh my methods of execution tend to dabble a little bit in to seduction interpretation so next thing next few things I'm gonna show you they need to be explained quite a bit all right so first I mean that I need the target let me talk about I'm qualified to attempt to uh execute and you want to butter him up you know you want to butter him up say nice things about him I think you're the friend means you thing you want them you need them and then it's all it's all smooth sailing from there start off go home start taking off everything you get out the massage oil it's pretty simple you know everyone needs a nice lubricating although you know this simple stuff and then just you know making out the passionate it happens and just listen just just hear me out my assassinations are again very difficult to understand so I must explain them again uh let me start getting into the nitty-gritty things uh I have a handle bar set up all over my house for various positions now I know I know it sounds this does not sound like a date like execution methods but it's fine because all that was hallucination I make them hallucinate thinking that they're all and that's the sharingan genjutsu exactly exactly this man knows this is a good man right freaking he bro this man knows they're all hallucinate that and then that time that hallucination is also slowly killing them the way they'll experience a sweet blissful death and they won't even know it until it's too late my executions girl any questions okay yes I'm still I'm still thinking that you've mistaken it for assassination executions are usually in the public and what I think he means is that he dose that makes them hallucinate so that way when they are executed or Pleasant way as opposed to realizing that they're stuck in a chair yes yes that is that is correct my good sir right okay kids in your newfangled er okay chalk that up to me just being old-fashioned in my executions I suppose one final thing many of our executions involved you know axe chopping blocks cetera do you think needing a monocle and having eyesight strong eyesight and only one eye will help with your spatial reasoning your distance such oh yes of course it does help actually um it helps me examine the target examine the target similar features the needs the personality it's a it's very exquisite to have this monocle on me actually it helps so with my jobs very very much need to know their personality when they will die and approximate yes because when I know their personality I'm gonna know what they want and that helps when I'm making them hallucinate I can't just start I can't just give them a random loose nation because then they're gonna go like what the hell is going on here I have to know the person got to figure them out it's pretty simple Ashley's oh all right um well I mean this has been quite a process but okay I was treated with unjustice your freak Hey you just haven't thought about your mom my pants we finished our thing and we're just going to rubber-stamp oh I have found hatred

believe a regular sized meal could feed a whole family I could down the sexes what I'm saying is I already got a lot going for me you need to get some foreign people in like me you need to get me over there cuz I'm the best of what I do right here's the thing everybody else they have every problem ever alright when they're going into these eating contests they don't know how to do anything they get bloated easily right they can't drink much they can't do it fast enough they throw up that's against the rules so many these people don't seem to realize throwing up means it kaput that's the end of your run you can't throw up but everybody I hurt laughs it's not how you do it that is kind of impressive but the rest of them have me a little concerned because here's the thing I'm gonna let you in on trade secrets that only Jeff knows about when he entered that competition you need nothing left to lose I go in there with an empty : brother we let everything out not before we cleanse our body there is nothing left in me but the stuff I was born with all right now may I have seen a picture of what you have done to a toilet before and let me tell you it was one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen on my phone well knee okay I got me britches it made me sick you ate 250 hot dogs in a row brethren you tell me how your toilet looks all right I didn't say I make graceful poops I'm the same before and after I come prepared during the contest there's one thing on my mind and it is eating as much as possible I need someone with a clean colon there may that's exactly what I'm doing I go in with a clean going you go in here's the secret everybody thinks you got to drink water drink water no my key is rum wash down the food with rum I know what you're thinking that's crazy talk but it ain't the alcoholic properties help break down the food and it helps me digest ease here before my stomach knows what's going on let's see that's a trade secret Oh Geoffrey you're figured out himself so don't go spreading that anymore but it's all about the realm you get down a hot dog drama hot dog rum hot dog realm I haven't even eaten anything and the main thing is it's all about the whip you whip your head some people just put in the hot dogger I'm dum-dum no no you put in the hot dog whop whip your head back what whip your head back realm pop whip your head back realm you see everybody out here how about this fancy stuff no I'm a man of principle I'm a man of action I know what to do and I know what to do to get to where I want to be I go in I have a game plan brother I'll tell you ain't no one do align me if you need somebody to eat something I'm yummy all right that's all great in all my but what's this here and yeah so I always do background checks to make sure me fire is in me is a good blokes you know cause if we go and go get drink some points and hit the tins gotta make sure that I could have a good shuffle yeah but it says here you done terrible things mate Oh what what is that about I don't know why you're confused you've already talked about my terrible things my toil would say I'm quite wearing quite abusive relationship but the reality of the situation is I use it for one purpose and I'd man my stomach and my butt have done some terrible things to toilets but it's the least you can expect a mixture of that many hot dogs and rum ain't gonna lead to Pony of Sunshine's and a nice movement you know what I'm saying so terrible things maybe to the toilet but to you and me you know water of a bridge maybe next time be a little bit more specific there because you can see where Carl gets twisted or get twisted damn I know now you [ __ ] mocking me me yeah I'm not do this over here just come over here make fun of me [ __ ] wouldn't be the first job go ahead do it no one's ever talked to me like that keep sending the next member in there you know all right hey Helen you what's up and go on in there get on get now there's a little touchy on the action so be careful about that [Music] hello how are you may I've been here for two hours interviewing for a competitive eater and I haven't even had me tea yet heavy-handed biscuits got a filmy caught with petrol he has had some graphs though hmm yeah that's not legal here may a cop oh yeah you need compare a VA job eh yes think you're mad enough for it uh yeah actually I'm I'm definitely the best I'm the best here there's there's no what makes you say that man well first of all no one shouts nothing shouts competitive like a cape you're gonna see me in my cape yeah you're like ah this guy means business here you go okay right now yeah can you give me a good 360 and a good life hey that was incredible that was pretty super yeah you know guys buy a that weird bloke saying that was pretty good I've seen better I didn't ask well anyways um yeah now this this next thing yeah it's a special technique I I've come up with specifically only only exclusive to me um condoms all right now I know what you're thinking you want my yes yes I know it is a is a very strange but let me explain to you my technique you see in competitive eating the goal is to get everything down as fast as possible see what these condoms these aren't just ordinary condoms but everyone sees them I pull Mount oh my god why is this guy pulling out condoms you see I just stuff all the food inside them these are specific highly engineered condoms a good food may I don't want to hear everybody knows food tastes not it's the food isn't the same when you're wearing a condom a it just doesn't taste this thing so it's just like why even partake in it if you use a condom a listing my good sir you it was like uh it's so I'd rather be doing anything else but it's I want you to be to enjoying what you do and oh I hate to be gargling food down with a corner because you have to let me explain my concern I'm not I'm not done like I said these are highly engineered condoms that we're talking about these are normal these condoms feel the texture of any food you put inside them and change the texture of the condom to taste and feel like the food you're eating you're not just gonna be eating a fricking condom you won't even know you have the condom on my good sir you'll just be so they always say that's what they always say well my good sir you have not met me yet so uh yeah but anyways um that's uh that's it let's move on here now again I think yes it's okay breathe me no it's just like my techniques are not understood by anyone but just cuz I'm the best alright no one no one quite understands them the best like like me alright quiet man not quite my next ability is stroke alright now again it's good sir Sir why why isn't sir why is the stamp getting wet sir I can't I can't explain if I can't see you sir sir I can't sir a little sir alright okay thank you technical difficulties is the stroke now you're probably wondering how can you use a stroke to your advantage well um you see again my jokes aren't ordinary shows I'm not not like an ordinary human okay these strokes give me the ability to go into this sort of inner state if you will these strokes allow me to continuously eat food non-stop without need to breathe or at least I met illegally like cleared like you're not getting like you know oh kind of woozy no no like walk up walk you know yeah yeah don't worry it's fine um now you're probably wondering why why I'm using this and why I keep saying that I'm the best and better than anyone and I'm not some ordinary human well it's because I have a god complex so you see it's just I know I'm the best I'm not like I'm not like these other people all right I'm different I'm special it's basically me so before you came in here you gave me like a book and you said like I read this it's gonna change me life and I'm be honest me it kind of makes sense with the bald complex now um can you explain to me like like what what like yeah this black book is about in what you're trying to do here it seems like a whole moment kind of thing I don't know what is here cuz I'm from London is that like an NA thing I'm gonna be honest with you sir I don't think I can explain that because I don't really know what that is myself all right mate thanks for making it kind of lean on me you want to do me a favor not they I'm not gonna accept you for this job you just don't seem like the kind of bloke is gonna be good yeah I hope you figure out your stroke thing but can you send in the next the next one please you know it great your decision all right um can uh the next person the next person he is uh waiting you're not gonna do as good as me because yeah I'm just I'm just better than you but going me or you Stefan hey Danielle you're muted how am I needed no we here oh nevermind I'm you're here when we were in the same room nevermind our universe [Music] it was up no oh man I love eating love it my favorite thing to eat is chocolate but that doesn't mean that I can't eat everything else but I'm just saying that's my favorite again okay and if I don't win I'll go back in time and I will do it again better and I will win oh man you got a time machine yes what is it made out of I can't tell you that it's a trade secret if you can be compared they are you gotta tell me what time machines me out all right I'll tell you what it is very good job but I'd really need the job it's late I can't promise you got wild I come from a long line of family of professional eaters and in practicing for this I can I know how to eat and and process everything my stomach therefore I can defuse bombs and I think you know we're gonna bombs I mean dropping bombs and in the toilet I can defuse them yeah I got it mate yeah yeah my stomach just kind of shuts that stuff down yeah like Jess and like I defuse them oh you did a poop joke and it was it was just as good night right except for mine's like not a poop joke because like I just did I get rid of them so but I forgot we were talking about and I apologize can we just what what reason what well I explains that you hope the short attention span because I asked what a time machine was made a view servant answered me mate oh you know if I yeah it's um it's made out of science it's very science now see now when I get science it just doesn't work so um now I I had everything I had every interview we'll come in here today and it takes some blood did you did you give some blood today I didn't know that was required sure you can have yeah well you da I'm gonna be honest with you you

sorry mr. fruit that's Jeff but thanks shark I'm sorry what oh hello dad oh and Danielle it probably would have been dad oh I would have accepted data for the job I'm not even human I think I think Shore is the best well joke's on everyone because I enjoy being unemployed which the job here a b-movie actor here's the competitive eater card data okay you can just is this the another gym teacher okay this is about all the yeah yeah let's put it in there then I'll shuffle I just put these over yeah you just brought to the side what do we do not be actor alright that was the actual b-movie this work okay yes well hello there everybody who would I see that everybody wants to be a b-movie actor but not everybody can be a b-movie actor because one you have to accept being a failure too you have to accept not being enough of a failure to where people won't see you in public and laugh at you so you need to have a strong will a strong resolve and in general just accept that you're just generally budget versions of the Avengers and that's pathetic now I need some pathetic insecure people can't get my first person your blessing us Wow how's going Wow yeah Jesus Christ we have a someone from Hollywood Boulevard up here well please tell me yeah please tell me how this incredible impersonation of a person I have never heard before tell me tell me how you making this win this dog-eat-dog Hollywood world first the thing is there's nothing more that I want is this role in this big movie okay first it's a dog-eat-dog world you say no I own it Krabs you own Krabs are you having it's a crabby crab looking out there alright and I will just say this Krabby Patties are delicious that's great um what does mr. Krabs have to do with this interview process no you said doggy-dog world I'm just saying it's crabby crab it's it's a it's two sides of the same coin but the good thing is I have experience in movies I was in a big-budget movie called good times in Tijuana oh so you're washed up that would make you a great big director but you know what they say it's time to come back you know I went away because I stepped on a crack angry broke my mother's back and I had to go away you son of a gun well just like any b-movie actor they think something's gonna hit and it just doesn't please continue I the other thing is I was in the movie music video but Fleetwood Mac's chain huh I think I'm qualified well you see I'm looking for a b-movie actor not someone who would be a voice actor for the b-movie you know I'm looking for someone relevant but not relevant enough and it kind of just seems like the the best thing that you've got for you going so far as being a backup for Stevie Nicks well this is a really good start and I mean we're gonna have to really go over this but would you like to tell me why they call you the jackhammer well yeah I've looked around and Hollywood circles and apparently they call you blast the jackhammer see the thing is please don't go to put that into special websites that rhyme with your home oh yeah pornhub okay yeah I'll be sure not to because they call me Johnny sins over there are you sorry Johnny jackhammer I will not confirm just go to the next bleed well thank you so much well Johnny touch what we have over here shark sharking tonight on eco saving my kid from that burning building by the way what's going on mr. blue esto oh there so as you know we're hiring for a b-movie actor I need to know why you always get the job I know what this position is you don't got to tell me anything I got hey first of all I got looks that could knock you out all right wow that was smooth yeah let me turn to the right you like that chin huh let me get that angle right yeah you are positively self-centered you are dead making good case for yourself yeah also uh you know I may be looking good but you know I do love me some Wow alright but you know I don't play a lot you know therefore you know I'm just a I'm just a rain to grunt in World of Warcraft wow you're like Henry Cavill but significantly less interesting all right Pete go right you know I ain't no high warlord or anything but I'm simply just a grunt but hey this is just a beat reactor uh you know b-movie actor you know job application I'm saying I also have some that'll blow your mind all right you might be looking for a villain well he's blow me yes I'm your guy for let me show you my talent ready I've been working on I was looking in the mirror and been I've been pumped for this right you ready okay all right please show yeah please I would love to see what you're going for sir I like what you're going for you haven't evil laugh because it tries to share a away from the fact that you have nothing else interesting about your personality and we like that about you I'm very good-looking like egg looking villain right now we have a really good starting point you're on you're attractive but not enough to be self-centered you play World of Warcraft because you want people to think that you're more interesting than you actually are and you use an evil laugh as a crutch to keep yourself up to make people think you're talented I really like we're going with this and you really seem like a B actor well you know all my life and I've been trying to make in big world tryna get these acting jobs but yeah I do have some sort of experience in the videography field as I use IMAX porn sir and uh I'm a pro at happy endings you know so I I'm not camera shy if you're looking for the guy for those kind of scenes I'm the guy I like this not only are you failed actor who uses evil laugh in that one movie and is probably going to fail and ever get another role you also failed to trying to be a director when you figured out your acting career is over and the star directing porn now that is a good food b-movie actor career I have to ask you though it says over here that you have a time machine now it kind of seems like you took this time machine to have the perfect b-movie actor career now I have to ask you why sir did you use that time machine to get to this interview listen I I just gotta I just got to do what I got to do you know I'm saying uh I'm not a very smart guy but I did my research I I talked to a Erik Tesla you know the guy who makes the Tesla stuff yeah yeah he hand me a blueprint of a time machine and what I did with that time machine I I talked to John Stamos himself you know back in the full house era and he showed me the way I'm going on how to become an actor what hmm well sir it's obviously seems like something is telling me that you've continuously used this time she didn't try and get this job however unlike your door porn directing career this might not have a happy ending so we'll get back to you a bowl of fruit please tell us about why you will be the best actor in a b-tier movie a man like whatever like I never want to really being in um because it's oh you have a nihilistic viewpoint because ultimately nobody else has loved you in the point that they would remind you of any amount of a reason to live that's really good okay please tell us why you would be a great actor no quite honestly your words being like nothing to me because I don't care about anyone's opinion because like I'm stuck in the early two-thousands and like I got like piercings everywhere black eyeliner like I'm just super emo it's like you need someone for that like like a period piece or just like someone that just like hates everything like that's me mid-2000 Zeebo core I like what I'm hearing so far sir you know like otherwise you're like feel my wrath or whatever really I don't really care but I could pretend I do cuz the only thing that does frighten me as sometimes I have night terrors of fairy dust because I hate anything nice hey not only does it look like you shop at Hot Topic it also looks like you dabble a bit in Spencer's and actually go to the backdoor section because you want people to think that you're mature enough to go back there which I also like well you've got a lot of going free you have piercings you use dark core emo sad terminology you're damaged that's good too people love that and film from being movie actors now my my problem with this however sir it seems like you're not as dark and edgy as we need you to be as a b-movie actor because it says here you're actually mad kawaii yeah I can't how do you have horrid yuku outfit on right now sir I it's a curse and that's why I hate everything and Ren's like you're so dorm I'm like shut up I'm gonna murder you it sounds to you eventually attractive but I don't want to have that privilege however it looks like you are gonna have to deal with it because as you said you love fairy dust and you're also weird Howard you qqt well that's pretty you loser that's pretty [ __ ] a whoo yeah whatever didn't like kinda go No well I mean I'm definitely gonna keep you in mind please have a seat in the back yeah sure whatever Wow we just have a really great crop of people today this is great it looks like we have a copy written character name coming in I'm for Sonic how you doing sir always hit me with the copier in character bro hey that movie just came out last year so hopefully you know that people don't forget and they're gonna absolutely relentless remind you that you are just as blue hedgehog now tell us why you'd be a great B movie actor listen I know it's not gonna sell you at first but I have a cane yeah and the cane is over here but anyways I have a cane you have a cane we like that it's a really really nice looking cane little Wow the honest I'll be like wow you guys got a really cool cane and yeah but not only do I have a cane I have scissors to head us we like that well I'll ask you more about that later but continue going so this might also help I have been viral but only once so I haven't been exactly extremely viral so you know was because of the scissors or the cane it was because of cane now why do you have the cane oh you see it's just okay the Canes used for more than uh I guess like showing off the cane I guess because uh in the end I'm actually I'm actually really [ __ ] so I use that cane for a lot of things than just showing it off if you know what I'm saying Wow um listen listen I've done a lot of research on you okay and you probably didn't think wow Hollywood b-movie actor research and well sir I've done a lot and you say you have a cane you say you have scissors and you said you've went viral and said you're [ __ ] you really just sound like an old man who was filmed giving gum jobs can you tell me about that well first of all I'm not well it looks like you have a cane and you have scissors in fact you enviro for being [ __ ] because like I said you've been billed giving a gum job I see of teeth are you wearing that got the wrong person my dear sir that well then what is that I literally I'm literate like dear you're going to town about you Barry Oh have you ever heard of Photoshop my god it could be yeah yeah yeah yeah it says in this yeah well you literally turn to the camera and say feeling dumpy no why why what is the problem like why would you do that well a very good explanation for that is now when Eli looks like we have two people attached at the hip you know you didn't respond sir so I'm just gonna will let you know if we need a good catchphrase for a gum man from Danielle or dad Oh which one of you is going to come in first Daniela's thank you sir Addington i hope you know the brutal reality of Hollywood b-movie interviews is going to be absolutely murderous to your self-confidence now please tell me why you would be a b-movie actor and why you'd be great at it well first of all I have relish nexium but they also leave a list so I eat other people because I put them in a box then I keep them then when I need to snake I eat them the ice thank you nice well the Russian accent of the Lisp implies me you've just moved to America specifically to pursue a Hollywood career however you're also a murderous individual who puts people into boxes quite honestly this sounds like a great one-shot movie that you're successful for eventually eventually develop a drug addiction because you're so successful and then eventually fall back into the background as a supporting character in a romantic comedy where you just never recover from having a terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible reputation as murdering people and also having a crack addiction now that's fantastic and all and I really like that I really love that it says however the main problem here while you have a great image it says you were the my little pony club from 2015 to 2020 which is this year it might be current why were you in the my little pony club and can you tell me if you are a brony or not so this is absolutely going to determine if you get this job or not I was not aware this club was not for actual ponies I sign up I sign up and there are no actual ponies hey there are not sir I don't know how to not be in the club anymore so I just I'll leave it and then I think they take me off the list after three years so this is why I'm sorry I hope that is okay well it really seems like he galloped your way through this interview really good stuff I mean hoof nice stuff dad oh could you please come in oh sorry took me long to get in here is not very wheelchair accessible in here you might want to consider putting in a small ramp oh yeah sure well you know as a Hollywood producer I can absolutely pretend that I care about the well-being of other people well it's a real traffic just enough to put in a ramp next time that would be absolutely sir I will send that to someone who is far more empathetic than me and PR you know how I know you're telling the truth yes sir tell me how it's because I'm a mind reader and I know that you're not going to be asked me at all and I'm that's not the right card and neither is that one it's a mind reader sir are you sir are you cosplaying Professor X er no I am NOT because as you'll see or I can probably see I am quite unimpressive and in my old age I've gotten very saggy and decrepid really really seems like you're an x-men sir no no I am NOT I'm just an old man looking for one last shot and I hope you can see that I've quite a lot of conviction as I heard you monologuing before all the applicants came in and I am very determined and I think I fits your your list of obligations quite well based off of what you said previously okay that sounds great now let's talk about why you have a great worth that get worth a quirk he's he's pink he's breaking my mind oh my god maybe he's right nevermind Oh does my botox anything sorry about that sir so anyways as I was saying it appears here that on your past job list you apparently have a great work ethic as a professor Eck's party you know you go to parties apparently you dressed up as Professor X and you give people a nice little x-men party uh now please tell me why you continue to pull up the charade because I don't think you're disabled sir I think use that wheelchair for some real IQ you really love presser excel charade look the x-men movies were very popular for a long time and when you need to make some cash you do what's available to you and I'm gonna hold man in a wheelchair whose saggy and I mean Patrick Stewart's not very saggy at all he looks quite good but you know you can't get Patrick Stewart who else you going to get yeah um thanks professor Eck's can we get Rob Evie back in this in the room please because no please ask for it professor Eck's out of the room thank you very much I can wheel myself wheelie way out of here out of this out of this business sir all right you will tell them I will noise stuff well um mr. West loads good to see you yeah I heard for a b-movie actor yeah we need someone that is just famous enough through their career well it's funny you say that well because I'm an a-list actor that accidentally said a slur back in the day and got exposed so now be acting movies are kind of like my thing so I am like you said just famous enough but not famous enough to ruin my career again really really really embracing your newfound failure I like that about you yeah I still have a they called it a critical mass failure of my career but I'm looking to kind of bring it back I um I ordered a coach and they said the one thing I'm lacking is a lot of swag so I just had to work on my swag a little bit um but I do have one question for you mr. West slow yes sir I can how can I assist you in any way shape or form why is it you wear matching underwear with your matching socks oh wow this guy's good well I'm gonna be honest with you buddy no you didn't get it because I was actually the x-ray guy from those Marvel movies that was actually what I was known for until I was cancelled the x-ray vision was my old hero name I thought you would maybe I can't I did you tell me what the Professor X guy yes okay well first of all uh not man up to man up not only does it look like you are on the downward trend you seem pretty you seemed pretty adamant about this whole x-men thing along with that dad of Luckies resurrects dude over there don't know what these have I don't know how we get these people whose interviews whatever listen buddy I would be totally honest with you here to be a b-movie actor you have to ruin your career or become just successful enough to where you just don't get anywhere and I just don't think we have the time span to really be there touching tips I don't really think you guys have the time span to be doing this considering you have six months left to live well it's because if they find me and they're gonna find me in six months and I think one more movie to send them out it is the way I want to go out so if you could do me that one favor I could die happy in six months if I could just star in your b-movie mr. Wessler anyways we're looking for people who are alive in six months thank you so much not qualified well all of you are absolutely miserable people and that's what I love about you well let's go over the people who I'm definitely not going to pick whatever the heck your name was Jason the jackhammer here sorry jack us up some good movie prices well uh we have over here mr. gumdrops and I'm gonna be honest with you I'm not feeling gummy well that leaves us with four left and well Professor X over here is gonna have to also get an X you hate to see it however I'm feeling very partial to the rut jokes just kidding the Russian dudes out - okay now you're like a weird mix of German French I mean I'm glad I rejected you that leaves us with the two stereotypical people that I'd love to see in B movies here we have an emo that is utterly Kawai it's like one of those young adult novel protagonists who are completely incapable of doing anything significant but they're good-looking enough so people fall behind them I like that about you you're white you're boring and that's what we're looking for in their demographic shark-tooth you looks like you have a time machine you really want this job right I literally talk to the young young John Stamos from the full house era not this current John Stamos with the young John Stamos had a full conversation on the reactor honestly man we've got two great options here and I'm just gonna have to really go with a guy who just does not love talking about jobs just well gee why do you keep saying John Stamos it's a guy I'll talk to man showed me the when Stamos tici tici Tommy everything timing you tell me how to have a good chin taught me how to play World of Warcraft tell me how to have a evil laugh the John Stamos from the full house era 1995 did like a get over this John thing I usually marry him anyways look I'm gonna be honest with you you're both awful individuals John Stamos thing is kind of weird but he is a great b-movie actor and for that reason we'd rather just hire him instead of you I'm sorry oh Layton's a bowl of fruit uh thanks I guess [Music]
