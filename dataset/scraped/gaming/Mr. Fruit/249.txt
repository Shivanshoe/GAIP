heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to today's video where we take a deep dive into a psychological phenomenon known as the mandela effect matt what are you doing right now make sure fruity taking your video hey whoa sue me i know it ain't it ain't a gameplay video all right hey maybe uh we can um [Music] anyway i missed you today because the mandela effect if you didn't know well actually why explain it when i could just show you the definition so it'll probably do a better job the mandela would be nice if i could spell it apparently the mandela effect occurs when a person believes that their distorted memories are in fact accurate recollections they can clearly remember events that happen differently or events that never occurred at all the bottom line is that the mandela effect does not involve lying or deception that's right i'm not a liar this actually came up if you watched it this is my moment blah i don't know why you seen that rebecca black song so much that's not a rebecca black i swear on me mum my wife does too in the greatest showman at some point in that movie during a song somebody goes this is my moment and then they go on to see i had this whole thing with rob i could have sworn is like zac efron or something we scout we rewashed it i can't find it but we both had that that thought and at the time twitch chat there were some people too like i could have sworn that was a thing we have no idea as far as i can tell it didn't exist but i'm not the only one that thinks that and apparently a lot of other people did as well it's this weird phenomenon and so i was thinking wait a second what other mandela effects are out there that you or i fall for and don't even realize because i'm thinking there's probably a good amount so when in doubt my friends buzz feed it out that is a sentence i never hope to say again and i don't entirely mean it but i looked up mandala effect quiz this one is the most recent so i don't know let's give it a shot you're not getting past question 10 on this mandela effect quiz if you're not a tv and movie expert okay hannah murder i'll be the judge of that okay uh i guess yes i really i'm not a i probably see more movies and tv shows so a lot of these might not even apply i guess if i if i don't know either way i'll just skip what's the name of this tv show sex in the city wait it's really a 50 50. like is this really a common misconception i haven't even seen it i know it's sexy what wow okay okay in my defense i haven't seen this one so i'd like to think everybody just told me sex in the city and then i went along with it that's because i can't tell if that's i think it's just from what i don't know wow okay well if that's an indication of things what is darth vader saying here okay okay okay this i should know this one luke i am your father bro bro no that's what luke i'm like my clue i'm your father are you kidding no i am your father [Music] they want the wrong one right

tell you the last time i i swear all these are pop culture's fault everybody else makes the mistake so then i i guess i'm the dumb one and just blindly believe it mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all or something like right it's not magic me wrong what is forrest saying here in the in the film forest gump i'll start you off my mama always said life is like a box of chocolates right life is like about wife was my mama always said life was like a box of junk i'm seriously starting to reconsider everything i i know my brain is turning on itself we're sitting in spider-man mean pointing at each other life is like a box of chocolates okay well on a side note i've actually been to savannah several times where this was shot and i once saw that bench when i was much younger i believe but uh on a more recent trip uh it wasn't there because they had to take it away or something because i forget why but tourists or something had to keep they kept van let me look it up vandalizing it or something the forest gump bench is no longer there it now sits in a museum since people were chipping pieces of it off probably other things i am scared to go was blue wearing a

no shaq wait i think i remember hearing about it was sinbad i remember that i remember that clip you scored better than five percent of all other quiz taggers [Music] looks like you're either from an alternate timeline or the mandela effect is real um it's very real what i can't get over this one that was that was sinbad i'm scared i'm not crazy look many people falsely remember kazam as a film titled shazam oh my god i thought it was titled shazam and starring comedian actor sinbad as a genie simbad himself has denied the existence of this film in multiple tweets he cites a sinbad the sailor movie marathon he hosted dressed as a genie as a possible explanation for the phenomenon wait are you telling me that picture doesn't exist wait brains are fickle things friends it's a good

turkey leg glove does rich uncle penny bags wear a monocle i remember this one no that's the only reason i remember this being a controversy because otherwise i would have said yes i thought uncle pennybags wore monocle for the longest time but then i because i think this was a while ago i saw this mandela effect thing and it was paired with the shazam kazam thing that's the only reason i always saw the adam monaco i couldn't tell you why maybe just because i think of rich people with monocles all the time how do you spell the name of this meat production company oscar meyer with an e
