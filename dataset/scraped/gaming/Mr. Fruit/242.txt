have to say entrepreneur because i guess that's kind of what i'm doing what's your ideal first date honestly for a first date it depends on how hard i'm trying to impress this person but i think most of my first dates have just been like dinner and something you decide to order out for dinner night what do you get oh that's not even a pizza i don't need to see the other options which really show do you feel like binge watching tonight i don't watch reality shows if someone were to call you a contradiction it would be because you're oh this is like i show up to the interview and i'm like my biggest flaw is i'm just too much of a hard worker you know innocent yet daring conservative yet sensual charming yet apathetic i'd like to think that optimistic yet secretly they had to go there huh well now i feel depressed oh wait i already am i guess i'll say that everyone has bad habits so what's yours i have a hard time letting things go i always assume the worst and i can never make up my mind but i think of all these the most egregious one i have to deal with is probably never making up my mind pick an animal any animal so you have every animal listed i don't think so so it should have been pick an animal out of the ones we've listed is there a gorilla if not what i'm immediately polar bear ape chimpanzee grill whatever they want do you see that elephant zebra no i guess if i have to i'd say eagle oh is that an eagle i need to work on that which of these words best describes you outgoing yeah compassionate determined reliable adventurous it's like between determined and compassionate i'd like to think i'm reliable but that's kind of for someone else to tell me maybe i'm not which celestial body do you feel most drawn to uh uranus nice one ah none of them your head's

so i just i want to get i want to get to know you what are your thoughts on um plastic straws answer carefully because this is a deal breaker pick a music genre jazz pick a quote oh boy be yourself everyone else is already taken be the change that you want to see in the world we accept the love we think we deserve life is what happens to us when we are making other plans hashtag relatable am i right um i guess uh yourself everyone else has already taken it yes sure someone is getting bullied what do you do join in stupid sorry you glance around hoping to make eye contact another bystander you stand next to victim in solidarity here's the thing i've never had this happen in real life and everyone wants to say like you know in a burning in a burning house there's a kid would you run in the same air but yeah yeah i would realistically almost nobody would and you wouldn't know until you find yourself in that situation well to be fair there was a point um was it i think i my brother was eighth grade and i was a freshman in high school and there was this guy bullying my brother on the bus because he was like near a stop where we were yeah i wasn't having that we got out and um yeah i i'm not a very confrontational or violent person but you mess with my family your friend we got a problem and he like punched my brother on the shoulder or something and then was like threatening further and so i came up i just grabbed his like you know the the collar of his shirt and like kind of picked him up and i said not quite as much because you know despite what movies say it ain't that easy uh but i said like if you ever mess with my brother again you're gonna have to deal with me and never never mess with my brother again so i guess that's what i do if it's a brother or a friend what is your halloween costume i don't really is there a i don't get dressed up option hey a banana why not you know i missed fruit if you were so i thought it would end at 40. your social

forgot my own sign whatever because it took so long what did they think i am they think i'm a pisces wrong i'm a virgo dude i'm imaginative compassionate and very accepting of others you're always willing to hear someone out and give them well thought practical advice see like like anyone would say like yeah that's me because yeah that's me although you can be slightly over sensitive you're extremely popular because you're just so nice i wasn't that popular on the flip side you can be indecisive self-pitying and self-destructive self-destructive's a big much always looking for a way to escape from unwanted reality sometimes your laziness can be the direct cause for your escapism yet when you have something inspiring in your life magic can truly happen see the the thing too is somebody said oh my god that's me literally they're just giving me like word-for-word things based on results like i might daydream at my job sometimes your legions can be the direct cause for your escapism wrong my element is earth so i'd be an earthbender color is gray beige and pale yellow yeah i couldn't think of worse colors you kidding day wednesday yeah i was born on a wednesday and in september that's kind of great lucky numbers 14 i was born on 14. i don't like these other ones though i think nine is my favorite number dislikes just about yeah i'm a virgo well uh that took a weird
