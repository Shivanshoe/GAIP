once you get sonic blasted once it's hard to get sounding plastic again oh yeah i'm hitting the colossi above you joey don't worry he's weak he's weak we also only have four minutes which i think is enough but yeah we got this well unless there's more to this then no then i don't know about that but more to this stop stop possible it's time to stop okay he's suppressed that's not cool dude it's 20 22 bro wait what no he's not oppressed i don't know man you do you but like all right ulting it's that easy okay pooping on him yep he's just getting absolutely dumpstered come here yeah no what's

gentlemen you'd love to see it oh you stayed alive i'm proud of you oh that's a [ __ ] barely i'm guessing there's going to be like uh do master flawless this is not gonna happen oh i got a gun let's go any exoticers 1536 a black pyramid girl i know you're pouring your heart out right now but i got a gun so if you could just like bring it down yeah jesus release a fan of three energy waves on contact with the ground yeah it's like the wave grenades except three waves and like i said it's like it's like hard light and borealis you get to choose what um type you want to use oh the wave is pretty cool it's pretty sick yeah you're missing out okay this is actually the only time you get to use it by the way so wait what yep you get it now it's deleted forever what the hell a weird mechanic for just this gun no one ever said it was the best bun just trying some new stuff out like yeah test it on the ground after the encounter for like 20 seconds grand master difficulty opens april 5th no the night okay yeah no but the the nightfall the normal nightfalls are just like your grand master yeah if we get pinnacle though we don't want to risk it mechanically we won't go over a hundred thousand dollars yeah okay i hate to say it but it might be competitive time i'm down hold on i can throw on the guns oh there's also there are dares we would just have to not get a score 250 000 or more there's grasp which we do any point but that's pencil oh that's pinnacle there's also powerful gear if we run another if we open a runic chest in another psyops battleground so you need i think 500 and i have you're the you're the leader i'll follow you wherever i have mr i have what the [ __ ] two thousand oh nice [Music] [Music] you
