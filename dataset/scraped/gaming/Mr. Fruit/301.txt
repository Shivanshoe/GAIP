here whoa where am i going damn it oh if i hit that one easy get him them there's people right behind me don't say that there's people on my building i don't know where they went i am repairing myself i don't know why you've seen that rebecca black song so much that's not a rebecca black that is rebecca black no i think i promised high schools you're like this is my mo man i promise you i promise you no ass rebecca the only rebecca black song i've ever heard is yeah it's her lesser known song called my moment i promise you i'm looking at that is rebecca look it up chat look up my moment by rebecca black and i need your slime the course goes this is my it is literally a promise oh jesus right on me go boys go where's the other one right here one went down the elevator hit him once hit him twice how about three oh above behind you dog you just dropped he just went up the raffle right here hold on yeah just buy time for well that's balls no no it's up to you i'm good i'm good i'm good i'm good okay she's i i can't find the song i'm thinking of i looked up the rebecca black one that's not it i've literally never even heard that song no i i can't the other one was some barbie song that's not it i literally don't know maybe maybe i've just like made this up maybe this is like that moment maybe this is that quote like i always thought was in a movie because the song i'm thinking of it goes like this is my moment [Music] she says the same words but it's not the same song this is exactly what you are saying in the exact tempo [Laughter] get the out of here that's that is the song you were singing and you just don't want to admit it no i i'm not even kidding you i've never heard that song before and then somehow it came into your eyes and i'm telling you i know it's not that song because there's a verse that falls in like the same cadence i'm trying to figure out rossi says i know what he's talking about i don't okay well then help me out what's the name of the song he is singing this is my moment the guy version what the does that even mean you know what is what is that like i don't i couldn't even tell you where i heard this thing like at this point that's what i'm saying that's why it might be the mandel it's not rebecca black 200 this is my moment my moment literally what you are saying right give it to me again hold on i'm listening to everything under the sun rossi says i think it's in 2k it's in what like 2k the basketball game there's no way mr free is playing anything well it's more likely i got it from that than rebecca black so someone says isn't it from the greatest showman yeah yeah yeah i think that's what update hold on this is the moment i'll be like banks i posted the whole time is this it what did you find it well there's like 20 songs from the show so give me something oh my god can we at this point it's like this itch that i cannot do anything until you figure this out because you are concerned and rightfully so i would be too that you have been singing rebecca black oh my god now i i have to even more because you're stuck in this rebecca black thing this is my moment that's what she says and like i'm not it's not that like i'm trying to be right i'm just trying to give rebecca black her due diligence you know she is a legend she is a vet we have meme songs you know duck song because of friday see this is this see this is entirely different from see like i know you're not singing barbie yeah i know i'm not singing barbie that's what i said but you are singing rebecca black oh my god it's we're just like this is my moment that's all i know it's in here somewhere someone says can't hold us someone says it can't hold us greatest showman oh this is my moment tonight is the night we'll fight is that what you're saying yeah yeah what is that oh that's can't hold it yeah you're like not even on this you're not even you're not singing that that's not even the same tempo or anything you know what this is that one's like there we go like what [Music] dude like the city can't hold us yeah yeah that one you have to play this at your wedding now wait are we free i don't know i'm listening to and it doesn't sound right oh my god but maybe you're just tone deaf you know that wouldn't surprise me okay tone deaf has nothing to do with tempo first okay maybe you just can't hear maybe that one then because i'm telling you my rebecca black song is closer than that so if that's what you're actually singing that's that's cat i think it might be exact ephron that says oh my oh the fact you think it's like a disney star it makes me even more confident that it's like rebecca black because it's because he's in the greatest showman okay well of all the options we have seen and heard i swear it's somewhere in the great show i'm about to watch the greatest showman right now just to find the moment because it's not this is the it's this is my mom yeah it says like it says like this is the moment this is my moment uh matchmaking oh my god we're in all right we okay we're ready thank god will you just admit that it's my moment by rebecca black claire's like i just listened to rebecca black this is my moment and that's what it is and now christians have an existential crisis going okay for the record wait say what you said for that i'm not crazy claire please tell me it's rebecca black i i think it's like a mandela effect thing i couldn't find it later i went through the entire my sights are said oh weird the only thing that sounds remotely like it is the rebecca black song oh please listen to it and be like oh my god this is it but you have to get to the course and it's like two minutes in and it's probably the worst song you've ever heard but you gotta power through it i've literally never heard of it before i've never heard anyone okay you don't know the lyrics though you just admitted to that so how do you know it's not that song that's my moment this is my moment my moment yeah that's not at all it wrong it doesn't go this is my moment i really want you to find it because claire literally said after we watched the movie she looked for that song too you've done this for like ever i know whenever it came out that's what i'm saying like if there must be something in that movie like that it's just it's like that mandela effect where i think that's what they say but it's something close i'm telling you i have to re-watch the movie now this is my moment from the greatest showman if it's that simple and you didn't find it i'm gonna kill you do what i don't know someone said this is my moment from the greatest showman i looked it up i couldn't find it because whenever i look for life oh that's a good i wish i could have this moment for life that's a good one for life i would have this moment that's a bear that's my first nicki minaj song go on that's a banger and then like she's like she's like in the music video she's like with samurais and it's a badass music video yeah that was like my legit like first uh nicki minaj song and i was like she's got bars okay yeah i i that's probably still to this day my favorite nikki song i do like reverse in monsters but that's not like a nicky song you know i mean that's just a oh feature where is all them fellas we got this yeah and there's only ten squats left oh right here is the answer right yep broke blue shields so weak got him thirsted nice boys let him know i'm just gonna let him know right oh fudge they're letting me know jesus oh god sweet moses i don't have a son in the bow i was about
