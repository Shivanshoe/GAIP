heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to more among us but in today's video we try out the modded community map that was that was made and i'm sure we're super late to it as i always am but it's the submerged map 99 of us had never played the new idea was going on so it's like a fresh experience which is nice so enjoy the video please don't give me an impostor first round okay all right i think i think i'm just taking on this new role of what the fudge oh upper deck went up i'm going to take the role of chaotic detective where i'm just going to sound really passionate and convinced and whatever the fudge i say i think like literally everyone start oh i can see him below oh whoa this is kind of crazy um yeah so i think i'm just going to kind of go left field here i'm probably going to throw a lot of games but either way and to be fair i think that's just kind of the way i've been playing but now i'm just labeling it what's wrong with communications what's that this is medical oh this map's gonna be crazy two floors like boner is down there uh classic uh uploading [Music] oh perfect sheesh look at me oh wow oh jesus retrieve oxygen mask get me with these put it on put it on did i get it what the what the fudge what do i have it i think i'm good okay what is this thing wait what active wait wait what oh i can like mess with the camera [Music] yo thank god i think we're gonna lose wait did i just i think i just saw so really quickly i want to let people know if you're on the top floor you can see through the glass ceiling or the glass floor yeah down below oh that's why it's really unfortunate oh that's true would you like to explain to the council what you did here today yeah that's extremely unfortunate okay because looking thing and murdered i accidentally pressed space and i didn't know there was a vent so i vented in front of sonic and then i came out in front of sonic and then i said oh sonic's going to tell them that i just vented in front of sonic thus killing sonic but i promise i'm not the impostor dude right i swear to god it's bright there's a bonus [Music] so i was gonna tell everyone about that when we made it to the first meeting but then you stabbed him right yeah like of course [Music] you have to go to the middle section grab a mask or you'll die at least i know they can i mean i'm not killing anyone i guess but at least i know what they what what is oh okay these are pants these are oh this is fun here's the lobby what wait what oh wait wait wait what the fudge oh wait i can take wait wait where's this go wait wait somebody called that wait no bring this one back what is this oh it's a camera oh yeah yeah um take me oh that's that's very neat wait oh that's the elevator up and down oh i thought that well that's not what i thought that was going to do my apologies this place is also with jesus big they weren't lying i'm looking for this thing yes uh incoming message e h7 what what the fudge do i do with this uh wait what the [ __ ] the eh s7 eat what twist it or press it or the fudge z what oh i gotta click the butt on my keyboard that makes okay on the big brain eh7 yeah i know yeah i know it's e87 oh they need me to type it no e h7 what i'm confused all right whatever i'll figure that out here okay e h7 e h what oh e h seven ah she'll be green we got we got reuben we got bryce i don't like reuben looking kind of sauce i'm looking up oh i realize i could go that far over i'm clicking um i'm pressing buttons okay i guess i have to wait a really long time okay i haven't everyone could be dead and i wouldn't know okay i have two and wait one in central no there's no way two in the lobby two in the lobby two in the lobby look for the elevator look for the elevator i'm going i'm going how do i get to the elevator okay if someone's coming up here oh fudge but i need this mask i think it's stupid okay it was below was rob below oh my god what the [ __ ] is this ah i knew it so this is awkward because i was just talking to myself i'm like i bet it's bonaire it's gotta be bonaire for sure bonaire that's how you pronounce it that's actually something that's his friends uh but yeah rob what's up uh he's in front of a door next to in front of the elevator yeah and i want to say it's dawn ketek because they're the only one downstairs so they would have killed and then elevated i did see a bruno in the cafeteria he was using the microwave that's awesome on the first or second floor i have no idea microwave i feel like it's on the first floor i don't know he was making an egg we found him on the second floor yeah he was like i could have been on the second floor for all i know we were all there as soon as we grabbed a mask and donkey dick was below us there's no physical way you could have been there to grab a mask and then get down mask really really quickly there's a mask on both floors oh okay yeah no she she's still bored it would be [ __ ] up if i had to take the elevator to go upstairs to get my ass that's what i thought i'm not taking an elevator in this game yet all right well i got nothing yeah basically what i'm hearing oh also how the [ __ ] do you open the doors you hit the corresponding key on your yeah i was i sat i don't all right yeah i got nothing uh well i was like i must be donkey dick but then i also remembered we were struggling with that door and we were in what the fudge is at research for like eight million years wait what how do i this is so confusing uh if it was robbed i guess i'm dead huh i guess i guess this is that somebody no they didn't turn this off oh it's a good thing we're down here because we can fix it how do what oh it's a shower yeah i was thinking that i was like what if rob was the one that killed this it also makes sense that he would follow me too to then be like hey whoa we just found this body and bryce doesn't see it real waited so long now they're gonna turn well he's been there since uh before the thing got finished because the doors were closed okay uh i think it was wrong literally every round i tried to get to the in where you guys were but the door shut me out so i had to wait yeah i was in the chamber with ria he's got it okay he showed up in time and he got a good alibi they're never going to get cheesy bread what happened i filled up my hydro flask in the room with the hydro flask which is on the right and then i accidentally jumped in the elevator and then i jumped in the elevator again when i saw that the sabotage was going on and then i walked down and i didn't really see many people but i'm just i listen i'm just trying to stay hydrated over here you know hydro means yeah robin's so that i can there's no way it was dawn i feel like dom would have killed me eight cause there's only four seconds left but i was scared we were going to lose this robin i don't think it's ruben yeah i really don't think i mean what do you want me to just don't arm again you just put your head in the sand yes i will say i i trust reuben from earlier in the game when we were stuck at a door that we couldn't get past and he didn't kill me and then he immediately did a task that uh he wouldn't have known it was there because i didn't know it was there either because it's ripe true i think it's bryce just because my intuition says it robin don't yeah i don't think it could have been bryce because bryce came from the top i think right yeah oh wait oh wait joey killed this oh is this it feels like this round's gone on for so long oh yeah yeah you don't have any rob i'll throw a random guess why not oh unluck response what the [ __ ] totally forgot [ __ ] up joey killed earlier you're majorly [ __ ] up okay don't take it personal this is business business it's a okay business oh okay yeah so it's just from let's see if anyone figures it out let me let me get away at the land here while uh wait is this another elevator well rob just missed it okay oh and rob i think he's killed or he's looking for people he's doing the same trick where he killed me i think he's just gonna see who's the first person to show up and then probably kill them or he's gonna use this as his long con alibi to be like yo i was here waiting how's this one gonna play out chief let's find out oh god oh god wait he just has to not do it and they lose ah they lose oh my god they lose [Applause] back to my old among us ways i see never getting imposter whatever ah you know my brain just a little tired you know i don't know if i can detect a bit right now what it what the [ __ ] okay and here we see the bottom of the ocean floor we're literally and i mean literally nothing is happening but at any moment we could see the legendary the exonerated the bodacious what the [ __ ] just thinking of different there it is look the big suck we have found it dilly dilly a beautiful basted asian date i wasn't paying attention who the [ __ ] was around here [Music] i got a question for don and shark what why me who killed sonic that was me not me someone okay may i say dude all i'm saying is that the there's a next to the mask was a dead body in the hallway in the body or watching i was next to him you're [ __ ] projecting i did it was right in front of the mask there's no way either of you didn't see it i don't know why we're arguing when it's a case closed the murderer admitted to it it's reuben yeah i mean i literally told you who it is it's me i did it i fess up he's pulling a dork don't let him do it okay i this is i didn't even see reuben near the place exactly it is gone i appreciate you guys i just [ __ ] sn i have a 50 cal on me okay that's all i'm gonna snipe this guy from across the map yo you fit this is actually under he was actually under i believe it yeah yeah he was not even on the same floor we are literally waiting for bryce to vote literally like there's so many small spaces i don't like in the world can i ever catch you at doing anything bridge and dawn or i don't know i got to go down i guess bridge and dawn bridge and dawn bridge and dawn bridge and dawn bridge and dawn there is bridge bridge is alive but what about don i don't know all right joey's there a while i believe it where's don bryce was there quick anyone see that before he grabbed it before it even like this man just knew i'm susan bryce right now brother that was awfully weird [Music] it's hondo rice i'm calling it now i got no actual evidence to back this up but i'm feeling pretty good about my baseless accusations please go down thank you [Music] next oh would you like this [Music] man can't believe bryce is the imposter dude kind of nuts okay well see he could have just done that i guess right because like that looked bad for me not but all right so i know i said i killed the last guy and i just happened to report this guy but rob dead bottom floor next to a mop the [ __ ] the the killer killed the guy and there was a mop right next to the body and he didn't decide to clean up the mess so that's a little silly on your part whoever the killer is but i have no idea who the [ __ ] could have killed him um so that's on you guys uh help me out here i just picture reuben slapping a body with a mop being like why aren't you cleaned up yet listen man like it would work it would work just like put the bucket over the dead body and then you're good but the killer didn't think of that obviously are you are you ready for this [ __ ] whale shark i'm looking into my crystal ball i'm looking into my crystal ball is anyone ready for this i'm ready i'm ready i know who it is both of them you ready i know it is two let's go on the count of three okay okay three two one bryce and dawn ah damn it okay well i agree with dawn uh but obviously not me but show me okay that's that's a bad defense right there okay so we're just voting off don yeah let's go yeah why yeah so i think it's done you were staring at the whale shark even though the whale shark was already there like and you just kept what are you talking about bro oh so you faked whale shark task [Music] flip it and ship it baby we got him thank you let's go boys halfway there let's go okay
