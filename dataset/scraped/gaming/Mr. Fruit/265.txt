heydio everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to golf game that is the symbol of my golf game is i didn't have to tell you that you could probably infer that yourself golf gang well i was bamboozled i thought it was a stand-alone game essentially just taking the golf at surf maps and and making a game out of it turns out it's it's like a hybrid of different things and at first i was like wait what's going on and then quickly we realized holy bejesus this is fun i think you guys are going to enjoy we're going to start you know baby steps we're starting on sunny suburbs it's rated beginner so um god hopes oh there's modifiers i like that sound okay yeah that's a great like i think that's a tennis racket though modifiers okay we're gonna wait on that a whole weekend there's a low gravity energized overgrown time shots rubberized bullet time jump explosive collisions right that's cursed yeah nice little overview here i love it lovely okay going with some low poly art you can't go wrong ready ready don't talk to me like this golf do i have to hit it okay i'm confused okay so you better move oh it does count strokes oh okay i feel betrayed uh we're not surfing at all hold on guys hold on we have this blue no pressure all right but see that's the challenge nice wow that's extremely generous wow you guys yeah it's a very generous yeah well they pretty much just give it to you they made it for me that's why they're like hey we made this game um maybe you won't yeah ten points oh nice let's go 11. go full start watch out for the grass [Music] come on be generous nice there we go easy get out of me wait i did three strokes in nine seconds like i want to see like what it favors i don't think the time map well i think i think it's a combo of both it's a combo of strokes and i think it's just like i don't think there's like a a mixed rating i think it's just like we're gonna judge you on the strokes and we're gonna judge you on the time i do feel very judged yeah cause dad and i tied but mine was slower oh see i got the lowest strokes and i got the second fastest knife yeah all right fine we want to go fast ah fudge it's like it didn't hit get out of my way oh you hit me okay there we go there we go yes oh you're getting old are we oh no take it over yes are you oh i was gonna say yo what oh that's so cool you can hit midair by the way oh i've been playing all i was holding it back good and then pushing forward not realizing all you have to do is rule oh no yeah you just have to release yeah i did not what get in the hole i was so distracted by the fact that i just failed everything miserably but that was third fastest so it's like it gives me the average on that i like that this is too stressful not only do i have to be good but i have to be fast i can't do both get off are you guys kidding me hello oh but is not actually bad you want to use it as a strategic yeah that ain't happening are you kidding me she makes cool noises oh oh thanks oh you freaking yeah almost no strokes let's get it slowest too sick it's what i'm here for i feel like this could use with with some golf clap sound effects yeah like really so yeah nice shot how's it yeah nice on that's infringement yeah my lawyers are gonna talk to your loyal you know i'm gonna i hope there's a modifier where um it uh just handicaps it don't worry i'm gonna get off 18 and then they're gonna tell me i had kovitz so i'm out of the [Music] tournament off the vending machine oh you're i welcome golfing games so much oh balloon oh balloon i it can't i just keep moving i can't  suck get out the oh you're welcome oh here we go oh it okay so it bounces oh it's that little skit i thought i like i like how you have to like make choices of like all right do i hit it for some extra speed but do i take the extra stroke to try to get first place in the speed but then i take less you know points in the strokes you know what's interesting is that you're playing well enough to make those i'm panicking and just doing everything and i think that's why i'm in last so i'll catch it up boys i really didn't think i could find a golf game i was working i wasn't first last oh that's it the coalition you all phoned me it's not my fault get out of there you you prone to me mr free no you you're the problem i wish you're the problem or i did what you what oh i went for it i don't know why oh i tried to oh yeah i'm a daddy i'll get over there let's go baby what yeah not gonna lie i didn't know there was a ghostbuster oh through that was a good corner shark what are you trying to do put a wall there dude yeah bro trying to get my shiny noodle paul starcraft my anus go oh that's that's good to watch this lane advantage oh wait um if i if i just turned off collision i'd be fragging i tell you what oh nice boost not oh my god oh that was raw yo somebody stop stop stop stop stop no come on no all right i got your second oh not today oh but damn got less less strokes but he got fourth in time so i did make some time i did make some time there i did i'm literally getting last in like everything oh boy this has a perfect start spinning off of me bouncing backwards excuse me oh nice nice nice catch me in the hole yes first in both or maybe not wait what how did you guys get less stroke oh huge bounce give me that rob you just wrote that out that's incredible yeah i just wrote it out you said first instruction uh you beat me in time so i was like maybe i can get first in strokes you can't i've never i've never won a hole you couldn't just let me have this nice oh thank you oh my god i love you guys yeah i'm just going to hang in the back seat choked thread it five oh no way ns rob could have just taken my time but you know knock right in oh i blocked shark right at the end there nearly there we all got like this but you did get first stroke though shark so that's nice yeah very nice a lot of people time for a second okay it seems like if people tie you might not get as many points because like my second place was in red if you could start me it's your fault you are the problem you are you are the you are the issue that you were like oh i'm so ballsy i tried it and it did not oh this is why i have trust issues i'm just going to ride and get out of here on that time right there dude i can't do anything and duly noted i don't know but next time i play this game i'm playing by myself so i can feel good about myself but i'm killing it right now but then i looked at the score hey i have been warming up with ocarina of randomizer so it could be that i'm not even remotely rob's catching up there we go hey how do you eat development baby another golf game and another game start oh i cut him off another golf game that datto is just oh  sorry
