it's that simple i'm so oh jesus christ okay yeah now is not the time ah that's a little i mean hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video if you didn't already watch it yesterday no not yesterday well i don't know when you're what it's not boring couple hours ago i think hopefully maybe i'm not sure you saw me and blue and joey do the brand new exotic mission out of act vox obscura yes of course and it was pretty great and most importantly we got the brand new exotic grenade launcher so we're going to be taking a look at that today it's the dead messenger an exotic breech loading grenade launcher it has quick launch high velocity rounds short action stock its intrinsic trait trinary vision one shot handheld grenade launcher projectiles release a fan of three energy waves on contact with the ground so it is a wave based grenade launcher however you get three waves so it's easier to hit people more people do more damage and then it's essentially the hard way or borealis grenade launcher the fundamentals press it to change this weapon's damage type cycling between solar arc and void there's also some ornament for it i have no idea what it looks like because it's it's not loading for me i don't know if it looks cool but frankly i this already looks cool to me so who cares right but i have an idea one moment ignore the stupid tool tip at the bottom that will just never go away she's like get off my screen okay it's not going to get off my screen point is look at this we got a firing range isn't this fun you can like you can shoot these things for uh damage things or something why does that one crit oh so you can see does this one crit at that range oh that's cool anyway not the point you essentially have infinite ammo here so let me go ahead and show you what it looks like look at that best of all give it a second arc solar void shields it's that simple it sounds good it looks good and i'm all about it so now i bring this death upon my enemies in the crucible it's also a really cool sight i don't know if um okay a little too much again i haven't really theory crafted what you would want to run with it like any other wave grenade launcher i don't think there's any way to one-shot somebody with it unless you get a direct hit it falls and the wave hits them maybe still just using this because it's fun and uh i like the the healing i know it's probably something else i don't know check it out though oh i think it looks really cool i do and since i'm already a solar class why not switch to the solar wave part of it not that i think that'll really do anything but oh this is gonna hurt it did it did hurt boost there's the wave oh it's that easy it's so easy to not oh wait actually how did he live hello am i you spin me right round baby ride round get me out of here oh god i'm almost dead okay but the best part too is every time i get critically wounded i just get tons of free oh my god oh how did that not hit him grenade and melee energy so yeah i'm all about it boom boom that's what am i doing that's all there is to it hand cannon boom do what the do with the wave grenade launcher guess what way easier to pull it off why why do i keep peeking great great questions i don't have answers boosh it's it's just it's that simple what do you the titan burger is just so wonky when it comes to melees man it's nothing ever seems to work the way you would want it oh i wanted that ammo but i'll allow it ooh thank you for the kill i will take that and we're going oh nice wave he's one shot we didn't damage them really oh the eos luna is too crispy but wait that's not the the grenade launcher dead witness that's what it's called right dead dread with dead messenger that's it yeah i know i know but what do you want from me okay i'm doing the best i can with with the things that i've been given again none of those were grenade kills yeah yeah you're right and everyone else is taking the energy ammo from the kills that i've worked for also true also true i'm dead i heard it i just heard the jump and i knew it the rules to succeed are simple shoot at the ground shoot one more time and in some cases twice profit boom clean up other kills get your own do whatever you want man why do you believe this i'd rain death from above and we we ended up doing damage it's so simple you won't believe these three simple tricks guardians started using to dominate in the crucible all right okay yeah uh oh i'm stuck in a corner and box of my own emotions yeah oh come on guys now i'm wasting ammo for that oh no we're no we're not not on my watch let me at least get a freaking boost moose moose moose moose and skadoosh i don't freaking know defeat opponents with super final blows sure solar damage see it's so easy if there's one arc damage boom just change the energy you know the typing when i start a match top of the team i mean what else do you need to know the dead messenger so easy a titan can use it haha that's so funny because i'm playing into class stereotypes and ooh titans are dumb we eat crayons punch punch punch they're not wrong we are joining the game in progress good time to turn the tides with the dead messenger oh my god it's so easy why was he so what he banked that off like three things my i don't even know if i think i'm more impressed than anything oh my god that's incredible look at the wave that's optimal boom gonna send it in there boom gonna wave in it's it's punch him me pop me punch me die okay well there's the wave kill is it it was he weakened i don't know it just did two for a crit which is why why can't why i'm confused i don't know like i don't think like hitting that oh again the thing that makes the least amount of sense to me is throwing me into a game in progress with absolutely no super energy what's that all about i don't need a full super but give me something to have somewhat of a chance because like that like oh you have no bomb oh let's look at how close i am to my soup oh not even remotely close that's right oh yeah okay sir now is not the time check this out ready ready where did you come from actually wait a second now you said it'd be super easy there is a bit of a skill gap i guess yeah i guess there is oh which is okay yeah i don't make it up oh my god and see how the tides have turned since i've arrived that's by no chance my friends that's no mistake that is the energy grenade just throw the dead messenger into a game it doesn't matter whether it pve pvp evp you know some gambit something it doesn't matter [ __ ] it it'll file taxes practically man like what can't it do but actually i don't know why okay i kind of wish i had um ammo or something there's just i know what to do here i don't i don't have be real nice wait wait wait wait wait get pooped up now i'm not sure how the wave did not hit him but that's okay results may vary but you know what result won't utter domination that look at that i'm pissed if i'm him i'm like how the fudge did i just die he didn't hit me with a precision well i mean the pistol did but like i was i was alive one second i'm dead the next how does that work hold on not everybody knows that oh god nice i don't know whose is whose right now i'll be honest chief skirt i don't know how oh i swear i threw that hammer straight at him but dude this helmet is so way go and that there is a bit of a pun there purposefully yes oh check this out ready if i swap to solar i'll do a little bit more damage against this super and we killed him oh but you know oh wait a second yeah what am i thinking you know what probably good here lying ramparts that would be good just flying around everywhere literal ac 130 dropping bombs down on people where are you sassy rascals there we go see that i i was pausing momentarily because there's not much i could do when he was in here with this but it doesn't matter here we are we're capturing this don't let me die please nice you're dead ooh maybe too much sauce frankly come on try me you're dead i'm different yeah i'm different i'm just gonna sit here nobody see me please yeah see there's the problem i get the kill but if they see me it is yeah it's momentum control so it's just bop when done practically too slow you got the kill here but you took the ammo can i hurt myself with this thing probably you're dead who's next i don't know calculate a trajectory you don't see that every day do you folks prenate that i'm insane didn't kill anyone don't need to because i got the bounty more objective play absolutely not could couldn't couldn't catch me dead trying no i have to reload [ __ ] slide shot man i'm telling you i have two grenade launcher loaders here i know you got no way yeah something look at that skill intensive at it's fine i don't know how i didn't i don't know what's how no one's really hold on hold on can i hold that i'm reloading this is embarrassing i don't know how oh oh the little ricochet and see with the three diverging paths it's just so easy okay we're good i think you want to know why i know that okay i was about to pop a super probably good thing i didn't 100 gotten shut down right there but uh oh wait for some reason i thought it was shields actually fight pop hammers i might have been okay oh kill for a kill a soul for so i'm chasing this guy so hard guys i'm here guys you gotta give me a shot man oh how come all the time i i i'm never on time to anything i'm supposed to be you sure i could that'll give me a kill freaking stupid grenade you got me but like i was like i know someone might be here uh kill cool yeah i mean i'll take it there's a kill too you know we're going solar here you want invisible yeah i keep dying but like what it's so wet you know it's momentum you're going to die at me hello oh we missed oh okay that was just embarrassing all around for all parties involved frankly you me him almost two almost two yeah with the way it branches out it's possible nice capture i'm so oh jesus christ that was nice well worked oh that's a triple eight million kills lingers forever it doesn't make sense man okay well yeah i don't really know where the wave supposed to go on that one okay and then how did that ah that's a little i mean i'm gonna call ref for that one that one was not okay come on that double two quick ones i'm like a bird i wanna fly away how did that not how did that thing that's the thing you gotta make sure wherever the waves gonna be it's gonna be where they're walking there's not a lot of leeway on that you know it goes forward obviously so sometimes they're a little to the side they're all behind that's all it takes you're gonna miss nice nice barrier bro it ain't gonna help you against this sauce brother now obviously yeah momentum control you can make just about anything look good in there but the point is even in the regular pvp games it's the wave come on i went the whole video without making that joke give it to me but i i feel like i don't have to show off his pve capabilities if you ever use the wave grenade launcher you know what to expect except you can hit even more things do more damage and best of all match game whatever shield you're up against whatever you want boom switch to it i'm a big fan get the dead messenger today and go watch the other video if you have another mission it was fun okay love you bye [Music] [Music] foreign
