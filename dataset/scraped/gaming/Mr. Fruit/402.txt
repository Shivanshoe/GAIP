hey hope you won my name is mr fruit and welcome back to our sunday series we didn't have a name for it before but i've narrowed it down to two or three i guess from these i might just do a twitter poll i don't know we'll go from there we have the spun day series because spin sun spun day you guys get it then we have sundays are good for ellipses because it's like sundays are good for you know that's kind of the premise there plus it have an interesting acronym or days are good for we could combine the spawn day with that ones bunnies so we have spun day series sundays are good for spun days are good for one of those you guys let me know but either way it begins this is our second episode but our first real one if you really want to think about it and to start these off i'm going to start with a fan mail because we've received a good bit and i don't know i put it a couple times up on there but like if we don't land on it at all this episode i wouldn't open any uh and then i would never get through these and quite frankly i want to open some of these so let's start off with that and then we get to the spinning or you know i could just uh by the way i know it's like super scuffed and i'm gonna figure out the auto focuses i'll figure this out together but uh whoa fan mail you can't see the pointer but just know whatever's at the top do my best okay wow fair mail great let's start with that by the way recently got my boys drip got my boy daddle song you guys don't know daddo he's a great guy he's beautiful he's wonderful he's kind he's loving endearing his hugs are like liquid gold got his dope new sweatshirt it's like multicolored this one's embroidered we got some like synthwave data going on here uh i guess this isn't a plug because these are no longer available they weren't available they haven't been available for like a month but you know i just you know gotta gotta lift up and support my dudes you know i think he's doing great stuff he wanted to kill the merch game and quite frankly i think he's doing so so let's open this one okay this one i will hold because it's actually addressed to olive fruit so i have dogs up on there so if we land on it i guess this is what we'll do for the dogs i'll um i'll open this for them another letter addressed all the napa starting to think there people like them more than me no i know people liked him more than me and i don't blame you you have here uh i don't know what it is but it's heavy um they they paid for priority it's eight pounds i think they shipped me a cinder block um i did not get a letter opener i should put that on the wheel huh i just use my giant katana but that's just asking for me to be injured so all right what do we have in box number cut away mr fruit cut away all right scissors are closed and put away you know i should get safety scissors like you get in uh preschool okay and the package contains oh oh no [Music] you guys don't know what this is but i do hold on i'll read the letter no okay i can't i'm gonna pull these out first look at this pokemon adventures one collector's edition i don't even know that was a thing you guys might be confused like what in the world so actually my most recent nuzlocke on my second channel i have way too many channels i was doing a let's play on pokemon y but i was talking about how i remember as a kid there being these like pokemon manga where the trainer had like a poliwhirl um and you could like see the pokemon the pokeballs and it was like darker and like pokemon died or whatever and somebody mentioned like oh yeah it's pokemon adventures like oh my gosh yeah so apparently somebody heard that and was like i'll get him all for him and now i haven't because i've i only ever ever read this one i believe or maybe this one either way we got pokemon adventures one pokemon vintage two collectors edition because it contains volumes four five and six cause that mind you like this is thick but it doesn't stop there ladies and gentlemen we got pokemon adventures three but it doesn't stop there we got pokemon adventures five holy heckers and it was out of order that makes sense pokemon adventures four i definitely didn't get to any johto stuff so that's dope i don't know maybe these are all there are it went up to five but looks like i got a bitter reading to do mr fruit merrily christmas i've been so blessed to have found your chance along you truly made me a fan of everything you do i hope to see many more use of content clothing and maybe even a video game or two trust me i would like to i had the money like so many others your content has been there for me when i've been down or when i need a good laugh you channel such a light to me i hope you enjoyed these books and please keep making content also i know you asked so you can share this gift you decide to this is from chris christengio or benjamin thomas thank you very much i read the little post script as well i do appreciate it and if an opportunity arises i will let you know but needless to say dude um thank you look at all this i've got a lot of pokemon manga to catch up on oh god because i remember like everybody talking about it and one of these an arbok straight up gets sliced in half and it's like killed crazy people like that happens in pokemon yeah dude that's what i'm saying dude these are sick like that the anime should be based off this stuff like more anime than cartoony and well it is geared towards children that's the thing but they should make like a more adult pokemon i think they'll be sick but anyways this is wow thank you so much i'm so excited now for the moment we've all been waiting for it's time to spend that wheel or um we need we need like a phrase like spend the content or if we make the name i can always just say sundays are good for and then it's been the thing and you'll notice i i did put the corgi uh astronaut thing on uh one thing i think it's it's kind of hard to see but i like it and maybe get a separate camera i don't know i'm like yelling right now so this is very strange anyway sundays are good [Applause] it's literally stuck in but not google and it's not docs what a way to start why is that even how is that even possible i don't know i also forgot to add one thing gotta add giveaway if i do right here sundays are good for [Applause] well we ended on fan mail we'll do something else first so it's not fan mail back to fan mail but i'll get to this this is just scuffed isn't it the only way to do it [Applause] it's baby it's time for cooking with mr fruit i know you all by the way mike's gonna suck my bad you've all wanted to see me cook what i get up to and i gotta tell you it's pretty insane and i figured i would show you my world famous breakfast smoothie because if you've all heard about it i would have been drinking this every morning for like a year mainly because i'm a creature of habit however it fits into my mind my micros are massive so i could have like a regular cooking channel and be like overhead and be like one scoop of this we're not that professional let's be honest uh so you need milk it doesn't matter what kind of milk you use all the milk you use soy milk you use one percent milk fat free i use low fat because i'm watching my weight uh you're gonna want a measurer because you need to measure that and then cinnamon sugar-free syrup because it has like no calories it's just for flavor you're gonna want some chopped alimons i don't like nuts but it's all right you don't get the texture you get the protein you're gonna want some it's like 100 just whole grain oats you don't want anything crazy or flavored and then you're gonna want protein powder which people have always asked what protein powder do i use hey not sponsored by the way but feel free to sponsor me it's optimum nutrition's bro complete 40 vanilla ice cream you can't go wrong but that's what i use it comes with a whole bunch of branched chain amino acids and all this kind of other stuff anyway it's great that's what i used and then i have the nutribullet but you can use the magic bullet any smoothie blender thing ever and that's essentially it i need to let me walk you through this it's a very specific science get your milk get a cup measure out a cup more or less boom now you want a half a cup measure a half a cup more or less boom milk done if you're lactose intolerant i'm sorry how could i forget you also need a banana and you don't want ripe bananas because they make the consistency really gross and thick and then you try and chug it down you want like not quite ripe but also not quite moldy or whatever rotten best of all the puppies love the bananas so i give them the butts [Music] that's your favorite part of the day then you just take a rusty banana sugar-free syrup super specific that seems good cinnamon pop it open yep why not oops you're gonna want half a cup you could do a full cup but just too much for me you do half a cup get you some good fiber some good grain some good carbs get your protein powder whatever is one serving for me it's two scoops of this then you want your chopped almonds supposed to get like a tablespoon whatever seems good wow you did it i'm so proud of you all i do is skirt skirt and then blend and i won't include this because the auto will be different beautiful isn't it and then from here you can pour it into something or you could just be mr fruit and why go the extra step and do more dishes just chug this sucker so after that phenomenal display of cooking we are moving on to another fan mail opening i honestly didn't even think we'd land on it and of course it's the first thing we spend and i'm gonna be honest i i really appreciate whoever wrapped this because it looks like how i would wrap something whether or not you think that's a good or a bad thing you know i'll leave that up to you it's not a good thing i'm thinking of maybe like sitting at the table having a separate camera for the wheel i don't know figure out something but that way you can also see more what's going on um again we're just doing this live and who knows like if you guys enjoy some stuff we'll make this a long form series so it can only improve as time goes this is this is all just proof of concept currently so bear with me i'll hold it up for you give you some gift wrapping asmr yeah surprises it's just another box well funny story that's not really funny while opening some fan mail um i guess a button was pressed or something and it stopped recording unbeknownst to me and you missed a lot so i'm just gonna have to redo some of them you'll notice there is now a blank spot that's because we landed on wife and she was not happy about that and sleeping in the doghouse tonight buzz but in the uh the fan mail we got we got another big old box here a little bit lighter though and in it we got a bowl of fruit quite literally it's really a bowl fruit the second time i've gotten this people just love it i got a pear ornament which is actually sick unfortunately we just packed up all the holiday stuff and we got an orange ornament that'll be putting up on the tree next year i reckon we got everyone's favorite groceries you got um i don't still don't know what that purple thing is i think it's supposed to be grapes but it's kind of terrifying i think that's a pepper or a cherry or an apple we got butter lettuce croissant drumstick pineapple everybody's normal grocery list and then a glot and i mean a lot of printed pictures of fruit so and it's addressed time is fruit just sending some fruit surprises your way sincerely sean alfano uh ps was supposed to send this to you a year ago but forgot happy holidays keep up the good work but the funny thing is his mom included the note and said it was actually supposed to be sent about two to three years ago so it doesn't matter when it comes though i do appreciate it very much thank you for the fruit it's very canon that is cannon in the war so one of the worst part too is i have pepper up there and we landed on pepper and i ate a jalapeno pepper fresh raw jalapeno pepper and quite frankly i'm not going to do it again scout's honor if we land on it again i'll do it but if we don't i'm not gonna do it because you didn't see it you know what i'm saying and we just landed on google but you didn't see me spend that either so screw me monday again look at the hiccups from the pepper oh lord fan mail again seems a little rigged it's only on there twice okay some people had some suggestions i mean this could be a weekly thing if we want but as some of you know i take my fitness seriously i work at all the time i die blah blah and i have a home gym now because of the pandemic i have now for almost a year and so i figured i'll show you around that in today's video i have like i put up like a picture of it on my twitter but i'll give you a quick little tour in this video and then the future ones if you guys want i can show workouts or maybe tips and tricks or i don't know enjoy my home gym welcome to my home gym in my garage might be like while you're away from home garage it's a tandem garage so this is just the extra part most importantly i had to get this uh well space here because this ball is cold colorado middle of the winter i didn't think it would be that bad i even insulated these yeah no it's bad so uh i got all this stuff around march from quarantine just started to begin which is lucky because then everything started getting sold out and i had a lot of stuff on sale i got this half rack platform uh the combo was like 50 off on amazon when i got it uh it's dope because it's all in one it's not a cage so you have the freedom to come out and do like deadlifts or whatever you want platforms nice to make it more steady uh you got all different pull-ups and uh chin-ups and all different variations you could possibly want uh the weights getting it separately in the barbell but this alone is i had this for the first like six or seven months pretty much exclusively by itself and you can still do almost everything you want to do even there's like little bars you can slide in here to do like uh dips and all that kind of good stuff but that was the most important inclusion and then i had the adjustable bench the whole time but most recently uh i got this edition which is very nice i like it a lot it's the cable machine i got this about a month and a half ago setup was terrible and if the cables ever messed up i don't know what else i'm going to do because i'm not taking that thing apart again but this is really nice because then combined with the free weights and everything i can do on that as well as the dumbbells there's like literally almost no workout i can't do unless it is only achievable by like a machine and even then i can kind of improvise uh so this is what i've been working on for the past new year um there's this cool thing my dad actually got these for christmas they're pretty cheap they're called the kettle grip this is nice because instead of needing separate kettlebells you just take this apart put a dumbbell in there and then latch it together and then you have a kettlebell grip and you can use any dumbbell so it's a lot easier than having to get those separate so that's a little home gym hack or whatever if you need it uh then we got some resistance bands mats liking my physical therapy stretches warm-ups warm downs and then of course mom boy ultra instinct goku by the way that was a pain to put on it's like a giant sticker and then i have a whole bunch more posters i'm supposed to be putting up i have like 20 or 30 different motivational ones the first one i had to get of course my boy so i can always look at him and feel inferior but as stupid as motivational poses are they also kind of help and also it's so bearing and then i did get these mirrors too off amazon and that's been a big help uh yeah overall i just jumped on a lot of this stuff early got a lot of it on sale which helped and all i can say is people like oh it's not working you're just gonna be back in the gym eventually well now if i ever need to work out at home i can deny everything and then on top of that just for my mental health in physical health for the past year this has been huge and to me it was completely worth the investment but at the end of the day anything can help even just dumbbells you can do a whole bunch of dumbbells uh look at that that's my home gym who doesn't love some genuine good time building testosterone and the human and the bopping and all right i did not think this was gonna happen but this was a highly requested wheel option so context uh they want me to order from applebee's and try the food because applebee's is a meme across the channel and fun fact i've actually never eaten anything from applebee's ever but now i'm going to while i'm on a diet i'm only going to try little little bits here and there it's early in the morning currently so i guess i'm going to wait until later into the day around lunchtime i guess going gonna order me some applebee's see what all the hype's about maybe we'll get the two for 22. ladies and gentlemen i have fast forwarded in time it was like a video game i said you know set time to lunch time here we are and wouldn't you know it right we got ourselves some applebee's after all this meme i got it for the first time now i'll tell you i did get the two for 22 which is odd because once upon a time it was two for 20 then inflation two for 22 except then it says varying prices for your region and for me it was a 2 for 25.99 kind of feel cheated but it is a good amount of food you get one appetizer two entrees and apparently my wife added fries as a side so we've got ourselves some fries to try these are critical they're not good you know that that's a that's a big hit fiesta lime chicken gonna be honest i didn't even know what i was getting myself into i just know that i've heard of this so i was like well i guess i'll give it a shot it looks interesting i still don't know what exactly i'm looking at here but i'll give it a shot our appetizer of choice was the buffalo wings people seem to like them and on top of that i'm gonna be comparing them to chili's um boneless wings because i really like chili's bungalow swings so we'll see how it stacks up and the wife appears to have gotten some sort of a cheeseburger the cheese part is gross but um so it seems like a pretty regular hamburger i'll give that a shot as well you're ready for a little mukbang all right first up on the docket we have ourselves the boneless wings all right here we have one uncoated additional you know i like i got additional sauce but i haven't coated it this is as default there's going to be some pretty dry ones lacking a little bit of sauce i'm not gonna lie chili's doesn't too so it's not a big surprise they're completely hit or miss okay so far not bad dallas is pretty mild not really spicy but breading's not too crunchy for delivery it's still pretty warm i'll give him that chicken's pretty juicy now the best bonus swings i've ever had but also i don't regret now i'm going to take the extra sauce in a wing give it a little extra dipper oni we got sauce on sauce not bad i think i prefer the sauce of chilies but i would almost say the boneless wings here seem like for the most part there's more chicken than breading at some points i don't know overall i think this is what this was a good batch of wings i might just finish those after this video even though it is not none of this is a part of my diet well then next up we have the french fries they are your typical french fry i mean it's nothing crazy uh looks covered in a bit of salt pepper nothing crazy not too crunchy but not chewy it treads that middle ground you know i'd relate them very closely to like wendy's fries and they taste a little bit different it must be the seasoning i would try them with ketchup too but at that point i'm just tasting ketchup so i'll go fries aren't bad i don't know if they do like loaded fries or something this chili's loaded fries about give me a heart attack and you know i'm gonna clog up all my arteries but delicious i don't know if they have that but the regular fries sure yeah i'm down next up i guess i'll do the burger first because my wife's waiting to eat now i don't know if she changed anything about this i'm not sure she did but here you go looks like we got your basic patty cheese onions tomato lettuce maybe some under the lettuce nope appears to be buttered bun the uh the edge of the bun a little bit burnt but not on the inside that's that's always a good sign the patty is pretty thick um only problem is i don't like onions or cheese so i'll let her put those back on so the patties cooked well i'll give them that buns not bad i'd like to be a little a little toasted a little bit more i kind of like my burgers burger buns at least have a little bit of crunch um the thing is it's just kind of bland there's no sauce on it it only came with ketchup and that didn't even cut i think it's for the fries it didn't even come in this burgers packaging or whatever i don't know if she took sauce off i don't think she did but there's there's no sauce and as far as i can tell that's why i had to take a second bite because honestly the meat didn't have a distinct taste could just be this burger could be the fact that there's no sauce all right let me go give this to my wife so she doesn't get angry after further evaluation i can't tell if that was some sort of butter it felt more like grease slash oil on that burger which is bizarre it's all over the bun but who knows maybe she'll like it and then last up we have the fiesta lime chicken guys let's see what that see i can't tell it almost seems like there's like tortilla chips behind it and there appears to be some kind of a sauce i mean i obviously see cheese but there's something else there and these are definitely like tiny little tortilla chip shreddings below it you know i'll eat it genuinely i'll squeeze the lime squeeze that all over the top you've ever used one of these you know the pain i'm about to go through will not be easy all right our first bite we got some chicken little tortilla strip some rice pico on it chicken seems to be cooked well a lot of flavor a little tortilla chip is subtle but noticeable a little crunch kind of hitch in waves you taste the rice a little bit more later on but initially just whatever it's marinated in this is pretty good i have no idea how bad this is for meal could not be good it's chicken but chicken's cooked well though easy to chew might be a little dry but there's so much going on you couldn't even tell i think that about does it now quickly i'm going to google how many calories this festival and chicken thing has because i'm scared to figure it out 110 calories put that in perspective that's about what three-fifths of what i'm allowed to eat the entire day but i mean to be fair if you're eating out or whatever i mean that's probably a bit on par i mean i didn't expect to eat here with healthy food or whatever but the chicken's good the chicken's good the buffalo wings i'd eat them not my favorite but they're not bad and the burger yeah i wouldn't really order the burger again just up to me but there you have it ladies and gentlemen the meme is dead i can officially say i've eaten at applebee's and i got the two for 22. and not that bad not that bad pleasantly surprised who knows about the rest of the menu but not terrible i'm already getting gassy oh and also quick disclaimer a lot of people had some good ideas but don't quite like some people are like um do a series or do a video like this the point is i'm able to do whatever it is in this video you know like it's something doable right now not like long form or like start a new let's play you know something like that does that make sense and it doesn't have to be challenges like i i think i literally maybe i forgot to i put up like brown somebody's like i should just do that you know so anyway mike i need a livelier mic man well screw me huh looks like i gotta go outside my eyes yeah i mean graphics are a little better than i remember but yeah player progression sucks i'm going back inside okay we landed on fan mail earlier but i didn't want to just be female back to back so i'm going to do that fan mail now do the part where i i spawn fan mail so they know look at the hiccups from this the pepper oh lord fan mail again i think packages make for the most interesting but we do have a lot of letters i can also open so this one is um priority mail today thank you very much i'm i'm so glad you think i'm worth a two day shipping everybody says wow you guys look at that this is the package i thought i took away the paper and i was like wow it's literally just a piece of paper but then i realized there's another cardboard box below it it blended in for a second hey miss fruit happy new year hope you had a great christmas as well i've been watching since the beginning of the dream team i remember looking up a video with thorn and found your trials but using hawkman how's the hawkmoon rob been addicted to watching listening ggee easy while i played dead city or did you talk about ghosts of sushma on a podcast so i haven't played the game or got in time to watch a video about the game i got a chance to buy a limited edition ghost of sushima soundtrack vinyl to resell i resell sneakers and decide to buy an extra give you now i doubt you have a record boy since you're not a boomer but this could make some great walleye for your tavern or even to put on the mantel feel free to show these off on stream podcaster video okay well it's a good thing i i should probably read that first huh thank you from marcus winters his twitter at or instagram at one of those is vii winters thank you very much i hope that shoe reselling game is going well i know some people in that thing and it it's a crazy world out there it's a hustle i know that but check this out the funny thing too is i actually go to sleep to the soundtrack quite often because it's that good oh look at it unknowingly you absolutely killed this dude i couldn't be happier right now this is i'm literally going to get a vinyl record so i can play this i don't just want to hang it up can't wait to listen i guess i know what i got to order next thank you very much marcus that is thick i need when i'm sitting down it's less dramatic i gotta oh this was a highly requested one everybody wanted this they wanted some loving from the dogs give me a second first i said i would open this package addressed to them [Music] looks like we got some treats i can't say too loud otherwise i'm gonna freak out bocce's bakery crispies peanut butter and blueberry recipe three calories per treat that's pretty good happy holidays all of and enjoy ps mr fruit gets none because he doesn't make you your own channel let alone put you in enough videos from kejon washington moore thank you very much didn't include oppa though which is old mean but it should be fair uh i still haven't even done a dedicated video to oppa i did when we got all of the was a problem child that's a whole other story um so maybe i will eventually but you'll get to see him in a second if you haven't seen oppa anyway we do have two corgis now so i will split these but i'll forget a little bit more don't worry looks like forbidden looks like forbidden captain crunch or something here we have dog number one oppa our tri-colored corgi he's a troublemaker country oh oh yeah oh he loves the blueberry hi buddy here we have olive hello she wants a treat she loves her food but girl she's a little chunkier and those were my little poopies i love them and with that i think that will conclude our first really official entry into the spun day series uh sunday's good for spun days good for series whatever we're gonna call it again i'll probably do a twitter poll so if you don't already follow me at mrfruity twitter if you want to give me the normal mr fruit at any point that'd be great it's been deactive for like super long time but whatever you know it's whatever i don't care uh so thank you very much for watching thanks to everybody for the fan mail for sending it if you want to send some fan mail to possibly be opened um there's a description or in the description rather is my p.o box and with that let me know what you guys think on the series and more importantly feel free to include some suggestions for the next one or future wheels i might even do a twitter post for that too to have it be a little more concise or all in one place doesn't really matter though let me know what you guys think love the feedback but most importantly i love you all with this setup thank you all much for watching have yourself a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] my
