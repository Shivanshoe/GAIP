heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. those are some words you haven't heard a while but yes it is i i would normally introduce you with my destiny character wouldn't break your immersion however for the sake of this video i just had to show this my neck is currently messed up i don't know what what's going on but it hurts a lot so i have to put a heating pad on my neck but the only way to make it stay there is to it's currently tied behind my back and up through my armpit i'm in the chokehold so i'm trying to make some johns just in case these pvp matches go poorly i'm literally handicapped so just just putting that out there because [ __ ] boom beard barrel it's been a little while hasn't that yeah i got to go to the tower because we often going to play pvp might as well grab some bounties while we're there in today's video we're going to be uh what's up guys am i the only one you know when you have something flashing like you have to you have to get rid of it you can't just let it stay there like come on now yeah i know i guess um i'll use this new stasis hand cannon looks pretty cool it's got shoot dilute just which is kind of neat yo rahul what you got for me homie garbage thanks oh wait and it's an old meme but it checks out i might as well get my old armor that actually will help me somewhat in pvp yeah she's a little old but she is sexy isn't she actually doesn't seem to give me that greatest ah whatever dude who cares anyway brand new exotic the lorenz driver the laurence draven that's how i want to say i know it sounds like some french formula one car look at this thing it's a hodgepodge of something i tell you what this weapon marks targets with an automated targeting system that reminds me drama yeah so apparently people are calling for nerfs because rightfully so as i'll mention in this perk you don't even need to have this gun out and it's it's giving people wall hacks and pvp and uh yeah obviously people aren't too uh happy about that so yeah just some drama final blows on a mark target generate a telemetry pattern picking up telemetry patterns grants monstability energy collecting three without dying grants this weapon bone stamps for a long duration and then anomaly a precision final blow this weapon creates an implosion that pulls in nearby targets and damages them with an additional detonation which sounds sick i don't know if it actually happens in pvp i mean i'm sure it does but i'm sure it's probably hard to pull off and then freaking other perks oh oh what are we doing doing it we'll just do control let's not get fancy with it but yeah let's talk destiny i am a man who can't play a video game longer than like one hour to two max i'm always swapping between games so it's not destiny's fault nothing just holds my interest and destiny is is a game i'm always gonna come back to here and there i'm just probably gonna never gonna be like that no life grinder um or if i do it's just in spurts okay but yeah fragment uh i've played this map well why is that dude outlined wait this is new whoa that's cool wait what is this okay i don't know what that is wait oh well i can like whoa

glory yeah that was casual yeah yeah yeah okay got a little distracted there my bad take it from the top okay but now friend or foe i will fight for my team i cannot guarantee victory but i can guarantee my sword in the world that i complete quest i should have looked at what they were okay it's game time this is so cool though when did they add this oh that is what is that armor right there that dude looking like he's ready to climb mount everest and i love it i'm here for it oh this is actually a pretty good map for us and again totally forgot to put on linear fusion rifle friggin perks to get more ammo we gotta kill wait how did i how did i kill him i no you're like you're bullying no me how did i should zone be you i body shot him i don't think he was weak oh wait oh my god wait his name was there oh my just 2272 damage chief that's a lot of damage holy thank you for your wait what are we playing why don't i have a radar shouldn't there be a radar oh doesn't everything do more damage oh my god i'm so stupid i'm so stupid i choose this and then i'm like surprised when i'm just like like what is wrong with me i don't know he did and then you did oh and i guess you just get your health i really should read what this this mode does apparently you get super super quick okay i'm just kind of out here a fragging i'm not i'm going to be honest i got one shot with this thing i got to make it count now one shot body shot is cool but what they don't tell you is that you don't get the great suck from final hits it has to be precision hits oh my god wow that melted me okay take two [Music] maybe not oh jump jump jump jump pump it pump it louder pump it louder i'm sorry i just i can't stop singing it's an affliction really oh oh yeah see we killed him oh i get to pick up my little thing but it didn't give us the holy sock and i don't mean like holy suckers and like holy cow or something i mean like like holy sucked like okay it's holy like it's to hold in high regard i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about okay nice kill i think it's things are a little laggy right now i'm gonna be honest but we're persevering oh wait oh okay ah mercy ruled them okay well oh we didn't get the great sucker but oh my god the tree just saved your life oh my god you owe that tree a drink zones controlled targets eliminated oh wow look at me i'm tanner fish the man i didn't die i never did oh am i in the front oh that's terrifying i'm just making it up as i go as always okay now this could be big right out of the gate there's going to be a group of people you scared him away okay i didn't hit oh i forgot oh it's momentum control too everything hurts so much kind of like this though okay ooh wall hacks no suck though oh that noise though oh i like that oh he had the lorenz the la wrongs his already charged that's not fair okay okay okay here i go here i go here we go that's embarrassing yo where my wall hack there it is thank you yup dude this thing's crazy in momentum control it's like it one shots everything oh my god the time to kill is what the [ __ ] is going on right now oh oh come here wall hacks i got this suck and it did nothing but wall hacks wall hacks for days come on come on where's those wall hacks give them to give me the wall hacks too late yeah he's pre-chart where my wall hacks man i paid good money for the for these hacks battle i ain't got nothing oh oh that was that was kind of nice with it i'm not i'm not gonna lie oh okay that was not nice with it what am i doing okay we got the kill though yas give me that oh very fun ammo yes oh yes hello there's like melee one shot unless you feel like melee might even watch it oh the great suck did nothing sad oh there's especially what am i doing oh he was pretty dude he's literally around the corner like like that nice super stupid how do i break out of stupid okay i guess i can just oh that'll work there i go can't see where anyone oh touche two string what comes around goes around oh there he is great suck killed me he's doing god's work he's showing me how it works because i clearly can't see you know if that had sucked somebody it would have killed him now i don't know if it would kill and not momentum wait we lost already wait what wow momentum control more like mercy control am i am i right oh look at all those things that's my bad i was i'm just playing momentum control for this thing but shame on me i'll just go to regular because as we all know you guys come to me for serious in-depth reviews and i don't want to short you guys on that to not do my due diligence my dd all right looks like it's time for my very serious review guys okay so we can see here on the red team we have uh this handsome looking devil and then now these are these other clubs y'all gonna make me all right we're gonna fight on be okay see this makes more sense now i have a radar i'm not gonna kill everything in one shot i really really wanted to headshot him and get the suck and i got ahead of myself okay they're all on b and thankfully for me i didn't spawn anywhere near that okay so he's using the and uh well shot first and missed and he had shot me uh no doubt in my mind who the better player is that's the suck and no one was okay that guy was kind of reasonably close it's a pretty close suck relatively speaking i mean the suck like the suck is you know what i'm saying i guess it's a good suck but if but it's just hard to get them in the suck did that guy just the head shot me mid-air with the wrong how does that even go yo yo yo yo yo i shot bro my anus dude oh come on take that point fudge take the point i said take take the point stupid oh my god okay that guy's just better than me i'm just gonna leave oh aim hacks aim hacks oh i see you're going over here stupid i see have been close what's going on well ironically the one game that was kind of close uh i made friends yeah ooh the little energy that shows up that's cool oh god i think my dog just farted holy he's trying to smoke me out yeah i should put on some mods too i know there's like ones for like increased target acquisition and stuff this season and as you can see i have none of them i mean yeah in hindsight that would have made a lot of sense all right we got aim hacks we got people to suck oh my god okay well and now i'm trying to shoot him with a gun that has no ammo okay what the fudge i swear to god i hit him but i guess he kept getting kills and wow wow what aim mr fruit how do you do it we're not trying to win this game tim just so we're clear he's like i don't think i mean i'll capture b but i'm saying like i kind of feel like it's a zero-sum game here i don't feel like there's a lot left to play for you except for this wall hacks wow i am flattered that you solo altered me i posed no threat to you whatsoever and that didn't stop you i respect that oh the flinch i freaking headshot you and we know it man where did he go holy would just like to reiterate i'm going to choke hold from a heating pad because my neck is broken at least it feels that way okay just want to clear that up sounds cool enemy has zone advantage that whoa that was a headshot we both know it my anus there's the suck oh god it kind of looks like it like kind of influenced his direction but it was almost like orbit he just went around and pulled him in pull him around advancing no they best watch out cause your boy just got the suck and there was no one to suck along with him and i missed enemies oh that was my quad that was me i'm in my mom's quad i didn't kill you oh my big saying buddy okay oh trying to change up the loadout that was the problem okay well that guy oh jesus christ that is my friend leave him alone he is my friend uh you don't get it oh my god if i had actually hit that it might have sucked but we'll never know we will never know go wall hack i choose you didn't really help that much but controversy just fueling the fire baby that's what i do oh my god oh my god take two oh bro i swear to god something hitting there something had to hit in there that's a laggy dude look at that look at that all right i'm playing 144 frames he's playing in powerpoint okay okay wallhack's trying to help there i'm not gonna lie to be fair though i mean that when i have it out that's just part of the gun you know like i don't think all right dude we get it you're a better shot you're beaten this time well we don't need to stick around for the stats ladies and gentlemen one last time for the laurence dravid [Music] [Music] you
