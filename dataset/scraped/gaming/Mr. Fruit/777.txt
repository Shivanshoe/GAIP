hidey-ho ruin my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to Cobb duty modern warfare and in today's video ladies and gentlemen I made a promise and over the weekend we did we completed the other shotguns ever even like platinum so obviously that means we finish the model 680 which we'll be using in today's video and the r9 zero which we'll be using in the last one specifically because it's my favorite shotgun of them all legs glued in the 725 now it does gold look cooler yes should we use it in game yes but does it take more to get the platinum of course so I'm gonna use it any even though yeah it's do do shotgun challenges were actually really easy to I'll be using the FSS marauder muzzle you'll see a theme here with damage range and tighter pellet spread the xrk 18 inch liberator barrel for said damage range and tighter pellet spread the 5 mil awhile later that is what that stands for right no stock stock so it's a stock but it's not a stock so there's no stock and our under barrel of choice is the XR k true gripped at cojones we're going for max range so we can kill at the most absurd of ranges also I hit max rank haha yeah it doesn't really do anything and we also joined a game in progress fun that's that's the first thing I want to hear when I enter a game listen can you all take a second and instead of killing me let me enjoy the Platinum oh wow would you look at that thing what a beauty is I actually was not a big fan of the 680 originally it was not until as you can see here I got the tighter pellet spread and damage range attachments and then I was like oh okay I'll come ah we didn't kill him now he knows I'm here but once you get those attachments yeah you start getting some pretty nutty kills or it's more consistent then you're like okay okay good ah guys got a watch behind you but oh wait all he's got a trophy sitting up there nerd no chance at revenge is a dish best served in another life because I died because I oh my god I cannot tell you how annoying friendly player collision is why is that apparently it's actually a glitch or something they changed something and somehow with their spaghetti code or something it means that you start colliding with your friends it is in you're 18 specifically or rather most notably on shipment it's like good gold alright sit good game good game Hey oh wow whoa house close one huh now before we get into another game let's talk about the most important thing happening as of right now my puppies sitting on my feet and she's being so cute right now oh gosh she's looking at me oh man since we have both gold and platinum to show off here we'll do one match with gold and then finish it with Platt ah see if you put the gold on this like oh okay nice nice man I can only imagine what the completion is for all shock Platinum must look so new and at this point into the game's lifecycle if they haven't changed it they're not going to they seem to think that it's pinnacle camo that it can't get better or maybe it's exactly what they were shooting for people wanted the more realistic camos and here we are with some more realistic camos I actually have a problem though with the shotguns most notably because stim is a bit of an issue when you take a shot and then try and stem if you stem and then take a shot while hipfire but then you can't fire another one until the whole animation is through because you have to [ __ ] the gun or whatever the official terminology is for it I'm not entirely sure I'm a bit of a scrub-a-dub-dub in my tab attempt ever so weak but I'm alive they won't expect me to go towards the missiles because no sane person would but I'm not at what and the spawn right next to me and it makes me what a spawn right next to me and then the spawn right next to me except this time I got the better of them non objective based modes uh-huh what a spawn again like I was gonna say non objective based modes and Shipman are the worst because at least with objective you sort of know spawns you can kind of make heads or tails outside of a few variables but in these modes no good luck my friend by my friend I don't even think that's the song I'm just making it up as I go a certain wouldn't be the first time nice aim there mr. fruit impeccable oh now we're fraggin now we're fraggin nope a little too far for me I'm dead like I can't even disappears into the abyss and I know what you're thinking if you wanted a sniper a shotgun with far range to make a pseudo sniper I suppose well then just put on slug rounds yeah but that's not what I'm getting I'm trying to use a shock and as you mmm as you would normally oh hello spine oh hello other spawn tsunamis dragon eggs ever you have a really big razors category I'm saying essentially make it a slug without making it a slug does that make sense because if not you just don't have high enough IQ and I can't blame me you know the average IQ evidently it's actually like is it 80 or 90 or something like that I know I don't actually know oh now we frag him though now we Fraggle me in I can't see I mean yeah oh my god covered in Muroto oh what a shot mm is that fruit the thing that would the tighter pellet spread more accurate I know you have to actually aim a little bit with a shotgun I'm as shocked as you are we have been climbing a little bit in the spamm because we have been draggin and of course you don't see it in this video but I've talked about it before I don't fudge my games there's nothing but going on sneaky behind-the-scenes nothing suss like that I like to harken back to the wise words of my kindergarten teacher you get what you're getting you don't throw a fit that's you here ah the Hannah Tron coma cheeky and something else sounds like native leader I am leader coma cheeky I am double cheek tough oh my god he really is it's a Thursday afternoon like what you doing coma cheeky you little rascal oh hello there there's another one I can't see him and I am stupid gasp bro Oh throwback oh my god I actually threw back I totally thought I was gonna die but here I am and I'm not dead spoilers didn't die yeah that's how that works too crazy to be do you do but no that's a Granada that's a Granada there's a Granada why don't you catch this Granada well party a la fiesta where's the pinata yeah open it up it's a couple different grenades which one are we gonna get now is it alive one a dead one is it a timed fuse is it an impact like what are we talking I don't know you get what you get and yet don't throw up in a steely that mr. fruit bringing life last lessons full circle and a call of duty commentary where I'm just shooting dudes with the shotgun you never expect to get dropped with such hot words of a wisdom but yet here we are and it funds me watch me ah God because of the stupid stamp I couldn't [ __ ] the thing and then they judge oh hey well maybe we just okay then we just don't try out can I finish my thought please oh sweet Moses alright I'll take that as a new let's try and grab see for the love of God so that week somebody help oh okay and we lost day so it doesn't matter okay one of these shipment games now okay okay I can play ball I'll play pump you know I never was very athletic ball sports weren't really my thing that's actually not true at all I love me some ball sports I love me some buzz hey 13 by the way God okay we just need to find it this is just this is this is a wipe this is a wipe give me I - you get get me I can't stupid gas God why is it that it's so opium why is there no there's no counter play there's no perc battle-hardened doesn't help with that UD doesn't help with it you spotted can't shoot you can only hit fire with some guns that means you can't even do anything you can't call your weapon you do this you do that they hold my god that's eccentric you look at this God just just remove it from a game or disable it on shipment for the love oh my that's I see the grenade hey I thought that was the grenade why didn't it go off now alright then yeah I'm not gonna question it grid oh my god I need to just haul can I just add a some sort of a breathing mask to each one of my characters can I do that can I make that modification I'll lose like a secondary weapon or something for that it's totally fine with me I don't need ah spawning in the kill Ranma I mean I can't really complain like I'm good at complete about the gas grenades but I can't really complain about spawns with kill streaks whatever on this map that comes with the territory but the gas grenade is a choice by the other people oh my dogs always getting caught on my headphone wire dude okay alright once it was funny that's a lie but I'll pretend it was twice little frustrating three times alright but the 20th time make just what JA Oh My Jesus Oh everything hurts everything is painful I'm gonna hide in here let me know when Armageddon is over is it safe now Oh a new game of shipment darn make your fruit cake fine you guys like my platinum uh-huh I'm sure none of you care I almost share the same sentiment once I get Mascis though you all better be checking me out like I am some cover girl that's more gas huh names who is the one throwing gas cuz you're pissing me off you're really grinding my gears where I suck yeah he really busted my balls that I can't spawn for one second I thought I got out of this game ok ok there's a kill I don't know I didn't get oh there I got the other guy though long shot I was actually surprised to find that there wasn't long shot medals for the shotgun you would have thought there would be you know feels like that is one of the challenges they could have done but they didn't and again I'm not mad all the challenges were pretty straightforward and I appreciate that and give me a couple seconds while I spend half the match reloading and you son of AA you killed bird he didn't know I was there he didn't know where to shoot but you gave our L leg I is real odd and I was gonna get this specialist bonus but no ah fudge I forgot to God when I need to record the video I got a switch to the war crime but how I suppose who needs war crimes when you've got these gas grenades that's the biggest defense here Dom I got a shot them up uh-huh good news is shotguns are done with bad news probably the last of the easiest ones to do that really didn't take much effort well honestly the LMG ones aren't that bad either it's just that there's there's have a decent amount of levels that's really the only the only thing so I might wait for double xp to try and level those guys up and in the meantime finish all the Gold's on the stuff I have leveled because like I love all the snipers God weeks ago but I still haven't even tried to get the gold after leveling them so I need to do that yeah that one's probably not gonna be very fun gonna have to play ground more and I'm just not a big grand more guy I just want to spawn and have a nice relaxing ten seconds ten seconds I feel like we're halfway there okay that was a decent spawn thank you game very considerate very considerate you know I'm not gonna reload all the way jokes on me if I think I'm actually gonna live to shoot eight more shots it's a funny meme mr. fruit see what was the point what's the point of a VP you know and I mean does anything matter anymore well let's get decent games with the shotguns but and I think I just step up the SP mm I pulled too much now I guess sweaty McGee is everywhere and yes I know that makes me a sweaty McGee and I understand that oh I got a burp yeah we totally lost as a tough one huh oh throwing the smoke with the thermal I love the play I love the play is that the mp5 - oh my god you're so brave do they have it the model 680 I know III know I really convinced you as to why you should be using this it's a little hit or miss but the next shotgun the r90 prepare for that one that one is by far and away my favorite hopefully we do a little bit better with it I was having good games with a 682 so don't get me wrong it's not bad I just would I would choose the r90 all this really means another set a platinum a couple more plots to go and then were there anyway that's that thank you much for watching and feel is my - day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
