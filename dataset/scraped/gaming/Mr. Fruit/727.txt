hi ad hope you won money miss mr. fruit and welcome back to Star Wars Battlefront to new content huzzah we're gonna be looking to grab some of the new characters they added they've added II walk for the rebels and some sort of infiltrator spy thing for the Empire let's be real I want to be any walk Wow looks like we're playing as the Empire which means hopefully we'll get to be the new is be agent either way I still got to give it to him they are updating this game like crazy lots of free new content they've even added to all the default classes three well four rather soap one per class okay herb the dirt math yeah I know crazy right what Brady weapon for each class that were probably gonna be doing videos on later as well so stay tuned for that this fella knows I'm here but it don't matter because he's dead I'm thinking we're we're just gonna be a Battlefront only channel does that sound that sound good to you guys that's pretty good to me it's rebel huntin season I just gotta find somebody that you had chat with it's fast if Evers I don't know what empire guys sounds like that but oh that should desist I guess we'll take that yeah that's a hitmarker that's a kill that should've been a kill let's be honest I got him and I messed up me reload I think oh no I didn't mess up my real have a little bit of faith mister fruit oh my god I'm just destroyed people is that guy's name coronavirus yeah I mean it's not funny that coronavirus is a serious thing just read where 38% of Americans whatever said they won't buy Corona beer because coronavirus oh we're here and I think we got dual blasters which reminds me of the art troop or whatever yeah with the Clone Wars saga which by the way is sick I can't see a darn thing though right now so I wouldn't really say this is a great idea oh hello there you have a giant forehead actually kinda seems like a mix of the arc trooper and Sith trooper app oh I like this I need to help my friends though I can fortify them love the sound of my blaster do you that so you are in the wrong neighborhood friend lookit we destroyed that guy I'm gonna fortify my friends to me rally I know why I sound like some guy from the Horde oh yeah well give me revealing enemies you little droid was it oh no that was an Ewok guy that wasn't a joy by apologies he why he just materialized out of the air and quickly died I'm looking to charge somebody girl oh wait what wait wait okay apparently that's not how okay apparently I'm mistaken increases sprint speed engaged damaged wood Oh for some reason I thought it was I guess like a shoulder charge I don't know I've been a TIA what do you want from me I mean I mean though the logo looks like a shoulder charge right I mean I'm not like I'm at you can understand the confusion right now I've got I got a hip fire yeah right I thought it was gonna be all about the Ewoks but I didn't realize we double blaster it up like the arc trooper that's the best part about the arc troopers and they get the revealing of the Sith trooper those are like my two favorite classes so when they clash it's a beautiful mix you are sure oh so dead oh my god it's unbelievable how dead you are like you couldn't be any more dead even if I tried god I love the sniper they even added with the sniper class that might be the first one we do like an old cycler rifle looks like some dope bolt-action oh I'm gonna I'm gonna be all about it I already am and I don't even have it that's how you know it's gonna be real okay I need to stop killing things I'm gonna I'm gonna commit okay thank you actually asking about to commit seppuku is be agent on the field friends we're rallying I'm finding the enemy just just just let both of them rip just like it like it's a beyblade baby skirt yeah I'm running right into the danger okay maybe that's maybe that's not the best idea but we won screw you rebel scum oh my gosh we're about to deke wad these guys so hard and yes I do speak fluent II walk but you see I'm always probably gonna be using specialist when I'm trying to get some classes because I have one of the cards on them and my loadout that gives me increased score that you sell to point me in the way of the me oh well thank you I appreciate that haha he's dead wait a second no wait why am I the assault I chose to be that's I freaking I said to snipe ah whatever alright immediate immersion activate though screw it dude I'm going first person this is never a good idea yep it's never a good idea okay now I'm a sniper who's actually probably just the worst idea on this map East and we're gonna do running those ruins and snipe people point-blank bad you know this is a this is a bad idea even I know it's a bad idea and that's when it's a really bad idea oh my god cuz I'm I'm like king of bad ideas and if I'm like yeah this is a bad idea than Jesus oh my sweet J oh my sweet Jesus yeah yeah yeah we got a kid we got a kill nicely done keep up the pressure lads where are the other people they're in here oh my god yes they are yes they are ha ha ah he's right on me I think oh my god I am oh shoot what up fellow II walk brother the reason I want to play as a frickin a walk look at - its bow and arrow time baby what is this thing - oh I can sense the enemy pew pew pew pew pew I don't know what I'm doing oh my god wait a second these guys hurt I'm I hit him they don't know he actually
