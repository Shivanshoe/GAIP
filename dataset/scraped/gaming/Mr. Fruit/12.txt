oh what the fudge oh my god yeah how i managed to get the kill where where is this boner give me all your credit how many kills does it take to get the center of the rift pop nice and aid me heidi hold everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to destiny 2. i'm looking at the brand new duality dungeon pulse rifle new purpose first off l plus ratio plus whatever you have to say about this gun doesn't matter because the aesthetics of the dungeon guns are so sick look at this what's this ah i've got high calf arounds for that increased range well-rounded headstone cool for stasis builds and their cool origin trait while this weapon is equipped taking damage accelerates its next reload taking more damage increases the effect the static sick maybe a hot take i think the dungeon's sick and these aren't craftable so it's you get what you get you hopefully frag so we're hopping into the fray um the asterisk here preface made a video on iron banner before and somehow failed to realize that there was a freelance option very peg of me i guess i just never looked for it i don't know i didn't even we're we're hopping into there now all right disjunction which also a lot of people apparently don't like this map i don't know i like it so suck on them apples defeats the excuse you you rude son of a gun can't you see i'm trying to use this brand new sick like look at this i look so sick i'm also radiant why am i who helped me become radiant thank you yes i feel like i finally found myself and i got an assist oh that is a fantastic need from that fella okay i'm gonna throw this here i'm gonna try and pick this up and i'm gonna get a rez and i'm inevitably gonna die i don't know why i tried to get a rez with the spark check this out bob that's incredible how i managed to get the kill yes give me the spark oh my god my headstone's trolling me never mind it went perfectly because it baited them my teammates that is into giving up on trying to find the spark because they didn't think it possible now i'm going to run right under their noses i think they know where i am i'm running right into the banks i don't know what the fudge is out i'm trolling runner out oh oh the sneaky pick up the res oh my god is he gonna dunk it where'd he go oh what the fudge oh wait i got a kill i got well rounded activated for once in my life this is this is a first can we where'd you where where is this boner oh my god yeah hold on yeah yeah yeah i'm coming buddy i'm not gonna let you die i'm not gonna let you die i would never do that that'd be that'd be so terrible to me i wouldn't want you to die right next to it drop the spark and then i would have to pick it up and dunk it for you that would be perfect so glad that that's not what happened because that would have been so sad see i'm on the fence it's like yeah i want to get the iron thing and then you get it oh my god that's a nice nade right there oh my god look at that nade look at that oh my god i only got an assist of course with her hordes oh yeah i forgot one of you guys have played rift yet iron brain rift it's uh iron banner rift more like iron banner wither horde featuring rift because that's really what it feels like oh look at that pulse so consistent so damageful okay i'm i'm over this buddy yep just thank you very much are you gonna oh no oh no it's almost as if it's exactly what i thought would happen would happen which i don't want it to happen ever oh no he dropped the spark right before he was able to score and so now i'm going to pick it up and do it myself oh no that side i could go back in time to the medieval ages you know i'd be like hey you're like you're old a gregorian band gregorian champ band can i a room for guy like me because that would be pretty swell i'd like to be a gregorian chanter i feel like that's been my calling all along also great kill me let's activate okay but yeah well-rounded and the headstone doesn't do that much in people certainly not when uh you know i'm not expecting the stasis so hopefully you forgive me and instead along the way you realize wait this guy is so entertaining and so funny and so incredibly handsome that's not very fair but i love it all because of that regardless of whether or not he has a good role because it is random and this is the only one he's gotten and instead the other like 20 runs of the dungeon he's done have just been armor armor armor hopefully that's you know the takeaway you get from all this carry on my wayward team i'll be here to dunk the spark give me all your credit come on peek me he's gonna do it he's gonna do that sassy little bacha pete you are so greedy and with all of that said get grenaded you absolute stupid buffoon you got rezzed however he was afk oh my god how many people can i kill how many kills does it take to get the center of the rift i've been rambling shmambling just like i typically do but because of that i kind of haven't been paying much attention aside from the fact that this pulse rifle is freaking sick brother it looks sick it shoots sick and it's sick sick and i mean it's got covered but good i'm just kidding he wears a mask he's baxed are you um uh what am i doing header i'm so very scared it's too late yeah yeah no loud loud noises you know how it is hey yo what the spark doing i know they ain't bout to remain at the dunk up in here cause i ain't gonna allow it yeah yeah i hear a golden gun but i don't see it yeah he's dead the rift dude over there you got him yes now okay hail mary imagine that killed someone that would have been sick huh nice oh an orbital power for me well i accept you thank you thank you very much come again i'm a post up right here brother look at that like the colonel rookie private fruit where he got you up on watch the dude tower duty we need you to patrol and shoot the things with with the sick freaking um headstone pulse rifle you got that that was so cool how you made the stasis crystal right there and i said brother it would be an absolute hotter you're sure you just sir whatever but i died i didn't they didn't even give me a medal you thought they would have bravery or excellence or sacrificed i don't know any of that nope didn't get any of that instead what'd we get this video and you guys are what the fudge terrible consolation prize which i said ow that hurts my feelings but true okay you know what i broke the law of the gun review i pulled out the gun i'm not reviewing how good i unless it's a primary but again we all know that drill oh it's so easy go i had stone on action all enough falling in there now if i hit him with my hammer that's a bubble that's what that is okay well i'm gonna run away i've come to grab the spark and perhaps bargain but made me grab escort my spark runner dude when do i get the fame glory wealth winches you know what i'm saying because i i'm just i'm just sitting i'm the i'm the assist man 30 seconds this has been i don't think i've ever played a game that ended one zero but today might be a new day well there's 25 seconds for them to prove me wrong wouldn't that be embarrassing if if that happened that would be miserably i'm trying to tell them that i i see i see the spark runner but it's not crushed all right working nice and aid me yeah burn brave burn oh we killed him i guess hey we won wow look at all that loot chief let's just go and boop that sugar up down there one more time look at that third place because i stopped some runners i carried it defended i've just kind of come to the realization like last season-ish two seasons ago pulse rifles might be my new love it all started when i started just rocking the gridskeeper thing is sick so good and then they go ahead and hit me with this beauty am i gonna say no and not to mention new auto rifle's sick except for its perk pool have you looked at it go look up its perk pool just thinking about i'm throwing it up in my mouth a little bit it's disgusting like the disrespect meanwhile we keep getting 80 million 140 hand cannons with the greatest roles you could possibly ever get meanwhile over here they're like uh yes this assault rifles god rolls around mulligan enjoy like what i won't stand for this disrespect you make me sick all of you i'm so sick oh he's so almost dead but he's not talking yo yo i think i'm having a mild stroke it's like i'm saying things and i'm here but not entirely it's all just like i feel like i'm latency irl i'm a minute behind here on everything that's strange okay please kill him nice get my res remember oh my god you're the best around oh my god and unfortunately our spark runner died no no no oh my god i'm feeding okay that was stupid maybe i should have broken the review code you know and pulled out a shotgun there that's like primo shotgun territory right there but yeah i stick to my guns all right okay i don't know what you were trying oh my god wait look at this look at this pulse rifle ah we were doing so good why did we spawn back here hello i won't stun for this except apparently i will because we did and just like that that was a 2af here's the thing about freelance and just rift in general if it's not a stack if you're ever down a point odds are it's like 50 50 someone's gonna have k on your team you're down two points 50 50 it's gonna be about four people on your team you're down three points you might as well just disconnect because everyone's quick okay they appear to be going to the right just fine this is fine i've prepared for this month okay while he has okay i've got to break the code i had to break it for the sake of the rift and i'm not talking about summoners ripped baby okey dokey i don't no no no rez don't re no don't collect the sp i didn't mean to this is i wanted to raise my friend why would it take priority over friendship takes priority kills [Music] hey yo yo new suspect new sassy vodka i don't actually remember new purpose that's the name of the gun i was close enough everything wait what you're just in our backlot what are you guys doing i've officially lost hope i pooped my pants most of all oh my god he's dead most of all but i got his rest oh that's kind of hot okay shoes check it oh my god um no i just oh my god i i just started stacking well that well stop rebalanced well it was well-rounded no it's kind of hot in my room lads chad's maidens getting a little hot um are you afk you appear to be okay i can only help those who want to be helped and apparently that's not you so i'm gonna do this i'm gonna become radiant i'm gonna kill the spark i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna not fight you i'm gonna re-up on the sole invictus radiant something something something something something lots of things that's a goalie gun oh my god my strafe is them bam bam bam bam all right guys quit horsing around i got your ass dude i got your rest i got your rice oh my god i got you i actually got your rezzed i'm dead oh my god please kill the enemy housing all right yep full teams okay 3-0 it's over which by the way if it's 3-0 can we can we just do mercy can we i don't think i've ever seen someone come back or at the very least like there's less than four minutes left my brother's in christ just to mercy it forgive me where did he go i think they're about to dunk i think they're dunking it's they don't no they didn't oh my god you're a hero you're a legend although we spawned back here again it's absolutely true and there it goes incredible all right well now we all afk so they can just score the fifth one and we can move on with our lives aka rift has now become team death match because who cares four scores three minutes like it might have been four score and and some years ago but it ain't four score three minutes in a comeback you know what i'm saying abe lincoln say no gettysburg or direct gettysburg this take two this ain't no gettysburg address this is just please put us to rest address just yeah they're not even picking it up yeah let's just tdm it is oh no they're going to weird guys no stop them ah this can't be happening it's can't wake me up from this brutal dream i'm still so far away from resetting my rank oh god i don't know what we were talking about but it's a stasis pulse rifle it can roll headstone so you can do cool things with stasis belts i've never made a stasis build but if i did it'll be with this because it's a cool pulse rifle and i like pulse rifles although i wouldn't mind a better route real headstone is cool for stasis build maybe some aside from well-rounded i don't know what else it can roll frankly and that's not for me to decide that's well the i mean it is the side the game society but it's for you to decide what roles you want from the possible roles to make your god roll because it's situational but it does look cool and it shoots cool and it sounds cool and it is cool and you're cool and if you put that all together it's a cool gun even though maybe sometimes freelance iron banner not so cool but it can be cool but yeah sometimes maybe not so much so the point is i like the gun 10 out of 10 duality dungeon these nuts got him [Music] [Music]
