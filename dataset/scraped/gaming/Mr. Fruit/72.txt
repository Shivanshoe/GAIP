oh sorry about that you played it safe it's just real safe farewell heidi hope everyone my name is mr hoot and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video our first installment in drip or drop a brand new guardian transmug fashion off today we'll be selecting from a few titans to see who is the most stripped if you guys do enjoy this let me know down in the comment section below and feel free to like or subscribe it's always appreciated get the drip in here ladies and gentlemen let's go let's go i need the pretty titans i need to be blown away all right what is this we got 12 that might be 12. these better all be titans all right hiding text chat so they cannot influence the judges we must stay partial the judges being myself and chat the way it works drip or drop we're going through the first basis is we're just gonna rate drip or drop if you're dripped you're gonna stay if you're dropped you're out it's an elimination bracket we got 11 titans here dropped your out drip you stay once we narrow it down and go through everybody then we choose the drippiest of the drift and then we declare the first drip or drop winner obviously it's going to be very subjective at least for me i will try and make it so that i will decide if it's stripper drop but i'll do a poll in chat and whatever they choose will stay we're going to start off with arson oh we got an mmxx ir here ballsy you know it's hard to pull off the vault to glass butt towel i am a big fan of whatever the fudge this thing is playing it pretty safe with a black camo black is very very popular frankly mainly because it's hard to mess up black if you make everything black so would like to see a little more creativity on the shader yeah and i'm not going to make someone drop if they use all the same shader but it's always cool to see people find a few different ones and match them together i'm getting it's just it's a very eclectic drip you know it the the helmets tell me one thing but then you're right and then the butt towel see i think the butt towel is not helping because to be fair i haven't really seen a set yet that properly uses the butt towel it's like one of those things it's like it's it's very high risk high reward because if you were able to like seamlessly make it boom i'd be like dang but i'm gonna i'm gonna start the poll and after the poll is done i will give my rating and then we will reveal chats the poll comes in 77 of the audience votes drop you've been dropped my friend my vote though however is also drop oh sorry about that you played it safe it's just real safe the camo doesn't earn you any bonus points black doesn't hurt but it's it it looks like you're you just dress yourself the first time you know what i'm saying you just threw on some cool things you know hey you always have a chance in the future but you've been drawn on to the next batman chunky bar with the bungie chess piece which i'll say is ballsy because subjectively for me pretty much all the armor from this was a bit of a yikes for me especially because it looks like you're ready to get on a bike you know you got the leather i'll get past the chest piece so it's just i'm not big on the chest but let's see if you can make it work right we see another black shader to be fair uh but this time we got some blue accents what is this we got first frost of course who could forget i do like i do like the little towel little butt towel they are in the same pair so it it's it makes sense why it would match with each other um all i gotta say what are those titan titan legs can definitely be a little hit or miss especially with the helmet i feel like you got a certain vibe and it does it does go with each other i i do feel like this one's a little more cohesive as a set but this goes down to the never forgiving folks at home do they think drip or do they think drop the results are in and 63 percent have decided to drop batman we've got ruthless chat out here these viewers are not easy to please my rating would have been a very soft drip good luck carter they're ruthless at home okay and the stark contrast from what we've seen before we've we've decided we've gone on the exact opposite i'm blinded by the line we've got the white we've got the bright magenta malibu wrong so we now hot take and a lot of people hate the uh little fur things they did with the the titan armor in this one i'm not horribly against it i will say it gives me some real mixed vibes with with what we got right here though but ironically it almost fits because it feels like it's like a gross mullet and it feels like we're rocking like the 80s or something you know so in a weird kind of way i think it almost works at this point i have to ask ourselves will anyone drip in the eyes of chad it's a mohawk to a mullet everyone's favorite god i gotta be honest that's a disgusting chest piece chat has 71 percent agreed to drop these mons i'm sorry carter you've been dropped next up this is brutal i feel terrible he's so terrestrial what do we got okay looking like we're uh a megazord i'm getting some bionicle kinda what vibes am i getting here very red though red power ranger for sure it's always a bold helmet choice i like it and what's interesting is this titan is bulky and yet slender does that make any sense anyone else feeling like you know what i'm picking up what i'm putting down he's wide but not why he's lanky you know but i love this getting a little creative with with the shaders he's got his little uh leather butt towel of course was a little his man satchel the back of that chest piece is pretty cool is the iron man was he stored in there i'm trying to avoid any opinionated things here before chat is able to vote trying to be objective and break down what we're looking at here what the fudge is this way i've never seen it what's this well turtles that kill cow or how many turtle friends he's made along the way no kind of dig this uh alternating color here though you know 69 nice is unanimous we we got our first strip you dripped chat has said you drip you did it you're the first i gotta say i agree trip so iso with the drab next up we've got guardian okay we're rocking the uh the one-eyed mask ornament which i feel isn't too popular in a drip loadout so cool to see we've got those are the shadow key boots pretty sure and you don't see this a lot with titans because frankly ah there's not many narrow shoulders not super broad because there really aren't many titan shoulders that aren't just blocks running with the reese walker 2 which kind of fits the aesthetic they're going for here we've got the omnicronia with a little bit of a different shader here and frankly i think that works really well for half a second i also thought it was a hunter just so slender i think it's part of the boots and even at first glance almost with that little cape but that's not a bad thing chat with a 50 50 50 by one vote by one chat has decided drip every vote counts guardian you have survived and frankly i kind of mirror chat i'm like 50 50. i don't know where i sit with it uh nah mr fruit no uh next up we our uh is two guardians now we have guardian 44 84. what do we got the one the the mask of the quiet one you love to see this we got a nice soft palate almost pastel purple some white some gray easy on the eyes a tiny little sparrow from that tiny little man the helmet has always given me donnie darko vibes that's for sure we see another crucible fur chest which is probably 100 more crucible fur chest than i've seen in the past very long time frankly we've seen a couple people go for this it's very distinctive with its its patterns they opted for the 30th anniversary but towel they've got their 5g transmitter 70 that it's a draw uh i'm inclined to agree oh i see you've just changed the trailer ghost thank you guardian 4484 uh for feeding the rancor all right next up potion seller kanye all right off the bat oh it's looking okay so we're going for a bit of a rougher scrappier kind of look what even kind of helps tie it in is the sparrow in the back looking kind of like a wastelander kind of thing you know what i'm saying little junkyard we got the the ancient defender believer in a little iron moss bone throw in there tethered cloth the asymmetrical gauntlets a rarity and again uh those exact same one the meridian constellation greaves they're hot right now they're going off they're flying off the shelves apparently come and get them 74 with the drip certified drip my friend in fact i think that must that might be the so far most unanimous trip decision i am inclined to agree i'll give a drip the only things throw me off are it must be the certain chess piece it's just so tiny and then you go so wide down here beside that like the gauntlet helmet i'm liking it like this gives me more scavenger vibes i don't know something you'd kind of see like who knows but ironically i think the chess piece works best in the back because i like this little little thing on the subtle we went from kind of slim to absolute chunky bar who wait a second does he have the exact same he does using the same chess piece see i guess that's obvious the difference between the female and the male titan variant you got the whole back a very from what i can tell very popular ornament to be used for the titan helmet rocking the center seps which aren't exactly the easiest to make a fit with we've got the front-facing butt towel a little more modest with just the utility of these cabs look at the cavs on this mountain chat with a 56 percent has decided drip you survive friend i gotta say kind of like the vote pretty close for me i'm gonna edge toward drip i think the biggest thing holding you back are the syntheses so you're dripped next up we got uh tactical wizard doesn't sound like a crayon either to me we've got wide boy wide shiny boy and it's so shiny he's rocking the lion ramparts rocking the default wine ramparts which have always looked funny in the best way possible to me was that uh that dude for my hero you know what i'm saying big shoulder very titan now it's up to people if they think you know matching these right next to each other is cheating a little bit but i don't i don't think that's necessarily a problem helps tie it in frankly i like the color choice especially because it blends in so well with the uh the gold accents 72 percent unanimously decides to drop tactical wizard no drip here i am inclined to agree tara king brad with a much different vibe looking titan again is this meridian constellation graves bruh everybody loves these paints man i gotta say that the the immediate glow effect from this this marks really cool the green in fact it's i'm getting like scion vibes from this almost like it's a sign oh i didn't even realize okay i have to give immediate bonus points it i did not until now that i realize those are syntheceps that's how seamless they went together because usually the centiceps are something i immediately see and they take away but this one it took me a second it took me a second the atmosphere glow i'm gonna be honest i don't i don't know if i have that one i haven't seen it pretty cool shader though and that gambit jade stone just making that thing pop 92 voted to drop i am shot no i'm just kidding 92 percent voted to drip it's the drip easily the most dance we've had so far and i have to say so far probably my favorite as well from what we've seen can't knock him for using these boots because if we we'd seen him first i would have been so used to him but man people love these meridian constellation grieves man but i am all about it i i'll tell you and last but not least the right guy with another helm big old chunky boots we've got the crucible chest oh we've got the uh 4runner or whatever freaking marathon uh flashlight again the ascendant this is probably one of my favorite marks so we'll have to see it what are we working with here the dawning tranquility very chunky titan you guys know how i feel about the crucible chest but i'm willing to let it let it go right now these are you know titans are usually these are just like extra bulky relax never even seen these or at least pay attention very big presence you know you're not going to miss them in the room 84 to drop the right guy the drip check has failed you have critically failed your drip check you've been dropped i agree first off i was seeing some people you know debate this like i don't get why using one shader's a bad thing and it's not always a bad thing like that last titan we saw with that green one i think that worked totally fine it's a matter of trying to find out okay well if you mix and matched what else could you have gotten could you push it a little further some people think it's a little easy i think if done right it doesn't have to be different shaders um in this case i would have liked to see maybe something else because it's very samesy for the most part uh but the the main drop for me though none of that's really that important the main drop is it just doesn't really feel like it flows together getting a lot of different vibes from everything so it's a drop for me in the chat the right guy farewell which means we have dropped six dripped five now it's now winners finals we gotta choose one from these folks so let's get a little refresher eso terrestrial a little robot bionicle that could guardian i forget what what theme i put to this one not quite wastelander potion seller kanye with the wastelander fit subtle the minotaur hoofed tauren beast titan and tara king brad at number five with the green scion he proved to be the most unanimous drip choice but now against the competitors and given a second look will the vote go otherwise we'll find out and 60 with the victory goes to king brad scion now fourth and fifth at fifth place was a guardian with his egyptian xerxes look fourth place was subtle with his minotaur now it's important to note though at third at least in this vote came in iso with his robot but only by three more votes those clause for that cut off but now we will do a second and third pull between kanye's wastelander fit and eso's robotic fit but congratulations to our first stripper drop winner tara king brad and i'm inclined to agree almost nah it's pretty close once you guys finish the next vote i'll let you know but here is the last poll and in second place congratulations to potion seller kanye with his wastelander fit which ultimately gives iso terrestrial third place with his robot fit congratulations to our winners um kanye here's the thing the first and second for me drip wise is pretty close i it's almost practically a tie for me but between brad and kanye they both just accomplish different things so well but i think personally from a personal choice i think i just like the waist finger wastelander fit a little bit more and the more i see it the more i like it frankly we've crowned our first drip or drop champion this one the titan dripper drop so we'll be doing warlock and hunter another time we have to in our anticipated sequel i'll also try and see if i can finally uh emote or emblem codes or something to try and give out to our winners or something so opposed to kanye i'm going to send a bungie request to you so if i can figure something out i'll send something to you [Music] [Music] you
