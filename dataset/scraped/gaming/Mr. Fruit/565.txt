hi Evie home run my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to more rogue company I'm telling you don't sleep on this game it's a lot of fun let me demonstrate hope you all enjoy the video welcome to Canales ladies and gentlemen are you think rogue cop buddy is your ally you were merely adopted at I was born in it molded by now a so trifle Dimas alright Valdemar let's go with the DMR and then I'm gonna save money to get some more expensive perks later Oh mega brain pinch pennies now to make millions later that's a saying right coming in hot on the docks check this set - gonna land here and then here's a big brain play right on to the zipline no like oh my god I didn't know someone they could get here this fast that's what I'm saying they won't expect me to be here gives me the element of surprise oh Jesus I even surprised myself oh Jesus Christ brah oh look at this ha oh here she comes here she comes yep right off spawn I knew it I knew wait oh Jesus wait did he how did he not know I'm one on one on one with shoulder what sure they're making ago they don't know they don't know around this corner I need this shoulder around this corner I need this shoulder I'm a multi shoulder kind of guy and I'm watching our flank cuz this is where they spawn I'm coming team looks like you guys are a little worse for wear but that's okay because I'm finding a way I do have a DMR after all oh my god I'm the worst Oh oh wait I'm kidding what what how do I get shot in the back it's like right where my teammate was anyway what were they doing aside from nothing important being the obvious answer dude hmm those headshot dink sounds I live for him all right Hail Mary bows they're done for that's gonna kill approximately eight people I killed none by the way Oh we'll get this leave this leave this alright I just got this girl's number I know exactly where she's trying to flake every tomb give me your gun give me a gun thats the gun I want let's see if they expect me to flank where they just tried to flank I got the loudest footsteps in the world Pope Jesus Christ man oh we won let's go now it's shopping time look I can get this perk down in the enemy heels for a significant amount of our short duration and denom enemy rillettes my currently equipped weapon and restores ammo that's right we're big spenders I'm making a last-minute diversion Oh Oh my family knew it for the objective uh oh no my middle name is I don't play objective I know my middle name is a couple names all combined together it's confusing oh Jesus they found me my loud footsteps Curtis yeah I hate to see that don't ya that's right cuz the flank never stops I shouldn't really be flanking because after I'm using a DMR it's not something you flank with but we make exceptions now give me your sniper rifle real quick a-hole I'm flanking with their sniper rifle oh my god I missed what that was a blink Oh Mike Jesus oh I traded that's debatable maybe for once in my life I'm just gonna go the way you're supposed to go they're gonna see me coming this way I don't think so where the fudge are they I'm ready for this I was born for it bring in the next one wait we lost the objective how oh Jesus I guess that's how oh my god get embarrassed get a very skinny Bears huh he didn't see this coming oh my god I'm nuts I'm nuts how do I do it there's another one apparently though Oh dude wait did we win we didn't win no my god has it not overcome that's why they've got a sniper rifle oh there one there one there one oh I see you girl dude I don't know it I think I missed yeah I kind of did all right regen the health wait but that gives me ammo and health pack what you know girl if my team would just oh I don't know flank you there we go nicely done let's see reduce health or generation delay sure increased weapon swapping Roulette speed sure don't have enough money to buy anything else sure oh Sh alright I should be flanking their fyke nevermind oh yes I did in a weird roundabout way I didn't really intend to do it but I managed and right in front of your face got ya oh wait a second they're flanking us oh my god yeah they're back from our spawn they're literally 1 there's somebody right here wait oh my god they're everywhere I want in the melee them but they just ran away oh my god how am i how am I continuously missing my my DMR what is him what am I looking at what is this oh my god somebody want to tell me how I'm still alive no you dead girl so are you oh you gotta be kidding me oh I shouldn't have died so greedy am I gonna get the kill wow they're actually raising skirt oh you missed oh you know this a miss me miss me now you gotta subscribe to me eliminations first damage dealt first downs second what wait second time a disgrace you disgust me alright we use the DMR last time let's use the keen 30th so travel this time oh I don't think I've played on this map how exciting guess I'll just have to figure out how to play up it did but we're do it alive I'm starting to see a long khanh route so of course I'm headed that way but they have the same idea but I'm just better oh they're gone for the rez oh my god yeah what the here we go mm-hmm oh that's solid that didn't hit anyone my anus try me oh my god it's the entire enemy team what's going on here why are there three of them over this isn't even the point that feel when you go to a flank the enemy team but the entire enemy team goes the flank instead of the actual route and then it's it's no longer the flank I got a grenade but more importantly I got a sniper rifle oh Jesus oh my god I bodied him I bodied him oh my god I downed him I'm nading it and I'm nading it with a different name oh my god oh I saw its damage numbers everywhere how are they not dead there we go nicely done team dad quickscope fell off fudge as soon as I pull out my sniper kill the rest there is somebody somebody somebody oh my god I'm this is the first no one's it no one's ever reflect me oh yeah I love you here I'm getting res oh fudge there we go oh god then they're behind me oh oh res now yeah that's all oh yeah you were in a gunfight totally understandable to me and I need to unlock this sniper check oh wait a second no I guess I didn't drop the sniper again I know she's right on me oh okay well we all just flanked her yeah I guess that'll do the job huh pick up their weapon use their weapon against their team oh never we already won nicely done you know nice weapon skins okay Oh megaBrain strategy I'm actually just gonna go the way I'm supposed to because they all went the flank I know a bit of a gamble we'll see if it pays off so far it appears yes they all oh wait a second well one person went the route they were supposed to oh my god nevermind the whole the whole enemy team did what the fudge where'd that come from others so weak but I have to reload just in the nick of time oh god I didn't see the other no doubt it was so young so supple so warm I don't know what I'm about anymore I'd be talking about those cinnamon rolls I had this morning oh the double oh my god get destroyed no oh Jesus oh how do I couldn't even aim a hip fire Jesus here's the problem I sprayed in parade I remember step one spray but I forgot step to pray you know what is this like some cool nano night smoke looking something here we go take that for me all right that gives me a distraction downstem does not even damage you I that's my bet I'm dead here just I'm just gonna flee that I don't even give you the satisfaction god I wish I would clink Clank a little quieter though like Jesus all right there's a kill though now they were flanking me so I have to flank after killing their flanker it only makes sense they were getting rezzed couldn't have that watch for their spawn the Omega flank and around one let's go one more game for the rest of our lives ladies and gents let's do this Oh can we make this oh this looks fun oh well time skip here I've never been here before oh Jesus Bob oh my god I direct hit her with that ok she's down your smoke won't protect you but I'll actually use it as protection oh wait what the fudge just killed me yoyoyo no no please come on somebody Nick Nick Nick I see I misplaced my trust don't appreciate you flanking and killing my team if you can't tell this is flank for the game mode we all want the kills let's be a real oh gotta kill through the glass I'm gonna take that got a pad the L stance there and I see this guy in this corner right here at my abilities almost back you miss anything give me a second all right and pop toss that over there gives me a little time to make a move just like that I'm now in position to kill the enemy team off their spot example a oh they didn't expect me to be right there I know even I feel oh my god Jesus yeah that's their entire enemy team I ain't dealing with that you're crazy Jesus ah alright hold on oh no there's a third what a ruse what every what a ruse I'm coming I'm coming Oh No I actually did want to get you I'm sorry Oh nightshade the heck is this thing oh my god oh my god oh why you just rushing in there I love it I'm coming to support you yeah my undying love and gratitude let's go oh fudge I know and that was a bit dumb dumb but it doesn't matter another victory eliminations first downs first damage dealt oh okay first I don't know what to tell you aside from the fact then I'm actually loving this game hopefully it's fun to watch if there's something particular you want to see in a future video let me know so with that I want to thank y'all very much for
