hi ATO v1 my name's mr. Furth and welcome back to destiny - yeah you like the new armor I recently grinded out the season pass dude what can I say my my wallet grinded out the season post listen I'm not proud of it but I'm just I'm keeping the lights on over at Bungie alright you're all welcome but we have a catastrophe on our hands and we'll get into that in a second but in the meantime I don't know if Ace of Spades is still good but I love the gun so that's what we're gonna be messing around with today because obviously if you watch my most recent destiny video trials of osiris is coming back which means your boy here has to stop being a scrub dust off the old d2 PvP and get ready to go flawless so with that lets us embark on our journey actually wanted to make this video though because I wanted to talk about some stuff a classic commentary video I debated making a vlog but I just wasn't really feeling it if he's been in the loop with the channel and myself the past week I've been sick but started to feel better at the end of last week over Saturday night everything got worse much worse oh my goodness look at you anyway Saturday night wasn't looking so good started with like a little bit of a headache guys like I'll shake it off maybe try and sleep on it went to sleep hour later I wake up and just complete sweats nauseous everything is just terrible essentially just having hot flashes shakes chills nausea the I won't get into all the details thought it might potentially be food poisoning but some of the Simpsons didn't check out as well as the flu but again some of the symptoms didn't check out Saturday night was just rough let's just say that I can't believe a head shot that dude so eventually after a very long night I'm able to get to sleep actually stay asleep wake up the next day Sunday feel better I'm like alright I was weird but it's past try and get up thankfully I get the podcast up and about same time I render that out and the other guy didn't die this is just this is terrible news but I will get that kill in fact I'm not even I'm just I'm not even gonna touch him I let him burn out yeah the painful way so yeah after about an hour barely getting that video up everything literally almost every symptom just returns out of nowhere again and the thing about Saturday night - is it was very instant like a thunderclap like it wasn't there and then it was just like a storm and it was miserable I was like okay this sucks buzz like all right I'll took a really long hot shower got some steam going then laid around tried to lay in bed just lie down hydrate all right maybe we'll just it'll pass it wasn't it was still just getting worse so I was like all right well you know I'm over it I need to figure out how to make this better so I went to Urgent Care long story short we're not entirely sure what the issue is but they gave me some sort of a but they gave me a butt shot I gotta tell you I've never had a shot my butt not that great not that great the initial you know stick whatever whatever you want to call it not not terrible whatever I can do shots but then I guess he had trouble like getting it all in I I don't know the specifics I'm trying to get my moment I'm gonna burn screwie all Thorne yeah it hurt a good bit and then I tried to sit down it's like yeah so anyway they gave me this anti-inflammatory thing because they think it might have been some crazy migraine episode which is odd because I've I have very occasional migraines but not a lot you know it's not something I'm known for it and it didn't feel like a migraine necessarily but so far the shot helped and so I'm I'm hoping that's what it is because when it comes to sickness I don't care what I have the thing that worries me is that I just don't know what I have it's the question marks you know because if I know what it is fine I know what to do or how to combat it or what to do to minimize blah blah blah blah how to get better that's all I care about but when it's unknowns god only knows what it is it's hard trying to talk about all this though and play well I'll give you that much but hey that's just preparing me for the trousers of osiris i'll be with my boys Oh granted we will be a little more concentrated but oh Jesus oh God oh shoot him oh you killed him let's go so there's just this thing I wanted to specifically talk about though while I wasn't feeling great is well what I had anxiety just because it came out of nowhere and it came up even the next day after I thought I was better so then I'm just like alright well what if I just go to sleep and it all just I wake up again with all the symptoms again like it is it just is it this is my life but more so what I do is I catastrophize I'm not sure if I'm alone here but when I'm sick it's like 8 million times worse now if you're not familiar with catastrophizing essentially well you it's like going down a rabbit hole right something happens and you immediately start thinking worse cases whether it is something that's actually happening and you catastrophize what is happening to you currently or you catastrophize about current or future events rather i catastrophize about future stuff when something's happening it's like that's it the whole world's died also this guy saw me popped hammers he's like nope but you're not getting away yes you are all right sick dude what a great super pop this is just this is lovely this is fan this is fair okay three that's not bad I'll take that everything looks like a nail when you use a hammer check this out ready I'm gonna predict the head shot height which is right about here and as soon oh come here come here come here where are ya ah too early don't melee me wasn't worth it oh god I did it up but I'm still coughing did I shove all my congestion to you my life sax I have a compromised immune system I don't know what it is man sometimes I can be healthy but once I'm sick it's like I'm in the throes of it for months it's like I'm never just fully healthy for a really long time and it sucks man I'm gonna be honest but whatever it is what it is anyway it makes me appreciate more when I'm healthy you know I don't know why I rushed that I straight up just start thinking like alright I'm sick but what if I never get better is this a life I want to live and then obviously it's really depressing thoughts I started to have and then I think about people who are more sick and have all those innocent might how do those people do it how are they that strong I can't be that strong and then it's just it's never ending so why not wanted to ask does anyone else do this I talk to my fiancee she doesn't she thought it was bizarre and that's when I was like oh wait what this isn't this isn't a thing everyone does when they're sick now granted i'll catastrophize sometimes even when I'm healthy it's just kind of part of my anxiety and my depression which was why some times it can exacerbate it or like for instance with my YouTube February was the worst month I've had on YouTube in the past three years now add that with my anxiety that doesn't it's that's why YouTube can be tough on me sometimes because then it's just like oh my gosh this is it all right well we're never this this is just how it is and it's just gonna keep the client and then put blob on people I don't think like that you if only or that simple right people with anxiety know what I mean where somebody's like oh well just don't think that or don't but yeah if only it were so simple right same with depression oh just don't be sad for it Oh trust me that's me I'd love to I would love nothing more so anyway that's one time I with my catastrophizing this why sometimes with YouTube that'll happen or why I try not to vocalize it too much because I know not a lot of people want to hear about it oh my gosh like I missed can I get a kill without him killing me no that's the thing too is like sometimes I know that I'm being silly ish but am i you know that I guess is the kind of thinking like but that's that's not really how it's how it's gonna is it's gonna be literally the world does not seem more bleak than when I'm sick and I can't help it and it's it's terrible and it honestly like compounds on a sickness it almost makes probably makes things worse because mentally I'm not feeling well on top of physically so it's just like I really am just weird aren't I like is this just is this just me there's got to be some other people out there right like you just get sick and then it's like I don't even remember what it feels like to be good to be well will I ever be well again how long will this last for is this a life and then like I said just it just goes on and on and then it eventually gets to this ridiculous end game where I'm thinking about some future that is almost entirely unlikely but then I'm like this is this is it this is my life really I've just I just want to feel like I'm not the craziest person in the world I know I'm up there but you know maybe there's other people who like like me please did you raise your hand right now say something that is why there's only gonna be one video today thankfully I'm happy that I'm able to get this video out today we'll see if I'm feeling better for the rest of the day but I woke up the same way I did yesterday Sunday morning when I was like oh cool it's gone our and I'm like all right and it's all back so I'm hoping today nope we're good we're past it and I can get back to videos because I didn't have anything prepared which thankfully we had the podcast ready so I was able to get that up Sunday but I also just feel very lonely and sad and pathetic I am pathetic when I get sick and I know it I'm like a big baby and it I just can't help a man is that other people too I know some people are like put a brave face on or whatever good for you that is not me I just become one big giant whiny baby why don't why it's just I'm just like yeah like that like I just feel like everything in the world is dying and life's hopeless so that's just kind of how I act - yeah super interactive right but anyway that's oh hello oh get momentum or eat bread that one's for Kade that one's for you my boy they're all in there Jesus Wow yeah like when I'm sick I I hate being alone I don't care what it is I just need to be around somebody because again this is gonna sound terrible and we've but this is me catastrophizing I'm like I just don't want to die alone I tell you like seriously it's it's bad news when I get sick when I'm sick you guys need to worry because I'm probably well so there's different kinds of sickness though last week when I just have like it was pretty much it felt like the common cold right oh yeah whatever that's fine I'm uh I'm decibel I'm not like super paranoid or anything they still go about my day there's some annoying sister like maybe I can't record or do this or that just because of you know different reasons usually because like you know I'm too nasally whatever but so yeah whatever I'll get over it but when it's like physically feel terrible half the lie in bed can't do anything the thing too is as feeling I it was literally like Sunday I laid around in a bed and did nothing not even like watching stuff because that would exacerbate everything was literally just like lying with my eyes shut for an entire day well that doesn't help because then my mind just wanders and it's just an endless cycle and I'm gonna get sniped again oh my god I'm alive my body it's just what I'm like immobilized by sickness it's just when like oh man I know and then now that I'm feeling a little bit better you know the like I should be like oh but remember this is what it feels like to be better well I can't think about that the moment I try but then all I can think about is how bad I feel I don't really know where I'm going with this I think I just you guys like my therapy session right now yes I just need to get sat here I mean how much do you guys bill can I force you guys his therapist I don't know if I if each what are you available I certainly can that's a lot of you holy crap all I can say is mental illness is fun man yeah when I'm sick and all I need is a little positivity but my body refuses to give me an e I'm like come on man give me something there's somebody to is right this is this is bad news I'm hardscoping so hard right now oh you're one I didn't realize I'm pushing we push those no never mind you have friends head all the right places oh somebody popped hammers should I pop my name in reply these are the questions we must ask and no I don't think I should sir I just I just wanted to get over there to pop my hammers you couldn't just let me do that thing next destiny video though I'm gonna be trying out auto rifles grip we're gonna figure out which one we like my problem is cuz I don't I haven't grind it in a while I don't have good roles for stuff you know I'm saying I just got basic stuff so I hope that whatever turns out to be good I I have doubtful incredibly doubtful I don't know I honestly don't like it's weak I kind of feel better though just talking about it with you all that does not make me feel better though he just dabbed on me I just want to get back to work and I like making videos I like feeling productive I'm a workaholic but that's totally fine with me I just get a lot of a lot of I get a lot out of feeling like I'm working towards something being productive like learning coding is really nice because it's something I can do in my free time that feels productive because I'm learning I don't know if I've talked about this too much I might haven't so my depression videos but I have a really hard time with free time and I know that sounds weird but I don't know how to utilize my free time one sort of the depression makes it so that I don't have a lot of interest in things or things I would have been interested in I have since lost interest I don't know it's tough and so if it doesn't feel productive I have a really hard time convincing that it's worth it and that's really unhealthy and it's kind of a mental framing thing that I've tried to work on well forever and still trying to work on to this day hopefully one day I'll solve the case but I doubt I will so just trying to find workarounds well like coding that's something I can do outside of making videos and stuff where I can still feel productive and feel it not feel guilty or strange about what I'm doing and I know to some of you who like don't have depression or anxiety or stuff this all probably just sounds wild ooh you're like bro what are you talking about and I know I know it's a problem it's a problem but that's just how my brains wired and I'm not here to try and warrant some sympathy empathy you pity me anything like that everybody's got something this just happens to be what I am and I deal with it the best that I can so I want to thank you all very much for watching for being my shrink today for listening to me ramble on thank you for tuning in and leaving any comments or anything like that I hope you guys enjoyed this video and with that I want to take all four much watching hi bezel is a fantastic i'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
