Nesbitt but I like Robinson better okay is that your final name whereas mrs. Nesbitt is a fictional character based on a fictional character from a movie Wow that goes deep shark DNA it sounds like you'd give me something sure it's just Jackson or what's that okay so Robbins finish what you're saying mrs. Robinson I hate to tell you this but although I thought it would have been mrs. Smith would it have been correct no no mrs. no Minnesota what if so what is I mean you guys don't love that up Meyer is Mazal field Fletcher hand soap and hand strain of times it's a hot commodity now I will say I'm having to input a few because for me on Google it has mists and Robinson at number eight attention is here that some of these are a little different so I'll have to be careful and that's why I'll enter some if I'm not sure yeah that's very but that leads over to team stands with a score of twenty mm good start good start all right next up we're gonna bless and Rob on the podium please look away from your screen the next round begins how does Google autocomplete this search coconut blank hi buddy rock you say buddy but Rob what would you say for coconut blink water oka no I've heard of that before I'm appalled for you Robin I will say that in current google it has that number three so i don't know what's on this so that leads us over to bless bless body and being bless yes please sorry champion bless buddy what would you want what is coconut oil board team-high warlord you want to play you want to pass i love the positivity i mean how much could there be right it's just coconut you know what I'm saying do you want to play or pass we're gonna play you're gonna play we love to see that we love it when the team's really we really take their ownership so we're coming on back over here - dad Oh dad oh you guys are coming off a win you're the first Google Feud champions coming back to claim your rightful throne you guys feeling good again I'm feeling good about coconut yeah sizing up stands here you can it man you know the fact that coconut water was not on there sort of blowing my mind though but hey I'm gonna go with coconut ice cream okay coconut ice cream people love their frozen treats but do they love to google them well he hits the double double double whammy whammy whammy movie which means you only need two you have three out of the five that's big that's big but I'll take it so shark was a UH what's up I'll tell you what's up coconut milk is up now how does wanna go drink that milk because I you know call me crazy but but I haven't seen a nipple on a coconut so how does one extract the milk I don't know but it's number five on the board one more stands between team high warlord and the first actual win in google feud that wasn't handed to them this is this is landmark right here ladies and gentlemen but the rules are 5 ok you agreeing to this team stands ok I don't need this from you what I do need from Daddo their weight now Blass is your next answer is this the one to claim the dub on this round or under the next answer so I don't know if you guys know this but I'm building a fence and today I was at a home improvement store looking at trees that's your way of that's true I love the story time you had me going I was hanging on every word you said coconut tree I felt that one oh hey it's a good trap oh it's up to dad oh now dad oh do it to him give one give one okay Wow Daddo coconut want I'm gonna go with coconut shavings coconut shavings I hate those especially and so does Google correct yeah yes well actually no well I won't put it in the last one because it I should be able to match it up I got one so short business you gotta let me bill up the hype here come on all right there's no suspense who cares okay okay coconut from shark for the win or for the past 40 B stands to possibly capitalize here sure coconut well coconut bra coconut that is not where I would have taken that but will Google have taken it right now that's probably on there and I feel like their team stands hey do you have an answer here to steal this grasps of team award he said shavings but I'll say it more so thing in flakes coconut flakes like I don't know or coconut flavor like coconut flavouring like it I don't know what you said you had something yeah well I was gonna say broth and what are you okay I think then paid between flavoring or coconut chay-ara flakes lotion coconut lotions not bad a lot of a lot of good discussion in here I'm gonna mean the answer here soon team stands but what's the thing you eat in the coconut the white stuff what does that technically call coconut what it's called coconut no joke it's the meat of I think so too you could either do coconut meat or coconut fruit cuz people are very dumb very dumb so just like let's do coconut me like Gmail emails I'm gonna meet our final answer here team stands coconut [Music] coconut meat survey says up on the board I was gonna say coconut rum shrimp all good options again I don't know how you got robbed like my Google has coconut tree up there coconut water you if you said coconut flakes interesting interesting and that means team-high warlord gets 25 26,000 the score right now 26,000 222 I believe I close the stream we can do this let's go chat that ties the double the points so moving on over I'm gonna do a new category for the double points this is evidently category people up first we'll need a dough and Danielle say I after I finish this sentence if you think you have the right answer how does Google autocomplete this search how to get rid of your blank a confident I have a Danielle from team stands Danielle what would you get rid of I mean if the categories people the first thing that came to mind was mother-in-law because people hate their mother-in-laws hmm how to get rid of your mother-in-law and this is people right it's people I don't ask me why I don't know I click people gives me this question I can do it as far as I know I'm gonna go completely against that and say how to get rid of your car how to get rid of your car he says well the board says no Ren and with a double strikeout we move on to the next one sister no chin period faster next up we have shark and Sonic how does Google autocomplete this search this game is blank I [Music] wowthat's yeah okay yeah that on our age that came in at the same time okay so the ultimate tiebreaker the ultimate tiebreaker I'm thinking of a number between one and ten whoever's closer is to go first so save your numbers whenever you want seven nine it was seven Sonic lands right on it Sonic this game is garbage survey says personally I'm offended as the host and for good reason No so shark this game is and I'm talking about this game in general okay I have no ideas rigged it's always rigged and the Board says it's rigged to 9,000 points team high warlord double point round by the way play or pass I want to say it's more fun to play you know it's more fun if you can't why not right okay so come on over I'll come on over and we doing champion bliss here's my man what's going on oh man you know I'm just diving my hand into a box of laroy's right now it's a tangerine flavor you want one mmm passed me wanna oh yeah yeah why not carbonation is a good you know sip at this tangerine lacroix I'm gonna say this game is over Oh game over for you ah not on the board not on the board bring it around back a beginning dad oh this game is what this is this is very ominous what game whose game the game we're playing you know I'm gonna go positive I'm gonna say this game is good okay oh I love I love that positive I want to later on in the session know if this game is sponsored by Rachael Legends we want this game is good at this game is sponsored by rates so we're gonna go with good good yeah good this game is good no what is not take your positivity out of here it says that's two strikes moving on over back to shark the man the myth the legend that could see through whatever this question is he saw that it's rigged can you see what else today's games also trash and garbage or we go with this game he said trash is trash are big garbage day so that leads me back over to bless bless you might mean maybe a little too much Lacroix hey so how about this time give me something on the board yeah you know I was just sipping my zero calories you're a sweetener and Lacroix I love this stuff this game is fun this game is fun this game is fun thank you I'm glad someone agrees survey says okay no one agrees with you it's not that's the first right it's autocomplete so my this base / - no team stands what is this game this game is what team stands I need your answer talk about yourselves this game is free or bad let's just not overthink it and maybe you go back we do let me let me check with my higher-ups no yeah no you can't sorry heck is this game bad for the double point round or not who is ever googled this game is real okay seven card stud a little specific this game is by Sula so that means double points only 28,000 a low around a low round but team high warlord still takes it still come back well if they can get the triple point round round everybody look away if it makes you feel any better I don't even feel good about winning listen Rob up on the podium hey now come on hey keep your distance whoa I just like yeah triple point round lot on the stakes here team high Warwick can cement the what's the category name still it's whatever this was which is people which don't ask me how that it doesn't matter you need you to answer this for me yes how does Google autocomplete this search I want to buy a blank I I heard Rob Rob you want to buy a what I want to buy a pet a patch okay a lot of people curious about that of course of course survey says no which means black 97 Corolla people wanna buy I already hate it what would people want to buy well I recently got the app Robin Hood which if you don't know it's buying stocks and I bought stocks in Nintendo so I want to say I want to buy a Nintendo switch hey those are hot right now market fine he wants to buy a Nintendo switch does the internet agree with them scrub I thought everyone hates timeshares how does Google autocomplete this search cucumbers are blank Hey that would be Sonic with the right vowel delicioso he says it's I can imagine someone's like I want to find like-minded people like myself a nice community who likes cucumbers nobody what are cucumbers cucumbers are pickles hey that's a good question that's a good question it's on the board hey okay team high warlord this is the last round triple points do you play or do you pass let's go full eggplant guys I'd say I play it okay because I was gonna say statistically the people that play usually win because I don't think we've ever had anyone steal so ya choose to play we bring it on over to team high or Lord it is in their hands for now bless ya how's it going but you're a cucumber man I know you know hey you know you know I'm actually miss cucumber oh wait I did not know that no no I didn't know they gave me like bio sheets of like all the people come on the show but that's not on there they didn't do the research formal sorry I'm just taking a sip of my god cucumber look frying it's not gonna happen dude we're not gonna you want what no root fruit a man after my own heart are they are they not people they're curious I believe that we all learned a little bit about ourselves and cucumbers today dad oh three all right more but I'm I go big boy okay cucumbers are not vegetables Oh I like it I like it okay that is searched are not vegetables Vegeta bowls survey sense okay hey Google says yes we know it me we know how unforgiving this game is if it puts it on the board it's on the board so okay where's our fruits or vegetables they're both my answer was either answer was gonna be why I won't say it well two more to go here you you've got all your strikes all the eggs are in your basket currently Chardin cucumbers are cucumbers are evil we hate them we hate them or they professed sorcery upon me but not the Google searches cucumbers are they are neutral they don't align anywhere okay so quick quit putting your agenda on cucumbers please bless enough with your I'm sponsored drink what's next if you tell me you were sipping on some I'm gonna come up with there and whack you with the cucumber you knows today you guys know I was you know looking at plants and I was like wow I can make a garden and you know what I found a cucumber plants and you know what the cucumbers were slimy okay oh okay I was like alright with our cucumbers slimy do the people want to know just ladies and gentlemen we are an unprecedented weight now what you were here before when we yeah we were at four before and you guys still choked so will you choke this time or will you take victory in your own hands not relying on the enemy to fail but for you to succeed dad OH cucumbers apart let's just go simple humors are good okay cucumbers are good like this looking for like-minded people very easy way out yeah our cucumbers good this team high warlord win the game two strikes two strikes so that leaves us with shark games online just for you this is up to you what are cucumbers my friend they're not evil cucumbers are gross Rose all right I'm starting to think you have a vendetta against cucumbers but whatever they're evil they're gross our cucumbers gross I'm gonna have to ask team stands to look away hi war doesn't matter but do not say anything that you see if you're wrong the team stands you're not looking right our cucumbers gross so it actually heads on over the team stands that's questionable but what's not up for question is your answer in season cucumbers are in season like well if they're looking for you know I like healthy this is it cucumbers are healthy you guys saying cucumbers are healthy but that up on the board and survey says for the game art cucumbers healthy no go same high warlord don't ask me I said first yeah don't ask don't eat hey I should have said it like man pickles are gross Issei there's some reason for some reason it gave dad all the fruits or vegetables and not what type of vegetable and then it didn't give him grosser good don't ask we should've got that point forcing evil because they're haunted that's a little different I think technically we probably could have done good I don't think gross because gross si that's kind of very specific so with that ladies and gentleman that concludes the second google feud team high warlord finishes with down 23 times 3 plus whatever they had is a lot compared to team stands not a lot which means T my warlord back-to-back champion 123 pounds I feel good about it you're confused I'm confused the contestants are confused that's Google food cucumbers are on my mind batter that I remember kids raise your cucumbers well or else they'll become evil the next one forgot to get you cumbers spayed neutered also remember they're gross [Music] [Music]
