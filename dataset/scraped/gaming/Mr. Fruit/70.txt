come on auto aim do something for me auto aim i don't know find your target i hate everything about it uh we might be dead will i be dead oh my god look at the poison spread though aiming who look at that heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and it's an exciting day our first video in witch queen you're going to notice something a little bit new a little more fiery and i'm not talking about my hammer yeah i got the new exotic exotic helmet for titans because at the end of legendary campaign you get to choose one and how could i not i mean look at this thing and i i'm not against the uh the perk you know it's not bad and for our first video i thought we'd do a little review on the first brand new exotic you're probably gonna receive in which way the osteo strica i don't know if that's how the heck you pronounce it that's what a normal looks like this is the ornament i think you got it if you just pre-ordered witch queen will rock default for now i i kind of i kind of dig both but this one ain't bad it comes with bug unrivaling steady rounds hand laid stock but its intrinsic trait fires a stream of sentient toxic projectiles that track the targeted enemy that's right auto aim auto assist toxic and deep with toxic overload landing the final blow or multiple precision hitch triggers burst that poisons nearby targets if yes super fun to use in pve you just start shooting things and then suddenly everything's just burning and dying you're like this is this is this is incredible how's it gonna fare in pvp wow that went we're gonna find out today aren't we because one way or another we're getting this video done baby because i've been playing witch queen for 15 hours straight since it released it's it's i'm tired but i'm ready for some freaking content dude and i don't know if anyone's playing pvp so let's do this oh momentum control is here well that is intervesting but no we're just gonna hop in control probably better things to rock than the worly splendor helm right now don't care oh you know what i should probably do ah fudge put on some like smg reloaders or something so as you can tell by well like i mentioned you getting the exotic helmet and my power level i did complete legendary campaign and i gotta say so freaking sick this campaign was so good that last mission man sheesh that was sick and it wasn't easy that was the fun part too but we're here we actually like got auto filled into a lobby so i don't know if that should be wearing or not but check this out best of all it even almost sounds like the niggler from halo which is fitting because it's essentially the niggler but in destiny oh and i'm auto amy baby and i am so very dead oh my god did you see that poison burn i stopped shooting him a while ago but boy it ain't over yet it ain't over till i say it's over oh this is bad this is bad this is bad but is he's not burning i didn't get enough precision kills okay so initial tt kill okay if i'm gonna say tt time to kill ttk isn't crazy but to be fair that's because of a lot of the uh it's because a lot of the power does come from possibly burning and it does have to bounce itself out somewhere it does indeed have auto-aim so that's something to keep in mind yeah i'll take it are we gonna lose some 1v1s against hand cannons yeah as yeah yeah we are that's all i gotta say we're gonna we're gonna freaking we're gonna get a kill i swear by the old gods i'm just saying time to kill you know hand cannon three head shots less than a second uh this thing couple seconds maybe i not entirely sure actually i don't i don't know when oh come on that's a kill baby and a little toxic explosion that won't help at all because nobody was here let's get get some help i'll put it this way it's it's a good thing that this it's he's invisible i can't see it he's there's so many people go auto honing projectiles which apparently didn't end up hitting anything it's okay if i just keep spraying maybe they'll hit something i don't know oh my oldest spot healing okay i'm just uh okay i pictured this going a lot better in my head i kind of i picked well let me put this way i pictured getting some kills but i mean you know what what should i there's a kill because if this thing was just absolutely cracked everybody in their mind would be pissed i'd be pissed you know why am i still in this match i would not be oh my god look at that okay he was literally afk and that's the fastest i could kill him come on auto aim do something for me auto aim i don't know find your target felt pretty okay guys it's it's day one of the new dlc who the [ __ ] is playing pvp anyway and it's a five stack at that we we were we were set up for failure ooh some new uh some new booties eat monsters for breakfast [Music] try this one again yeah i level up in the season pass i did i can get into exotic i'm gonna refrain i'm gonna stay strong i don't need to the new crafting system though and then leveling up the gun is so sick and like the originally shaped date is even cooler so you might have a gun and you look back like dude like this is literally day one witch queen oh and also there is a catalyst or something like that uh we'll play with ornament there's something that you can craft but the weapon has to be level 10 and then you need three of these things which i do have but they're not easy to come by in fact i bought one for 400 legendary shards which you can only buy once a week pretty steep pretty steep but you know i paid the price literally because i bought it with 400 legendary shots welcome to the fortress are there new pvp maps i don't know if there's no i feel like probably not because when was the last time we got a new pvp map actually so here's what's gonna happen all right i'm gonna throw this grenade i'm gonna get hit by everyone and their mom i'm gonna step that was their mom right there everyone was preparing to shoot me but their mom showed up first yo do i have some enhanced radar or something what the [ __ ] is going on here is it this gun you're dead i do have sun warrior right now this could be incredible or nothing could come of it oh he's burning is he burning no i not touch let's go we got a toxic cloud explosion nothing came from it oh oh that's gonna spread okay i have already gotten as many kills this game as we did last game i'm not saying it was the ornament because i'm not it's the well so far it's the fact that it's not a five stack that's helping a lot okay look at that from downtown funky stuff malone why what are with these early good jolly freaking poopoos i'm sorry that's all i can think poo pee pee poo poo it's like really and here's the thing i've been grinding like 120 hours just the past two weeks to get ready to grind like you see what i'm saying but also look at this dude look at this exotic you get me in critical unless you if i can kind of back up boom little sunspot pops on me sun warrior suddenly i'm healing like come on cheese oh yes oh my god i got precision shots around that corner i mean a little generous am i gonna complain no you're dead okay uh we might be dead we may not be dead but we're we're gaming but where are they i'm just freaking i'm just letting him fly man i don't know i don't know he's he went oh my god i think eli didn't get a kill but i assisted no please please i'm too young and pretty mainly too pretty dude the healing look at this i'm so good yeah i'm dead oh look at that the little sunburst melee thing freaking gotta kill man and also we're popping out for the oscar street now not by by any chance either because it's just that good man look at that look at that aiming who what not the greatest of crucible well boy oh my god look at the poison spread though look at the poison spread if i had gotten the kill the other guy might have actually died with the with the toxic cloud spread but we may well frankly we may never know he he's gonna live he's gonna live don't tell me that don't tell me something like that i don't wanna hear that it's terrible news why okay i i got a super early typically i hold on to these but why would i hold on to it oh please try me he's tethering hey you know i essentially ate two supers well imagine if this gun one shot on the win any any whim also get absolutely pooped off and you didn't have to aim i just one shot everything yeah that's the lure wrench driver i hate it so much i hate everything about it please peek me why why look at that or poo poo pee pee in that order all right what do you want from me all right you take the aggro for me buddy i only got a couple off wait none of those auto ended for me bro he's like oh my god we're getting out of him yeah you are getting auto farm more like it like you think you've got the you think you've got the jump uh-uh no because i got the auto in now if i was using any other weapon where i could just normally aim myself would they have died sooner yes but that's not the case okay that's not what happened and we we don't need to say here daydreaming about what could be or couldn't be what you do appreciate the ost you have to say it like that by the way for what it is for what it does and not for what it doesn't and you are not a single one of those hit that's i'm so dead here or am i try harder you nerds too many of those nerds though can only dodge so many you like that you like that why did so few of those hit though hmm oh you're dead you're dead you're dead you're dead you're dead you're dead why did the projectiles are also evidently much slower than you might think i don't know i don't i'm just i'm gonna be honest i'm holding left click at this point i don't know i have a false advertising i don't know like point general vicinity hold left click it should kill him yeah well you know results may vary evidently oh come here you're not getting away from me well you are but you're not getting away from my team now i don't exactly know what the catalyst or whatever does i was just so busy going like ooh can i make this and not like ooh what does it do i know it adds a lot of reload speed i think probably something else too come on here we go this is this is optimal this is prime that's an assist but this will no dude all they have to do is like tap a and d at a range which is fair i guess i mean this is this is a sub machine gun even if it is auto aim oh my god i don't know what that was on both of our parts why wait wait 10 seconds guys wait don't die we could throw here oh it's it's two to two i know what you're thinking mister aren't you about to die no see because i held them at b see i do like this thing too they give you these red borders which is which is attunement and really you don't need to know anything about it except that if you just use it enough you you get these cool like l it's cool it's just fun because then you like end up using a lot of guns you wouldn't otherwise and like see i got a couple here i've already completed so you know all right i'm gonna make a mistake i'm going in the rumble hi guys hi oh you guys look great well one of you look pretty basic but that's also what the fudge where am i uh orient yourself hurry and that is oh wait i actually traded [ __ ] all things consider that's pretty good he came at me with the i think a grenade launcher shot into uh yo check this out by the way denying heavy pog do i need it no am i gonna use it yeah why not boosh freaking punch you i don't know why you're not dead we'll trade we'll trade got so rudely interrupted by myself that um yeah gonna see you run at me though without firing back five feet in front of me bro this thing melts see see only my strafe oh okay oh i mean that one was just kind of clean oh this guy's done for me strafe it run from it you can't avoid it yeah the fact that this so the reason we keep trading is you know projectiles a little slow damage is kind of well it ain't front loaded tell you that much oh i thought i was going to catch him fighting the other guy and then maybe something with poison and that's a shotgun but so despite what uh what i might want shut them down it might just you know kills might come a little slower than i'd like i did not get a properly heal up but uh well we made it work anyway so let's get it let's see if i can't momentarily weaken somebody not didn't even come close to touching them it's it's not a grenade launcher that's for sure and if you're like oh whoa what do you tease them as fruit was that's the new glaive weapon yeah wow guess what watch this channel because next upload you know what you're gonna see some glaive gameplay i haven't used it yet in fact the few times you've seen me pull out this video are the only times you've used the pvp but that hey we gotta save it for each other okay i'm i'm actually competitive in this game okay so maybe we should just keep to rumble with it you know not every gun is good at everything you know know its strengths play accordingly auto aim auto aim trader to kill auto worm yeah take a podium weapon level up i think i got a pinnacle drop i think that's my pinnacle drop let's freaking get it what else did i get i went to my freaking postmaster well leveled up oh my glaive oh very nice we are we were pretty solidly in second place sir in fact yeah i mean he's super so he he got a good bit more damage but we were we were in there you know that's all you need to know the ostia striga real good in very specific very very specific scenarios and it actually seems to benefit a little bit more from smaller pop pvp mattress if you're going to use in pvp in pve yo i'm telling you slap that thing on hold left click enjoy ton of fun pvp is a different different story and i don't know if like i've always been known for doing you know pvp shenanigans if you do want to see some pv stuff though where would you want me to try it and or do it because and i don't know maybe like a gambit matching or something which is asking a lot frankly but you know for you guys i'll consider it with that said i thank you all much for watching have some fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music] you
