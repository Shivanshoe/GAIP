it about i'm just putting it out there whoa i feel like that's a threat oh no i think i'm gonna get demonetized that is a great way to start it i like it oh my god how do i draw this oh i i i got i got mr fruits i have to look them up if you saw my attempt last time i cannot remember for life from what banjo looks like okay and then i have to draw kazuya probably also a little too big we'll do something like this not huge on this color this is also this is just a trash drawing my apologies i swear i'm better than this but this mouse latency it's got blue eyes beautiful blue eye it's like that then it's more like that okay perfect then he's got his little backpack point something like that comes down here doesn't quite make sense to me like that go oh fudge oh jesus i'm running out so much time uh fudge this was not according to plan what does kazooie look like he's like angry [Music] definitely did not get to finish that whoops i vastly ever estimated how much time i thought your problems made it very hard i can't use words i'm just putting that out there who is this i may have already broken that rule but in a funny way wow that my drawing is literally words words words words words words pretty much just words um [Music] the dude from weezer what the fudge lead singer of weezer rivers cuomo what does he look like what the [ __ ] he looks like something that would finger tomato sorry got like what kind of glasses like i have so what does that say about me nope and he's he's very satisfied with himself living in beverly hills pretty sure this is like loser's logo right

that i really tried the hell out of that oh my what is uh um wait i think okay i see somebody thinks they're clever i whoa whoa whoa let's keep these comms what do you mean thanks in a little corner and they thought no one would notice except i did yes did somebody draw a mogul i definitely broke some rules i mean i i there was there was a rule about no writing things and every drawing i've had so far has had drawings where they write the words no more i don't i'm tired of drawing multiple characters who is this oh my god i'm trying to think i think of what pepe pepe will be doing here we're going to do a kind of like a pepe hands here one of my favorite emotes an absolute classic and if you don't like it well random god now that sounds stuck in my head i'm not really looking at what i'm drawing just kind of going so when i look at the whole thing i might be horrified but i forgot to do his mouth what am i doing all right now just color him in like a darker green and he can't think of anything there good old pepe i love to hear the confidence over there rum oh all right here we go this is good the heck uh okay i don't i feel like i'm getting this wrong well rob i i see why you were asking about uh purple yeah but it's good thank you i mean assuming that it matches what you're trying to draw although i'm not sure what this square is it'll make sense all right i have only seen monstrosities i know you play with them i notice every time you play with us you go oh my god so i'm flattered to be fair i also oh my god what they draw so i'm glad they could be but something else
