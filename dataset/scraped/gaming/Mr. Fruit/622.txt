Hey hi how are ya mr. fruit here not podcast mr. fruit well my immersion show yeah actually funny story this the podcast is officially moving off of the main channel this will probably be the last one uploaded to this channel then next week I'll probably post a reminder just to let people know if you're looking for it's on this channel then after that bop it's gone the videos however that have been uploaded here are gonna stay here but go to the second channel there's a link down in the description box below really appreciate it if you do especially show this first video some love to help the channel the idea here is I've been told that like YouTube see really like assigns your channel a certain category and stuff in the algorithm after you've uploaded a few videos so point being my channel is never meant for podcast exclusively so this way it's easiest for people that want to find the podcast there'll be one channel or anything uploaded there is is podcast related I'm hoping to also do some highlights over there like some clips from the podcasts from time to time in between episodes sooner way go over there show that video some love so that it can hopefully get boosted plus I won't be making any money off that channel for probably a while because we have to meet the minimum threshold and then apply and then blah blah blah blah but I think it's a step forward for the podcast going well forward hurt bitter so click the link down the description box below subscribe if you want to make sure you're not missing any of the podcast again show the video some level I can comment on that one if you could that would be greatly appreciated like I said it'll continue over there and audio listeners I think I mentioned it in the podcast or something that you're about to hear nothing's changing so don't worry about that although you don't hear this if you're an audio listener so new channel check it out appreciate the support enjoy the podcast hi ad hope you won money miss mister fruit and welcome to the GG overeasy podcast in today's episode it is a questions and answers kind of episode we go through and answer every question our patreon stands have for us so the topics and the answer is very well drastically yeah it's a little bit all over the place so if you like a little olive cart you know a little bit of this will be that kind of a buffet of a podcast well you found it we hope you guys enjoy this episode with that said let's get into it [Music] welcome back to GG overeasy episode 39 why we're officially when is technically midlife crisis wait were they 30 away from 69 nice Hey we're where we've been they're like we've been at the midlife Carling and now it's hitting like a truck I wish easier our oh yeah well you're not wrong we are close to 30 a few things to cover real quick before we hop into this today's episode stuff first off big move from us Rob I don't know how we messed this up last episode the whole time we're talking about the Zack Snyder cut I saw yeah we're talking about BVS and not Justice League I don't know why that didn't even register someone commented that was like huh yeah I said didn't we yeah so see you didn't get that many comments commenting on it cuz you can't tell they couldn't tell most people yo yeah yeah you also did not say anything honestly yeah I think I don't know why have maybe you said like I think was some like but as long as they still have Jessie whatever in and I was like oh yeah and then I just thought BBS was like yeah stupid friggin and then we went off from there so whoops that's our bad what do you want from us tuber fake news second off well I'll edit into the video if it has actually swapped to a new channel so is this the last lightest could potentially be Eli's like one so is this like we had legacy now is this like no Wilson song full song the Encore no it'll uh it'll still go like we're still gonna keep numbering and stuff it's just I don't think I'm gonna bother to upload all 39 or whatever on the new channel okay because it might also just flood it or whatever so I'm gonna make a playlist and it'll just link to all the first ones and then we'll just go starting from if this is 39 39 or 40 or whatever but it should hopefully help the the podcast because the algorithm works and stuff I think it would be better it's not known as like a debt podcast channel or something like that yeah that's at least the the thing and if it doesn't work I guess you know failed experimental Oh click here to pre subscribe yes so do we celebrate if it's yeah but maybe not it also may be no we're figuring it out I'm actually not a big fan of champagne it's not that great what I don't like party no I mean it's tie yeah I'm a sucker for that fruity bubbly stuff like it just gets to me okay yeah well you know where I stand on it alcohol in general so you'd be hard-pressed to find any alcohol where I go like mm-hmm that's not bad you'd be hard-pressed to find anything edgy about you I had you try something lies because you draw a very young young just such a good boy hey hey if you watched well the day we're recording this is Thursday May 28th but I posted a video of golf at today and everybody's like whoa mister fruits like change because I'm a like a lot of innuendos and people are like whoa dude like which is you yeah boys like penis like stuff yeah change dude I don't like that yeah but everybody please don't do that yeah sorry so I'm getting cancelled but aside from that I you know new me what can I say how well have we done considering how well we done how could have we done I mean I honestly have to think about it we haven't been canceled yet yeah like what longer than my high school announcements talk that's right real talk put this funny so with that today's special episode is dedicated to our patreon stands we're going to you used to watch it like it's not like oh yeah yeah right like yeah don't get twisted yeah they still like normally you still watch you used to listen yes it's just we're gonna be going through all our patreon every single one of them on every burning question they've had however what I'm reading it yeah so this will be interesting should be quite an array of stuff though so hey this is actually a great question I feel like to kind of start us off it's a great question all what blue is review I thought about the same time okay I'm pulling one up now let's find ourselves a GG overeasy podcast review now we're only reading the five star ones correct oh I mean see but if we yeah if we were to read like a four or one star that's just we're gonna study it I just love the idea that I think might read my force R on the podcast Here I am going to randomly scroll and select a review that could be any stars oh but I found a five-star one all that's naturally just crazy we have here from sloths five I love you and this oh I've stars this is the best eight and a half star podcast out there if you're looking for something to laugh about and to make yourself big brain wait a minute is he trying to say that he feels big brain because listen to us he's like wow those guys are stupid this is me kind of riffing he's laughing with us not at us we a big brains dude right yeah why else would I have this giant forehead just all again since small script robbed fruit and blue bring you a podcast that has it all from gaming to big brain moments and the stories love you guys you are all MVPs thank very much slots thank you the gamba review read worked off very fun and now we gave a read off questions so the first one is from Robbie not me have you guys seen the new Minecraft dungeons game do you have any future plans on playing it I am I've seen a lot of it and it kind of seems like a really casual a RPG so that's why I want to give it a shot I haven't heard the greatest things about it though for some reason but I still want to try it it seems tight I mean a Minecraft a RPG that sounds too much shaming I think curse is the only one who's played it right yes I've almost beaten it oh wait it's short so for those unaware it's out now you can play for free fee of Xbox game pass otherwise it's 1999 so it's not meant to be like a you know massive game per se I guess and so because of that like if you if you wanted to just play and go through all the story missions or whatever like just straight through once I probably take like four hours in test and I though we were playing through one we cranked up the difficulty size we could every single time that probably meant it took a little bit longer we also did you can find like secret dungeons and levels which unlocks like secret levels and we did like one or two of those so we got a little sidetracked aside from that yeah it's like I would equate it to like a watered-down like a simplified a RPG or like a watered-down I don't even say Diablo just a RPG in general so if you never played the genre it's certainly a good place to start really approachable casual yeah yes I mean Rob I love our role plays literally the most casual game in existence and he's like ha no bro but like my server is pop you'd but like this is their this is a no casual loud build server bro Christian is the minecrafter now I am that crown is I had never I don't think I could do three hundred days in like survival my own horn 50 like that that's not like I don't know that that part of my graphic isn't fun for me I like I like building fun stuff see this is the perseverance of fruit though because in the past month he has totally thrown two different of his hardcore series one is minecraft and though he's black and white but he's still come back and managed to make it work that's perseverance dude it was like fine print it didn't make sense it's not we're not going to but you're still going right like yeah that's yeah that's less than all yeah like never give up you know do way so it's not a Nuzlocke then what is in those long but it's not oh my gosh we could go into this for everyone flashbacks the boom essentially like literally the gist of it is if you black out you lose but I didn't black out to lose any money I didn't white I didn't respond in the PC and because um and because levels are at levels are it's the only place in the game where levels are all normalized you can't use items and the enemy trainers pokemons weren't randomized like nothing about the randomizer worked so the account meet cherry you're just trying to get me all riled up next question minecraft unjust pretty cool content wise I don't know might just stick to the stream I may I might make I got I like video who knows I don't know it doesn't look like it something I can like just sink my teeth into I thought it'd be something way bigger I thought it was gonna be way now I'm waiting for the riot and or RPG for that this one is from a Winky when is the next destiny - dream team video question mark and then for emojis have like the sad pleading I want you know like why I like watering like your new baby mm-hmm I would say ask bunny when you get something to pick a video on that we're all like hey let's actually do this and it's not like Rob's like bro don't make me don't make me do it with like think about our video series on the Olympics literally had more production value than bungees Olympic min you're not wrong bro first of all the trip the Olympics was a team effort all right mm-hmm like that was like a full last team effort and that was rough because man did that teach me the lessons of the Internet of wow people can really be mean even when you're doing like a play yeah I think people were more invested in those teams than they were in this car like mr. Freeze's words Robin died I'm sorry I still get him to this day when what is our last Jesse Tube video can you guys say off the top of your head right now with our last test I'm thinking was like an iron banner video maybe yeah I honestly it's been a little while I want to start I'll start scrolling while you talk I think I think it was an iron banner idea for like two months after shadow key like that was the best I feel I don't think huh I don't think we've done any trials I think it was the video where we go flawless and the last thing we say is like no I've been robbed like you never have to play this game good we never did well you guys did I played some I mean I got the I got the stupid felwinter's lie I got the what's that ello the friggin exotic which game time isn't that the machine gun was stupid but the felwinter's lie was only like two hours maybe yeah it's crazy to think that this is probably the first season and probably since like last year and season of The Drifter where I've spent less than honestly is less than like five hours a week on this game if that yeah I'll go on Steam and I'll look and it'll say like friends played and it'll say the blue esso like six hours played recently which is like a week I'm like wow I'm happening for I'm like good yeah but my current schedule is log on do a Grand Master nightfall with like PG and ass on and then yep log out what else is there to do it it's not like and this promotion I watched a video Sammy posted of you guys playing like a Final Fantasy 14 rave it looked actually pretty sick it looks like really cool oh where did he put it it was on his YouTube channel it looked it was like a raid and it had like it was what was the laundry and my stairs is a labyrinth or something like that there was like love worth of Ancients it's a so there's 24 man raids in Final Fantasy they're super chill but it's legit 24 met 24 men three squads of eight he's going and beat the [ __ ] out of these giant bosses yeah it was pretty sick yeah it's super fun and I was like that looks way more fun than anything Destiny's related right now and I was happy that you were doing that instead we're happy the most this is the most time invested in a different game in a long time so I mean does it feel wrong do you feel like you cheating it feels right for that mr. fruit that's what I like to hear you know what else feels right the next question just gonna help segue okay Ethan Stevenson says what is your favorite breakfast cereal oh dude I gotta go I'm a huge honey bunches about standing I love honey bunches of oats I respect I can only had that like twice with the almonds I do I do I do I know nuts I do sorry but just like I feel like an 88 year old woman when I eat you guys are probably the type of dudes who like cashews like not even out I don't like any nuts just any nuts I'm out that's it we started I actually had a bowl of cereal oh this was Special K strawberries and that is my favorite special little little strawberry slices yeah here's a you know I'm afraid to admit it but Frost what I can't tell you the last time I had cereal why it's what I'm talking years like I don't remember the last time I've had cereal Zero's like comfort food yeah it's just easy and cereal do milk is milk is on but the problem is you good uh milk is now underrated milk is actually over eight no that's a hot take milk right I will never just drink them the glass of milk oh my god dude how's that gross that's just gross what do you mean dude I could [ __ ] up an ice cold like you're just like right now drinking a glass of milk is so good what the only time I ever drink milk is if I have it one cereal or cookies and milk that's you can't honestly sit here and say when you're done with the cereal you don't drink the milk of course I do if we've got a damn right you ready but the cereal milk it changes it it's not just milk you know still it creates a new base is still there you just added a little seasoning on to it yeah but the seasoning makes it way better and milk is just grow and by seasoning he means and a lot of it yes dude I could I can mess up fruit could you get fruit you gotta be with me on this I could mess up a glasses like a nice big glass you know night I will say I could go for a good class but then it's like okay i milked out for now yeah it's not someone gonna like but like a nice there's a limited milk meter yeah yeah so see i can't really measure that because everything makes me gassy so what's your favorite cereal i go back into the the corridors of mr. fritz mine thank you man what cereal what cereal really hit different probably Cinnamon Toast Crunch that's I have that in my pantry as well but it's like the family brand where it's not Cinnamon Toast Crunch comes in a bigger bag but it's like cinnamon toast crunch but but it might as well although I found it was it never hit as good as like the actual cinnamon toast crunch you're right about that but it's just like come on you gotta cut corners in some places and I just cut into my cereal whatever that have to be much cereal okay this next question is from not blue wheat loaf 112 oh we got some Rob's and blues low-cost players we know that you guys have done previous episodes where you talk about food everything from toasted buns to types of ramen although there will be no summit this year due to corona would you guys ever do a food review slash mukbang allah alone or with the dream team so I was actually thinking about this a lot right and I was actually I had like a straight up plan to pitch to you guys for fruit summit because we have so many different people in the group right mm-hmm I wanted to do a thing where everybody makes their own dish fish and then we all like eat it oh recorded but I thought like my I thought it was probably had to record that we maybe not necessarily but I was like I thought it would be fun little like bonding experience with like Oh tonight oh tonight blues making dinner whoo oh yeah you good I'm saying yeah I want to be tied if we did like yeah like like a bond if you guys are down for like frozen pizzas tonight on the menu we have a toast he knows and like nah you got Funyuns Faustino's the pepperoni oh you guys would like the dough see those we also have some thin mints Oh SB right right - all right would you like carbonated or non-carbonated - yes a honey button I got a lot of stuff in my butt sick oh it's so sugary I'm impressed I don't know if I could physically do a mukbang because I can't even watch those they trigger me too much you have to eat like yes that's like you doing that right though you didn't okay but you didn't lose it when you're eating okay you might lose it to mukbangs but that doesn't mean like you struggle eating at a table with people I mean if I was the only one doing it but if I was next to you guys you're but I would probably kill you guys how do you go to dinner with people what people your mouths closed and like manners pluses some ambiance the whole point well that's the point of a mukbang yeah just like really have to like go to town like you just have to sit there eat and then talk about stuff with your homies it's not your you act like it's like a challenge like let's eat and from you but can I make it through this that would be my goal and spoilers I probably wouldn't maybe that would make for some good convo would be fine I've seen you eat shoulder shoulder came to people all right you went in I would do it if we didn't have to be like I'm not like have you seen the ones where it's like they dip like a meat claw in like sauce and there's like yeah some of the some of the trends for most things are really gross yeah a lot of the fish stuff miss me repent like the raw fish like that horrible person was eating like the octopus live or whatever or that wasn't a squid I don't know was it that I don't get it he was an arm likes like something like moving in my mouth no no no all right next question did I do that we'll do that next summit yeah I like that idea blue with the cooking see I I thought it would I found a nice and then we could do like we could like make it like a spoof on like kitchen chef or something like that it's like what a see what have you made for us today and it's like today I've made you Funyuns on top of a burrito could be like maybe like a like a like a like a Hell's Kitchen type say you have to prevent it to Gordon and it's like a committee it's like it's like through and arrow and like like row player in there I feel like she would I feel like you be great judge and then when it's like cooking it cuts the person like you in the background like talking about your perform it's like I really just right there I just thought I messed up most a lot of us a lot of us headed back to a cold shot of you just like not saying anything looking nervous Rob just presents a ball special okay he's like yeah so today I made you some special okay now this is some extra vitamin D milk and the Special K flakes with some with some fillets of strawberry yeah I hope enjoy thank you I think it's funny it's like today I prepared you a Special K with whole milk and then cuz she's like did you say uh did you just say whole milk I prefer 2% they say [ __ ] you stay home it's a bit stupid in it and then you go back like cut you in the back they're like I hope they don't realize the Special K was like expired like as I poured it first okay and there was five seconds left on the clock I realized that this was six-year-old social care it's really it's antique it's been finely aged antique special ok oh my god suicide me up alright so we got a question from Peter lock Meyer who has your favorite Pokemon during all your nuzlockes both on and off screen and why also can I get a Chandeleur for my girls 50 omission is 50 the stupid scandal your Pokemon you had you take that back is not a stupid one but it's a sick one yeah that's Shawn Chandler's the only one like Pokemon that's bad based on an object that gets a pass this is a that is not even remotely no that is not a pixel right oh my god write that down write that down yes but dude is right suder's watched me play because he loves the podcast right I was like wait a minute that's that's gonna kokum on is that way no meme like that's kind of sick new starter I would probably say my favorite would be pork chop he was the our first starter on the first Nuzlocke on the channel and then first i had and then he died a very quick and unfortunate in in fact we lost the entire lock is a larva tar and oh that's right you got done yeah we fought the first gym leader who had a good bite that new dragon rage and what do we one shot my entire team my goodness oh yeah that's right yeah so I probably say pork chop memories you just know how to like throw the entire tarantara lion don't like you you like there's some casualties about that teat our line has casualties that I know the curse did uh time is for weaknesses there Bates did you just got good what do you mean their faith their times for weaknesses no I'm saying that's what I'm saying like T tar like like they throw a fighting move and then I'm like oh Jesus like on my team that's what I'm saying I don't know mr. freer it's gonna find that the best refrigerator gonna be like oh so that's how we so we think four times okay mister fruit oh so you you killed him on purpose then no so so what exactly okay so you're they're asking what has been your favorite Pokemon yeah you've done a Nuzlocke right blue and your index yours like in your own life in a Nuzlocke yeah specifically um honestly honestly is probably my Empoleon I named him uh I named him look don't make I'm not gonna tell you his name I was a young kid what is it no no dad tell us now I literally named him happy feet because literally Lou like this dumb 14 year old kid doing a Nuzlocke but dude Empoleon carries in those locks like he resists everything yeah he's nuts yeah that's my favorite that's one of the favorite Pokemon I've ever had in does lock that's probably where I got such a that that has a attributed to my undying love for Penguins III think that was my as the first time or like the in penguins penguins are kind of [ __ ] behind wait a second I didn't really think much of Piplup in the Impala in line I wouldn't originally released and I think that's where I was like man dude Empoleon staight knew your life changed at that moment yeah employees are so good man he does look specifically he just resists everything he's nuts my favorite one was III don't play but I watch and Christians Snorlax was cool Oh bro poor without ya makers and it's really funny how he dies it's so unpoetic dude and then like it really rare to encounter oh he's and then doing the stats now whatever dude not porn right next way why rich why rich with that any Pokemon and a theme here any Pokemon that you want to get an evolution they think deserves one oh man there's a lot thinking I would love to see in an evolution from Raichu I would love Pikachu to get a third evolutions see right be weird doctor a stone that would be tight but it's kind of the after a stone at plus they have Pichu so there's really no oh yeah you can yeah I guess but maybe they give him a fourth [ __ ] plus they just get less they have a little and right you so there's right she's already gotten the his fix okay I'll shake give my boy Toxicroak an Evo would be sick I love him but then I'd have a third one to love I'd have CRO gun [ __ ] broken or that leash no it's only crowing tox screen although okay I'll stand by the third I know it doesn't well it doesn't need a third I guess there would be more ones as that's like more pressing I'd like to see that I still think bouffalant should still I still stand by the fact that he should be Toros his evolution I still think that bouffalant I look at the first time I shot opal the first time I saw that I was like oh my god they gave torsionally Pokemon yeah for sure oh that is tight yeah I totally thought it was yeah Taurus was evil dude it's tough all right Rob no here he said right you dude that's so tough I think right you would be sick like that would be really don't damn that's okay if you think about this is a rough one mu-3 would be also insane third evolution so that won't happen damn it so I I guess my new jerk response is I I think Dunsparce deserves an Evo go fish my um absolute pleb - Chad yeah that's what I thought kind of like when I first werster played Dunsparce he's like he's like this little he's tight abs he's such a cool Pokemon design but he's so yes yeah that's like he doesn't evolve he doesn't he doesn't when I saw Dunsparce I thought oh this this is like this is like the Gyarados of this game like he's gonna evolve into something tight and then he just stays there is he a bug he's just normal I I always think he's ground for some reason but yeah he's just normal Dunsparce is he's he's like when you see that thing you're like Oh what does that evolved into yeah like I can't believe that just has no evolution it feels like a waste of a Pokemon it's like oh that's good that's good evolve into something tight it does not evolve alright now that one's definitely one of those I would agree that if they're gonna give one probably give that so that it's not just complete trash yeah it would like redeem Dunsparce I don't know maybe I'll just say miltank sure get like a giant beast cow oh yeah yeah just like twelve utters and then and the only move it learns is mega rollout maybe next question is from flaming or taco fury when everything is on the line what is your strategy for rock-paper-scissors that's pretty simple I honestly tell the person I'm going Rock and I go rock every time because normally then they start going like what is he doing and then I just go Rock every time and normally that wins me every game normally I just throw whatever I threw laughed I try not to overthink it so then you always stay on the same one then yeah so like let's say I just threw Rock and I lost rock all right everything's on the line they're gonna psych themselves out they'll say there's no way he's gonna rock again oh my god he got me no way there's no way he's gonna he did it honestly I'll just shout I was just like straight-up call out what I'm gonna do and the cheesy like one free bait there's no way he's gonna do what he said yeah no you you you think right you thought there's no ways gonna be said no people will be like oh I can go rock plus you're like okay then I'll do paper but wait but he takes it so they're all gonna go scissors yeah exactly so you're like I'm gonna do rock like mid like rock yeah and then I would do it like that's how I do joke and you're like oh that's stupid so within what there works every time if made of rock papers is you're like rock paper I'm gonna go rock they're like oh paper and no scissor [ __ ] it's very dumpster just people dude people you see but like even if you don't even even if even even if that person's like oh he's there's no way he goes rock you see you're still in that person's head now cuz now they just don't know true yeah so now you're playing double mine games mom it's big brain that's 4d rock-paper-scissors well now everybody's gonna be the sonographer scissors because we were revealed our strategies or we just changed the meta game like there's a rock-paper-scissors like thread that I hae new strategies these guys just like cracked it yeah like it's since that new patch and a new ad read oh let's get into that and welcome back to the GG over-easy podcast where in this episode we're attacking about pretty much everything there is to talk about including but not limited to this next question yeah this is really an interesting one to actually start with if in the future you become a ruthless dictator and someone is said I don't need time to kill you what would be the best time to travel back to hmm that's a pretty loaded question my my personal nasty question shame on you for asking yeah I've court not know if I'm going to think like if I become a ruthless dictator the best time to kill me is just when I'm a baby right like just you know like when I'm sick or like on the toilet and when I'm just like oh it's your most horrible yeah or maybe when you're having a migraine you know that's one or like sick like I'm in bed I was the woman to do but no home bro stuff have you changed your glasses yet speak at the headaches no dude cuz I can't I still got like 2 and 1/2 weeks to my appointment Nikhil staying no yeah baby I guess when I'm a baby like that's everyone's answer right so it feels like a cop-out though yeah yeah with that so I guess more specifically um I got lob boys are us for the first time and I cried for about 20 minutes and tell my parents found me that'd be a good change yeah cuz it was one of those things where I guy just kept walking and they just were like one light it's almost like away from me and I got thought I was lost forever I'd say sophomore year when my girlfriend I broke up you know just shoot me then I just do it yeah I would have been so melodramatic like my life's over anyway I have nothing to live for maybe then she'll realize what she's busy now log oh I don't know okay this way started okay good okay bro I don't know honestly like what better way to do it then like like if I was just a ruthless dictator like just go back in time no no problems right we're like right after I pop out and they put me in like one of those baby beds like what better time is there yeah yeah like if you really had to right like if you really had to gonna be really good yeah I mean if you if you get no bars held to why even wait for that to shoot my mom when she's like pregnant would ya you know like why to go there but then I had determinated to protect him cuz I knew one coming for me spoilers right I did not see the question needs a question next question is from Dillon Jimenez he asked blue what are your thoughts on the last of story arc on the Clone Wars show have you guys gotten any new show suggestions I've gone through so many idk what to watch anymore thank you guys for what you do love you all so I mean I don't want to do spoilers because Clone Wars just came out but dude it's pretty fresh I just want to say how good the people who were on Clone Wars are because because this last season single-handedly improved how good this last season was improved how good of a movie episode 3 was she just by 8 episode 3 a better mood it made it was a 3 a better movie I promise you it is so good like the show disrespect so much about about the entire universe and I just I was I was in I was in heaven I there's one screaming laughing oh my god I think it's like ten episodes okay dude how many episodes hold up one sec you watch it Christian no I'm still seasons and seasons behind okay okay it's only like two seasons way back when I just want to watch this form and just say screw it my gosh my new show recommendation though would be the last Kingdom just finished it I mean deed I go resisting just go watch it good watch the in to see it's clever starts off a little shaky but like trust me once you get to like once you like season season gets better colores type are all the seasons on Disney plus I want to say yeah I would assume so okay so what's your so Christian the last Kingdom on Netflix great what does big well it's about this the Saxon who when he was a young boy was supposed to be heir to this land called Bevin Burr but the Danes aka Vikings came over took it away from him and then Earl Ragnar actually took him under his wing as his son and raised him so he went from like the Saxon to a Dane more or less maybe not like born in Dane but he was raised he's pretty much a Viking himself and it starts off with some betrayal and then they try and pin it on him saying he was trying to get back this whole time and he's still a Saxon he's like no I'm a Dane but then no one's listening and so he has to figure out what to do and he's gotta watch from there it's good but it's like Vikings and Knights so like I'm there um City and I have been watching the show on Netflix I forget what it's called but it's like this show where like um they throw like plants and like they build like big structures and it's made of plants and it's like it's almost like the Great Britain fake show but instead like now they just build these giant plant structures and its really awesome except we just finished it yesterday so now we're sad the show hole yeah it's yeah it'd take a really cool show I forget what it's called but it's really cool that's what I would recommend well there you go just one let me see the next one the next one is from Jamison Tanner is there any particular moment in your life that helped you push you or guide you to where you are today parentheses can be in either your profession your personal or professional life um stay I sold my weave for an Xbox 360 you need to pause it uh yeah it uh unknowingly led me to where I am here today all because I hate it that would never have happened that or a college college was a big wake up changed a lot of my mindsets and then also made me have to realize what I was doing very true uh-huh okay run back the question again the question again is is there a particular moment in your life that helped you push you or guide you where you are today No okay all right that's like if I think about like in the way Christian thought about it I guess when my mom's house got robbed and they stole the PlayStation 2 but renter's insurance she was able to get us a new gaming console and I wanted to get an Xbox instead of a Playstation 2 because I could play xbox live and then that's when I set up like Halo 2 Xbox Live and stuff and that's when I was like gaming is sake yep soccer then the most general sense I guess was when my parents bought me pokemon yellow because oh there you go it was like I feel like of all the things you're teaching of all the butterfly effects I feel like for us yeah like whatever games kind of kicked off it's probably the reason the biggest reason we're here wearing now so having experienced inspiration like that sense did you get that for Christmas or your birthday that's a okay gotta love pokemon yellow dude and I think but my parents yeah I got me this janky Gameboy I mean they're all janky now that I'm thinking about it it was Pokemon it was yellow and I loved it so much and they were like oh wow he's I mean wow I've never seen him interested anything without Jesus he could chew and poke one yellow leg as a starter yeah okay so yellow was the first one I played and then I went on to red and blue but my I love Pokemon so much my parents even ended up getting me like the special like limited edition like pokemon yellow Pikachu gameboy version I want to pick the I have it right in front me round apparel really yeah it's the one with togepi and Pikachu on it yeah yellow and that's dull it's tight did you guys ever play that that Pokemon game I came out on a Nintendo 64 where it was like you could talk to Pikachu like oh hey back here - yeah I did not unfortunately hey that would have been something else I had cubed oh no it's the Tendo 64 I know they say yeah Oh cuz then I think on GameCube they made like look at the chat like some farm farm one but yeah I know what you're talking about I never I never had that them yeah you could like talk to me it was so bad it never worked it's terrible I got it and it was the worst thing ever I've been lied to but like Pokemon snap was so sick Oh like that was so good is that waist okay this broad question what's the best Pokemon game on the n64 stadium - yeah no Pokemon I know I I'm with Christian I think stadium 2 is the best one Pokemon snap I mean Snap is good don't get me wrong but stadium - well with the minigames alone and then you still have like the rental battles you can do through like the whole pads and everything and then being able like input your Pokemon but it was like sick it's super tight don't get me wrong why isn't that a thing anymore like like they make a pokemon stadium 3 well the closest thing we have is pokémon battle revolution yeah we're not gonna we're probably we really have there's a really no reason to have a stay how we be yeah I mean right now well the Pokemon games gonna be on switch from now on so there's really no reason at all of us 83 coming to the switch every pokemon everything here provider you see the problem with that is people only loved the stadium games because they could see their Pokemon like in a garage of hardware right and it's like oh I could find I could see my Pokemon like in real like like in good graphics but there's no need for that now cuz it's already on switch I mean yeah unless they wanted some weird like hyper realistic looking abominations yes stadium games were only as good as the fact that there was no mainline games on a home console and now maybe you would normally play were black and white with like eight pixels so yeah so there was demand for like really senior Pokemon in higher quality what a game dude October 10th March 26 2001 yeah because I got it for Easter I remember that you know what game I do one another one of is Pokemon Colosseum that game oh yeah I tried it feels old my calcium xD gey love darkness shadows yeah what a storyline that was the closest we've had like a action-adventure yeah let's see what our next question is here Griffin asks what do you think is easier to start to stream or make a youtube video powerful YouTube YouTube YouTube you can you can you can have be creative you honestly with YouTube you need the mic you need editing software and some video games and you could you could do a lot with a little when it comes to when it comes to YouTube with twitch like a standard for a streamer so high now yeah like a scuffs zero viewer andy is gonna have a hard time yeah because you had quality purposes like ah like twitch which requires twitch requires like a certain level of production and if you don't have a certain low production like you have to be like super engaging whereas with YouTube like you could with YouTube see the thing about YouTube is people [ __ ] love memes and YouTube is a video uploading site where your stuff is there forever so you could just upload straight memes someone would get it but yeah yeah I like this guy exactly whereas on Twitch it's like I'm not [ __ ] watching this clicks off the stream I mean go back 10 years the what you needed to succeed on I guess what would have been just in TV at the time was just stream yeah didn't matter what it looked like didn't mad didn't matter the fact that you were alive with a game yeah that'll I was like alright yeah sick everyone's here but now it's like bro unless you're a one person dual stream one person team that looks as if it's a production working behind you with crisp gameplay thanks to high bandwidth in and add all this kind of stuff like its yeah you could thank doctor disrespect for that yeah there's so this remedy prerequisites to having like a successful stream it's like it's a test having a stream is an investment whereas it's YouTube you could make you can make anything work on YouTube where you get paid for it probably not but yeah well you get exposure absolutely that's the caveats what are you trying to do actually like sustain yourself in its true we'll move on to the next question from Kyle he says oh great I already know this is going with the first name Rob found bless his video of your stream about the Kyle's you knew how to be hilarious naturally with my name I get the memes a lot got any funny story of those Kyle's to share um I just know one Kyle and his and I just played destiny with him a lot and he was just a bellend dude like he's just and but he didn't like put up with my [ __ ] and I'd never put up with his and like I know his older brother and we just always butt heads and Kyle's just suck except for Kyle blessing he's the coolest Kyle blessing is like the God of all cut black Kyle's all right he's like just love the end once like him Kyle name there isn't blush named Kyle that's good dude I was like brightest of a rise that read that I was like like that like that was bad like cuz I a book is cooked because bless is blessed you know what I mean like yeah he's not Kyle I never one time ever called him Kyle have you guys I know I know yeah I was bless yeah so that is my story of why I hate cows is cuz Kyle sucks the colleagues I know sucks Thank You probably you're a cool Kyle oh man I'm not saying all kind of suck just like 99% but you're probably that 1% so it's cool yeah 99.9% Kyle suck you probably just 0.1 we have a question here from a Jimmy Dean rodeo says ever thought about having a special guest on the show if so who would be your first pick Oh Nathan Fillion oh so we're going live as like okay they're kind of realistic well I thought they said you could have any special guest no that's true if I could have any special Nathan Fillion really oh I love you have four does anybody you're Nathan Fillion dude why probably matter the rock because I think the rock would also be like I'd go just super charismatic I think Joe gonna be really cool so we have four done acid also by the way Spotify if you guys want to buy us for a hundred million will say no make it 2-1 yeah yeah so I mean Joe we appreciate the the steps you've taken for thanks Joe okay one second I have to answer the door but yeah Joe Rogan would be super cool to have on the podcast because I mean who better to have that Joe Rogan I'm in true as far as like a podcast guess he would certainly know what everything yeah although I'd have to be one of those too in relation to the creator of Pokemon I think he's dead I'm not mistaken that bands I should remember his name but I can't uhh [Music] satoshi tajiri at the hands he died in 2011 okay oh so you got to see Pokemon like explodes that's him he was 45 when he done but do you know the whole story about it no so he was actually on the spectrum and so one of the this is like the rough TL DR that I kind of roughly know if I'm missing some things but I'll be really broad so he was on the spectrum and part of that is like you know sometimes they have like certain fascinations or like doing certain things and I believe with him the one thing he really liked I think it was specifically the like click butterflies you really like collecting like butterflies or maybe insects and like cataloging them and all this kind of stuff and so I wanted to share that love essentially and so he made up his own monsters where you can collect them all and so that's where the idea pokeman was born that is cool and then Pokemon means like Pocket Monsters right like that yeah although they stopped referring to that I think they've like Japan themselves too just now called Pokemon because I first released yeah for them I was like Pocket Monsters but now it's I think they just go Pokemon okay it's poker because Pokemon like normally let is that like the American name for it or yeah I think it was at first at least again that was my understanding of it yeah what the West called it II that's dirty Westerners oh there's a really okay we're almost to it I'm excited for that question oh wait no that question is now actually I'm stupid Emma Nelson asks what do you guys imagine is inside of a poké ball oh I've always wondered this I love you could probably do it now like whoever's listening will just Google like inside of a Pokeball and just look at all the cool like drawings and illustrations people have made of like imagining what it's like a lot of them are cool like little biomes or like little cottages entire worlds and it's kind of interesting you would have to think it's pretty comfortable if they're chill going back in cuz they're not like no no don't yeah sure except for Pikachu so who really knows maybe Pikachu just didn't like it in there yeah I don't know cuz then like with Pikachu like look like Pikachu's just kicking it in that poky like that is like you can't it can't be looking like that because she was not down yeah he's sitting there chilling with a it looks like a cozy little hobbit house almost I don't know I imagine as like just a hollow space that just nothing here yeah I really love it enough yet but that's just like I'm unimaginative and I can't like truly think about like yeah like this one like it's literally like just a squirtle like just just imagine they're just like suspended in time so if that were the case I'd like to at least believe once they go at you roughly here so like I like square at all you all rested up buddies let's try to run away get him yeah no I would like to think it's it's it's nicer than that I'd like to think they're comfortable in there no I don't want to think I'm throwing them into purgatory yes I kind of do want all the Pokemon a catch and just put in a PC you're just stuck there forever it's just the hall I'd like to think that like essentially when I put him in pokeball it's like when I like ash would send all of his extra Pokemon essential to like Professor oh can you take care him on the farm something like that yeah like when they're in the pokeball food they go to this place they're taking care of his chill and they're happy both out and inside the pokeball but that's how I feed in and out that's how it's a perfect world yeah I would like to think that it's what they would like it you they get this like it's like a room like this size it's like Oh like you just hear like Pikachu I choose this like gotta go away I think the thing is just like that squirtles trainer it's just a punching bag with that squirtle trainers face you just said he's like this quarter like she's you and he's like try to act chill like yeah dude so it goes back to just like bags yeah like one day I'm a raza it's wait till I'm black scores boy do you have no time for a question I can't rapid fire me oh okay blue perfect timing what would you what do you imagine is inside of a pokeball like a little like a hotel a luxury resort room yeah so it's like in the bitters are pokeball you get like the different inside changes so like like a lousy ball is like pokeballs like La Quinta Inn yeah exactly yeah but then luxury balls like five seasons or four seasons with them yes exactly that's why you have to care about the ball you put your Pokemon in like is this Safari ball like nice and Safari in there like is the luxury ball like a nice hotel like is the pokeball just a barren wasteland it's just room it's whatever their native regular habitat is because imagine you throw like a water pokemon there's no waters it matches the other ecosystem more or less like a self-sustaining ecosystem so you don't think it's like what I said blue like looking the discord chat like it let dudes literally like just squished in there no I feel more like a Pikachu type thing no I told him that's at least what I'd like to think yeah that's what I that's what I hope next question is from Ben Tate says hey guys a longtime listener a second time writer wanted to give you guys a 69 star rating but I have to take one star way due to rob not like in Revenge of the Sith it's something I don't like it I just know yes he's a very will take 68 you know I think it's just not I think people think it's better than it is because 1 & 2 are so bad like everyone's like god this movie's great because like 1 & 2 which is so bad before it what what's your most memorable Star Wars moment my MS in the battle between Anakin and obi-wan best fight in Star Wars and it really shows how far Anakin has fallen I would say I don't know I'd like to remember Christian we were star wars oh and the leia scene yeah dude in the back goes what Rob and I look at each other like are we watching it like is this really like we're in a Marvel movie or something so like whatever I think like my most memorable Star Wars mode that's literally what I go to is like just seeing that for the first time and Christian without like having a point to Christian or like touch if we poke at the same time it's like it doesn't only time like that you try the whole movie too but it's just like this like you're seeing this right like I'm not crazy right that's like when like the Seinfeld musical bear on a brown like starts playing the Danner that that that that like that we'll be right back but if I'm going for like my most Padma I'd probably say my general Green this pulls out like six license I'm Erik you got done I'd already dude oh my god yeah he got dumped but it was so sick almost all the villains in each one they like such cool things as never explored except like we talked about Darth Maul got some justice and like Clone Wars and stuff and outside the universe but like nobody else did just boned yeah but she would greet her my most memorable Star Wars moment my moment hurts so bad because because it was like okay so it wasn't force awakens first of all and it wasn't my moment it was I was watching force awakens and the theater was popping off right and yeah and I just remember seeing this probably like 40 year old woman with her husband and her little daughter they're sitting right next to me and and this was this was like unreal height for Star Wars because force awakens is back a new trilogy we're gonna ever gonna get another one again so it's hype and I'm watching this whole movie and every single time something happens I can like see in the corner of my eye this just absolutely enthralled 40 year old mom sitting there so excited like something happens that she's like oh my god like she would make like it she would like me like oh yeah yeah like a nerdgasm and it was just so wholesome cuz I was like wow she's like bringing her daughter and her daughter gets experience a whole new trilogy for her generation and I was that was like but that's just my favorite room cuz I just remember like man like it's like this series affects so many people like I can't wait for this trilogy in what what comes like what what happens and then well we know what we got but but I remember that so vividly and it was like yeah I'm like that's that's that's what that's my goals one day because maybe one day we'll get it actually good trilogy and I could bring my kid yep do you have on Christian it would probably that nothing mentioned that's probably the one of the biggest ones that like stands out so [ __ ] the most part though I still think is when the starter store gets sliced in half I've seen it you know in that same movie where they hyperjump through the like slice through the starter story yeah I thought sick I didn't like the visual man continuity bro meadow like the whole like that it's like silence on the whole picture it was sick sure like yes but like the idea behind it is absolute supid and dumb if we want to go there why can't even hear anything in space okay I hate whatever okay yes the shot was cool but it makes absolutely no sense and absolutely destroys every sense of what that I hate it well I like how he just came out and was just like yeah I didn't really care about like keeping keeping things just like who's like alright guys gonna go make my movie now this next question from solid Garcia is for blue specifically oh it says I know blue has watched a Doctor Who so I wanted to know about his favorite doctor or episode [Music] now do you stand Doctor Who or like you just like have watched it at some point and I was pretty big into it I for wallows into it I kind of lost me with the recent stuff a couple years ago I mean I think everyone will tell you David Tennant is their favorite doctor from this generation of Doctor Who because I mean he's just like he was heel is literally Doctor Who David Tennant unless look him up wait he's like oh yeah I know literally the Doctor Who when you three need someone says Doctor Who that's the person you think he's from Harry Potter he was like one of the bad guys in Harry Potter yeah oh I thought when you said Tennant I thought you said Tennant and I was like wait like the new movie and I was like maybe this is some weird and play on that dude did you guys read we're like the actors we're even like yeah we had no idea what it was about when we were shooting it like we're still we still don't know what it's about yeah that's funny I'm Christopher Nolan's I don't worry you'll understand as far as as far as my favorite episode okay it's been out for a long time so you can't like nuke me for spoilers it's probably episode doomsday it was it was it was the finale for season 2 and this was a really tough episode because Rose Tyler is like Rose so Rose is like one of the most popular companions to the doctor of all time probably the most popular and there was kind of like some romantic tension kind of between her and the doctor for a long time so in this episode it was like this big it was like this aftermath of this huge battle and they you know obviously they end up saving the day cuz it's Doctor Who but they but Rose and the doctor end up getting getting split into two different universes No so they can't so they just get separated and it's actually so so hard because the actress for Rose was so good and it was just it was really it was really sad because she's I just love that episode dude it's just so nice Doctor Who a superhero or like what is he and why they're always different doctors so they're different doctors the there's not like a great reason for different doctors canonically it's more so like when the doctor dies he's reborn into something else it's like but it's mostly so they could kind of have that's it that's just how they've always done Doctor Who I think they've kind of like swapped out of the actors every now and then to like keep like a fresh take on the whole you're James Bond yeah but yeah James Bond like um obviously more quickly you know they go through doctors the doctor is like a same person every time but like it's just a different person no he's I mean his general character is not like crazy different each time but each time they kind of want the actors to do like their own kind of yeah their own interpretation of the doctor so yeah every time a doctor dies they get reborn into something else a different person and yes pretty much it I mean it's a tight show it kind of lost me the writing got like super janky like when uh when Matt Smith came in so doctor know he's known for Sherlock yeah that's what he's also a British series matyi it's got my British series mixed up there on the BBC on the telly the old British series and this not British angry oh and welcome back to the Gigi overeasy podcast Rob hit us with some more sauce this seems to be another blue and four related question from Nick he says seeing as blue and fruit have shown interest in God fall do you think you will do something with God fall as you did with Borderlands a few longer episodes seeing as the three person co-op by the way I saw a question about the new clone war season I was just wondering if you could put time stamp in the video so I know when just skipped avoid spoilers Disney Plus isn't out yet but that's okay I simply didn't do spoilers yeah there's no sport arena uh so do you guys like God falling will you do something on it I don't know what that God fall is if the game yeah I mean it depends on is it gonna be good damn we'll see currently what's got fall we talked about it's like one of the like PS 5 games coming out and it's like that third-person melee combat looking thing yeah for sure that would be like a hack and slash a RPG yeah cool so yeah that's but like we have we only have that little demo they showed or like super scripted thing so like as to what's actually be has gonna look how it's gonna play we'll see I am I'm excited though so if it is good yeah I wanna do something we have a question here from whoa he says any plans to play more my night I love watching you guys lose your minds I really just let me do my night at sick just cuz of like like friendship get tested in my night right I mean that is true my night is essentially the the rock-paper-scissors we're talking about where we have someone just being like I'm the I'm the hacker there's no way he's there and then yep and you she's like dork dory but I'm Haggar and it's also like team up on Christian as fast as you can yeah dude I'm always fighting so hard and ever just like never trust nope nope nope not him dude so so the reason why everyone is always against you is because you have such an absolute resolve whenever you do stuff right and that's fine but like you do you're so absolutely resolved immediately it's like such a it's like such a contrast to like someone like dad oh who was kind of like skeptical and trying to figure stuff out and it's like okay maybe this may be there like he did this he did that whereas fruit is like oh yeah well clearly this dude you know it's trying to fake us out it's definitely this guy and when you're so absolut and confident so quickly it's like that's us I'm just trying I've tried to fight for the little man you are so I'll just have to fine I'll be more aloof next time I mean I have to be more aloof or just like you're just like you're like you're cut and dry you're like this is this this person it's like whoa and then yeah but no I commitment honors really quickly well then what normally happens is someone will throw me in the first time and then they'll hack it so then it's immediately like we can't trust you and I'm like guys I swear it's like never put him in and then it's just I'm over there like oh my god but yeah hopefully mr. waves asks with all this extra time we have with everything going on in the world are there any new hobbies slash your skills that you have picked up yeah crying in the shower yeah for hours on end um yeah I would like to say I have but I've worked this fate like my I don't have any more free time or do I say it's like a skill I mean it's just more video games I've gotta like I guess used to my creative juices when I'm doing it but aside from that like my days are still pretty much just as busy as that were pre quarantine my gun breaker and final fantasy is getting pretty saucy so I had to so I don't have you know he also has a follow-up question that says what do you guys think is the best looking shiny pokemon Umbreon easy I do like well Breanna l-- yeah it's like out its Umbreon but the rings are blue pretty sick I don't actually know if I have a favorite that's pretty cool blue but it doesn't be shiny Charizard none mine or me or something for say yeah absolutely that's literally the most popular shiny in the history of Pokemon Pam hammer uh-huh oh it was pretty tight you know it's like a white Orange I wish I could just see like visually the whole list of them shiny like wasn't very cool to like literally Charizard Rayquaza greninja like three most popular Chinese because they're all just pure like just black it looks sick yeah shiny red cause was definitely sick you won't you won't see me joke about that no I know a lot of wack ones but I don't know like which one I would what's the back is shiny guards a lot of them there's a lot of them guard shop shiny is like a slight tone difference you're gonna look at trying to relate what oh yeah yep it's like everything just got like it's all it's like they just kind of like let you turn the saturation down like that's yeah they essentially took the saturation slider do pull back that's it they did him dirty with that did they did mm-hmm they're a lot of dirty ones like the ones where it's literally like wait is that shiny I can't hear what dad's the whack ones see I can't really feel my favorite one is so don't know them all well enough I'd have to literally just go through each one a bit ooh that one Oh Pikachu's a pretty bad shiny yeah peaches of whack which is so weird that's your mascot yeah yeah I'm surprised I surprised they haven't like redone his shiny because it's Pikachu you would think right Eva Shoen is pretty cool Eevee's like green right I do kind of hate Jolteon shiny to know Evie's like pure white yeah like a like a silver white guilty on those kind of gross looks like yeah like screen to be still be honest such sick shiny - isn't it blue yeah yeah not a sec know what mine would be all right what do you want for me I'll just I'll just I'll be the second or me just because you mention it rayquaza I can't hate you cause requited just a bad [ __ ] he he do be though that do be how it be uh the next question is from na Barry says rob has the weight loss coming we need an update slash weigh-in how are you feeling thanks for asking me about a month and a half into quarantine and not doing as you say after everything you showed me - wow talk about great timing there appreciate it literally I have stopped in my tracks oh my I started wearing my watch again though I started to do runs again I've started my running routine again I'd noticed Christian on here you are at zero my friend I just don't I well one I didn't wear it anymore because at first I couldn't do anything then once I got my gym back I didn't do it because Appa chew through the like the the wristwatch part like the the Lynx or whatever this yeah I completely true though so I just have to order a replacement but I just never had okay so I I can't wear it by hands yeah I don't know how much once I get have you thought about going back to the gym like I will you go like next year okay so when it's like not going for a long super clear yeah I mean thankfully I have my home gym so I don't desperately need it I mean I'm missing out on some stuff and I won't be able to do some stuff but like unless your fundamentals yeah speaking of clear went out today because she had to go like her wedding dress had gotten like some tailoring done so she had to go pick it up and our city has like opened up to where it's supposed to be like fifty percent capacity which is stupid in the first place but they did that and she was gonna uh saying no one's wearing masks no one's social distancing like the tables and stuff at the restaurants aren't like even like spread out everyone's close to each other it's all and there's like all this is gonna do is make sure we're just gonna go right back to where we were exactly think our cases I've only gone up like 20 percent which is like which is like but not good but it's like a shame watch two weeks about two weeks after that whole Memorial Day stuff where everyone was just like yeah let's just go for good yeah what'd you do I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do what I can and just wear a mask and I'll be doing the best that I can my thing is like I don't get why people are upset at people who do this side to wear a mask you know like no it doesn't matter for me is literally like what if anything I'm helping you yeah like it dies well I don't understand if you have like a problem with somebody wearing a mask you're an idiot I'm sorry I mean this country has a pretty big problem of butting into things that don't affect them at all so how high oh there's no reason to give them as wearing a mask I it's it's it's astounding to me the people who are like take it off it's like no I'm not gonna certainly if you wear like like your right to not wear mask is just as valid as my right to wear a mask to like step off oh yeah but next question is from Barry again says who is your celebrity crush mine is uh Emily Blunt John Krasinski's wife was she doing she is she's the but she's a great actress she I love her British accent she's funny she's smart uh she's an activist she's great I love her you'll get that from Iran by appreciating oh you love everyone - OH I just do you guys have like a crush on their entire relationship like that's literally goals do uh-huh I leave Blunt is gorgeous she's awesome and then her and John Krasinski Rawls was just cute as [ __ ] like I think I'm saying yeah they're awesome I hate it yeah and it makes me sick it's a sort of binder I'm never gonna have something like that it's the worst like that's like that's like literally the perfect like relationship between two people I hate it it's the worst god it's nothing so perfect just good Jesus like come on I haven't really thought about mine like I haven't really thought about a crush in a while but I know when I was younger it was Jessica Alba very light it's a celebrity crellick already in middle school yes Larry crush they're all normal what do you mean no I feel like Emily Blunt is a very gorgeous and like that's a lot more pass like whatever Bernardo Cart Cardoso as when did y'all decide to be content creator / dreamers what were you doing before and how is the transition based a lot beside you guys so I'll get back to you I was at a movie theater and like I was watching a stream and this was like I think the tape like we had probably deported then like six months into the dream team at that point and I was like working at a movie theater yeah you don't even there like a week right yeah um and I was just like I'm not doing this anymore and then I just dreamed from like my ps4 for like the

time pull a breathable every time dude that's I mean that's pretty people it hits like everything you need yeah but Chipotle brutal [Music] I mean that's good but like you know it doesn't lie right like you could you could put you put a lot in that fine and I don't never get sick of it so I think I could do a a month of that cuz that's the other thing too is ARBs you get protein you get days like like I'd like to say like I love pasta but man and about four days pasta you would get malaria by eating 30 days of pasta no damn payables really good one but like probably breathable okay you join the game just it's just it just covers everything like I just said I Steve like if I'm doing the burrito bro I need to like not get like cheese and like sour cream I need to just go like straight

hey give me a celebrity card I'll do that I'll do the challenge I would do fruit ever consider picking up a Digimon game to give them a shot I think you would really enjoy digimon story cyber sleuths Lee yeah I played Digimon game back in on the ps1 I was pretty sick that's about it there's still Digimon games oh it's on the ps4 it's a nine out of ten really yeah everyone can't have love I can't say I've like ever looked at recent Digimon games is this like the most recent one I guess like March 12 2015 it's a popular one it's probably the most popular Digimon games that if not the most popular one interesting yeah it's on Steam I mean what do you know why don't you do a Nuzlocke I don't know if it works like that Digimon battles work the same as Pokemon battles know that I don't want to do oh yeah look like this just came out like October 2019 like no like did you want game it looks pretty cool the one I played I forget what it was but you had like a little overworld and you were a Digimon but you were originally a human but you got like stuck as a Digimon in this world and you were like trying to escape or like find your way out I don't know what it was but it's pretty dope maybe I'll figure it out yeah looks interesting jelly is asking what is your favorite smell and do you have a memory associated with one of my favorite smells is like after it rains you know yeah and like that just reminds me of like golfing I don't know why but like I look like whenever I go golfing sometimes it rains and I love that smell it's like I'm golfing Digimon Digimon World three that was well that's what you played no I think that into out them up those are my jam sir sorry figure it out you not sure I mean the rain rain smells so got to definitive ones what you think about that rain mm-hmm and a freshly mopped floor that he's got mop of fabuloso lavender yeah you like this a little bit now far below the lavender right after he's not a good floor for me it was like pledge because that's that like the lemon scent my mom would always like wipe and clean with that you'd always smell that but mmm but that rain obviously I love him Reina freshly mopped floors fabuloso lavender do you like the smell of cigarette Christian because of your dream like or like no is that just like gusting I'd okay I do kind of like gasoline tax was gonna say I am there's no oddly therapeutic smell to gasoline I like I'd like to smell a skunk is that weird well that's cuz we know one well know even like before like I was like could your song but like it like even like when I was like a kid like with it would like drive over a dead skunk already thank you yeah yeah but I've heard like there is something to this gasoline like apparently like in certain people some people like that's weird but apparently it's very common for some people to be like I like gasoline I like gasoline too and I'm not sitting there like extorting it but like you kind of get a whiff and it's not like I like Sharpie - yeah it's oddly Pleasant Sharpie is god-tier and I like Sharpie I also like when you'd like with like the sound of an expo marker going down like it's like we keep but still kind of smooth a brand new book that or like when I open pokemon cards like that's do you smell yeah yeah like a card back you have the same smell yeah that I thought brings me back immediately I also love the Hat the smells hand sanitizer I know like I do that [ __ ] Chris asked do you guys have a food that isn't your favorite but you love it because it brings you back to your childhood like in ratatouille do you have a ratatouille um mac and cheese for me I was well I guess it for me it's not my favorite I still love mac and cheese but I as a kid does like the first thing my mom taught me how to make homemade and I would just make it all the time so mac and cheese is it for me for me probably sorry no you're good all right top ramen with Franks red hot cuz yeah because my dad didn't cook and my mom rarely did so is usually just like fast food or like Hamburger Helper and stuff there's never anything I really enjoyed but then when I had like cooking myself they've worked really late so like middle school high school I lived off chicken Top Ramen except you'd only do like half the season or could be beef and then you just drench that in red hot and it was like this perfect combo I had to slurp that down all the time it was the only thing I could make so you know what I've dabbled in lately is in Ram Yoon I don't know if you guys have ever tried the shear immunes that I recommend we actually have some in the country you know what you know it is so good with with ramen that ramen is a slice of American cheese I [ __ ] you not really and I'm not talking like a real slice of American cheese I'm talking like that process craft making crap like that gross like I product see see what you think that's gross but no you drop that in there it's like creamy ramen oh okay we're all going oh you guys I guess I would be like chicken sandwiches my dad would take like rotisserie chicken and just like take the chicken off there and just like mayonnaise and mustard on it and then just throw it on like sourdough bread so uh so your dad like nothing so your dad also makes prison food like my dad yes think about every single like Latin dad prison food there there has to be something to that because the few times my dad had to take care of dinner would be like rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and then while I was at it if he could just find like Genki mashed potatoes they have that was always dinner that was it just rotisserie chicken that he just bring home Poisson thing at dinner like my dad would make prison food I'd be like like he was like dude I don't like he'll just throw stuff in like a like a like a sign agreement otter is skillet he'll just throw [ __ ] in like no care in the world and he'll be like yeah this is good and I'm like we have two more questions nicholas asks which pretty much forgotten video game franchise would you pick up for a reboot remake sequel on the next gen so I can I would love that was I was just about to say either that or jak and daxter I know jack oh I thought it'd be really sick I was actually thinking it's like Cooper like two days ago I was like man I want a new Sly Cooper those like games dead though like why don't we haven't gotten anything since I don't think we've gotten Jack index for anything since Jack did consider those games like a platformer actually action-adventure maybe like platforming and yeah you don't see in any of those games in our but then jak and daxter got kind of weird at the end though they had that one game where like Jack was like super Jack it was weird Jack's and daxter yes yeah is really like that what would you do blue Oh honestly man I've already gotten my remakes cuz Pokemon does it all the time I mean my answer would have been yellow and I mean but there's like four guys franchises Pokemon forgotten okay Ferg on franchise um dude guy forgotten they'd forgotten I can't even think of him well that's what I thought at first but then immediately it came I thought of Sly Cooper so yeah the I ever played a Sly Cooper they just looked cool never phone Oh tell me there was a cell damage do you guys ever play cell damage it was like this like vehicle carnage game where you like drive around and like you just did like damage to other game was so fun I loved cell damage oh I want that died I changed my from jak and daxter I want cell damage I've never heard of a oh it's so fun so damage is really cool about 2002 yeah you would drive around and like it was almost like Mario Kart but then it was like kind of edgy like they said bad words and stuff oh thank you it was a really fun game I really really liked it a lot I guess it's on the Nintendo switch nowadays I wonder if you can play like online games okay you know what game I remember that I remember playing as a kid it's definitely forgotten by this point is this game called Spy Hunter and it was like this car game I used to love car games back in the day it was like this spy car like a gadget car game or each level you got like a different gadget that you had to use effectively like clear the level so you get like rockets or something or like like a like a jetpack on your car it was pretty - huh hmm well certainly forgotten about and I never heard of it I never heard about cell damage either I guess mine was more of a Normie on Santos Jacko asking me what I thought of something advance wars miss those fans yeah always have to make more well like yeah recently someone tried to make like a spiritual successor called like war groove but you had Vance Wars was like this really cool turn-based like war unit management thing but like there's like powers and captains and the story and it's really cool I love it Jack came out in 2001 September 10 2001 well then they came out with one on the DS and I think that was the last one um yeah advance waters dual strike June 23rd 2005 and I think that's the last one pretty sure I mean if not then I got to play it last question is everyone has a guilty pleasure movie that they know is so bad but you love it anyways so my question is what is your guilty pleasure movie his is Batman Forever Kilty play see I don't think I have one I don't either because when a movie sucks normally I'm like this sucks I don't want to watch one then one the thing is even if I like him away I don't watch it so it's weird I always watch a movie I always rewatch stuff I guess I don't really have a guilty pleasure movie a movie that I know is bad but I watch it maybe like big fat liar I guess but I don't watch that a lot but I know it's a bad movie but it's like or like any Disney call or like in any like Disney Channel original movie like brink or like Johnny tsunami like those movies are trashed but they're like my like guilty pleasure movies that guess any blue honestly so you know America yeah Josh yeah yeah whenever we would do those old Disney movies those are definitely guilty pleasures for me yeah like uh there's there's what I remembered as a kid it was uh it was the what's that it what's that he's named Corbin something jumper up movie yeah double gotta kick it up or something like that I remember that one that was dope and then pretty much all the high school musicals jumpin jumpin yeah yeah those those were those were guilty pleasures and I dude America loves those movies dude like he is into that [ __ ] yeah I'm not I'm not into it like he is but like when I watch this I'm like damn this [ __ ] this [ __ ] popped off and I was a kid this [ __ ] was kind of hard you lie and that'll do it
