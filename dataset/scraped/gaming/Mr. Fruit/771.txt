hi ad hos own money miss minister fruit Amma welcome to the 22nd episode of Gigi over easy in today's video we talk about a couple things we start out yesterday that's 22nd episode or is it 23 22nd because I was confused last time but the last one was 21 okay I thought this was 23 the fact that we don't know is kind of sad but hey I mean after like we hit double digits like just a pot another one you know what I'm saying is bring him out yeah not amiss bada bing bada boom we miss a couple weeks but that's okay it's not important this episode we talked about the Destiny to puzzle and puzzles in general how many we've done and for about 20 minutes I was just so confused yeah it's really confusing but we learn hopefully it's solved by now again because we're also headed to pack South they'll be gone this weekend then we talked about some games coming in the future Rob had a question thank you first even after an answer it was a tweet he was still confused even though a tweeted tweet and I tweeted the Wow that's what you do yeah oh wow okay you tweeted the tweet we answered a patreon questions all that kind of stuff we do what we do we love you guys we'll see ya back south more or less [Music] hello you've tried to reach Gigi over easy oh we can't come to the phone right now because we're pax South 2020 but in the meantime you have this podcast it's like we aren't gone at all but we just recorded it in the past Wow yeah that's a thing you can do that well you have to solve this like puzzle that's time dated and then you get and then you get yeah it's tough because you're like all the pieces have to be here but little did you know the box is missing that one edge edge piece and you have to wait until the software or the publishers come off distributors that I don't know sends you the tools there are way so Jake saws people who make them do they make the picture first and then cut it or do they cut and then put the picture why do you let that it's every picture first I thought you were about to say like do they just have a whole bunch of pieces and paint them separately and then stick them together wow it works I'm sure like I just didn't know if they like the the robot machine did this and then like cut it all up and made the things and then they paint like over that or like an independent Reedy print paint shut your mouth I am almost positive at least this would seem like the easier way is you print the picture first because if you cut first then you're gonna have the contours and then when you try and paint it could bleed or like I could be a so possibly not but then like if you cut first you get every kind of nook and cranny you know I mean there's like if you cut it first you may like burn some of the pieces off I think you make they make cut first neck I think you have a good point yeah see I don't want you you don't want to burn the picture cuz it they have it let's just never figure out this should be one of those things you know it's always like I do something for a puzzle yeah really well okay what's a big puzzle like a thousand at least a thousand pieces I think so once really in high school or something I'm old school my mom had a puzzle phase so I was like I'll get a puzzle well this is a puzzle uh pretty boring well she was Batman I'm Batman isn't it the Walmart and I just got like the biggest pieces that wasn't just like the Prairie yeah or something oh my oh my oh no on the Prairie down yonder it's always like big ones are always just old prairies Wild West or like winter escapes no more jet train that was one of the coolest games ever did you ever do a puzzle blue I've done plenty of puzzles really I mean like huge I'm talking like at least a thousand pieces that's a big puzzle to me that's been done that before III what's the big I I don't know I just remember doing like this it was this Thomas the Tank Engine puzzle because I was hey as a kid I was balls deep just on like that was my that's my lure oh really that's right looking at my childhood I just anything positive I can never find it but usually Thomas is tanking is the one bright light of my childhood so you're in your anime moments when you have flashbacks is it a loose picture of Thomas the Tank Li you can yeah Thomas the Tank Engine is my all my like never stop Chuck is that train freaked me out like I never liked them as a kid it's a little uncanny he's kind of he's my sleeper a tiny Valley moment like with the human faces on trains yeah and then you like it cuts damage hmm yeah yeah and then he's seeing rapid Biggie Smalls - I remember when Sidney and I first started dating pressor I'm gonna do something really cool and I was like something that's like totally different a 50-piece puzzle let's do it no it's so like I'm like we're gonna do something fun that like nobody does so she thinks like I don't just play [ __ ] video games all the time I was like support alert I was like we're gonna play [ __ ] we're gonna do this jigsaw puzzle and I was like and it's gonna be of the Colorado 14 errs I was like this is gonna be sick I was like thousand-piece puzzle I was like mmm like I show it - I like gave it to her she's like Rob this is a thousand pieces I was like yeah brookey and she's like have you ever done a puzzle is like no I was like hey this will probably take us two and a half three hours and she said two and a half three hours just alright so we literally sit there on the hotel of our floor and just like and like I'm not kidding you maybe you know sort the edges for two hours go by and we just been just like sorting the edges like this is a mistake do you want to go out like dinner or a movie this is a terrible idea I'm sorry then we never do the puzzle of Ian we did finish it though but like I think three or four months later but you tried exactly it's the thought but I would not recommend doing a thousand-piece puzzle I'm like I don't know fifth date I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're really patient and had nothing better to do I guess we're not that boring but well I mean it sounds better than like the destiny - puzzles yes speaking of puzzles I've just been seeing the drama well that's it whatever well let's go to our resident destiny - egg we know a guy yes on the call here above us look in here yeah - corner we'll have to make like one well by the time that this video comes out I imagine hopefully the puddle of salt because that's writing almost no progress has been made at all since the puzzle came out I imagine progress that's gonna come on to a reset but but the progress isn't stopped because it's hard right the progress is stopped because they've stopped giving information right or is it just like a basic rundown here of the corridor of time puzzle is that most iris Osiris sends you into the corridors of time to explore now is this towards like like was this completely random okay that's like that so this quest comes out of nowhere everyone's like what is this you start the you start the quest quest tells you to go and record at the time to go explore and that's it it doesn't tell you anything no mission quests no a point like when you get in there no a waypoint you just kind of to figure it out so people figure out that you have to obviously there's symbols to doors a portrait of time which there already were symbols like if you played like the same 14 missions but now the symbols are part of a puzzle so people quickly figured out okay so in order to get to a certain room we have to obviously go in a sequence of the symbols that correspond to the doors these symbols start spawning on the obelisks that they never they were never there before uh-huh so people figured out the order of the symbols and the obelisks actually dictate like an order there it is into the doors in a sequence and then it sends you to this little area with a grave and a sword and ghost and it gives you lore when you look down at the what is another puzzle right below that area that you go into so a it's deception yeah I was gonna say that you solve a puzzle to find another puzzle yeah so well what we assume is a whole nother puzzle so once you actually get into the room uh-huh there's you look down and there's a but there's like a bunch of hexagons with a bunch of symbols yeah I'm bad shapes all wrong and every single room right so every single hour the symbols at the obelisks which is how we get to this room in the first place will change mm-hmm so every single hour which there are 19 of them now total which are complete you get 19 lower pieces when you go to those rooms like every single time you go into those rooms and you look down at the hexagon symbols every single time those hexagon symbols are different for every single time you go into the room like depending on the hour yeah so people have gathered those into what is apparently this magic hexagon puzzle that everyone is was hell-bent on that this is how we solved the puzzle which no one knows how to do yet because really we again have made almost zero progress on saw facility so the current theory could totally be wrong and not even hurt there you could totally be wrong do you think it's currently wrong I have no clue okay because I mean at the end of the day like we won't know until it's done it seems like okay so to finish elaborating on this because this is all very confusing if you don't play destiny uh-huh everybody plays destiny right yeah let me give you a quick TLD deport just how this works so there's so good leading up to this long puzzle solving group there's basically two puzzles one is the obelisks we had to wait 19 hours for the obelisk to give us 19 lower pieces to get into the rooms right well and then they like end up brute-forcing it because then they were like okay well we only have like 600 possibilities now let's just run through them and then we can maybe not have to wait for the 19th one right well they brute forced the final puzzle that we were supposed to have oh okay which only gave us an emblem so that was the first let's go is it a cool puzzle the second puzzle what everyone is assuming right now is that all those obelisk symbols that got you into the room every single time the hexagons at the bottom of the map are different those are 19 different hexagons uh-huh that were given to you and now everyone is trying to piece together how those interact with the 20th room which is the final room that gives you the emblem because in that final room everyone's symbols are different every single time the our changes and every single person so like dados symbols that he sees are different from fruits our different Rob's are different from mine oh they're not gonna be up there I'm not participating yeah well I'm just saying if you were participating so everyone that is assuming right now we have to for some shape or for some reason piece together as many of these maps as possible from the community to try and see if there's like any code that we can break yeah so like that's what I was gonna ask so I see it's not even them looking at the hexagon that's in the middle of like the picture they started to look at the hexagons on the outside of it and then they try and combine them to make a painting so dado and then we're making the paintings of all like the the nineteen rooms because each room has like symbols on each side that I like open and closed so it's kind it's kind of like finding the edges to the puzzle pieces now what if now what if the emblem is just that's all you get like that was the end of the puzzle so people who are Lords now be money for the meme but the quest itself is not complete after you okay so it hasn't like that doesn't turn in or anything like that so there is a quest that nobody has completed yet and that is what everyone's trying to find out what another current running theory is that as when we gather enough community images to find like a pattern or something or duplicates and and I mean the theory right now will say that's wrong that's wrong we really don't have a theory as of this as of right now it's more so just everyone trying to gather as much info as possible to see if we could like find a theory to latch on to you all right here's my theory and I'm gonna state this for the record this is while it hasn't been finished and this is gonna be correct Kotaro daughter was I did call I did call the the that room in that one raid oh my called that you would always like this has to be something in this room everyone well I said guys I bet you jump on those little things down there I said it I remember it and then they're happening and I was like I knew it and everyone was like no you didn't talk about anyway the Sun will come out tomorrow so that I'm right I called it so well I think it is is there's there's certain doors you can go into right I think whatever like the hexagon shape fits I think you have to be like in a fire team of three people or something is that the max you can go in with is three yeah okay so I think you're going with three people and then I think it shows like a different kind of way to go in for everybody and then you go back you go back the way you came and then you go through all the way to 18 or to 19 but when you get to 19 you take the door that your hexagon told you to take and it takes to a totally different place and you win and you get the ice breaker here's my theory okay Tuesday reset comes around and it pretty much just gets solved for us and then yeah it'll be labs too so I I personally think this is just a very deep very deep puzzle that they've set up I don't know if like there's a labyrinth we have to go through based on the symbols we get I don't know if we piece them all together and we get like like a like a sequence that everyone has to use to finish I don't know if like there's some other secret we haven't found yet that gives us a sequence to find the exit to wherever where people think we're going because people right now think there's an entrance and an exit and that's how we finish exploring the quarters of time some people think we have to actually like grab the sword itself from the corridor somehow so I don't know a lot of I mean everyone doesn't know a lot of things maybe we would have solved it by Sunday hopefully we've sold it by the Sunday guys please it's literally we're recording this on Wednesday so I figured that it's Excalibur and one random account is coated to be able to take the sword doesn't play anymore sex it's a golden Kappa like I like if it's Rob's we're doomed yeah like I said I'm not participating but I do play on my Smurfs though yeah I just I think they're just given us something to buy our time and attention because there's nothing to do I I don't know what's gonna summit something big has to be coming I'm just glad I met the person that's all I'm sorry dad oh I'm just glad I'm not you for today I mean dad was dados I think dad was pretty much done with it oh he gave up well I mean well he's going to pack so any dados and data put it enough like carried enough of a backpack wait for enough of these puzzles tour I think he could be like you guys got this well dad it was streaming and he's like I was like was I was I are you sick dad oh he goes yeah I'm sick but I'll be good compact boy only two days you're gonna be fine poor guy put him on so bad for him too he's like he's losing you're like yeah painful like almost dying and he's like sitting in discord like hey can you guys run a couple of these sequences for me like in the discord everyone's like yeah [Music] 1:42 like 150 Sammy was able to do the 112 he had like 100 110 120 yeah I was like I'll do some smile I never was assigned one they probably don't give him any I would just be the chat I'm like I had the 11 sequence smile play ah yes I ran this one let's just move on and hope that by the time comes out someone solved it or we can just forget who solved the next time I think there is a an exotic behind it what do you think no nothing another has to be exact there's not an exact I would be upset you don't think there's anything Christian not an exotic what is that I don't know do not an exactly gun because the only other enough one we know about is the bastion or whatever which is gonna be a quest later and I've had secret guns that have not shown up in one time nope I mean that's fair no right it would be cool but I'm not I'm not so you're doing I'm nice like my hopes up it might be like it's just like a time locked thing and then like come reset Oh puzzle solved yeah legendary thing or so I have no idea yeah as you know I'm not invested in it at all I'm not either but if it is something cool I will go and do it I'll think about it now you'll do it we'll see how complicated this well it's not good well we're how easy blue compare if it's still if it's still not solved by Sunday by the time we're tough because we're talking about it right now I'm I think hopefully I solved by the time this podcast comes up but if it's not then damn well either fruit is right or we have a very elaborate vodka worst-case scenario a very elaborate puzzle and I really hope it's not fruit is right because I've case scenario you're right I'm just being a realistic realistic Ralph right now think about Maine I serve with our mm-hmm yeah but you right here is that doesn't count and I didn't like our names are new I don't know what in our name is but I do know there's an ad break Oh oh that's cool welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Gigi overeasy podcast we're away right now we're making serial killers in the making I'm fruit ninja bro anyway welcome back we have some exciting things to talk about that don't include destiny puzzles that was probably the most exciting topic I know yeah I don't know if we can get if we can top that uh the car tax rebate one was pretty fun I actually learned a lot hey that was important yeah it might not have been interesting it's come for a circle because you dig it has yes I will be applying for some rebates and speaking of rebates okay what's a rebate we can get on this podcast from our viewers oh you mean a review nice try but that is really close that wasn't my best one yeah we do have a five-star review can't go

moving forward I think we were and yes ah well as a reformed as we can be okay so I had well I had a tweet yesterday I don't think it was a stupid question I don't know if you guys saw it yes public on it pretty sure it did oh did you i think Claire said this is the stupid state version are you serious I thought it was pretty interesting so it's been windy in Colorado these past couple days oh yeah and this is what Claire had to say she goes somebody like oh that's a shower thought she's like no that's just Rob's brain all the time no oh that's a weird shower thought that's just what was driving Ken Dryden chillin hey where's that Tennant - I'm good now hey come on I'm driving sometimes well that's not any better yeah one in six what is that it's just kind of like you know that's twelve and six and that is not her that's me I'm a car accidents I've been I'm anyone leaving your house at one time remember oh yeah after the pastry's jacks game go Pat's well what was I talking about he's so tumbleweeds loser yeah I was like I was it and then I had my anime moment as it is it all over Brad you come back because it's going is he retired so are we gonna do we don't have a quarterback when it's windy why do you only see tumbleweeds when it's windy like I took like I've never just been blocking on like you in a party really well this is cause like any field and I just never seen it like it just a tumbleweed chillin this is what you're missing out oh we don't follow raps Twitter I only tumbleweeds when they are moving like I literally read you in my town I read the people my tweet for those who don't follow me and if you don't follow me come on but it's true like and you know for a fact it's true you never see a tumbleweed when it's not wind okay so here's yo where to tumbleweeds on from yo you know it's like you never see them when it's not windy I've never seen just a tumbleweed they're just kickin it and said there always be tumbling food for thought why'd it sound like you were at stand up trying to deliver a pie yo why is tumbleweeds you know I was honestly blazing in my backyard like like just thinking about tumbleweed mm he's kind of gone back from the gym and I was like I was driving and I literally saw like seven tumbleweeds on my way like in front of the road I'm like another Road tumbleweed to get hit hey come on now and then I was like have I ever seen a tumbleweed just chillin and the answer is no have you ever seen a tumbleweed not tumbling in the wind yeah way yeah I'm a humble plant what do they come from well here's the important thing when do you ever go outside to even see a tumbleweed exactly let alone in Colorado of all places and there's a lot I mean there's a lot of tumbleweeds apparently here like I mean I saw a bunch yesterday but you just never so you walking it apart I'm walking in a park and there's a tumbleweed plant there like hiking on stuff wait is it but like what is it tumbleweed ooh humble well [ __ ] it just tumbles but like what does it do what does it mean what does it provide like where does it come from or is it just a figment of my imagination like Aryan told me not everything provides in this world some take like us if anything did we provide more water from the IceCaps more heat from the Sun there was all that water trapped in the ice caps you're welcome now you can drink more water drink away idiots just drink your sweat tumbleweed facts oh wow that's lets hey let's check it up yes please hit me with these a tumbleweed is a structural part of the above-ground anatomy of a number of species of plants a disappearance it is mature and dry detaches from its root or stem and rolls due to the force of wind okay yeah and that's it there you go so it just comes from so it starts off as a plant dies and then it like everything you ever wanted to know about tumbleweeds Wow God Wow okay this is gonna be riveting let's hear the truth about tumbleweeds isn't so simple Oh see they may be romantic symbols of our national love a fair with the Wild West it's true this may be but tumbleweeds are also invasive weeds called Russian this Russians Oh what what Oh your armies are here I just cracked a puzzle the commies many modern-day Westerners fear they're taking over no this is we especially since I just started watching Chernobyl this is bad I'm at Mother Nature Network oh that's a yes in 1873 Russian immigrants arrived in South Dakota carrying flaxseed though is apparently contaminated with Russian thistle seeds so wait what is scientific name is South Sola tragus I didn't want the Lord's own as mucus invaders from another continent quickly sprouted unhampered by natural predators and diseases to keep them in check just wanna know why they'd each winter after Russian thistle plants died the brittle bushy parts snap off at the roots and blow away dispersing seeds wherever they tumble about 250,000 per plant whoa because Russian thistle thrives on little precipitation look easily exploits disturbed land stripped of native species it was able to quickly take hold a Greek ultra fields and overlaid raised lands of the arid West so tumbleweed by the end of 1800s this intruder had already rolled its way across most western states and into Canada Oh carried by wind and even railroad cars so a government botanist sent to investigate in the early 1890s could barely believe his eyes one almost continuous area of 35,000 square miles had become more or less covered with the Russian thistle see in the comparatively a period of 20 years what is it Russian thistle look the life of a tumble literally looks like a tumbleweed when we think of tumbleweeds we really picture fledgling Russian thistle bushes and this is oh I see that play all the time and they're you know now you've seen technically a tumbleweed not tumbling about so a tumble but that's not a tumbleweed imagine it's a dandelion no it's like a caterpillar that's like a caterpillar the tumbleweed is like the butter four things dead rush I'm at is a dandelion you know when you see that they're not the same thing is they it's like that like a tumbling like that it's this but dead so you're saying caterpillars and butterflies are the same thing what that is a caterpillar which doesn't involve okay did you know evolves into a tumbleweed rakes off and dies yes it's a tumbleweed no no I read all that from now that this will does not evolve and do a [ __ ] Gyarados and then go all the money yes I get it doesn't evolve but it becomes it like I'm note when I die I'm no longer alive I am dead but I'm not saying I have to do with a caterpillar and butterfl because they're not the same thing you wouldn't classify a caterpillar and a butterfly is the same thing identify a caterpillar and a dead caterpillar as a caterpillar yes whether or not it's dead or alive but what I'm saying though is like a Russian thistle and a tumbleweed yes they come from the same thing but they are two different things they're not robbed if there are two different things if I'm reading this right would earlier was the Russians a Russian thistle doesn't really what happens it gets cold yes riddle guys its fault no it's your dead I get that and then it just out but now it's a tumbleweed no longer a Russian base just tumbling it's a dead Russian thistle that's tumbling so they're like it's a tumbleweed because the Russian thistle is a we normally take off the [ __ ] the green of the Russian thistle and you literally have a tumbleweed see it but it's a tumbleweed now and it's not a Russian thistle it's just a nickname Rob know if you want to if you want to be specific if you want to like use like actual like be is like putz as soon as possible you as a twosome Russian thistle like like you guys are saying a Russian thistle and a tumbleweed are the same thing you're just saying it's a it's another phrase for the Russian thistle there is a Russian you're a human and a homo sapien yes like that okay two different ways to say it but human is just I suppose more no but I still do the same things out homo sapien does you know like I'm a human but like a Russian thistle sits there and just is a plant okay all right yeah right as plants do why are we still putting at houses dies and then it becomes it becomes something new it's like a butterfly house yes yes it's dead but it changes who it is in what Italy it's just dead what from a tree it's not the same because it's dead you literally tried to a brush and thistles in my brain okay hey hey you know how you guys go through puberty isn't that the same as dying no that's uh you're literally a question yeah no but what I'm saying is that it just becomes something do it early a next dad Robby V that's your Nick but you're still Robert so when a one I see a toddler you know a tumbleweed tumblin thank you when I see a tumbleweed tumblin all right doing this thing what is it Russell yes but then why do they come up with a name tumbleweed if it's not a boy hey she's good you know the Pioneers used to ride those things and miles um did a tumbleweed it's a weed which weeds are generally annoying and are invasive and it tumbles yeah but I just I thought the tumbleweed was its own like Musa butterfly like thing like it's a whole new and different me but there's a whole this can all be boiled down to the commies it's their fault okay yeah well yeah okay now can we move on yeah I guess thanks for answering my question or I can continue reading about nope I don't know I think I got it because I got it right a lot like you don't it's gonna confuse me more it was funny when back to the told destiny to puzzles when Dad was like doing a bunch of math he was like okay so there's like four doors you can go through that's like a hundred like some I thought I was like 25 goes into 100 four times dad Oh smile and he goes okay glad is correct and then he's like reading jegos Rob that is also correct I was like thanks Russian thistle is beautiful in bloom before it dries up and tumbles away why am I in this podcast right now that's what they even called this they called this to a tell me talk about 25 goats bleating grow so much few more times and then fruits like oh dude so the Russia said that tumbleweed can grow well I thought a tumbleweed was dead no it's just a nickname this is tumbly because eventually it's gonna die oh it's gonna topple oh well the way tumbleweed bumboy so we've been tomboy but bump bump but why would you call that probably when it's alive and it's not oh my god dude these boots were made it's called a Russian thing or whatever that's just what I do anyway these days boots or walk color coming out delayed was it well it's old release date is dead and now it's evolved into a beautiful tumbleweed butterfly the [ __ ] oh it's glaring it's a cool Aryan yeah that's a bold move cotton so eight when was this game supposed to I've never played Final Fantasy and I don't plan on playing it but why you man what my I've never played one I'm fancy amazing but it's lining but it's turn-based well not anymore well boring term basis boring hey hey - watch yourself yeah that's why I don't play dough boy that's like you know Rob you've changed I remember when we saw the let's go Pikachu an Eevee trailer you're like bro is it normal for me to get emotional and at that moment yeah you remembered what it was like to play turn-based Pokemon and now you've turned your back on your roots but but like a turn-based game that is supposed to be that great like how good is it hey um blue yeah a resident gamer um I'm curious you know you know card games yes for you and don't you like Oh what is that call when you like you let the other person you take a turn yes that is turn-based that's a card game though that's a card game what's different in instead of a card it's now a person because I wanted I want to see the person like I want to move the person and hit with the person I don't want to say uh you know what cloud attack and then he goes I mean it so many good games know what you're doing with your card card attack yeah but that's a it's a card game as like nice death rattle bloom and you know but what I'm saying though is like that's a card game like in Arizona where Robert are stone yes Don and I'd like played a lot and I put a lot of money into it yes so what but I did quit for a little bit and only turn-based he says but no thank you just stubborn but when you're unwilling to open your mind but didn't you say Final Fantasy is no longer turn-based oh I wanted this because it was [ __ ] boring and made in the 90s and that's why they decided oh maybe we should change this you know it recently came out let's blown up yes bravely default fortnight for instance on the 3ds they may have a second one either they already came out or something guess what it was like an homage to original Final Fantasies blew up people love it they're still turn-based games out there you know what's turn-based slay the spire cards the spire miss a turn main sking with cards King I'll show you I'll show you a bad turn based game if it doesn't involve cards a what a bag game that doesn't involve cards now you're attacking my advanced wars like is is it like Mario like turn-based I never play bit more I think Paper Mario is turn based on I hated Paper Mario because it is Super Mario RPG oh my god one of the best games of all time yeah and that you're gonna tell me that's bad boring I won't say these games are bad but I will say they are boring yes we spent three turns figuring out what a tumbleweed was Mario use plunger attack on third one all I'm saying is that I think that genre is very boring and slowly dying almost like an RTS is you can't say those are blurry when you play card games god there is a difference but you like these four games for games or turn-based more games are tight but that's a board game you just have to reframe your mind then do I'm gonna be playing a lot of board games at PAX what we do but I need to see if I can pick up talisman we need to play talisman well they have a little they have like a section where you can rent out okay we're playing talisman and I'm bringing in charge of infinity yeah which is that the one you guys always play like you Danielle dad oh yeah bag of likes everyone gangs up on dad Owen and he instantly gets destroyed yeah otherwise he wins buddy got take them up what is so what is it like it's like a board game equivalent of a deck builder kinda like slay this fire but instead of fighting a eyes and stuff you're fighting each other and it's turn-based yes but that's not video game so okay every board games everybody out there listening yeah if you're on youtube comment below if not tweet Rob or post on the subreddit something start listing off some good turn-based games that if that Rob can't play and be able to busy the same ones I'm gonna here Final Fantasy personas [ __ ] Paper Mario RPG or whatever I you just let me think I'm trying to games that people like I guess the new Pokemon like I love Pokemon do but it's boring it's boring to Pokemon I wouldn't say no yeah you're right I don't I do not love Pokemon but I like Pokemon and I like I yeah I'd love how it makes you to feel Civ brings you good but it's a five-term basic boring into the breach I don't know if you play by oh what the hell that is sounds boring fan 10 games yes I into the breach brush so good as made by the people did FTL anyway it's not important see I think RTS is and I think turn-based games are the two most I guess boring an advanced Wars I love those games Advance Wars you are you and I are poll offices here if they file fancy tactics yeah Final Fantasy Tactics pretty similar war groove recently came out that was like a love letter to it like Final Fantasy Tactics and advance wars that's fast RTS Fire Emblem almost all the firearms except for the more recent ones well yeah and then even still except for the one like a couple years ago this most recent turn-based there's only one turn-based game that I think looks kind of fun what's that one game where you have like four it's a kind of cartoony style you have like four people and you take them through like a dungeon or something like that and like you can have like an apothecary like heal somebody and it's like it's only like a 2d kind of wait wait but wait up was that called was like what do you do every week with dad Oh Rob yeah but that's really that's different that's that is not tournament every combat is turn-based didn't but that's differ for the combat for me thank you judge fest urban based D&D most of the allure isn't about the turn-based combat it's about all the RPG that goes in between the turn-based car what is that game that I'm talking about though you know like yo we played a lot moon moon plays at a bunch what's it it's like a dungeon so it's dungeon something dungeon crawler dungeon something and you take like a team of four darkest dungeon mayor nights that is that what I'm in a couple years yeah that game looks pretty sweet that one's really hardcore - yeah that's what I think South Park the stick of truth he's losing it but he's standing up high he has a spine dude I've always tried to like make him stay up like how did that happen that's a dumb question just let him stand let me die no it makes it way easier because then we don't have to [ __ ] you took your training we left the fiddle is thing okay well we just got robbed there with southpark yeah South Park is that but that's because I love South Park though not but the there's always and yes I will say though that that was the first time I played a game like that when I found out the combat was like that Isaac we've managed he's like like three or four turn-based games that's been dark not can you I tell you that that South Park games probably the only turn-based game I have ever played like the guy working through but you got you bravely default there was also more recently octo traveler I believe that's what that was called that came on squishy I was in doctor path but I just no octopack that's what it was I liked him plus the art style is really cool like that the 2d had they did all that yeah but I think your turn-based is yet so I won't be playing Final Fantasy seven long story short but but the new one doesn't have turn-based anyway oh I wonder why because it was boring and stupid that's because Final Fantasy has changed well what do you yeah because it was boring and that's why they changed it anyway initiative boring is different from other people's doesn't important okay so what is the what is the appeal of Final Fantasy 7 as somebody Kingdom Hearts is the closest I get but I know who like cloud is I know like teef is only because of Kingdom Arthur the appeal is that it actually changed up a lot of things that made turn-based boring for a lot of people back to hello maybe I was a little try it out not only that I mean all you have to here is the victory theme I mean yeah if you don't want to play it for that I don't tell you one of the stories dope - at the time like the cinematics and the stories on everything was doing was insane well I get to see a triangle walk up and that was crazy it was crazy at the time the fact - back then it came on two CDs we couldn't fit all on one you had to buy on ps1 it came with two disks did it really so at one point he had to put in dish - yeah back then damn you could like just skip I'm just putting this to fust not really how that worked but what do you mean because like you had a save and so I get a certain point for certain content or everybody you need to insert dish - uh-huh so then you put that on and put it in and it essentially just has the load of the the rest of whatever you needed to play on but it's not like you just I didn't show well I don't think they were capable of that and like then when did this game come out I mean probably right after the mid nineties a light bulb yeah I don't know 1898 played it by candlelight I'm offended right now don't be dude it's just my opinion and it just happens to be the right one they are and now we got whatever I knew explain to me the story I thought that'd be great it's pretty complicated the story is great cuz it's so calm explain to me like I'm in splain it's explained in less than four sentences what Final Fantasy 7 is about and what cloud goes through loss and then has to go and fight this mecha overlord people but essentially there's a it's like steampunk ish and and there's like a motorcycle chase and it's really dope okay and he finds this girl on and this guy and like bear and stuff and they're like fighting this really sick and you go and then Sephiroth she's a tough kid watch the animated fight but they did for like a movie a while oh I was like I've seen that yeah Advent child mm-hmm great you ready for the plot you ready for the plot that we're gonna be here census Avalanche destroys a shin Romano reactor in Midgar an attack on another reactor goes wrong and cloud falls into the city slums cloud buried and Tifa rescue Aerith during their skin literally reading like the bomb discover that president Shinra was murdered by Sephiroth who was presumed dead five years earlier and that's the plot that's it was interesting still yeah I mean I'll watch people play it I'm probably not going to please they're good enough fine whatever when does it come out now why is it delayed I'd forgot we're done see I'm kind of over the whole remake [ __ ] I'm kind of over it maybe but that does bring us to more important part oh no it's not March it's until April it was an issue it was March oh there's only a month in two days way worse but it comes out a week before Cybertron by the time of this odd capital Z out Dragon Ball Z Kakarot excited why it doesn't look good I don't know how to feel about it well I mean I'll play it and see yeah I saw some guy on reddit post he's like walmart sold me Kakarot like two days early and they had to like manually and put it right yeah they sold it to him they had no idea they were not allowed to sell it yeah I don't know it was just basically like the old stories right like you just play through the cell saga the frieza saga goose ah I haven't done that enough times okay Rob please do it again many times I've played through the thing is the reason Budokai two three threes I keep turning these out is because Bandai will lose the rights to make dragon ball game unless then they publish one every year yeah really yeah so that's why they have to do it which upsets me because like Fighter G could be like the best fighting game if they just like show love and but because they have to keep after like kind of move on to the next one and even arc sis the people behind it who like mainly developed in stuff in Japan like yeah we're totally done to like do more stuff but it's all tube and ein are they updating it i like along the way or i mean they were originally only gonna do the fighter z-pass one but then they came out with the past two which I like Geryon and Brawley and og DH and all that kind of stuff we're hoping for a third one or maybe hopefully just a sequel sometime I don't know how to do that but still it could have been so good we have whoo Warcraft 3 reforged I'm looking forward to that one what isn't that turn-based - what's hard tf2 remake all weird RTS you know we're esports that exploit another sleeper you have Thank You blue I know you guys say you are such an entitlement you have to respect your elders Rob did you really just did you gotta respect your elders that's the problem with America you know you're all get them out in orgies this dude buys a house and suddenly he's a Boomer was like playing with his door the door is like looks fine it opens and now there's some it does with a door and I swear he look you look like a dad like they're speaking it back and forth on there's something wrong no closes doing what a doors supposed to this already like the thermostat might nobody touches that except for me which by the way I am trying to hoody season it up right now and I will tell you I'm struggling really yeah I am sweating up a storm that's so weird what it feels like like you're in here is it's a furnace you're weird man I like feel great but this is uh back on sale oh yeah because I know it was only available for a small time January 24 oh there you go Chet granblue Fantasy Versus that game looks so sick dude oh my they're fighting game from arc says we bum you guys are naming these games you guys like man this looks sick I think you guys are mimin but you guys are serious yeah no grandpa fan first looks sick I'm a gamer and then there was a there was the it's another it's another grand blue fantasy relink have you seen that yeah I don't remember on that one literally we bond sir hunter yeah sick I want them to do a anime on bamboo bamboo because that originally was but it's like in an original world by arc so shut your mouth Roberto all right or a tumbleweed Rob they called me that's because I do be tumbling that's my name [Music] yes Kingdom Hearts 3 Ahriman oh yeah is that the is that the DLC that come out this way no I do on PlayStation it comes out early late and you went anyway 23rd or xbox that comes out February haha what happens box comes out February all right maybe Ella maybe I'll crack that back open we have one punch man here Oh nobody knows I might suck but I'm gonna buy it anyway that'll be a fighting game and has an interesting mechanic or if you want to have side Touma on your team which is one punch man yeah cuz obviously he's just like stupid strong it wouldn't make sense to make him a fighter and like he's playing people and he's like actually fighting and losing like that wouldn't make sense if you have him on your team he's a win condition and if you get to a certain amount where you tagged him in there's just a whole cutscene he comes and just when you win the game really yeah but you like sacrifice upside like a spider team but if you're able to fulfill whatever it is to call him and you like men that's cuz he's one punch man that's awesome like that pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team yeah remake season but mystery dungeon is my choice it's a remake - yeah oh my bro that in Hollywood what do you want me ain't changing anytime soon my hero once justice - is that the movie no it's a game that's a game I think good yeah there can win the same one we're gonna find out I know fighting first one yeah what the hell is this like finding game month or something what is this I think it what else are they gonna do with my hero I don't know JRPGs a visual novel yeah be cool I probably I I'm lazy neo - that's gonna be sick that's like Dark Souls right ish yeah it's like I never curse with you it was like Seki row before Shecky row just not as good as check iran so you can't beat second row never um maybe get your channel to do that that comes out March 13th ps4 I think might be an exclusive I'm not sure I think it is doom 64 and doom eternal now is doom eternal doom - or is it like a DLC yes doom eternal is a sequel game that's sweet I didn't play the first one Fairy Tail I didn't know there oh no way it's an anime it's a good one is it no I'm like 80 episodes deep it's a long one yes good so it's good and thinking about certain doctor stone by the way oh yeah might branch out I'm saying it was bleeding edge I'm not sure how I feel about this one yet I'm gonna try it for sure it's this inviting game my god yes and no it's like a hero battler but it's like melee so like imagine overwatch but you're only like melee you know huh and you have like abilities and everybody's different mm-hmm it's like four before with like objectives I'm sure we'll make a video on it from Ninja Theory so I'm gonna turn that one um but then how great here's the heavy hitter the fun stuff if this hasn't been these haven't hit you hard already these titles can't see a audial if I'm pointing the finger guns I'm about to pull it I'm gonna do it Final Fantasy 7 remake April 10th and it's cyberpunk 2077 April 6 yes it is I cannot wait plus I've been watching are you gonna be able to beat Final Fantasy in 10 days no I probably just I probably won't even play it just to save myself a big chunk of time for cyberpunk cuz I'm going I'm going hard boy yeah yeah new playthrough god only knows that game is gonna be so intense it's gonna be so involved and I'm here for it that's April 16 can't wait that's definitely my oh it's six days dang yeah it's my demo most anticipated 2020 that we know of so far not halo 6 infinite or whatever watch yourself ya know cyberpunk takes the cake halo 3 is probably I'm over remake season unless its halo 2 halo 3 that was the stipulation but then Last of Us part 2 May 29 that one got delayed too oh it did mm-hmm may seems like a good point that though yeah but that one was gonna be yeah then there's also one I'm interested too interested in this one doesn't come out though until new console it's gonna be like I think with the PS 5 like a launch title mhm God fall and if you've seen anything about that slasher it looks dope yeah I think it was first revealed it but it'd be a morons yep it was and then there's some other stuff nothing to write home about League of Legends wild rift that'll be the iOS the mobile version of League specifically made though for mobile as well as its people didn't rage already at League legends of runeterra January 24th or note J yeah that's their card game right mm-hmm oh it goes open beta actually like the 20th or 25th their turn-based card game right yes okay yes yes but I state that and their time but now like so the main way they're gonna monetize it is by like board versions and like things they're trying to make it would raise free-to-play as possible which I like that no card game has really ever done are they gonna have an economy though or is it like a dust kind of system what they do is you can get shards or whatever to like craft but then also wild cards so if you open up like a rare wild card that means you can just craft any rare oh that's right yeah you told yeah which I liked because the Magic the Gathering arena did that but they've been botching it apparently with a economy and his monetization and stuff it's just a nightmare and then Timm Timm anywhere a 21st I think next year no oh I said I thought you were going like never I was like I just forgot to mention you these aren't on the list that the early access comes out next week you know there is a game I have to give my credit to wait Rob knows about a game yeah Wow yeah and you like it a lot too you've been posting a lot about it about a front - bro Oh battlefront - he said already came out I know but like now it's I feel like it's a whole new game honestly it's totally sick and if you haven't played it don't [ __ ] play it it's sweet I love it rust is coming to ps4 and Xbox one russy's and for confirmed shut up do not like can't believe you just said that now they're gonna take that in [ __ ] run PT XD I literally like think about that all the time Oh ghost of Tsushima that's gonna be sick is that like oh no that's like that one game when he's like running through the field on the horse right some more but I also don't know a lot about it hey you don't need to samurai do you know I saw a horse cool art yeah no I meant and a similar Elden Reagan for some reason that name rings a bell dying light - oh yeah it was surprising I feel like they revealed that game way too far ahead of time yeah yeah I forgot there's even when I played a little bit of it at like not last year's e3 but like two years ago III before they even announced it is pretty fun anyway we don't know what fall will hold because obviously me new consoles yeah and that's where I feel like this III although Sony's skipping on e3 again even with new kanji three stupid especially with all like the weeks last year that happened with oh yeah with all the journalists and stuff like that I got boned but that - yeah I just don't I don't see because I mean Nintendo's already on their way out like Nintendo doesn't need e3 to make their announcements and isn't that all did anybody else think the video game awards like was almost turning into like an e3 kind of thing like almost like what's just another time a lot of eyeballs are watching it I feel like a lot I feel like that's what people are gonna do that though is instead of having like a e3 press conference just save that [ __ ] for the video game or just Wheldon or you're big enough either yet you just do your own like Bethesda Tony Bethesda's losing it though man I need some room I need Elder Scrolls 6 now it's not gonna come out of here I need it now to save your reputation reputation reputation quickly turn off there like I used to have a soup love fanboy love for Bethesda dude and that he's gone like you know that one massager I took yes with a guy talked to it all yeah he was on ironically a thought 76 BAM that's a that's pretty in character yeah seriously and it was he told me a hissing yeah I love it don't you put him on for I was CI Kelso can be like you can't not like it I mean if you do more power to you but you do you're free you got a set expectations a little higher which I can't really say that cuz I played Pokemon so that's a little that's as that's as low as you go is I just remember us talking badly about 76 while ago and in the comments people are like fruit you haven't even tried the new update I paid $100 for my super fallout 76 past and it's a totally different game come on bro description fee and if I don't keep paying my subscription fee I lose my world that doesn't even work yet or something which I know the argument is yeah but they took time to make it better but they're still making so many blunders and first off how could they ever release a product like that and back it and Todd Howard was like he never once said he was like yes this wasn't like this is perfect that's what people wanted word we didn't compromise everything and it's like this was literally later because when bethesda releases games they are known for being super buggy like when they first come out Avenue say yeah yeah this is a whole broken game I think I got my money back so and then they put it on their own launcher god I hated that guy's game but yeah I think well cuz like the argument would be like well like Rob just said battlefront twos better he gave it another chance except I also think the three years of updates yeah I think the other thing too is one while battlefront did ship with bad microtransactions and the game itself was still good it was fair the bone structure it's just whoever decided the player economy and either gonna life stuff like that was the problem then I go transact but the game itself was still solid and now they fixed all that you would I can't even buy my current transaction anymore all of its cosmetic if you want to which I bought the like or I think because I had origin access whatever I guys like everything the cell the celebration edition which has everything along anyway mm-hmm which how it should have been when the game came up no I think that's completely different yeah like that was a when I played Star Wars for first time it was like wow this is very pretty the game is fun to play I just wish there was more to do when I play was a game when I play 76 it's nothing works I can't even loader the server I can't even talk to you how's this inventory work it's not even a game like which robot am I supposed to talk to oh yeah we're like the terminal so bad the terrible game yeah probably at worst game of the Year last year and then there's Layton hell I thought it came up 2018 I don't remember no I had it in 2019 like February 2019 being and I flushed it from my mind I remember so excited we hopped on it yeah well here's an ad welcome back to the podcast where I'm not giving Rob time to sit down and I got to keep getting toes yeah I like that though hey real quick yes tonight we're seeing weathering here with you I can't wait I can't wait I'm gonna cry for those unaware it is from the same creators of your names I mean uh which you if you have not seen that fix that right now real quick it's not a movie and your name like Britt that's what I love about your name it breaks the premise of a movie it's a piece of art like you could put it on the wall that's a turn-based movie of them no it's not it is a movie is it it's not a movie a piece of art I don't do yourself a favor and wash it I've never seen Rob tie so solemnly about something I mean it it's a top three maybe even a top to her Wow yeah like of any movie yes yes for sure did that movie makes me feel castings and it made me I will say kind of ruin what was ruined for me was after the my whole Katie thing uh-huh someone edited that yeah it's inside 0.0 I was awesome that's still I probably want my favorite like dream teen videos we've probably have ever done Connor but you should go see that but that is from the creators of that one and there's also using the same people who did the music which is rad wimps mm-hmm and you know Rob why don't you give us a little rendition you gave us a little taste make a way okay I'm trying to think of which one I want to do and which one I can do without being very offensive I mean Isaac Ryu sue me back I say why Oakland almost beer I bought a Mosinee burner that's what it is that's nice that was nice I just killed that Wow yeah do you like that please don't ever put me on the spot like that again because I won't do it and I will make you something instead don't ever put me in mind with a fence I'm gonna take you to the back of it you ever do some polygon tell you what but before we get on to the next segment let's take our patreon resume Hoarders our patrons love you Wayne Angie Brandon Smith be nerd Sean Logan Boyd thrown Lozinski Chris Yaeger like Russell dem Halle Jaden Blanche Maria brainiest GP hash newcomer Benjamin Thomas as well as our stands the stag Omega se big sexy arts tha or the stag big sexy oh my guards and say if you want to say it the wrong way yeah thank you very much we appreciate your support we love you so we're gonna I forgot to post like hey these are the questions we guess I thought you were actually gonna throw that I was like wow you are showing a lot of tendencies so I kinda the next time I just kind of went I am going to go through some old ones when there's actually did a really fitting question and I'm really weirded out that it actually came up tumbleweeds no it's about something on the table Jameson Tanner says I'm listening to the episode 15 right now and I have an anime question do any of you guys like Gundam animes and if so which ones Gundam Wing is a classic and amazing but I also love deep love for Gundam Seed /ce destiny I have only seen Gundam Wing that's the only one I've ever seen - and endless waltz the movie fan-freaking-tastic movie I couldn't tell you what the anime is of I remember it's giant robots [ __ ] fight me why I think I mentioned this on a podcast while I remember but someone did sinned in the peel box a Gundam Wing model for me to build which I used to do when I was a kid it is uh when Jesus was this the wing Gundam II W is that that's like the main protagonist is Gundam mm-hmm this is like the at least from but it doesn't come colored right like you have to color it you some think so but yeah I used to because when I used to build them it's such a pain and they hurt your fingers uh-huh you have to pop them out of these plastic things other colors oh yeah Wow spoiled because when I did it they all came like this it's the white hair like silver and then and then it was all silver and then you'd have to paint it yourself so it would look really cool and then I would paint it and then it looked terrible but thankfully these are colored oh my God look at the little stickers dude that's gonna be so I don't have the patience for this but you see these things we have to pop him out of this uh-huh they you blister and they're like rips apart skin so much I'm not a fat I'm not a fan of that but it's fun and then the final product I like to do this eventually and then we can put it up somewhere near in but I've only watched it when it was on Toonami so like I've never really like I I couldn't tell you if I watched it from beginning to end if it was on after Dragon Ball Z sure I watched it as per usual I'm a horrible person and didn't bother to bring the letter so I don't know Thank You Ethan we appreciate you I think this was from Singapore he's the one that also sent them all that other stuff and like your uh I think the midoriya oh yeah yeah mm-hmm maybe that's what he said I put that on my shelf blue did you ever watch Gundam Wing or any of the Gundams yeah I watched it a little bit I was never like crazy into Gundam Wing though mm-hmm yeah I just remember it on Toonami and that's it yeah I just remember like one day like watching bunch of robots fight each other and that was pretty much phenomenon tanami it was a banger Oh tsunami like absolutely absolutely like introduced me to everything that I loved about liking by animes I mean just Dragonball Z to others that I watch um but I was gonna say you remember what what this reminds me of try to stand with you Toy Soldiers is that what that movie oh yeah I love that movie yeah that's hilarious I love that movie I used to have the little figurines from that too all right here's a good one from Winky dinky this follows the Avatar bending universe oh if you guys could have I hate this question if you guys could bend any elements what would you guys Bend paas I love the podcast he loves the podcast okay so you have to answer it okay sure I've thought about this little bit I think we can immediately negate two of them earth and water because you always need a source but you have your source everywhere on earth no bullets so let's say your water you're not near a body of water unless you're carrying something with you mm-hmm you probably don't have a I don't like waterbending I'm with you I would not even think about Earth is nice and usually on earth but well we saw most people as my last can I have metalbending yeah but here's the thing - the whole thing like we kind of saw in Korra depends on how pure the metal is and what it's made out of if it's if it's crude metal yeah then you can probably bend it but if it's like finer you can so your so your team air or team fire thing about arrow air or fire at least from here's the thing we're not going by em night shamalamadingdong movie well that's terrible because with him firebenders needed a source but they did yeah but in the show they never did they never needed a source yeah come on never needed a source i mean air is a source for fire so technically like but i don't need one but between yeah air and fire you always cuz like water and earth would be cool but I'm thinking practicality at all times able to utilize air or fire I think yeah I'm here you could fly I'm with you with the whole water part I think water is probably the dumbest one like that would be cool well here's the thing I'm all I also have plastic phobia literally going on you guys I blast a phobia so while going underwater and being a like breathing I want to be cool I'm already terrified of the ocean I don't want to go in there yeah so is that what that's called yeah like you scared of big bodies of water Oh like open water and stuff yeah not fan yeah no no thank you no thank you like subnautica literal sweats when I go down like I tried to make a video uh-huh and there's like when I'm playing by myself I would like have panic attacks because there's a point where you like get out from like the reef huh and it's just water open and it freaks me out I can't do it even in a video game so that's why I probably wouldn't also watermen earthbending is dope that one I would possibly think about regardless of the fact that you need a source I think Bhoomi makes me want to be oh I think I would probably pick ever you hear that boobie yeah um but like Appa my dog I think I'd go with ever bending airbending plus if you get into the darker stuff which is in like the extended universe whatever the manga you can suck the air an oxygen out of people and kill them that way like you have blood bending yeah yeah you can suck the air and oxygen out of people yeah of course that's a bit darker yeah alright so let's hear it waterbender why would you do is if you want to give it some real dark [ __ ] nothing gets darker than waterbending you guys are like go in the black bending like good bird people who I could crush all I could suck someone's air out I can literally Bend your blood okay but we need a full moon does it matter no you don't need a full moon if you have the right lineage and I'm yeah if we're talking about like straight full power of a band of bending I would absolutely pick waterbending one blood betting is legit like the most Opie bending in the in the series it is bust that's pretty crazy legit people who should have no reason to be fighting avatars are out here good like 1v1 ting avatars because blood bending is over power to [ __ ] only one we might I can freeze anything it will bro how is that not Opie I'm good but it has to be water water you're not just freezing and then finally three if you are a good enough waterbender you can literally create Bend water out of the air what the heck like that is has not yet to take that from living things though okay and yeah so it's not out of air at the cost of killing things over here that or as we did see if you sweat enough which I guess maybe I should become a water bringer because I'll have plenty of yeah water bending is so versatile and you guys are not giving the creditors I respect that that's a that's a sleeper ass I could do a lie yeah I like her time all around it you know I mean I'm a whoo-hoo-hoo that's right ha ha yeah ha I always thought about that though like if bending was real I feel like civilization would have such a hard time doing anything because people just destroy everything they say it's like I mean like my hero academia that like the progress of humans like stopped because everybody got like super pyres like so it never like advanced like they said we'd be having vacations on the moon but because people got courts I mean yeah I needs vacations on the moon yet quirks bro I have a question I wrote into the patreon they selected it very quick we have a bob okay from tumbleweed blaze 420 nice um my question is who do you guys think is revealed tomorrow in the Super Smash reveal I would say oh I'm by the way just to practice this is on Wednesday and yeah this comes out Sunday so you guys already know who it is like Dante so you feel like they've done a lot of because because who someone from Capcom or they'll make Craig team said look out for these dates and one was January 16th and who lo and behold the direct for smash is January 16th now um now the newest Devil May Cry was the third one right fifth okay see now here's my theory game by the way I think it's Sora because in the post they had the guy put three fingers up so Kingdom Hearts 3 it's coming what do you buddy laughing it I'm hoping for Steve Steve Steve that because I would not be cool you wouldn't really I would his moveset so easy though he's neutral B he pulls out his bow and arrow this today pulls out a pickaxe bag you pulled like a sword you'd be super easy Ivysaur character another sortie just what we needed while still will Dante yeah no I hope it's not Dante I hope it's Sora even though he would probably also be a sword kid believe it from a while ago deke I totally be done for doom guy it might be interesting of course I like doom guy mm-hmm or C I don't even know like I was telling Rob earlier like since Joker and hero and Terry Bogard I have no idea those coming I didn't see Terry Bogard or I don't know Bandra was a meme and it was kind of like oh yeah so like they did it and that was very like yeah it was kind of like I didn't think this would happen but I thought like make sense this was for the fans yeah but the other ones was like what and I think they've all they all have a good place in the game I think they've always done to get part of that it's just I never know I think Sakurai put three fingers up because he said Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming I'm with Sammy on this one another sorting yeah dude why not and then he can like but then like you can play a Sora you could play as like ventus you could play it as like Roxas you could play as like Axl you could play as like uh Sephiroth I'm hoping new Pokemon Eevee come on yes yes that'd be kind of cool and it well win work we might eventually get cuz I'm they did with greninja and then within Center or we might get a gen 8 gen8 Pokemon what if you get a what's the blue the third evolution of that blue one bomb if we can tell you I'm I'm returned in the game no please don't put any Pokemon in it the only choice is real boom blue with no leaks provided would you pick Dante still I would still pick Dante Dante is probably one of the most requested ones would you be happy with Dante I would be very happy with Dante see I'll do it fits so well in this mash note I like who cuphead Oh that'd be really cool plus if they did his animation style uh-huh another 2d hey hey what did you pay yeah yeah you know you want your brush it now hey come on now then some feedback on tape yeah what about cup at home you know like did you not like cup it oh now I hate you you had my back this is more egregious than that Rob about turn-based games what about the tumbleweed is it worse than that I don't know okay you can't Wow all right yeah you suck really I love cuphead well well and then like if they did like kind of a game in wash style with him like Game & Watch is a terrible cuphead mug man there's some Ultimates but then like the way Game & Watch moves is so cool like I just think it's so interesting that he still moves as like how the 4d characters move but he's 2d yeah I think it's just really cool they could do that with them well plus on top of that yeah the way they animated that Cup had like 30s cartoon to the stuff has a tone animation style yeah and then on top of that it's moveset I feel like you could just pull from all the different kind of perks and stuff you can put on them yeah that could be as different stuff I think be fun super sick but blue disagree you know I think Dante is well but I didn't say anything all right cheese nobody nobody wants cuphead and smash nobody's out here I want cover all right well you remind already in this situation unfortunately I've never played a Devil May Cry game so is it turbot no I D I want ninja actually dungeon or bust he's in fortnight let's get him in smash really what it yeah that'd be cool why not have him pom pom as I know his pawn pawn is like a critical hit like if you hit at the tip of his pawn pie just like it's like a nine yeah again it was the tip that's hilarious that is crazy though that they had is a ninja skin like a literal ninja skin like it's not even like a no mosh ya know it's literally ninja in his getup with his logo and his name and everything do you think they paid him or do you think they were like hey like I might get like percentage of the sale absolutely gets paid yeah he's probably getting percentage right this game and sale or something like that it had to work out some deal yeah probably like 30% because even if I wasn't enjoy I'd be flattered but I'd be like but you're also going like wow I do love your game but your where's the cheddar at well because he'd also be like I know I'm gonna sell you a lot of skins for this like come on do you think do you think this is gonna start like it'll see it into tapman skin now and now we'll see like a nick mark skin or like an execute C skin I guess it could open the door but I wouldn't mind if it was limits just a ninja just cuz of like the cultural who's never forgets he had like no matter what you think of the guy or whatever his content or if you've never liked him or whatever it's undeniable the like the cultural affect he's had so I think an homage to it is fitting yeah but you don't see this opening the door for like a Valkyrie see now you knock dusty we had it going for so long dude we were about to end the podcast with him and now we just chill a nice big chillin okay he's fine you comfortable blue and we are okay we got it we got it check alright but you know it's not I that we got in the pot oh that's not that's the worst transition that is the worst as a sat over yeah blue working people find you on the Internet do you find me everywhere i blue eyes low nice you can find me everywhere at rabi be mr. fruit more or less if you want more tumbleweeds follow me engines that is i was literally like driving like what I'll put these tumbleweeds man I think I hate this [ __ ] I can't believe you thought and then I gave it to a cabin that I came home on out there to different
