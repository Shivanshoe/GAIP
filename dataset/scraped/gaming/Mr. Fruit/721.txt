hi ad Holdren my name's mr. fruit and welcome to curse of the dead gods this game just released in early access and I got to tell you I am all about it you guys know it's a roguelike and you guys know I love rogue lights but this game it's it's impressed me so we'll hop into a run here real quick but I'll explain some of the stuff you're seeing on the screen right now bottom left we have our torch which doesn't do much damage but it just illuminates the area around us then we have our primary weapons we start with which is just a little sword you could do some combos as well as a little pistol time the shot perfectly like that you'll do some extra damage and then right here is a two-handed weapon you usually get one during the run here you have your traits and for each one you get it adds a certain amount of health damage or gold find if skulls right here which is the permanent currency you keep in between runs and you spend those on these runes that you can bring into the runs with you so this one will give me 3,000 gold at the start of my exploration and when attacking damage I take is reduced by 30% and can't interrupt me if gold here which you do lose at the end of the run and then here I believe it's called affliction but for every 100 affliction one of these will fill up and when you go into the next room you're gonna get a curse but this is kind of the cool part of the game there's give and takes with this so sometimes you can get greedy for this item but you're gonna get more curse and then you you don't know if the affliction is gonna be really bad or manageable not to mention every time you go into a new room you take a 20 affliction they currently have for exploration short medium long and hard we're gonna be doing the short one it's the only one I've tried as a map-like slay the spire the harder runs have obviously more runs and more champions or bosses whatever they call it that you have to get through but we're going to start with you some gold which perhaps might be a bit redundant because like I said you can see there I'd start with 3,000 thanks to one of my runes but I got to tell you a light is your friend we're gonna want to go ahead and immediately light that bonfire and you have to avoid these stupid witches so normally attacks don't inflict affliction but which is a tax they well they will like that yeah we don't like that you can also parry I will attempt to show you well we failed that didn't we try again there we go if you can pull off a perfect parry then you weaken the enemy if they're melee if they're casters like this well then sex 2 sec I'm gonna light that on fire though off fudge we messed it up so there is a lot of environmental hazards that you can use to your advantage oh that was close you can obviously dodge out of the way or just get a sick parry oh sure I'd really appreciate it if you uh if you wouldn't watch let me see if I can parry these oh okay that's good to know a little risky though cuz if I fail oh I'll take affliction but when you're a baller like me does it really matter alright we get a take to a relic tip percent base damage for pistols well I do like to use pith jolt so that's nice all the rooms are procedural generated as you can imagine nice try guy we also get a 15% damage against weakened enemies weakened enemies would obviously be like the people we parry so we do like that we don't like those traps though let's light this up here they can put out the fires too if you accidentally let them attack it well then boohoo sucks to be you the fire goes up and it is what it is oh oh get parried no I was too busy attacking we took some affliction you're gonna learn we really don't want affliction oh wait a second I can knock them into the I've never knocked him into the spike traps that's incredible but unfortunately it took a lot of damage and affliction the fact that I'm at 50 right now makes me real sad because I should okay I see what we're doing here oh okay yep yeah yeah very clever very clever but I'll take that go Oh Oh God okay look this first time played it I make a lot of stupid mistakes bear with me hopefully I'll actually complete this run that would be nice for you to go to the unknown though which obviously can be any random room I don't know if they're like special ones explicitly saved for the unknown rooms I don't know I guess we'll find out if that's the case well I don't like that come let's see gotta explore all the different ways though if we go this way we can't go back but whatever let me light this up and you bait them into it like that one it Jib ate them rid of that boom all right no you know goosh and we'll take that you also see this whole greed kill thing kind of like a combo if you're interrupted and get nose you get more gold per kill your story's 50% of max health when a curse is lifted sure but I don't even know how to lift a curse I didn't even know that was possible that is news to me but that I mean that sounds great don't get me wrong I'd I'd love to get my my curse is lifted let's light that on fire so I can actually see what's going on here mess up that Perry cuz that's just what I do I'm just the greatest video game player ever oh dude get hit by that I guess that we already have enough of fliction you don't need anymore oh and would you look at that we got a two-handed weapon so I can pull out this spear and it does poisoned damage just dance yeah nice it does it does sound quite nice what do we have here Oh Jake Galah this oh what a ceremonial dagger secondary weapon instead of a pistol two percent base damage per point of perception hold on I've never seen these what do these do wait a second whoa wait what okay not that that's not cool but I don't have any range well you know what I haven't run with it before so there's always a first for everything so why not we'll we'll try the daggers I have a feeling we're gonna regret that but that's okay we could get new weapons although we just got two new ones so instead let's go for some stats unfortunately probably unless we're somehow able to get rid of some affliction going into the next room we will be getting our first curse which is unlucky there are definitely some worse ones to get so I'm hoping we get a we get a lucky with the game by there but no way of knowing I am gonna use my dagger okay that was pretty cool I guess oh yes let's really go yeah oh okay okay so has AoE though okay okay okay okay another dagger it's literally the exact same one unfortunately you can't sell dupes or anything like that but I'll take that oh oh we don't have range but now with our two-handed we do we just got a bow and I'm pretty sure yeah it has fire attacks bt-dubs that's real nice that though is not cool I don't appreciate you trying to trick me like that game certainly wasn't one of your better ones oh but okay you're gonna enjoy this so I enjoy the environmental of tax you're ready you are in this room especially ah fudge I destroyed it though you can a rope these guys on and well in this case I'm doing a horrible job and I'm just here we go ah there we go obviously I don't need to do this but it's way more fun to do it so wait for them to get roped in you guys suck alright fine you want to die I'll make it easy for you Skoosh Skoosh Skoosh and just like with the pistol you can get perfect attacks and they come out a little bit quicker which is nice no you don't no no no I'm gonna use this oh that little Cabo is cool I must admit and also get destroyed by the environment yeah pleb alright now we're gonna make an offering so we could get extra health we could get better gold find or better health and gold find and you'll see here I'm left you could pay for gold if you had enough and on the right if you didn't you could pay an offer in blood and you would get affliction thankfully I had plenty of money so we're gonna go with the best one I'm gonna offer gold so I don't have to worry about afflicting myself about it Bing about a boom and now we go the next room unfortunately cursed but it is what it is should we get a relic or raw stats I'm like in alright you know I'm thinking stats wouldn't be bad cuz we need some extra damage but a relic could be nice let's actually just let's stack stats why not and here comes the corruption unfortunately it's too bad fools bounty what does this do the maw of soul desires the darker it becomes steel under matron powers leaves an even darker stain on the greedy gold chest now deal corruption when open gold amount looted and chest increases oh oh they know how to play right into me I want muddy but if I want money it's gonna come at a cost and there are some ones more passive like that that happened in certain circumstances some combat one of the most annoying ones is your enemies are cloaked while in darkness so you have to keep light on them at all times but that is much easier said than done okay that's real nice okay can you uh no you're supposed to fire on fire on them our way oh oh I didn't go through them oh oh my god this this just got so bad so quick oh my god I'm a rookie oh my that shouldn't have happened I pulled out the wrong thing I didn't dodge through my got hit by both afflictions I got hit this just went from bad to worse my friends but that's okay well there's a will there's a way maybe hopefully I really hope so screw you oh no you don't know you don't you you I can't see nothing Bob oh they don't yeah fine I'll just dagger you whoa who's about to attack me over here we go we got the kills actually now that wasn't good but we're alive I guess so that's currently what we got going for us not a lot yeah this you could tell okay all right yep very funny when they always like to try and try to trick you all you know fellas it's a security bt-dubs you said now I'm trying to not aggro that thing in the back and it's Agron it is a lot easier to manage when oh Jesus well you have to worry about other stuff it only does one attack occasionally but when it attacks it is so annoying please kill it thank you hey you know the standard kind of dice with it perfect shots weakened enemies oh my god it doesn't do as much raw damage and it doesn't do fire attacks but that's actually huge that is so good because weakened means they're 50% their defenses reduced by 30% so obviously you do the math the DPS would be better if I can get those perfect shots all right we can get extra damage was what we were looking for better gold finder or both you know me we're gonna get both offer the gold no way I'm offering my blood I took way too much this room sucks to suck but it is what it is and I get well I don't have a choice didn't realize guess we're getting a weapon so we're headed in oh boy okay I didn't even bother to check the map is there um what the fudge is this okay this is kind of new oh yeah you see that all that weekend though oh whoa I'm out of stamina it's important to note some of your weapons ah fudge requires stamina to use all right I don't know if I can combo this okay who you can good to know oh yeah actually for quite a bit of damage to you ah fudge you know every time I get in close nothing good ever happens I'm out of stamina give me a second I'll get parried you already weakened so it doesn't matter that much what I'll pretend it does you need to die and you need to stop you oh my god where did all these people come from I need to get my weekend shots off okay I'm having a problem with my mouse it's actually releasing too soon for somebody what the it actually won't let me charge ah what's going on what what's going on I'm not maiming also what the fudge that hurt oh there did it why wasn't it letting me I don't know I wasn't trying to make like John's or anything it's literally not working I swear on me mum please kill that okay you know what you just had to go and suck when you wanted to show people the game didn't you mr. fruit this isn't what I intended I swear to God die yeesh that was a bad room alright what can we get here aha war two-handed bow jazz more damage perfect shots pierced through enemies with like that temperature damage wall on the light 30% damage against elites champion - air boss is opposite base damaged roof that is nice that is nice and we do have enough gold for it we could go ahead and get it better no no I think we'd go with this one I like this one let's use our gold am i okay we won't get another curse yet so that's the good news that's a sick bow man I like that I'm gonna need to keep things lighted though cuz it gets more damage well in the light but it doesn't illuminate itself so so you can see by the symbol when we're using it we're in the darkness oh my god I just noticed we must have missed the only place to heal up ah suck all right we got to go stats and in the hope that this randomly gives us Jesus really I'm throwing okay well here we go oh sweet Virgin Mary look over me these dire times so I asked those piercing shots are nice though all we need to get that guy it's doing it again where it's not letting me um charge up must be pressing something wrong can we not take damage for what Oh get out of that for once in my life mr. fruit yeah yeah okay you know you suffer he is such a wide arcing melee ax and everything it'll hit me and it does freaking every time on the backswing bra take it so much damage hey we care about the affliction right now I did just live oh god yeah geez okay we're good they're gonna try and trick me with all this shenanigans that today I dodge through that oh my cat I'm gonna die I'm what are we gonna die I'm gonna die I'm bad I'm bad about about I'm gonna die incredible oh jesus not no not like this why me oh god this is all right this is gonna be rough hold on we got it Josh no we're supposed to dodge through him okay yeah he damages his friends that's a good start okay he's very upset understandably so listen listen we can be friends we can be friends I don't know if I can parry him but that seems like something I don't want to find out watch this though oh just get right behind them ha ha big brain it's a little risky enemy attached till 25% less corruption well that isn't that nice it's a little late but can I get that you just heal a buttload because that that'd be really cool I wouldn't mind that all right we're gonna need max health oh thank god okay max health and more damage this is all the gold I got left but we got to do what we got to do I owe but it doesn't heal me it just I thought it would also give me 250 health fudge all right let's pray to the unknown please God all right please don't be like just uh uh what Greed's blindness with gold on the floor will disappear after a while but the value of its increased okay okay that's fine that's fine we're practically done anyway it's manageable 16 gold that's not bad huh oh oh wait what it what is this wait a second I've never seen this before I don't like it cuz I could just go on cuz here's what's gonna happen there's a gold in this thing and I'm sure it's gonna give me a crap-ton but I'll have to fight for it or we just leave now and considering all that's left is a relic room well I get I mean I could use it too no I think we just we got to go we got to go dude no way I swear I don't normally I don't are bleeped take this bunch of damage you gotta believe me you gotta believe me oh oh wow the gold already disappeared Jesus I literally just saw how's that even fair breath alright let's see what's up here anything worth my time uh well there's certainly enemies let me see if I can't upset e spaghetti him oh well they're certainly upset e spaghetti grab the extra gold come here gah mere you guys aren't really coming here but that's ah god I can't shoot it won't let me shoot ok I'm not moving anymore I can't shoot what ok something's up with my mouse right now this ain't cool bro oh ok all right listen Ella I'm not making excuses it's it was actually something good I mean that doesn't explain why I've gotten attacked most of the time don't get me wrong extra perception sure helps me find more gold doesn't really matter right now but was that really all their effort took damage for pretty much no reason essentially there is some gold up here though don't mind if I do no no how much this is actually gonna bother or matter rather okay well that dudes just sleeping in Chile Jonas oh my god I didn't have enough stamina screw me Pierce Pierce all hours dice oh my god I don't have money watch your stamina mr. fruit watch your stamina don't put out the lights on me ok come here buddy ah the backswing every time oh my god why am I just the worst oh this is bad this is bad this is really really bad I am weak I'm weak I'm going to die what can we get here was this give us no single source of damage you take and exceed ten percent of max al well I would certainly hopes that be a hundred fifty damage gold offering cost Greek no this I could do it I'll get another affliction and I just have to hope it's not terrible for a last boss fight screw it didn't I got nothing else to lose nothing else lose whatever you know I've said take my blood I don't care it's already over for me Jesus Christ yeah hundred sixty health going under the champion images that precede terrible events I'll jagwire statues not trigger fireballs that should be okay wait a minute no I think there's a lot of statues in here and it could either go really well for me or really poorly and knowing me it's gonna go really poorly oh Jesus Christ can we have to we have to Oh God statues oh yeah this should be fed immediately takes 30 damage because of it no you don't know you don't we just got to do this it's it's not pretty but I can't risk going in there and taking damage cuz fireballs I can't do everything man oh god screw me I would have only gotten hit by the fireballs Oh Mike they just they're everywhere they're everywhere why they're always firing don't they have something better to do bro rah rah it's just it's just a prank bro Oh God get stamina back I'll use I'll use them to my advantage haha hit the boss I think not entirely sure we're doing we're actually doing some pretty good damage and we're piercing oh wait a minute wait a minute this might actually be possible I might oh my god oh my I actually did it how is it that I take the least amount of damage in the champion room oh don't mind me I'm just gonna yeah give me a little better you know a moment 24 skulls not bad me I've had everything under control do you guys are you guys worried about uh-huh and that my friends is curse to the dead gods I hope this video does well probably either way I'm gonna make
