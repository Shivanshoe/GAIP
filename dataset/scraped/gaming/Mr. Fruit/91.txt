everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and we're back on my free to play new life account and i decided once i unlocked pvp on the account hey you know let's see what crucible's like as a new life maybe there's like certain matchmaking pool originally well instead what i learned is i understand why 99 of people are like yeah i don't i touched destiny pvp once and i was like you know what i'm good because i got to tell you what you're about to watch if that if that's the new light experience i would not blame you for not touching that again with the 10 foot 20 foot hundred foot doesn't matter how long the pole is just don't touch it you know what i'm saying enjoy the video free item oh don't mind if i do as a free-to-play player we need all things free yo dudes we got a freaking we got a catalyst i'm surprised they didn't tell me to put it on okay now why world's my oyster i can't even play the crucible when do i get a player cruise ellie this thing i'm like what in the dickens i know what i'm doing and i'm still overwhelmed kind of like choice paralysis too many things [Music] stop it forsaken campaign free yes control what the [ __ ] brand new player and this is the first thing i see what yeah right hello yeah oh 1360. literally new light player this is no this is not like sbmm they they have nothing they know nothing and then i'm sit first game in this i'm like why am i frozen no wonder no one plays pvp good this is their first experience yeah well now get started okay okay what the [ __ ] i even know what stasis is and i'm like what the [ __ ] first killing this account is with shotgun finney is it yeah i wonder i have blessings of this yeah dude what the there are so many things popping up on my screen nope nope oh yes yes goodness great sister dear god what is this this abomination god must not exist or at the very least he's not with us right now ah this is their first game they probably never touch it again huh yo get body whoo when i say about you say who bali what is happening everyone's light level is so high does that matter i'm confused where'd they get all these cool i'm a robot well like how how is it not like a protected bracket for your first couple pvp games or something good it's gracious this is brutal there's no defending this uh [Music] question man [Laughter] and okay yeah sure you want you whatever no i'm gee well curse i've played destiny or maybe i'll pick up to ashley too i've heard the pvp is pretty fun let me check it out for myself i've determined that is a lot yeah jesus christ what's up watch okay yeah my stats bro absolutely cracked up and then i'm like wait what no in fact he died to me yikers uh i've been killed by who furticus maximus their accounts what two hours old why are they playing with me yeah i don't know i don't know and you died to me so wow this is chaotic in all the wrong ways i've got friends in all the right places i was like wow but this guy is kind of well white oh i wonder why oh that's great he must be a new light player too wow i wonder oh he got such cool stuff so fast open to you've been bamboozled god dude ally who yeah bally freaking yeah nice i was looking for a genuine new light experience i have found it yeah screw you in a pirate ticket yeah what the [ __ ] what help me help my dog i'm frozen i can't see yeah you need to jump down oh my god i blink oh my god i'm throwing oh my god i'm throwing blink come on oh my god it's not bad come on nice first track oh jesus christ run my friend what what the fudge see i'm like what the [ __ ] did he just hit me with stupid the the i don't understand it's like they have skill-based matchmaking very clearly and crucible so why do they choose to give a new light player a lobby like this at the first i understand within the first like two three matches they could probably pretty quickly discern okay this guy doesn't belong here let's bump him up well like these are the lobbies i would normally be getting on my main account this is bizarre and not only that it's like i don't even have you know what okay i'm putting on the tinfoil hat i wonder if they do it to make people feel like they have to buy things um think about that because they're like wait what's that weapon oh whoa where did he get that wait they're killing me with these things wait i don't have any of this oh well maybe i should you know didn't like call of duty it was like back in modern warfare or something maybe even earlier there's like a patent but yeah they have a system design where like people who buy more like micro transactions are more likely to be paired with people who haven't or whatever so then people are you know i don't know me he doesn't know [Music] die that was fair like no that guy's not even a new life okay i think he's just struggling hey look at the players i'm playing against and then there's me like this guy plays the game that's weird i'm not staying in that light you just need a better primary all right you know what dude you know what let me show what it's a buy i'm going to rumble hey i'm going bottom i'm going bottom tree this time man let's mix it up what do we got here not new light but it's with people like seemingly tanking their light it's bizarre and then everyone else is not remarkable yeah a couple gilded flawless in there all right let's do this my name is mister oh my god dude come here come here move back back back back back i'm immediately back are you kidding that's his loadout get bagged on sudden just got killed by a new light bruh what the fudge yeah okay yeah all right bud adapt icarus grip my anus there's me with a hand cannon emitter nothing holy wake me up inside what i now understand why people say remove pvp from destiny holy oh free for all that kind of sounds fun huh i'm getting spawn camped by gilded flawless and unbroken wow oh my god what the fudge killed you you must have gotten team shot who shall not pass stupid ballyhoo [ __ ] what is your laggy son of a yeah nick what oh my g kit absolutely output you guys are so bad this is embarrassing new light player by the way hey thanks he got here [Music] oh low there she goes oh low i'm in the way oh oh this is too good now oh wait a second is the stubborn oak the great what the fudge is this show i don't think i've ever used a shotgun this kid is kind of popping off ah you so look at my eos luna yeah whatever dude i got value all right can you say the same i'm gonna go ahead and deny that yep hey i'll take kills forever this man just walked through my rocket launcher explosions yeah all right yeah what what's this what's this dude dying that's what i am too young and too pretty to die okay but the value and the stubborn oak man she's more like stiff oak okay well almost killed them rude maximus has met his demise once again what the [ __ ] jesus get me out of here oh boy okay well i guess i die now guess i'm very dead now hey where you guys at uh happy birthday happy happy birthday not to me obviously uh sorry friend are you probably sweating like yeah that's why i use vorpal weapon dude what is this that one didn't even make sense from that far away i'm a super it just lights me up i hate it here what's that you've got you know i this what like my fourth time getting heavy yeah i have one heavy kill and the guy was half health i wouldn't even really really say it was much one minute left oh gosh your enemy what the [ __ ] yeah wow oh i mean i'll take the loot don't get me wrong learn it well but also what the [ __ ] man the motto of new light players guess i die now oh yeah freaking oh yeah yeah yeah who wants a piece of the champ do we know there new life's not going to be touching much of the pvp because why would i ah my first introduction well hello mr beaver so nice to meet you always good to see another hero of the tower now that's the real destiny experience oh yeah okay uh okay that's an armored piece okay so you know not popping off yeah all right so here's the thing a new white player doesn't know what this dude is true but if you're looking you're watching this and you're new or something like wait yeah here's big easy thing for you every weekend you got some extra legendary shorts boom approach this weird anti-identical man okay because he's gonna give you something i can't afford this i wouldn't buy that anyway frankly it's not what i would choose first but a fit in aspects honestly that's pretty sick i can't even afford these that's quite i don't know how much shards i'm going to get away you know i'm grabbing these our first exotic armor yes you'll be honest i don't think i've ever used these weapons oh yeah all right straight to the point weapons already in rebuild very quickly melee range is extended and it's 66 good decent resilience intellectual training pretty good pickup if you ask me [Music] oh my god you know what i'm talking about we'll take it what else well that doesn't help us yeah i'm probably like a destiny player oh my god i thought you don't shut your mouth right now the best way to introduce people this game because i feel like it's one of those games where it's like oh it's easy just gotta give it some time and then look up a whole bunch of guides and watch some videos and ask some people hopefully some of your friends play that's not the case for everyone what a month dude may it change your fate thank you why is there a cosmic horse i'm so confused it doesn't make any sense yeah if someone's like hey i just made a new free-to-play account what should i do i'm sitting here and i don't know what to do so i i'll tell you this but whatever you do don't touch crucible you're welcome i can tell you that much that is not to play [Music] [Music] you
