hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to today's video a very exciting video because as all of you know for quite a while you know between different times whether it be a little while mainly you're not the inception of the channel first couple years we always had a lot of series going on usually some indie games and stuff but we all we always had some let's plays and whatnot so i figured you know it's been a while since we've had something like that on the channel so i'm thinking we do it with volleyball which if you haven't heard about this game it is the wave my friends it's incredible first off vikings that's it that's the that's the tweet and open world sandbox survival i know it's like what everyone is playing these days is whatever game seems to be but it is so good at first the graphics you might see like what in the world is this is this like runescape 2000 like what year am i living in get past just like minecraft it's definitely stylized but the best part is the game has so much depth and i can play with friends so what i'm hoping is we get a little series going here me playing with my friends or sometimes grinding solo if nobody else is getting on but a let's play of valheim as we go through the progression of becoming viking becoming legend becoming ragnar so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video if you do like it be sure to show it some love help me
