also gg it was a pleasure being a player hope you have a fantastic day you're a gentleman and a scholar also if you did see the gold Oh Jhin video been having problems on the keyboard turns it I did have a backup one but the buttons are in weird places ahead it has these weird macros on the side and the last keys don't have textile keys so when I go to put my hand on it it's always in the wrong position it doesn't feel right so essentially what I'm saying is I'm trying to set up some John's just in case I was what do we have oh the Odin I did recently max level this during double weapon XP I gotta say not a fan hey I was going on but dude I didn't realize we can teabags like that yeah no attachments 3 5 7 no attachments no thank you I'm just gonna head down mid uh-huh meet him in the middle I sigh dude a gentleman I like it yeah she's like you know what let's not play footsie we'll meet in the middle and Duke this out like a gentleman will bow to the fisticuffs here well it was nice when it lasted but it appears he's done with the ceremonious Mahamaya what were you doing bro oh my god that's funny but that is a man I can respect look at this dude trying to push down find me my spawn I like that I can respect that sir now where are you huh meet me in the middle oh there is I see you you see I wait a minute Renate over there yeah yeah let's go screw it we're going for the sweep let's do this check out my patented strategy though he's not gonna see this coming right mm-hmm okay it didn't work it didn't work it worked it worked ah let's go for it oh baby so far we've been getting the smaller maps and I like these I don't know how like there's some like Hill or whatever I don't know how that how well that would do or the 1v1 but it's the origin 12 second time oh and he's using a little pistol you will rap where I'm a pistol shots going that's mm-hmm yeah what happened to the Honorable vac oh he's uh he's back right I don't know what I'm shooting at did he Mele me I mean it was a good stunt play oh my god the dude refuses to shoot the shotgun I don't get it and he could have very well just shotgun me Oh we sniping though okay okay okay all only a hitmarker is this man still using the sniper rear that the pistol fine I can use it too buddy see see I'm just like so offended if I lose around I don't know why come on pick me he doesn't want it's cuz he's right over here nope that's right over here oh yes he is Oh check this out wait oh that's not a stone is it's a flash isn't it ah jeez I was gonna stun him and run run to the other side and I was gonna snipe him for a disrespect but yeah that didn't work Oh throwing knives though I think I know what I'm gonna try and do yes let's go that's how you end a game yes sir pistol I hardly know where all we're right in the shin that's got our GG back again you're a gentleman and a scholar in 11c in the arena were enemies but outside of it there's no need to fight you no no Zane we can be friends gunfight on cargo oh I have not played this map either Oh looks like we're gonna be sprinkle a little bit of paprika on this match season it up I'm a fan I mean all we need to do is add a dash of cumin and this is a delicious dish actually won't that be fruit paprika and cumin I can't imagine that's tasty oh look it's all nighttime and stuff I don't know the map looks like you can go up and other things okay good to know we got the assault rifle let's check what's up here oh wow a whole bunch of rafters I god this tax with so many places they could be oh he threw a grenade paprika hello its me cumin he's gonna probably expect a higher elevation play which is why I will not do it I will not succumb I'll be family but it doesn't matter if I can acquire and stay on my target faster than you care my friend oh it's that headshot there Marge oh the carbine okay this guy is it doesn't stand a chance I mean we're talking about my gun my weapon I embody everything that the carbine stands for ow foggy fee saw me first that's not fair okay well played I just didn't see him when he used the the carbine where is he oh there is yeah I am I just ran away from this boy I'm pushing you know I am oh alright well play dodge me alright well now I'm just getting embarrassed and I jump right up here I can't oh I thought I was gonna go the other way and then I just miss my shots follow oh my god I'm sweating I'm so mr. fruit you're gonna lose you know what I think oh he was right here what I was trying for it what are you shooting it oh he's on fire though you and there boy yes he is oh no he's right there like okay yeah definitely that he was on the tunnel but now he's freaking origin shotguns brow he's just gonna use the pistol and I don't blame him because it's gonna be the right play Oh yep there is al we're pushing yeah that's how we do it get on in there mr. freer we get him I'm the party and I'm bringing it to you sir we're still using the origin go ahead use your pistol see how that'll do ah jeez ah God ah jeez he knows I'm here so we're gonna we're gonna psyche are you really yes I do it was around here somewhere I was just gonna flush him out my all my throwables he'll either get started fly forever he might he's to the grenade run to me me Bob they would go and 800 IQ with all that stuff bouncing around and making noise it's less likely that he's able to listen to my footsteps uh-huh uh-huh I know I know big brain big brain we're actually gonna take this one a little slow I know it's it's not my mo for a reason yeah I just need to push blindly because I don't know this map this guy knows that the angles and it's working out for him not so much me oh Jesus Christ let's do this ah wait hold up I was so far behind that box that's not even funny I should have just kept pushing uh that was only pistols okay this'll be interesting that's great aggression is got me here Oh Claude you got the first shot uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh let's go we finish aggressively that's right this is what it's all about mr. Frodo it's all about pushing your advantage or disadvantage it doesn't matter which state I'm in we push that was the most honorable fight my Spice Girls friend okay he got me sweating that was close warmup Brown's stats are not affected wait wait so do we just miss the cups wait a minute there's snow balls a feller where where is you hello dude Oh what they only hurt him I figured it would kill him yeah okay like yeah I guess I have to punch perhaps not lethal by the way though yeah it was pretty fun yeah but now I've sent a statement now Jesus this guy's here to play us the 725 but with reduced range so oh wait we can still use snowballs I might just exclusively use snowballs then oh wait there's a yellow snowball hold on how does this work where does this guy go we just oh dude oh can you imagine you thought it was so sick okay what is it is this guy playing is this does he have like an Arduino or a team like a just a certain path of what I don't know we need to go find that yellow snow again dumb pom-pom don't-don't-don't um got it all right at snowball time brother snowball ready you throw it and oh my god he got destroyed geez I didn't realize I had an arm like that that thing that dude's alliant my goodness all right FAL so maybe we take things a little slower this time around yeah it looks like he has not moved so I'm going to yep I'm gonna flash em okay yeah this poor guy he's cold afraid alone and scared afraid and scared those are kind of it kind of the same thing right he just doesn't usually like doesn't even peek oh there is nevermind he's peeking bro he didn't even shoot back what is going on here am I getting pranked is he gonna let me go up like five Oh and then he's just gonna turn it on or his ashton kutcher about to come out here anybody you got pranked brah I don't know either way we push I think I need to know wait right here yeah bro easy it's like he's literally just following a set of commands I was like he always goes through this and he still does this is this is strange or maybe I'm just so good at reading my opponent oh my god mr. fruit your amazingness never ceases to amazing this never ceases to amaze me that kind of and a redundant look at this new leaders dude we got it will get us bad what I I don't know no no that is funny though you Gigi I guess yeah what do you say boys and girls one more for the road huh assert my dominance see I can talk all big and mighty until I lose which might very well be to frog all right what do we start with the carbine okay I thought this was my weapon until I got absolutely destroyed last time so let's see oh fudge but it comes with the laser okay that's good what's rush MIT there is a funny story I didn't mean to switch my I didn't realize I had a hybrid I accidentally clicked it and it kind of disoriented me but we still pulled it out so I guess I'll take it sitting still Frollo Harley oh you like that don't you he likes that I'm numb numb I'm on a nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom we eat those we eat those we eat those we eat those we eat those my eggs really different person when I play competitive okay I'm sorry it's like once or like to be twos I'm playing with friends and stuff I thought I heard him but I was also talking and then I realized it was too late and I was dead we're dead who are dead we're dead we're dead we're dead we're dead we died of those but today's a different day because watch this 800 IQ I'm over here oh hey wait a minute that was my play oh he's not gonna see this coming he's not gonna see this coming where is he Oh pulling out there wait how did he I didn't kill me I mean the origin is not that not that strong none me and well played I wouldn't have been using my pistol right there if I'd known but what do you do should not go Pekin when I have to reload like that I I wouldn't peek when I reload as I I'm still reloading what am i doing god I'm so stubborn I'm an idiot really who knows where I could be in life if I just took some my own advice or didn't do things is a hard way you know I probably CEO of Tesla honestly Elon Musk who the mg34 I can't say I'm a big fan but that suit key because we'll make it work now unfortunately seems like with the old machine gun rounds why is that gasps oh it's a smoke grenade oh why am i jumping up here where is this man I found him but I would like you all to take note of no matter who I'm playing no matter what's happening I'm always pushing a one-track mind that's right leave that boom saw you coming oh the RAM seven I didn't know they added the new weapons into gunfight that's cool holy shucks that would be a rocky Elantra they take that buddy oh he burned it he burning he don't like that ah oh I knew he was all like oh poor guy yeah I didn't even have a chance to react to that what a moly throw match boy let's go it's close though and he might very well go for the rocket play again which is completely respectable oh joy was mid throw dang it well played sir we'll play God now it's now it's match point oh god now I'm sweating oh jeez oh I get nauseous with a nervous oh no God this these are the final rounds they give us owner if it's always the same like this pistol fisticuffs he had to have seen me like that come to Papa come to Papa let's go you see that place the Navy has to run towards me yeah yeah yeah let's go let's go that was a close one though well played for art this is what I need my life man the only thing I was missing was some trash track from the other end but they also announced a 3v3 gun fight that's gonna be a whole bunch of fun what I hope you guys did enjoy this video now if you don't mind I got to get back to the camo ground with that said thank much for watching happy Souls a fantastic now I'll talk to you in
