i'm an acrobatic ninja now first i must disable their shields and dodge meter no you don't but there's more of them oh there's another one oh what a dodge look at that i can barely really keep a hold of what's going on here my heart expect more confident as we move higher up the tower [ __ ] uh i'm hacking the mainframe what did i do oh well isn't that convenient man this fulfills my cybernetic space ninja dream that i've always had but wait a second you actually dream about that you don't look at this no you don't oh yes you do swoop oh my god up up okay this is uh this is this is embarrassing nope take three this is the perfect game for me because uh because i suck apparently you know i was gonna say it's the perfect game because sound effects this game was can i oh what a

ghost runner and i'm starting to think i understand why because if they're all like me well then it makes sense why we're nearly extinct now but apparently there's like this octopus lady that's like yeah screw you guys whatever she's got like a skill let's get oh my god what a save what come on all right slicey dicey that is my uh my superhero move i named it slicey dicey as anyone would no no no i fi except human error of course this is why the ghost run is way better dude he's like mainly an android must be nice not having to have feelings can you imagine not being depressed [Laughter] i couldn't all right i ain't playing games no more they're all dead skirt maybe i should have shown you guys earlier levels where i swear the earlier levels it makes you feel like a god and then and then me being me i'm like oh dude i know what i'm doing and the next thing i know i'm i'm here all right game time baby i'm coming back to this guy first where did he go where'd he sir existence is pain yo but no lie the parkour is like super smooth super fluid dude nope nope almost dead you like that yeah it's one of my special moves i normally don't pull it out but these plebs are pissing me off oh oh you can't shoot me [Music] that's the last of them here first try that's not i can't believe i did that well back where i belong the garbage chute skirt i'm surprised that all these enemies that are fainting to kill me don't see me doing this like oh my god hardest hardcore i've ever seen somebody do like we got to fight that dude hard pass yeah hey we did it god never more iconic dude than me and freaking samurais dude i love samurai blade uh what's cooler dudes me going pew pew or me going slicy dicey oh no oh my god he's got rapid fire this is a new development i thought it was already hard enough oh hold on let me see if i can try something ready [Applause] i just deflected all those ready watches i know there are people talking they're like whoa you know exposition story look i'm the story is cool now but i'm gonna be honest i'm here to slicey dicey some people as a cybernetic ninja okay actually does have a pretty interesting story it's just you know right now i'm recording i'm talking i can't lift i ain't got no time to listen what a lovely day what a day oh my god i'm nuts oh my god oh i feels i actually feel like oh i feel like a real gamer right now real gamer real hours holy cow you know the game's good when it's able to make me feel like that because god self-deprecating humor you gotta love it what's down here i think i've been seeing ricochet this whole time that is a perk you can actually do this like a skill tree thing i'll actually show you right here there's modules and as you get further in the game you can obviously unlock more but each skill like has to be fitted in its own slot somewhere so you can't just do everything you have to mix and match but you can do stuff like projectiles the sort of reflected back of the shooter [Music] that's what i meant to oh my i hate mine okay what am i that that needs to be destroyed okay i'm on it oh but how what am i what how am i going about this what what am i doing right now freaking can i just go can i cheat ah hold on that's definitely possible 100 possible 100 it's not possible it's not possible heads up there we go oh what up dude okay now screw you i hear the assault rifle guy but where is he okay that's just a solo dude whatever oh i think that's the guy in which case uh i'm in trouble because yeah wait where am i going where am i going what am i doing oh no i'm vulnerable dude respect me boom boom but see yeah once you know what you're doing uh which you know contrary to pop relief i kind of know what i'm doing you can do this cool stuff and it looks like whoa like you

baloney god he deserves a raise i'm going for these people first screw it i totally forgot about this guy there we go i'm just i'm skipping the line bop screw you oh you know hey this actually kind of works yeah it's it's a different route but it works all the same jump back up you mantle too hard all right this is gonna sound really weird do you guys ever like it's freaking freezing here like my house is like 55 degrees i kind of like it but that's not the point but you know when you get like so cold your nipples just kind of harden what's that is that a weird thing to bring up because that's like that's what's going on right now i didn't know if you wanted like a nipple update but there you go okay you know what i'm just gonna smash cut to me finally defeating this level because god god okay and whoa i beat it we're all heading towards definitely a whole bunch more times the worst part too though is like i like it you know i like that trial and error and then getting it right it all comes together don't you love it we're not playing just comes together oh my god they want me to okay which way to the filters oh holy cow i actually just felt like a bowels right there that felt good
