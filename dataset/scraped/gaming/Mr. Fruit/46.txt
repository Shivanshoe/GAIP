okay i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and i gone and done it oops i broke the game bungie please nerf me or this or ignore all of this what could it be that's possibly breaking the game surely it's no it couldn't you mean to tell me the cerberus one auto rifle is an absolute monster yeah if you're good at pvp this has always been one of my favorite auto rifles well first i just like auto rifles and there's like eight million barrels okay what's not to like it's an auto rifle shotgun we've been through this before but it's high time i bring it out of the vault we're rocking the catalyst again you know how it is i can swap to a tighter close range spread that's not the only thing tighter with a closer spread you know i just i just keep putting on do marchers just because but maybe i should start using one-eyed mask or something ah theory crafting couldn't be me even though it's literally not even aircraft and it's just putting on an exotic that's already two that's already too much for my brain to handle all right we got a more tighter spread bigger spread see ready but then change it there's that automatic shotgun oh i'm so ready but first i got to be oh here it is oh my god it really is an automatic shotgun it with that range a hundred percent good lord what was that okay i gotta i gotta swap the assault rifle time here we go nope okay so versatile so deadly all things uh you thought i was talking about the servers oh that's embarrassing oh my wait oh don't what that was actually some like nute damage and i'm not one to say that lightly because i hate nuts i know blast for me it's something about the texture okay i don't know what it is i just i just can't all right and i need you to respect that about me all right time to come clean all right yes i was just trying to get some clicks you know sensationalize that's what the whole world's come to you know did i really think the cerberus was like all that more not really no but right now oh i'm thinking it might it might be it might just be here comes the shotgun sucking me softly with hit hail baby got back all right we're shotgun time okay that wasn't quite how i drew that one up no maybe the catalyst is made 100 the catalyst is bait that's okay not everything can yeah yeah the more i'm using this cattle is the more it's like wait what what does it do better maybe it's like a little more damage or something but yeah try me um that's what i thought get out of here got me overshield i got my friends well i mean if you can bother to hit some headies you just got to be so close you know it's so situational i need a i need a jack of all trades here okay well maybe it is well isn't that exactly what this is wait a second yeah you can swap between fire mods depending on the situation i mean if that's not jackie trades well what is oh we'll get that damage from afar absolutely insane i mean it is literally just a shotgun so not really sure what i expected okay all right i'm what this thing's trolling hello well that's a lie i dispute that i'm taking you to court i'll see you there you like that you like that okay you killed me so quickly but with the new seasonal artifact mods look at how quick we relook oh yeah baby give it to me baby and all the ladies say i'm pretty fly for a titan guy it's i'm better i'm just better you know no no the cerberus is better i can't take its accomplishments from it i've done nothing absolutely nothing it's unlike my parents now hey yo uh any any ward of donners yo with wait my water back no i'm not watered down what the [ __ ] am i on about papa i know puppies i know i'm uninstalling you gotta be kidding me dude he's burning me he thinks he's got the upper hand except i have a cerberus with a catalyst and i didn't do anything to get that kill in fact it'd been so long since i damaged you i didn't even get an assist just like all the group projects too you know i do all the work i don't get any of the credit although you know going by that kill then you must be like wait so in fact you didn't do anything on the group projects and you tried to take all the credit nay i hate group projects because it yeah it usually became me having to do the most work and coordinate and if i'm having to coordinate things we're all hopes lost let me just put it that way all right um can somebody help me by the way anybody somebody yet again the damsels in distress their car fell on deaf ears what happened to chivalry yes it's me a damsel right i use it when it's convenient even if it's not complete i can't see i can't see because there's something on my screen we actually won pretty quickly because of the cerberus yeah of course see this gonna be top of the team top of the top three on my team take me higher also i have done it i hit 1560 we hit the cap kind of like that cyclops look he got going a warm little cyclops cyclops always got a bad rap why they got to be bad you know your cyclops are cool maybe they're chill and we are the bad ones isn't that really just ow oh jesus what happened where did how okay well i swapped to the shotgun module stop it oh shot that action ball out the sky it's it's so the catalyst is so bad why wouldn't i just at what range is the candle is useful because by the time i swap how about this huh no no yeah okay screw it no more catalyst right it's just it's there to tempt me i got it so that i would have a gold border that and nothing else all right so take that take that miss that okay this is going great my team's quitting that with the watch guys where'd you go i thought this was going swimmingly this isn't the best map no because most engagements are you know around that medium range and you know what we don't like medium range engagements or long range there are very few engagements we like it team team team team sure i'm i wasn't saying team like i'm blaming you guys just uh cry for help realizing that i'd put myself in a terrible position and hoping that you all could bail me out right there's the truth is that what is this thing in my face dude just a pocket galaxy brother this is a match that is happening and we'll hopefully be over soon oh yeah oh yeah oh no hey guys let's just stop killing frankly let's just get mercy here real quick i mean that's that's what i've been doing this entire match was not killing should go for the mercy just like that see i want to tickle them make them seem like they've outplayed me but in reality you know this is all under my control i am dick up then stop it check this out bop nice little mate there okay that hurts excuse me you went through my grenade was he invisible even how did i i couldn't or did oh so many questions he must have been invisible but like there was oh my god a head shot with a revoker from that okay i'm st that's it's getting a little saucy because that's twice now i'm just looking in the chat for dead phoenix he's only getting head shots done ah i get pooped up and you know i'm starting to think we got mercy though great work guys great work hey it all came together in the end you know it's not easy it's not easy but we managed look at us huh the small victories deep side resonance complete yes all right that's it i gotta go in a rumble i need to because now there's no scapegoat i can't blame anyone it's just me and my cerberus and my thoughts and you guys all of you watching so i'm not alone if you think about it i don't like this map for this gun i don't really know if there's any maps i ever wanna oh right right this is rumble oh right sure you just talked about how you want to be alone and melt people even though i think i probably would have killed them with just a regular assault rifle at that point it's so bizarre i mean it does have like random spread and stuff and that's the cerberus but that's that's kind of part of it right it's like sometimes that works out super well and you kill them in a flash and then sometimes it's like a four second time to kill when you're right next to them and it's like come on man statistically how is it possible that it's even spread that much you know what the prepare to feel the wrath of my exotic auto rifle i love this thing oh come here come on oh you want that heavy do you give me that heavy ammo i couldn't get a kill prepare the rockets i didn't get a kill i swear it you've got to be kidding me man sits there one shot me with a fusion rifle like he just outplayed me now how do you do it man it's like being a grown man going some like six-year-old kids t-ball thing like a professional baseball player and you just kill them and you're just like t-bagging them all right yeah you know you like that huh i get you mowed it off he's gonna steal that kill no he won't because we're better now he's gonna come this way but i'm going to post up here then i'm going to come around here then i'm going to hit you with that and then i'm not okay nah nah it's fine guys it's fine i'm fine i'm fine don't worry about me don't worry let it out you know it's not good to have all that pent up stuff i don't even know oh my you walked into the wither heard last time to give him a kill bro that could have been us but you playing okay i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst i'm using the catalyst bro we're both so bad but okay i gotta run i gotta skedaddle yeah i just wanna call cerberus into the office you know sit him down so what exactly is it you do here oh my god the random spread popping off you just sit there hold left click down and pray so it's no different from how i play every other game come on wait why did you all right well let's not stay outside that's exactly where i don't want to be but if i turn this corner and then i cerberus him we won't kill him perfect pick me high uh why is running in the 90s stuck in my head i don't know okay you live by the random spread and you most certainly die to the random spread by the random spread that's right shake it off shake it off soldier we're gonna win this game and not by my skill but the hair of my rng chinny chin chin come here come here come back here you coward okay i wow that was some real spread there i don't know how that happened ass wither horde okay that was a smart play but unfortunately for you it's not enough you're gonna get hit by that oh my god it's that it's that easy it's that free i have my super and he has a fusion rifle i'm only going to get one kill with this thing which is pretty depressing but i'm not really sure what else i can do about it one my second throat yeah yeah well good try good try throw that over there he's gonna run around the corner and not gonna be able to do anything about it nice stupid would have been extra bm had i killed him before he could even throw the shield but again you know live by the rng die by the rng i'm almost dead gonna pop this and then i'm gonna try and get closer to whomever it is trying to oh that's an overbomb why is that going towards me wow that was some tracking on that thing what the fudge was that what yeah all that went terribly that is a spawn okay and all right now i'm nearly dead hope that ricochets to something nope okay he's gonna know i'm weak oh jesus oh lord there's too many places to go no no no you gave him a free kill you boater oh god why the super near me why why why because i rap about reality no come on didn't even get a fine people gosh dang it ah we were so close and yet so far down this is the new meta you might not like it but this is what peak performance looks like that and
