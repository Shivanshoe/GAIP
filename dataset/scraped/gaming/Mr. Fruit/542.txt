hi everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to rogue legacy 2. it just entered early access ever since i saw the reveal trailer for it i was super excited because as you all know i'm a big fan of roguelikes and roguelites and this just happens to be well i mean from the name you're gonna assume what it is it's a roguelite so obviously like a roguelike in between dungeon runs you have some currency to spend in this case coins then of course your little village before you head into the dungeon you have your blacksmith and your enchantress the combat is really fast really fluid all in all i love it especially the art style and one of the most important aspects of the game is what you see right here it's the aerial kick which you can use to bounce off things uh perform combos or whatever because i'mma be honest with you chief i'm gonna do my best but i suck big doo doo butts i've been trying obviously slowly getting some upgrades but your boy isn't exactly slaying it so in order to go to the castle which is the dungeon you got to give this dude all your gold so you spend it on whatever upgrades you can afford and then you go back into the castle the cape the citadel agartha uh there's a big door here which i assume will open one day in the story or something i don't actually know but anyway this is the start of the dungeon then you move forward all you need to know is there's actually some fun stuff every time you recruit a new hero they have different talents and traits so for this one i decided to show this one off for the memes at the beginning lady autumn has the trait osteogenesis imperfecta which you'll see there i gained an increased 180 gold in this dungeon run however we have one health and then histrionic you're a two upper numbers are exaggerated which is just a for fun trait there are some traits that don't really hamper one way or the other they just kind of spice things up and if they don't make things harder they don't give you gold bonuses that's essentially it oh yeah 727 damage needless to say that is a lot more than i usually get all right let me time this olay yeah okay and lady autumn is dead so much for lady adam adios muchachos kombucha cheers um we're going with the barbarian there's this dope attack in the air and then also this just does fatty damage like i said all around barbarian is the way for me but midair that attack doesn't do too much damage you have to hit a lot of successful hits which isn't always easy there we go oh okay but this guy's super annoying because they're attacks through stuff so i have to kill them before they can get their attack off i'm gonna wait for this dude easy peasy i'll pour through here oh oh wait where am i going oh jesus ah god i wasn't ready i wasn't ready oh two for the price of one though oh god and i i always end up hurting myself so much because i accidentally hit end of freaking people but i got a freaking what is this oh a scholar weapon so that's going to be a better upgrade for our damage attack damage if i'm able to craft it and uh well i'm all about that oh wait where the fudge oh so i have to make it through this maze of death it should be easy oh wow wait i did it okay maybe these spirits will be a little more helpful and a little less worry you know give me secrets i'm an estuary one of only a select few handpicked by your king our king sorry we are the best did the best and by the king's decree others stand below us yet here i sit rotting in the halls after my fellow estuaries banish me from the table me of all people from the table me from table me if i think we should kill some of the scholars then i get to spend my explaining why it's not my fault the others don't spend their full hours speaking their mind and who cares if i brought up the same bargain for the last 30 meetings i am an estuary i can bring it up as many times as i want i think they can throw me out like i am somehow their lesser well no i am not below them they are below me every day they powder away at their little civic duties like nutty little rats they read their stupid little flip flip flip books they train their weak little hyperderp soldiers and grow their ugly little eggplants i don't know what sound an eggplant makes but i am beyond those mundanities my role is too important to be handed by these duties i'm the bastion that guards the gates the last nay only required line of defense against any would-be attackers this peace places them in a dull stooper they need me one day this peaceful end and when this day comes i will show them who their superior truly is okay so i guess i'm just hearing the backstory about the boss because that's who i fight that little portrait you see when i read he's like this little hunched over dude who is uh somehow just cracked and somehow this dude doesn't take flame damage uh it doesn't seem very fair oh i've never been able to one-shot those but i guess that attack damage buff coming in clutch that's why you get the upgrades oh my god i've never been able to one-shot them either oh this is an exciting development hold on wait for them to fire yeah yeah yeah okay and this guy watch this whoop whoop whoop can't touch me yeah this reminds me of shovel knight it's all mechanic and it's a whole lot of fun if i do say so myself it was implemented rather well now forward oh god okay wait fudge how do i do this i got dropped below but with these platforms these wooden ones if you jump they disappear for a while so they thought i was gonna die nay it was them who were born to die ow you did not get that attack off my anus oh this is easy clip through the wall come on charge at me spear maiden or whatever the fudge you call it is a spearmint well would you look at that i do know my stuff got the aoe though on our attack that's why i'm saying dude i'm just a migo face kind of guy so barbarian just makes the most sense oh what's going on here i don't know but we got a teleporter and we got free gold i kind of wish you know like first time you used to teleport or something it would heal you or there was like a room that would heal you because just like never happens easy all right we need a nice clean run oh and this was the other room that allowed me to get the uh the heirloom that allows me to talk to that whisper thing which turns out isn't very helpful but it's got to come in clutch somehow because otherwise i wouldn't have to go to so much trouble to get it you know at least i can't imagine oh whoa look at that mcrib this dude's throwing two out and he jumps i've never found that guy well screw you mcrib we're actually doing pretty well this run i still have armor uh we've got a decent amount of gold i mean all around feeling pretty good about this well maybe i should stop feeling so good about this one because wouldn't you know it my friends this is the boss i don't know how he does it but i keep losing lamech's trail there's no other choice if we want to leave this island we'll have to enter his throne room the doors are sealed shut with magic only his royal rit tanui can open them but i have seen how they do it there are two amps beside the door both lamps must be quickly the strike of foot to open the doors fire goes that password really quick okay i think that's supposed to be like hey this is how you open the door i figured that out myself because i'm a genius okay i'm not gonna go into the throne room yet because i actually have a lot of health left and when you go in you get defeat all enemies wait what how if i was a young boy my father took me into the city yeah i don't think there's oh wait a second just use my fire breath oh my god magnus magnesis ruined magnus uh increases radio of coins flying towards you okay i guess that's nice seems a little frivolous oh and then this is a easy little chest room which oh my god which had a whole bunch of gold okay okay girl i almost had 1100 i think that oh now i moved on to the next area which i should point out uh is not ready so it's an early access because if i come over here jump over here there is a little book talking about the devs um oh my god what the fudge was that and why uh that's not ready yet so that'll be ready in uh future updates which is fine though because god knows it's gonna take me a fortnight to uh oh i got some sick gold to beat this stupid boss but i mean what am i saying we're gonna beat him right now we're gonna beat him in this video yeah you guys all thought i sucked and i did too but today that changes okay let's see oh there is quite a bit left that we have not explored whoops okay whatever i'll try and explore everything then yeah i i don't really have a choice we'll have to take deb what the fudge is this thing living axe what is this wait what the fudge i've never had to fight this dude what the oh jesus back up oh i'm stuck in the corner okay it's like watching the little dvd the old dvd thing fly around in the corner you know what i'm talking about i don't know we killed him though that was new that's exciting and now i need to tp back uh wait there's a tp literally right above me what there we go i don't it wouldn't directionally i don't know you just had to toggle through them all right we're back though and yeah this is actually easily my best run so i can't wait to have it all ruined by the boss i don't know how that didn't just hurt me um but uh well quite frankly we take those that dude needs to calm down sir okay look at us oh what's going on here oh i don't really like it i'll tell you that much a little greedy there mr fruit let's just go through this oh what is this ambrosia take 78 damage but become godlike liquefied red orb given to those whom the estuaries wait a second wait a second reduces max health by 47 but deal 175 percent more damage than every fifth hit wait a second i'm about i think i've got a big brain moment here so i'm gonna lose health but i become godlike for a short duration i don't know how long that is but if i grab that and hop into the boss's lair i think you guys are probably starting to pick up what i'm putting down but if i can get in there and use part of that fast enough so i'm gonna explore the rest and then i'll pick that up and we're gonna go to town i mean if i can't do it with a god-like buff then i really am just a lost cause okay wait so i've already been up there fudge me okay but i guess i should go up there because this room does have i haven't gone down here oh my okay well there goes all that help huh yeah yeah yeah all right but like i said uh throne room will heal us thank god clearly wait am i there we go uh so what haven't we explored we haven't explored there there are chests down there so let's do that first we gotta make the most of this run this is officially my highest earning run too all around this is going much better than i could have hoped wait a second how am i supposed to get to all those chests over there what uh oh don't die here or take any more damage that is absolutely necessary you little penis well freaking ah okay i froze him yay because again i forget i have spells for this like exact reason you ready ah freeze fudge and i managed to just land right on one why wouldn't i okay but again we still have enough health that i'm not too where we're gonna die here so maybe i can sneak up to the uh the chest this one seems like there'd be a little whisper here i guess not no you don't let's see what's up here first we got a big boy yeah take your swing and miss a swing and a miss bob oh wait okay that doesn't lead me to wait wait how did the gold go in there that makes me think there's a hidden passage here but i've never actually in the tutorial or something i think they showed me like a hidden passage but then ever since then i've never found one so i don't know if that's one of them oh my why did that just do so much damage all right they're getting more cunning perhaps the more gold i have who is this oh fudge i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die okay okay uh we started taking a lot more damage than i thought we would so suddenly uh screw it we're going boss room oh wait no i took too much damage i can't take the item anymore i am so paper oh my god oh screw me all right hold on god that sucks huh what am i doing right now still no secret entrance as far as i can tell holy jesus fudge okay now i kind of just want to get a little dicey with it because there is a chance something can drop meat i think i literally just need to find one meat and we're good just one meat please please sir i'll take one meet i'm desperate this is the run i'm getting greedy we're getting all the possible stuff but i also fudge i want to get all the gold i want to kill everything but like i said i also want to get oh fudge me oh wait what i'd regained health somehow how would i regain i can't move here fudge i'm out of here oh and i can't go back down wait i sh just kill me now well let's hope there's meat somewhere else nope nope nope meat meat meat i'm so desperate bro come on man i've been a good boy bro uh i don't really trust falling down there let's see what's up here well treasure it's really hoping there was meat and that bro it just seems a little sus dropping down here ah i took the chance and died because of it i literally almost cleared out the entire dungeon which i've never done before i got greedy i got greedy i mean we got a lot of gold yeah but i also had a good shot the boss all right well hopefully i can get through this stupid boss at one point just for that i deserve another kombucha swig roguelike issue too early access is out now thanks for watching [Music] i
