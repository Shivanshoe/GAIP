easy excuse oh oh oh oh somebody touching my spaghetto this is cool you can't you can't keep doing that meme it's like it's it's a couple years old by now mr friend and that's when they age the best at this point like like you need to move on in internet time it's been decades yeah oh shh wait so can you ride that horse back there or no wait or no right are meant to do more than just right he's a celestial horse okay are there more sentinel beams that come into the game you know that song about sex okay uh go for it rob even though i don't know how to tell you this we already know what it is uh rob do you have anyone at home that you want to say hi to you uh i'd like to say hi to uh blue westlow uh shark um dork um all my guild over on eleanor um uh that that's all i can talk about okay oh my god wow family man wow what a family man you're in the studio audience with me well you said blind website he's right here he literally brought him yeah you're saying like hi boy he's someone asking the questions like yeah but i like i like blue's presence a lot so like it's like i've been really reimbursing like i'm reimbursed i know how you feel about being around me and it's like i don't need that like i don't need to solidify because i know we're good with blue it's like i need to like i want him around right now and i need you to stop all right you know it's like michael scott i was gonna find where i was gonna go with it eventually i kind of was just talking until you said that you didn't find it but that's okay why can't i see any oh right because blinks removes my vision oh vader why are you immune oh thanks usher no what if this was really ushered is usher from florida can someone check i don't think usher's from florida florida ushered that's how like he's the real usher that's what florida is yeah he actually well that's why his name is a player well i get like it's a playoff float rider but like all right i mean t-pain's name is t-pain but he ain't in pain well i mean after you know i mean after like 2007 he was yeah he was in pain i'm here for the t-pain like oh no like his redemption arc has been great but for about a decade there uh it was definitely intense don't you be disrespecting t payne's singing abilities mr fruit that make you sick yeah no kidding wait you're capping i'm not capping have you ever no he's not no he can actually see it yeah he's in a way what i'm saying is he just brought auto-tune into the music industry and now it's everywhere yeah well people overreacted to using auto-tune but auto-tune is also a really good artistic choice if well i tell that to every rap song i hear it's just it's bad hot take i think auto tune is fine and i never thought anything i think if auto tune is used correctly it's fine i think if you're like a singer subtle yeah who hates exactly yeah you know who didn't need uh auto-tune frank all right here we go thanks okay dad it's much more pure back in the day all right i'm purist dude i sound like frank sinatra when i sing fly me to you put me in the 40s dude i'm frank sinatra because i can sound like yeah anyone can do it like you know like yeah come on i sounded exactly like frank that's crazy resemblance it's uncanny you put me in the 40s like i'm making a million now i understand why people need auto-tune you put it you put an average white dude in the 40s with some confidence and he could be fricking not true you take that back am i wrong though a lot of them were technically italian all right oh hey some guy in my chat was like i didn't know frank sinatra's streamed on strokes yeah yeah i bet very easy and you're mine let's see that is probably one of his songs i've never cringed hard right now you just posted cringe you just posted good what okay i would say most music coming out of the 40s and 50s that just didn't have any flavor it was overrated didn't have flavor what has flavor his background what i mean background instrumentalist had marked more work than he did oh my god tell me i'm wrong why me too i thought i was getting a migraine for my jaw no it's from playing with you guys there babies are you first like your ears put a cigarette in my mouth and let's go to the ball game god what am i doing i don't know either i'm just posting cringe that's all you're doing i'm super excited oh my god it's hard to take don't mean it all the time all right you know a base take is this is actually pretty fun playing this with you guys how about that oh you know what uh i thought so and then the last 10 minutes maybe rethink that so it's only been like come on oh hey wait a lightning round i've only gotten this once before bonus bonus bonus we win the next rounds we get extra treasure we gotta capture the zone bonus bonus bonus go to

much everyone frankly oh okay okay yeah that's cap i've seen your chat there you go that is my answer to that i'll post more cringe with cringe i wanted joey is better than you and he's an actual zoomer all right this is just something joey has what's wrong with zuma put the phone down in the shower all right like don't compare me to him you're but you always listen to something in the shower too are you there yeah i listen to something but i'm not texting in this yeah but you still need stimulation lying to messages stimulation you can't just you're like you're just uh well you know what i'm listening to i'm practicing my frank chords clearly i mean how else am i going to hit a noise all those hours not put the good use well it's because mr fruit i'm going to be real with you i've done so many videos with you and like when one person's key is off it kind of throws these off and with the hell i think it's because you know what kind of tone is it that's not a bxr at all i think did i get a bxr i got a g on seven that's not a bxr that's you gotta be awake shut up i'm sorry sorry okay you got a key now we're going to go to the treasure room hold on to open the chest that gives you a 30th anniversary weapon all right hold on for these hold on you know i see why we haven't done this hold on there's a strange coin on the ground i need to grab yeah okay wait no oh my god what do we use the strange coins for well you can use those to buy either bounties from the horse or gifts but you mainly just stand for the bounties oh bxr did you get it i think it is yeah hey is that like is that like do i have chances of not getting it yeah well there's like a couple different ones you can get from this oh for real oh you get either the beam rifle the bxr or the br uh the energy sword uh is there something else oh uh grenade launcher uh pardon or dust or the wastelander shotgun look dude it's hard dude i could be it's weird man like oh go to loot cave it's just like the back of my hand i just know exactly where i'm going you know yeah rob abused that more than i did i'm not gonna lie yeah i did i showed up for like 20 minutes during that i'm like i'm bored and then i just never did it i did that for like no lie like eight hours at least a day like i would literally just sit there dude and like just like hold the left trigger and then just like push right trigger and just hope to do enough damage and then throw a grenade every once in a while is great and that was like back then dude like when purples could turn into blues and like here is a hot take from rob here is a hot dog if you'd say that that was a good system it was a good don't even i'm not saying it was a good system stop while you're running i'm saying it was kind of cool like it made like that having a purple and a legendary that much like cooler you always made it that much more rare terrible like having the zombie apocalypse before everybody because your blue turned into a blue or your purple turned into a blue and mine turned into a purple that's all right i actually do remember just get back to the loot cave what is that what what the [ __ ] is this you got an exotic oh my god that's [ __ ] up bungie that's [ __ ] up wait you got an exotic don't get frozen go get him rob go get him i still i still remember uh farming the loot cave i'm like it's not real i saw this warlock that just had like a terrible exotic it was like the the one with the wings on it okay it's a mechanic you might want to pick them up you're welcome and i was like wow this game is tight wait you pick them up yeah you're all right shake it off now throw that grenade in there rob get paid son oh you good i know i died wait hold on this isn't completely i nearly did not the only thing that sucked about the loot cave though is like sometimes when the the dudes got enraged that yeah this is here we go now now we're complete or we or was it this one i think it was this one all right boys oh here i'll show you the back i'll show you where i was i'd go like here fruit get out of the cave sorry i know they're not going to spawn that's my bad yeah what am i doing what am i doing over here like i am a child you know like do you know how to farm this game oh that i did and that's why i showed up i sat there back with rob and i'm like this is what you've been doing yeah my dude isn't this sick yeah i can't wait for these to turn into blues apparently because apparently we like that all right apparently there's a mechanic with these things you got to pick them all up what a mechanic that i told you about no way crazy i'll let you guys figure it out from here okay i'm picking these up what what does it say burned by riches yeah i'm so rich right now burdened by so many riches oh a little two birds wait i think that's not good for rahu a million more you guys think they're gonna put kate six in the destiny uh or and into fortnight with the bxr that'd be sick i'm hilarious why do i i hate this why is my grenade this it's never this ever hey you're taking all the loot man correct he's burdened by riches oh the the the crystal that's crazy oh we're charging the crystal no way really oh dude like bungie knew about the rust content too right that's what we're doing right yeah that's our callback that's that that's our easter egg to the call back that was like their way of working in the dream team into this like 30th anniversary uh yeah you got to move oh yay i'm so smart like in video games because in real life i'm definitely not you're big smart oh street no what if this was actually under the loot cave the whole time and like when the they're like hey we're purposely going to make this blue cave happen so in five years from now when we make dicey wait collect rob it was it's right we're in it we're here wake up damn this has been under destiny one this whole time this just looks like oh [ __ ] this is why you know they're actually saying luke cave and stuff wait what this is just fan service and i'm pretty i'm pretty here for i'm here for it too well i mean uh i don't i don't think any of this fits in the war i mean we literally just had a celestial horse and sir guide us through a game show so true but i'm gonna come out and start uh orange justice avengers assemble no no i'm saying like which queen acts fortnight do you think kevin was going to be in fortnite the two characters i would bring are um icora akora would be one and then probably or is overpowered in the lord dude yeah she's just like she's gotta be all and then i think you have to go oh no you have to have a cora you're wrong it's got to be core bro you gotta power your opinion that's two to one so you get the last two you gotta go with someone low-key like um that core is not low key like she's like somebody low-key like sick why because he's dead or like or my guardian you know because he's one of the characters that had i mean realistically it would probably just be like honestly they had a there's a lot to him saint 13 would actually be pretty cool cool armor set looking you know all right i think we uh i think we gotta flip one of these switches okay where are you going well i mean well we have to open that gate but how are we going to do that i know you said i switched something is telling me we played that switch ah rob oh my god okay so it's not this one okay maybe it's now you learn that one so it's not that one either oh i don't have my music on the flap oh i don't either that was fun so what are we gonna do well there's a thing back here so why don't you go get it wrong i gotta bait it oh i gotta jump over the thing i'm so smart wow how do you fit that brain inside of that that's the thing i was talking about good no way to go bro now we gotta do this all over again and that took me forever to get to that we've never been to that also war you died and i said wilhelm seven killed you the guy we hear in the thing because he set the traps that is crazy okay it switches this time try blue no it does not don't you lie to me why would i lie to you and now i'm getting spoilers now i know where to go you're spoiling it bro no i'm not now i know where to go what's wrong with you maybe don't die forehead maybe that's what you get that's what you get that's what you guys exactly talk [ __ ] get hit get hit by that guy here come that boy i got the horses in the back i got the horses horses i bet i could cheese this watch if i go from under here it's not going to close on me see check this out are you ready you're not oh my god imagine imagine using a trap that doesn't even work on me it couldn't be me uh couldn't be me all right lead the way rob all right so i saw what you did yeah there you go you jump here you fall ah jump then you do this then blue gets owned by that but i survive and then i run back easy and then we go back okay where we going we go into this door okay interesting idea try it again okay let's put our heads together what could we be doing which ones oh we go here in here guys you got to watch out for the little stompy thing okay okay rob okay okay okay oh my god he's dead that's so tragic oh they said the end of day six i was like oh my god this cage good stuff rob you found this is this the issue why some of the purple engrams turned into blues yeah they were all they took them all like no like because it was like defunct like they weren't read so much of it none of this was real so what was i doing in destiny 1. this fire team found out someone in destiny 1 found this dungeon and we did yeah these are all the people we've been stuck here so now what let's go like bungie is now just giving us a free because they're like our player base is too dumb to find it we okay not here not here what are we thinking um oh i got an idea all right do it rob i deactivate this and it puts me up here well you're not wrong got it i thought it would like put me in a secret it did put you up there you weren't incorrect how the hell am i gonna is it is it gonna just make me fall off the map if you res me from there what what do you see me i'm like off the edge right there no hearing you're fine okay so it'll come down to murder oh wait what but how do we get into this oh i see it i see it come back oh here what rob all right what do you see rob never oh my god but wait a second guys there's three i pressed it button button he pressed that button there's nothing here wait mine boom back up oh wait my door open there's a thing up here guys this is a button to murder me and what's the last one what do you got rob this one this is also a button see dude i called the devs out on their [ __ ] i knew they were like they were doing some like diversion and i was like okay they want me to do the farther away from me i'm smarter how does it go yeah all right where am i going now okay spikes mean not good all right yeah generally speaking spikes don't mean good so all right okay wait there's a button here probably bad okay step on it i would assume this opens so i'm not going to that is bait and i get invaded do it oh do something crazy oh i i found it i found a chest nobody's found this god they don't want me here speaking of they don't want me here someone said they want me tougher than i thought see and i feel like bungie is hiding something bigger here you know there's got to be something more oh where's the loot where's the loot where is it where the [ __ ] you said there was a chest here you lied it was no it's like chest full of gnaw it's just lore that's that's cap you're capping okay wait holy [ __ ] oh my god this come here all right what do we do i'm gonna say not that which one do we choose huh what do we do i guess the only one that's open that's a good idea i like my head watch okay there's thrall here hey fruit all right there's stabbies there no now no stuff i was just trying to be nice and help you but you laughed at me oh it was funny deactivate nice nice oh and let me go through this and then this one open so we go out now we're going to this one oh yeah okay going with your badge now i'm thinking with oh don't punch these [ __ ] these nuts yeah don't punch the blue ones they explode if you're into that sure that's a call back to d1 those weren't and then we'd do this one those were what i call back to d1 oh this game's so easy dude you guys are doing so good [Laughter] see idiots later what a bunch of dunces where do i get the lead whatever you're a doctor ask uh ask beer what that means he'll know you're a toss-up rav

i i i don't know how did they do this by themselves mr and you had no idea what they were doing i don't know so they couldn't do the damage required to win a fight but they could big brilliant they did this yeah oh [ __ ] oh wait there's a star over there mr fruit oh wait what am i doing wait there's a is there a star over there well that's so weird wait oh my god whoa wait what whoops [Music] oh so why don't you figure out what i just did okay the um you i'm getting there you got enough moats to bank and then once the crystal was like yo i'm satisfied um bad guys came out and when the bad
