heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us all right everybody's got these tasks everybody's got these tasks everybody's got to do these task task tasks we got price we got shark we got fallout and we got coma i'm sorry i just i like to sing it's a problem really and i i can't help it there are so many people i love their lights i love their nights they'll never see this coming this early or will they maybe they will i'm wanting somebody just come right here come here come here come on [ __ ] suck might be waiting too long here hmm fudge i think i've squandered my moment i need to wait for this to hiss then i go it's a game plan if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't watch bro i was doing the water wheel who's giggling bro i just uh i just found a body um i am in the med bay area and i'm going to going to go leave and i see shark chilling in the the little rocket area and there's the body and then all of a sudden all of a sudden the doors are closed and uh why did you not report the body if you were trapped in there with it i i i saw a body dropped and the lights turned off yeah that makes sense he was dusting on the scan dude he was standing there looking mad sucks but he was tossing he locks himself in he's like i don't i don't know what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna delay i came up with that elaborate story where the door slams in front of me where you're on the body just to say that i killed he just can't buy his story without the report he's all right get a red wish i'd gotten a kill there would have been a little bit easier but alas i did not that means that i could not fix the lights means that i cannot be the one to do that unfortunately not gonna help me bring clothes on this stuff we got fallout and somebody i'm just checking on bodies fallout knows where i am which isn't great okay watch this biggest of brayneth so all right so i did a little bit of gas that's all i need to do fudge man there ain't nowhere to go it ain't looking great for you boy i think i just kind of make a ballsy play bro shark i need you to sabotage something for me buddy shark habitat lights i can't no come back fall out so okay that was clean so far it'll be hard to pin that one on me but i'm not sure still very doable as long as no one's seen me in a while might be all right body is on camera i've seen nothing not gonna lie fruit my butt clenched because i thought you killed me when that song no i did not i honestly i thought you killed me when it pulled up i mean coma and i passed cams when the reactor was going off but i don't think either of us checked it i didn't see anybody else there was nothing in the hallway so it's just a really cold body no i i it i like to laugh and then lock someone in the room with it and then report it that's how i like to handle it but uh you know it's the road yeah that's true has bryce been spotted anywhere around there no bryce hasn't been rich bridges saw me through med bay uh i was in the little scandi room or not skinny room the decontamination room okay and then i moved down from there the only ones i haven't seen coma crafty i did see him he was uh i saw dork just a reactor como was doing o2 for the little uh canisters and then he and i went up for reactor there's a thing outside uh a task it's got a bunch of little tiny squares and i don't know how to do it you could literally jump through the maze look at me okay thank you i got you dude i know that one's the worst thank you i mean from the sound of it i think we already got shark so i think we got plenty of time definitely i think we'll probably just win on tasks i think i think this is bryce i also think it's me i've just been waiting for the opportunity to lock someone in a door with the body and then laugh and it's it's harder to do he only does it one way it's it's obviously him ah there's just not enough time i was literally i was like clicking kill i was running back to kill him now my cooldown is too long i'm in trouble i'm in trouble gooby i don't know what to do dork saw me go that way maybe i'll sit on admin do some detective work either with the tasks though i don't think there's any way way too many people in labs some people know too i probably turned the lights off a little too early honestly seeing if i can snipe somebody as they go for it did no one see them it was me well it's not crafty did you call in specimen room no we it was um outside electricity it was in the middle of the spawn okay then yeah it can't be crafty it wasn't i don't think it was dork he could have just insta killed and then reported right but we were together we're at the lights are we in the light so i don't know you were the one who called the first one in right i was with that long epic story okay and then who who's vouching for crafty right now that's fruit and i saw fruit coming in was with me in the very beginning and stuck up for me i'm down with fruit so that leaves shady or self report but dork doesn't really self report i was just doing wires all in to always to the right inside of the contaminant not contamination what is that like the showers um and i feel like i don't know i don't know fruit will vouch for me but when we were doing gasoline together we were on that same path that is and then we stuck together for a while did uh did you do both with mr fruit both gas no we didn't do both no we didn't do both but we we we deposited our gas together and filled up and then did the second gas together interesting because you started off the game doing gas yeah i got i filled up my gas tank and i never got to dump my gas out so we dumped it together and then we filled up together and i'm really bad at the game and i'm out of task listen battle wires bro i'm struggling over here wait bryce might have a point but then again bryce what do we oh brax is playing third and posture he said he did it and then maybe i mean if he was right if he was wrong about shark then or maybe we can just lose here he killed it and i reported it oh we could be doing that but i think it's shady i'm voting shady no i i skipped because we have six i think we got a shark [Music] it's not over oh no i'm going to sit on vitals let's give me a good alibi be vital victor whatever the v name would be if i sit here on vitals what i'm thinking is i get a stab somewhere hurry up tp somewhere stab then go from there i just i literally don't have time just don't have freaking time dude watch where are people i need to go fix the lights i don't know i've done lights i don't have that light i am so screwed i am sounds good all right everybody's fixing the lights oh this is not looking good there's no way it's not there's no way it's coma because the fact that he had to ask about the squares i still can't do it it's the last task left the game there is no way it's coma it's literally the last task if we if we can escort me and explain how to do this task we could win the game okay mr fruit i was trying to give you this opportunity the entire time to set up my mo and i'm really proud that you did it set up your ammo what does that even mean yeah yeah that's my mo where's the body it's right by electrical i saw the body flop over then i opened up a door and then i reported that's all i need to know it's also it's also not dork because we were hanging out the whole time well i'm out by comms there's no way and because the last time i saw it is the killer well the last time i saw all of you was near o2 and i went south and now you're saying it's electric and then you're saying it's your mo and then you're blaming me and i know it's not coma and this is mr fruit talking you sound really guilty right now dude i'm gonna go ahead and vote for you to be fair the last time i saw crafty was with fruit i i left crafty i went south last time i saw crafty was with all of you guys i just don't think it can be coma i really don't think this is dork also earlier i'm pretty sure i caught you venting when you got to the other side of a door yeah oh you were you gave us the first imposter so like he's getting a free pass for me that was the first imposter we haven't had a double kill since then though which means that fruit is the second imposter and we just won the game you messed up that's also possible coma may have just played us really hard i just [ __ ] foreheaded y'all easy i finally get lobbying the first body sharks voted off okay so like there was a time okay there was a time when me and fruit could have got a double kill but you vented away from it i'm like where did fruitco and i'm freaking out i'm like okay well i just gotta get a kill then whatever and then i got caught by bryce shark defending himself was probably the best content ever yeah he's just like um he's just like i saw that [Music] i saw that too like did you see anybody like i don't know everybody better be going up here but i'm gonna get killed in the stack nope i ain't doing it see dork rob fall out okay work rob fall out dork fall out rob wait a second gotta be dork gotta be dork he went to keys but there are no keys i'm a metagame this ah no wait a second gotta be dork gotta be dork you want the keys but there are no keys is it robin dork obviously it's rob oh my god it's going to be dork isn't it no oh [Music] not like this where is everybody where did he oh why would omp call it i thought hi i i'm gonna clear uh crap who was it who was i just with and uh who got the metabase scan uh i i saw clear crafty for this uh this kill for sure so the body's an admin [Music] okay did you see anything so i like i like how we all still while we type oh my god what the hell i told you with like three other people i don't think it was bridge at least not this skill self report i'd like to i'd like to think that phonomed just self-reported by accident oh [ __ ] it could be a i kind of hope so too i i'm uh i'm okay with that yeah i wonder how hard this game is on your phone you think it's easy it's pretty easy on the samsung note 20. we're all going to record this together i hope you're getting paid he says he wouldn't kill the canteens i wouldn't i believe him he's clean i'm voting for him just content i'm voting for him out of principle i like how sharks just told me you're familiar one out i knew it was dork dude that is so tilting on the way to report the i'm telling you it's dork i know it is i don't know if i want to divulge the fact that i knew it was him because he did keys and i know it's a common task and everybody has to have keys and you want keys and nobody else has keys that metagaming i don't know i mean it's a dead giveaway like come on i freaking god i had it i had it and rob knew it rob just saw the glint in my eye the detective fruit gland and he's like nope he's going to he's going and he's going to click the button and he's exposing my boy i can't have that so he silenced me and you know what where smart is it worked and the worst part is i'm the only one dead so i can only talk to myself so quiet in here no reverb i can fix that river [Music] i'm gonna fill the o2 canister if i need air then i'll just fill it up i need to live i need to breathe i'm so lonely and it's also torque and rob but nobody can hear me because i'm dead absolutely fantastic mr flute okay what i was gonna do a simon cow impression but that ain't it okay where was it mid bay all right wait well wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on hold on who who was in specimen with rabbi and me bryce was it's rabbi what 100 i was literally doing simon says with price that entire time so i go into specimen from medved i run into abby and bryce down there let's go out let's go i do my my my download or upload or whatever it's down there and then i go out towards like the middle of the map i don't know what it's called keep going and then bryce is dead now got him i literally where's the body dork that's rob's tell literally were you watching camzo did you like go over there to report it no i was just doing it i was in there with bryce and then i went up but i went to go fix life yeah crafty were still in what was it did anybody see rabby fixing lights no no though it was me and doritos wait did you report the body dork yes he did i went from fan cams to med bay and that's when the reactor started i'm not going to 100 says ravi but he's the last person you kind of have to vote here there's two people dead we don't gotta vote for nothing you know i don't think we were we're not odd i'm sorry you're right you're a hundred percent right rob public enemy number one but i'm still skipping because uh bridge by the way if i would have killed prices where did you see him come in from by the way the top uh from band cams all right all right like i'll i'll buy that we were touching at the [Music] yeah it was rob you know i know it's even worse within the first five seconds i knew who the imposter was i was literally running to press the button and rob killed me uh do we know who the other one is it's dork i knew dork i knew it was dork the moment we came in yeah and he um stabbed me before i could ever touch the button damn yes got killed right away i was like oh my god this is the rare case where like i they're not even gonna get a kill and i know who it is and then i died how did you figure out who it was dork did keys nobody had keys you either all have it or you don't oh that's big brain right there i was like maybe this is a little metagame but like you know better yeah at this point and so i was gonna press the button be like you can vote on it or not but i'm telling you and then i know i died oh we're playing like a chicken in med bay during the reactor i couldn't like get to the reactor i'm trying to do this yeah i saw that i was like i was like crap in my pants i was like home stop no no and then fallout came i was like oh yes that's what i'm doing crafty i'm trying this damn you play you can hide behind that reactor and what i was hoping is that the imposter would try and kill somebody well like i was i'm done with tasks okay you're looking mad [ __ ] guys i don't even see his full name it's just abby well that's like when you hide behind somebody doesn't see you and then you pop down you're like it's called the sammy well for me i didn't even see your name wrong save it it's like a little part of him outside he's up there i think i've won i think i still have a lot i've been like scared of like people it's definitely owned because he doesn't you can't kill anybody on the phone it's gotta be dude look i'm sorry you're dead but you know i'm glad i have a buddy glad you're not alone in the afterlife like dying first and then having them call a meeting and then you're just dead alone for a while you know it's it's rough oh no i know that fuel all too well [Laughter] i have done my job i appreciate that thank you um sacrifice has been noted my tasks are done we're close yeah i don't i don't anticipate that they'll be able to kill enough well here's getting it boss there's so much i know there's always somebody though that just never finishes their tasks i feel like we're always like oh we're close and then someone always just has like two and then they're like oh whoops oh rob just took the kill and this is gonna report him oh got him who who nailed it bro oh are you gonna tell us what the sunset was like too let me let me set the scene here let me see the brisket evening 11 39 p.m october 3rd i had no but for really it was rob what yeah yeah give me give me that what what what a shock i got you bro i got you trying to pull one over on me i don't think so me not old thanks i literally just did lights with you guys you literally watched and then i went down to the bottom of the floor who was with me i i i was there fixing like yeah yeah it was over there so here's me yeah oh i know who was there it was me dork robin i saw a bridge no it went down it's shark it's just i'm playing through dork's headset as well so that's confusing well me and the dork went up to the right and uh blue and green went off left and i was like i'm going to take a page of the old robbie play i didn't go and double back down and look there's a body right there on the floor right where i left you this is interesting this could be a self report and you're trying to you're trying to come back on that spawn kill and now um because i did not i saw bridge go to fan camps but i went down the hall this was between you two we have very few jobs left we can probably win on jobs but why not vote rob out now because i watched him oh you're just giving no i gave nothing away dude you did it i didn't do anything i literally went down the hallway he went to pancake are you kidding me there's six people left two and why would they ever skip there ah there's two important what my brain hurts why would you try and break the other words who is it it's dorky oh my god what um do any of you have tasks because otherwise they're going to win 20 seconds for like minutes i don't know why they're like let's just skip it's it's six people oh dork and rob haven't found anyone yet they do your tasks before the reactor yeah or yeah they're so close please there's one task crafty don't go up crafty don't do it [Laughter] okay same reactor too no [Applause] oh there it goes not like this not like oh oh we won oh my god we won it was me it was me and uh me and everybody everybody was like so so close together oh i kind of swore it was dark cause like did you kill him in med bay or did you kill him on cams um what was it who was it dork that you were on you're watching cams and he said you found nobody at mid bay me uh rob did kill me he just happened to walk into the room oh i gotta tell you all though that is the ballsiest play you're at six people you know there's two imposters even if you think you're close still skipping that's ballsy real ballsy [Music] you
