90 minutes later we finished here we are record me intro I had fun we we talked about we talked about packs for a little bit talked about a little bit about that packs Destiny's puzzle at the beginning or middle wall we talked about really interesting patreon questions that led to just a bunch of tangent yeah that's why I love my agent questions that's like my favorite part they leaders yeah bizarre roads you get to hear the extended dream team Lorne that's true and you get to hear about stuff and I really can't think about what we talk to it right then next time like yeah we did it this time but that's when people are like oh sick it's like one of the best ones cuz spoiler-free and I literally like I hear sat down hidey-ho yeah I had the room ready here we go we're going in I gotta get to the gym and now but you got to get to listening to this bowl that's a good transition [Music] Lou help me out here he makes it look so easy it's hard like this is it like we're in it by the way like this is it this is our inch righties and gentlemen welcome back to the GG overeasy podcast I gotta salvage this correct I was trying the trainer were you the only eight star rated podcast and we're back and we don't know she'd be on audio this week maybe should be well our guy at the studio is out and then listen we that was two weeks in a row of audio on time before audio listener show you hate us it's not love you we love you we also just like to do things very last minute yeah but procrastination for anyone that isn't us ie our company that doesn't really work especially when they have weekends off on what I'm doing it's like school like we're you yeah oh absolutely oh really yes habitual progression ater procrastination made me work harder though like I always like well I got a do it now like does that make you work harder it's just like try it just stressed me out well I was like I don't have any other choice to try to do it now or I don't get it done yes so then I get it done what about you blue are you procrastinator and really depends you crashed in aid on that answer Oh like it's cool I was just get over with to get over with oh really if I'm very interested in something like super like like my brain has decided yes this is what I want to do then I'll I will I'm Larry Lee's procrastinate Creston it procrastination oh god we've create the the least procrastinate ativ person whoa Wow I think I made that up I don't think that's not work I don't think that's a good word and now if I had said that the whole world would have flipped upside down and said Rob's an idiot but we'll get blue a pass there but I feel like all of us could say that like when it comes first like YouTube video could you really safe route you can procrastinate on YouTube absolutely not no no way no way with Rob he does before he goes on vacation but that's because he just has no job that's more because you should be doing that anyway yeah that's it's essentially the same as school except I didn't procrastinate there's just totally so much work to do I don't have a choice and I pull in like alright tonight is what are we been on the syllabus since day one like okay well just so you know now you've got this you've got the whole semester day before like oh wait we get to tune in tomorrow that's final I did that for my sports writing class oh that was bad there's a go and interview somebody during out this whole semester I was alone I was like I have two weeks left like I'm so screwed now that you mentioned that that was my least favorite thing about doing cuz we had the same degree yeah with the Caro State University go Rams I started journalism and technical communications and for some in Midway they changed it to journalism and media communications I don't know why or is the other way around doesn't matter I think it was James you know it from JTC to JMC yeah well so the journalism part I didn't care about that yeah but the other part was like graphic design film editing the interesting stuff mm-hmm wait oh wait they split that into the same degree yeah yeah pretty much yeah why don't ask me man school dude I guess what they charge me like a thousand dollars a day for that every day you shown the class like retweet yeah it was stupid but so we had that so that meant we had to take certain amount of journalism things like newspaper and all this kind of stuff writing some news writing and here's the thing it wasn't a hard class and I'm not bad at writing mm-hmm but when it all calls for like okay so you have this thing due in two days you need to go out interview ten people these like businesses I'm just thinking about right now gives me anxiety like I didn't want to interview it I don't want to bother anybody I didn't want to approach anybody I didn't know I just like please no I don't want to do this and I'm like I'm not gonna be doing this yeah it's not like oh you'll get more come no I don't this isn't me and so nine out of ten times I think even you did we like fake to interview just friends and like change their name my roommate for instance his name was Cory but I'd be like all right Cory I got this interview I'm not interviewing you so pretend you're this person go yeah you are and they just give me like weird answer me perfect okay nailing it done yeah your name is Bob yeah I think I did that was like Blake I was like Blake you are a mechanic what do you like about it my god yeah think about that right now move oh yeah they'd always be like go and find a student athlete to do that for they had that for like the whole semester and I like waited us no standard answer like track guy who's really cool about it well the thing is I don't think I genuinely maybe like one person throughout the whole semester but every other almost flopped and I never knew out really who's the interview that created you going well I think there's Nord towards the end I had to go like interview a teacher somewhere on campus I think okay see that's kind of that was that one wasn't as hard to because it's a teacher yeah and you like they have office hours it's easy to find them a lot of stuff in it like random people instead of like a business you guys about like why you enjoy this uh or there's one back in for cons it's like um should females walking around be able to be shirtless what are your thoughts yeah that was like when they were trying to pass that lot because they did now or whatever how you're supposed to Addison I don't I don't want to do this I get secondhand embarrassment from just watching people interview other people yeah I don't need to experience so when you see cringe happen you Chris so you have like crazy you guys gonna mean that hard no hash tag free the titty or hash tag titty nom yeah I was probably enormous I didn't really become like a meme Lord till I met you blue like you turned me into meme Lord all that like Tron guys came now I used to be a Normie like shark taught me how to twitch chat like pogchamp and all that kind of say that into the camera I used to be a me and but I learned with a better twitch TV wasn't for me every day was hard difficult I hated my life I want to see this movie then one day is this the a dream or not the ad read the yeah this is only say that I always say I had read but I mean podcast review that review why can't I think I was going to read one but I got distracted oh not by what we were talking about over 2000 ratings now thank you guys mm mm we're stuck at 5 stars on iTunes just because it won't let us go higher okay I don't I in multiple time but I'm pretty sure like eight it's because well it's because we go so far past the measurement that it doesn't show so we're at on the fruit dream-team GG easy measurement it's clear that we're the eight star podcast once again this reminds makes more sense than Fahrenheit I haven't been able to watched renoble since read before I went to pax OH but it reminds me blue have you seen it I've already watched the entire thing yeah oh yeah so like in the first episode when he's like get the counter or whatever mhm it's like three point five four and but that's as high as it goes seems like three point five four okay that's not very bad that's as high as it goes same with the podcast their counter can't keep up with our radiation or in this case our rating I hate that little one star one dude no but look we have a four star oh my that's what distracted me are you kidding I hate the one in the four if this is forever written rating cuz I'm actually super interested like what I like they have like really valid credit that they might no no I mean no valid criticism no see and then if I bother to find the fourth star and really right now you know what everyone's gonna do right at force thought it was for sex no I've started some real criticisms or something and you're like a movie critic or something I don't know you I have to ask like did you like the rise of Skywalker if you say yes and your opinion is immediately nullified then just immediately I'm gonna contact Apple can we delete this what else did I hate about that movie don't even get oh what did you find the one what I found the one star what it's literally just one star titled balance and it just says I'll just balance out the rating here don't mind me that's not balancing stan has a blog no one reads it cuz you suck wait what the balance out what the heck see this is like the this is like the people who like in like in 2016 presidential elections these are like the people that like literally who wrote in Harambee funny my friends will think of the best me more guys look I voted for Romney and there it was like blasted I like that you know like here's Malik go rob a did oh that's hilarious okay did you find that had read after finding the one star dude hot or the review none and read Rob keep saying that oh I got it read this one this is an older one but I've been scrolling but look the title of it is wound seven stars oh that's this was before we got upgraded to eight but I appreciate it that's really cool that's a bad name I was like whoa they can like do that in the title that's eleven stars or twelve actually if you animal okay nice now we're twelve stars okay this is from Kurdish dude Kurdish suit and in the high spots and I've been a big fan of fruit blue and Rob for four years now having mr. fruit video since the first polka watch these three and extended dream team are hilarious together and on their own if you haven't yet check out the podcast on YouTube the reactions in the expressions are priceless especially blues face every true very true yes I don't know how you hold that man you always are like the most perfect shave every time I see you yeah it's pretty yeah well being emotionless tends to make your hand pretty steady for getting a proper shave okay reminds me of a like Christian Bale and American Psycho I've never seen that movie really yeah that's like the one cut that's the movie like with the meme he has like the axe all right yeah it's all bloody well this guy me wait I thought you were talking okay you know what are you doing get out of here watch anime now you don't watch American Psycho by the way maybe gonna make it for one day now that's a big jump though I don't know that's a lot of freaking on what's going on over there you're saying something's in my eye but they're scratching both eyes I know well but I it's my OCD by scratches I have to feel like it otherwise it feels uneven it's not important yet the balance yeah just like that one yeah as I hear that guy no I'm not that guy that OCD messes that semester you keep it five stars and we wouldn't have all these little blurps at four and one I can't find the four but I'm gonna find am i around change it to a fight right now yeah then we'll read it can you like Rick wrote like retro actively make it a five and then it takes away the four probably not know can you please make it a five the one star guy like I don't really back in your dad way I don't like that I don't like it when you do that actually please stop keep it this way oh those long as we only have one four and one you can add those two fine it almost makes the five stars look more impressive too because it's like you know like maybe that's like 101 stars but you have like a gazillion 5 stars okay but don't make one deal wait I said yeah that's nice again we're not really yeah I'm just trying to like make it supportive in my brain we're trying to rationalize it thank you very much for that review and thank you very much to our patreon supporters oh we have our producers of course stands the stack Omega arts safe and big sexy or the stag Omega saw big sexy art stuff I appreciate I like that one more or yes sir oh my sexy that's just written it backwards all them backwards from I start first you said sexy though you just like you didn't even say it back sexy forward is sexy backwards it's one of those I don't think it's a oh that's the word we're looking yeah this got race car hey okay what's that what's that one d onehand Canaan blue that was a palindrome not like where we called palindrome but it was like two different and it was went forward the same backwards it was a d1 gun yeah that's how it was like two different words too so at first I didn't even realize what were the perks if you know the person we're all okay so like a god role you were looking for a rifle barrel no idea I mean I know there's literally the palindrome but was I don't remember that well cuz there I remember there was one I just can't really life but the description whatever it was like something about a palindrome you trigger me whatever can we I'm literally gonna look this up right now our deaf boy can we talk about the [ __ ] puzzle was solved and they gave the gun that was in the roadmap away how are you gonna start with that we have to we have to we have a very interesting how you guys I think it is a [ __ ] so classic bungee dude like you gotta be kidding me out of touch that was so dumb and like so out of the realm of possibility I didn't even think that that could have happened like that's how dumb it was and then to hear that that's what it was I was like there's what are you doing man any any other gun any other thing that's the worst possibility that it could have possibly been yours here's my view on it okay okay I was disappointed for sure and it seems like a lot of the people who did it weren't as disappointed just because they got a partake in the puzzle itself but I don't know how to feel about the reward because the biggest problem with the reward is the fact that they put it in the roadmap and they said hey this is when it's gonna happen so we're like Oh we'll get a quest then yeah and then this mysterious puzzle shows up it's like oh this must be something not on the roadmap JK literally just a gun it's a week early now that's it for this season um have fun is it good not really no it's just a it's cool though I mean it's like it's definitely unique but well and I think you don't like the big problem they did too is that then they like take away like you don't have to run through that whole mess right the reset you can just now anyone can go to st. and just pick it up if I was the dudes who made the puzzle why the [ __ ] did I do all of that and like figure out the path if the people who are going to get the gun don't follow the path that I just spent 40 [ __ ] hours or whatever it is like trying to figure out and now they can just go and like do the quest like I think that sounds like a bad precedent cuz then like these cool people who like do all these puzzles that I'm not going to the next time this is something like this happens they're not gonna like want to do it I mean they will but like yeah I think it'll be tainted in some sort of way there's other people yeah I can't do it I can't what do you think about it our resident destiny 2x were blue Iceland we know a guy I dig and that's exciting to watch and by exciting to watch it means I didn't play destiny for a week and came back and the puzzle was done yep sounds better I'm at the puzzles cool seeing everyone solved was sick haven't seen like community puzzles like everyone pitch in for it was pretty cool I was a more official way to do it like everyone go to bungee net and play like not blow the screen shot or something and plug it into the site and if yours works then it'll go on the the the official bungee map and yeah once the maps complete Wow everyone look at this map and do the puzzle and that would have been really cool I'm not not in a way better than just hand to a bunch of streamers and make it happen yeah for me the weapon definitely was not nearly as interesting as it should have been getting people were like making this kind of like lore based oh it's Hannon type reference where it's like oh wow we literally pulled the gun from the future and I say I'm six no way people are saying yes like we take it from the future instead of just no we're just way quicker than they really thought they could possible you know what that reminds me like excuses like that is when I'm in when I was in graphic design uh-huh and I'm like here's this art you counts basically well actually resembles like my emotions oh my god you just like maybe straight forward yeah like well and I went with minimalistic not because it's all I can artistically do but because simply because you know it no just to say this it's like bungees like oh yeah yeah you pulled yeah you hold it from time - yeah this is really the first time I've ever had like and puzzle this big to be rewarded by something that we already knew about yeah you could say the same for like whisper and outbreak but at least those like we didn't have in the game outbreaks like wasn't even like data mined or anything right yeah we did know this existed and with this game I mean with this puzzle was like we literally saw it in the time I think if we didn't know this gun was coming out it would have been way cooler but the fact that they spoiled it is really depressing how did you watch your own videos oh yeah maybe I was mistaken maybe they rip ssin for the go so I can tell you right now it was in the description of the gun yeah for those that don't know a palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward as it does backwards the flavor text for palindrome hand can read straw Oh coward which you guessed it reads the same forwards and backwards so it was in the flavor Texas yeah it must've actually think I could have sworn there was a gun know that oh I'm probably the name of the gun yeah I'm probably mistaken though that's probably that's think you know mm-hm maybe you saw that you're like oh my god raw coward the back so what's not to the bastion now cuz like if the bash was on the next thing is there anything after the bastion crimson days I think okay so that's not - I'm not no oh come on you love it no ho that's your guys's things dolfin dear yeh we haven't done doubles in like two years so yeah but that's exactly I haven't done doubles of him and since like Call of Duty oh well that's more recent yeah that's pretty recent also yeah yeah we I'm not guessing you've got more doubles than me in the past few years yeah so that's why you should do crimson with him nah I don't even think we've done every done crimson agent E - no that sounds awful that sounds bad I remember the first crimson days it was just the worst ever just supers I forgot what it was like warlocks frezz would like be the last alive and you couldn't kill it it was like a final boss who's the same rate boss basically what we're saying is there's nothing really left this season oh yeah the UH pretty mothers so there's there's the Imperium Foundation which is supposed to be some event I don't know what that entails so it could be like a really fun thing I doubt it that comes out on the 4th of February which is two weeks from now okay and then some sundial boss bah-wah and then crimson days and that's it so let's get it this has been a season though sounds like more Tim Tim I keep hitting the stupid from more tempting Call of Duty Battlefront and whatever anything except destiny until next season yeah I agree I'm I mean I haven't played destiny I got all since I think since the raid yeah that was probably the last time I really played destiny well that's the that's the one thing that motivate me to just grind it day one raid oh there's nothing like it it's the best but then like when we did it like after that I'm like I don't wanna play destiny for a while now like that was good I just played way more destiny like five days and I haven't passed like year yeah so I'm good I'm tapped out but it's always fun although whatever you're on your 10th em grind breath dude literally every Tuesday I'm Larry booting up D to you to play some raids ok but then every Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday you are grinding temptin ok that's fair but like I still nicely but problem with raiding blue is just like I just don't [ __ ] care I just don't care about the drops like that's fair no one really cares about the drops but it's camaraderie with the buds at this point yeah and like I love playing games with the buds dude just not destiny like I would play anything with you guys than that I mean it you guys say golf it I'm there TTT I'm there about my favorite turn-based game you should try out legends in return oh no but I haven't I have have you boo no it's dope yeah you like it there's a few problems with it currently I'll quickly go over so legends of return for those who didn't know is a card game from Riot Games the first official second video game they technically had teamfight tactics but that was arguably still a part of league of legends I would say like TF T is more so like of its own game than this it's a card like it's still using all the same properties why how is this not League I mean if this were like a side mode from that be saying like harsh tone isn't a game compared to World of Warcraft okay I mean they had to literally create an entire card game mechanics how that would all work I mean the only thing they take is like names and designs of okay I see what you're saying like just the champions Rilke in fight tactics I would think it's more like a mod I mean that's how like Auto chess came out and because I mean I would say team fight tactics is a new game but a lot of people argue that because it's still like in the league client it's still legally yeah it's still Lee wasn't but anyway new game entered open beta yesterday yeah so January 24th anyone can access it progress won't be getting wiped any more which is cool oh and it is I would say it's in between our stones approachability uh-huh and Magic the Gathering is depth okay it's like in the middle that's nice I like it and the thing they're going to with is that it's like the most fair economy wise card game mm-hmm in fact like right now there's not even a way to like buy packs or anything I was just about to ask can you buy a jet or anything like that okay so it's all supposed to be mainly driven by just in game and you can pretty much get everything you want as long as you play and then most of the revenue is driven by cosmetics you can like change what your game board looks like and it comes with like different music and effects either cards have skins no but I'm sure that's coming something okay and then you also have your I think they call it a little legend too and this but um he's like on your game board mmm Norma it's a little poor oh but like I got a TX it's like a mechanical t-rex super cute you can only interact with him so there's always a vase my money yeah exactly and so that came out I played early access a little while ago when it was a closed alpha or whatever I didn't get in and I really liked it the only problem people are having currently is it's so hard to grind multiple things right now like everyone feels like the first deck they craft has to be the perfect one because currently with the economy and stuff there's no way to build a second one yeah like once you've built one like even me like I'm pretty much out mmm okay and the first one out of what like I'm Chester crystal like they bite charge is what it was called if you on a craft but you can also get wild cards which are like if you have a common wild card in craft any common card unfortunately the first one I crafted I was like oh this looks cool it sucks hard yeah so now I'm kind of stuck it comes with some starter decks which aren't terrible but the main one I like too is expeditions which is the equivalent of like harsh stones arena mm-hmm you get two trials and whichever one has the most wins is what you get your reward based off of mm-hmm and you born went flawless first time that's what 700 huh I saw your tweet well so well the way they do it so it wasn't seven now so you have seven ones you can get and when you lose a game if you lose the next one you're at any point you was two in a row you're out so you can lose one win one lose one will lose one win one you could do that forever if you wanted to and then at the sixth game to go on to the perfect win you only have one shot that's a winner and we pulled it out nice so the reward was cool what was the reward like what do you get for that like a champion capsule and something else like pretty rare stuff now what's a champion capsule like it was that the equivalent of like champion get a legendary yes so it came with like um like a common rare epic champion wild card and champion wild cards the most expensive it's like a legendary huh and then sent like a lot of chard and all this other stuff which is Doug because champion wild cards are the hardest to come by him obviously but I've been enjoying it the the actual strategy the game I really like because you like take all these many turns and you get it react to what people are doing sometimes and there's a lot more to your turn than it seems like like do i attack immediately so they don't have anything to reply and then play stuff or do I play stuff get greedy big a build a bigger boards if they have any replies blah blah blah the whole like defense mechanism where you can choose who to bring up to defend your health how do you win so they have you each have 20 health of your Nexus mhm essentially like 20 health for your character whatever and have Falls to zero you Liz okay so it's it's essentially like hearthstone I thought like they knocked down like towers and stuff like okay no so it's just face yeah okay cool 2d face alright sweet and well that's what I'm saying it's like a hybrid of hearthstone and magic how long do each game last like I would say depending on the deck anywhere from like seven to 20 that's not bad that's like pretty normal mm-hmm and yeah I'm just all about it right now plus I'm on that grind cuz that's the current issue with the economy is it is very bare and like balanced rewarding and that like it's almost everyone's gonna just play free-to-play yeah but it's also like if I don't get these question today I'm missing out on this amount of XP it's like that grindy like you have to because they have a weekly ball so every week on Tuesdays it resets and all the XP you gain that week starts to create this weekly vault and then you can max level the weekly vault and come to stable to open and you have what have Frazee stuff right so and the main bonuses you get are from my different quests and PvP bonuses every day that decay after a couple games so just like I got it my quest reset I got it no I got it oh now there's someone I can rear old it I can that video can wait till tomorrow yeah so are you gonna make a video on it I made one a while ago uh-huh I didn't do crazy it will probably just be one either just streamed for fun or about my own yeah sure sure sure but I think you guys should at least try I'm gonna try it for sure what this a dream oh good job blue very fair welcome back ladies and gentlemen the GG over-easy podcast and quick aside from what you're talking about took a quick poop break oh no stop no no no no no that's that's all there had to go okay you nearly pulled out your phone you're like he's gonna show me okay to be fair you're the one that wanted it yeah I did not show it yeah I did I wanted to see it but like Lord I was I saw the some memes on subreddit from the Reese's video and I saw this a lot in the comments as well but it's guys like I love the video but holy crap I can I not can I not stand people calling them Reese's their recess no wait Reese's well here's a I call Reese's yeah I admit that you're right it's Reese's but I call them Reese's oh so Reese's is right because Reese's is definitely correct but yeah because it's with the apostrophe it's possessive so technically the Reese is like the Reese's yes yeah but which is very weird growing up I just always heard greases and when I look at it I just immediately think Reese's I don't know yeah I know Reese's you're right but I'm still gonna say reason yes it's like [ __ ] and give I say jiff what yeah my friendships over what see the problem is age if I see so many people say jiff no I just saw I staged if now sure as well it is still a gift no it's so unfortunately whatever creator was like yo its jiff yeah just because he made the word doesn't mean he understands how English works okay wait but then you just said to that guy that you know that's right that's why I can I know that he's right he literally made the word no but that doesn't that's not how English works though like the the reason peanut butter is jiff it's because there's a J no yeah like when you start G it'sit's hard give Dolph give good get gastric I don't know other cheap words I for some reason I went gift golf and then I thought oh my gosh Truffaut baby I don't know what do you say yeah I love some Joel's understand yogurt yogurt that was rough man I I did it though I was pretty proud of doing 30 I thought that was pretty good now I look back on those so hilarious but people are like how sick I wasn't that sick except the worst part about it which you don't get to see dude oh my god I was so sad so like they went the Shake Shack before and I was like there's like do you want like a burger and I was like yeah dude that'd be great cuz like I want substance at some point like I should eat something other than 30 Reese's so like Franz so like we do the video and data is in her mother Levi gets out and it's like we're cleaning this place or right now so he's like we're cleaning and I was like alright that's pretty accurate yeah it was like we're doing it it was like all right pulled out is like apron a feather duster all the animals came through there through the house the clean with him and he's just going through this beautiful I'm not gonna fight this so I'm like helping and stuff and everything's clean I'm like alright let me eat my Shake Shack someone like threw away like my dinner and I was like so and then like I didn't want to be like you've actually pissed but I was so mad to pretend like I didn't want to throw that whole house into a nuclear bomb like rip yo that sucks sounds like okay I wasn't like die I was like I was trying to be reasonable I was like to be fair it's probably in a plastic bag in the trash can I'm very true like if you want to if I like wanted to yeah and then Christian was I out door to ask you something then at that point I was like a knob I wasn't like Ripa's oh boy yeah I was like at that point I was just like I have a headache because I thirty reasons I hate you all go to bed yeah it's cut yeah I hate you all go to bed and then the next day I actually ended up being like a cheeseburger like eight o'clock at their work yeah and then Chris and I had the same flight we the last time I saw you is actually hilarious it was like a scene from a movie you were going into the train and it's like sardines in there man you guys are all crammed I literally like went anyway nope and I like right back here summit that's like weird I go hey look out the window and Rogers like like no VIN there Christmas just went so funny pax was tight I had a really good time PAC South is really cool it's like on the smaller side was because you have we just went this first time yes I've gone since its inception just get small every time this was no exception was the first time you went the biggest it's ever been yeah really mm-hmm no one felt the most like pax and then after that the only one that was really attempted for and that one was actually surprisingly big yeah that one was uh yeah everyone realized oh wait a minute what are we doing here and then they'll back down yeah I was like first year there was like Sony mmm-hmm really yeah Sony was there they had some things there's like a couple like Triple A developers thing and then some double-a well years this and and then the mixer had to come in that's not saying when mixers the biggest thing you got at your convention ah is that what that's that was the biggest like it was and then like there was like mixer meetups and I was just like oh [ __ ] that's me yeah and they had a sign like a looper looper lupo and Lachlan and somebody's like doing some fortnight thing mmm and I was like that has to be over like stream I was like they're not gonna buy this is gonna bother to come out here I guess I did which means X has spent too much money yeah on those I didn't get the return on that right Lupo is like half the budget yeah it was like all right yeah sure yeah absolutely yeah I will go yeah of course I mean while we just played board games yeah that was sweet captain sonar was fun frustrating but fun yeah well like I was the captain first you should explain the game god it's really hard to explain so like there's a team of four versus another team of four they all have their separate roles and you're like running a submarine so you have a cat in a first mate an engineer and a radio collar now the radio collar just listen or well the captain says where the ship is gonna go and basically determines everyone we should so that we're set up like across the desk with a divider mm-hmm so we can't see everyone else's it's a IRL battleship like yeah constantly going but like a much more yeah so the captain like chooses where to go but every time they go somewhere it like hinder something that the engineer has to cross out on their sheet so you have to like check in with your engineer where you can go and stuff but like you have to say like I'm going north so the problem was is like the radio analysis person is supposed to like listen to the other team and try and try out their course yeah I try and figure out where they could possibly be on this map but your team struck would put that a little bit clearer with me our captain I was decent I was not very better towards the end I have to like help you up again yeah and I'd be like so you know east-west and then so I wouldn't be like west like I wouldn't do that so I'd be like east or west it was so like Claire's like the captain and you just hear like coming good going east and then we're not even not even really it was just like can we go north no way can we go noise he's gracing here there was no confirmation I was a captain other data was that dad was just like what was so and we want every time to accept the one time when I was captain I think we want him on the first one yeah cuz Claire gave me bad info cuz I could have killed together the direct impact but I did it one before you guys when I could have done to the radio is the most important the radio what you learn is the most fun I've because that like we would have won that last game because every time we were ready we had torpedoes and every time radio was wrong so we just asked I would give that am I'd like board game tier list talisman being s tier and operation being F tear I'd give it like beat I was fun yeah I have a good time it's fun very hectic and you can like choose to play and turn-based or real-time and Danielle was like we get determines this has too much much we're doing real time we're just going into this and it was way but it I think was way sir yeah his hectic no one knew what's happening did you have a favorite board game you played at PAX blue yes [ __ ] in shards infinity I was at the Spurs game I think when you go oh yeah yeah well when you mention that I ordered the expansion it's coming tomorrow oh and then I have it here so we can play with okay well I think at one time so I'm pretty [ __ ] mad but I mean that's fine well the problem is we have more but well I thought so too but then we had so many other games and then when we were at PAX everybody wanted to play new stuff different stuff so just now but um oh I played settlers Kitaen that was fun that was cool isn't it Catan Kitaen Catan which I don't know contain I say entertain you uh I don't know if you were in the news but Daniel oh no I was I was this guide like walks up and dad it rolls a6 it goes like six dick six days and then this guy's like walking up he's like hey can I like put up Mike next to you guys and like I like just kind of record you guys like playing for like a little news piece and we were like oh yeah dude for sure like we walked away he walked away he's like yeah we're like Oh God we don't really know what we just signed up for it that's one like we were like hot mics are hot by the way I was like mics are hot I'm so confusing right yeah come on like live stream yeah someone had like he like put like a little microphone but like it was like Mike Wazowski and Monsters Inc you know how like when he's like standing on TV the logo like covers him and you see his arms and legs it was literally just like the back of my head like just this yellow data like they're like talking it in I you just see the back of my head and I was like really funny because a lot of people apparently message him they're like yeah we saw you on TV and then my dad of all people was like hey I think I saw your friends on TV what are you talk what are you talking about he's like yeah your friend who has like the white hair and and his white hair and the girl with the with the pink hair and I was like what are you oh my god dad would Danielle were on TV I didn't even know Rob was - he just kind of forgot that part you just forgot that no the back of Rob said he was at in the back of beautiful man back of his head should've got more screen time but that the whole bit they did though just encapsulates what I was talking about with the news radio and stuff there's so cringe oh yeah plus he like he's that guy that's way too excited and then to also doesn't know his thing so he's like playing it up as if everyone here everyone at the things like a kid yeah or something like yeah games yeah what are you like yeah I played pong when it came out all right boom know aside from that I'll have to find a link to that or that story or something I was - um yeah put it the food as always I was delicioso Rob doesn't have a proper I thought tie place we ate at where I had like the tequila are you also like for tequila B I don't hammered we literally see how it was a head but like good hammered like I was not like but I was like even to be fair to be fair though that's what most people go to meet arrows for at this point yeah to get [ __ ] hammered on Mexican drinks that was tight well I don't know if you heard him but we like sat down and was the Aereo's yes he was like you want to do tequila shot no I asked him originally okay so yeah all right we'll do like one tequila shot it was just Robin arrows and Rob's talking and stuff and they do the first shot he's like okay whatever we do I just can't have like four or whatever he's like I can't have more than three yeah I can learn three because he's like then you don't want to be around me ya know and what does he do ordered more than three like cutting it and then areas goes hey Rob look at them he goes I'm not gonna say no to Aereo's while I'm three tequila's deep already like what's a fourth one but like now I can raise it now because now I can see that I can handle a fourth one that was kind of a test well maybe though you also weren't at high altitude very true - oh very true man maybe I could add like seven oh yeah I was pretty that was healing pretty good Santa - oh my god then the uber ride oh Claire told me about that terrifying how was that terrifying I mean like he almost ran a stop sign said I killed us yeah good warts we have Rob for tequila deep man up here in the passenger side with taking one for the team dude because you know if you ride it an uber the rule is if you're in the front seat you got to have a conversation which is how it is exactly you just have to do it is if you're in the back seat you don't say anything it's not like rude and it's not like weird had I known this was gonna happen I would have taken the front seat but we were where the things they was like Eduardo and pretty I think like he talked about he was like born and raised in Mexico came to San Antonio recently in the past couple years whatever yeah really thick accent kind of broken English yeah and older on the older side marry and best he's yeah but he doesn't need a driver's license find another way to grind he literally like he like almost ran a stop signs like you're gonna die is like we're okay alright alright we start and Rob's just being ridiculous we're kind of talking too much to ourselves for the world awhile and then for some reason that border just kind of he starts talking about I think no he starts talking like he just on that we're on the freeway and it's like a fort like it's going like east or west right never eat soggy yes sir Eastern West like it's just you get one or the other and he like looks at me and he goes um he goes so do I go east or west and it's like mind you it's like 350 feet in front of me like I gotta make a choice now I was like bro like or the whole West like a West and he gay okay so like he like gets in the West and like goes and then we're like taking this long way and he's like oh you told me to go west now as I oh I bet I'm a man like that so I was like and then I was like he's like this is I kind of like your fall and I was like no it's not my like I'm not gonna put this all on me like you kind of threw me under the bus I was like I'm gonna make it 70% you 30% me or how about $64 I'll take 40 you take 60 he's like okay how do I thank you mind you rut he's not the guy doesn't actually sound like this like I can barely be very thick accent and it all starts with he goes like you can never trust these GPS things and that's who's like east or west or something like that so I said what do you mean you can't trust it so what was should have been like a seven-minute ride back to our Airbnb it was 23 minutes yeah yeah I don't even know where we were at some point I think it's so funny because I legit cuz I took Danielle and daddo to quick trip because she wanted to see if she can get like this drink especially and I even take like a wrong turn to get to this quick trip so we was like a small detour we literally take a detour go to the Kwik Trip then take the long way back home because we have to take all the back roads and like we literally get there just after you guys it was one of those moments I get out he like kissed the ground like thank God is a good trip Jim and I had a good time and then he was like talking about some restaurant and I was like yeah I got it was a restaurant oh yeah he talked about some he's like do you go there he said something he was like oh that's like there you go there sounds like it's like the last thing I want to do is make somebody feel like I don't care about what they're talking about or like make him feel weird so I'm not gonna be like what the [ __ ] did you just say like I'm gonna be like a helpful and I was like yeah I eat there like every like Tuesday man like what about you and then he's like uh yeah I get like the know you're he was like he you you go you been yeah understand your time I like yeah I get like like the enchiladas or something is in July like it's clearly not a restaurant and then he's just like oh that's great and chilly and then you start naming food yeah and I was like hey Leo those are fired and then I love Excel autos bro yeah is that sick house is bugged fire and then Rob's wondering why but he thought stop stop lights are like the size of his ball but they look like this penny know so like you know like the size of a stop light like they look small right like because they're high up dude but it's like you put a person up to a stop light it's like the size of the person like they're huge like they're like five foot we got Rob telling us to the water on the front and then the people in the back the whole ride anything I say we just could not believe and you can't tell cuz you were in the middle of it but it was bizarre I wish I had just recorded that it was yeah it was like a mix of terrified not to mention we come to a four-way stop and this guy doesn't easy Joey where is it and then oh it's the middle of it decides to skirt that go because there's another guy at the stop sign to his right that's it now it's like we're gonna die yeah and then you're like is flashing his lights like waving the guy come on what are you doing and if I'm the other guy there I'm just like going yeah it was wild I literally couldn't hold and I was like we're dying he's like no worries that we're good we're good he's that come on let him go he said come on nothing get me out of here again he's the only one I've ever given something except for five star really you didn't give him five one star Wow because he saw 19 from our podcast I have given a one star though before I have given a one star I gave it for driving and GPS he didn't follow any GPS and his driving was bad yeah uh you know what is not one star what this a dream hey how do you not see those coming by now I don't know in welcome back the GG overeasy podcast episode 24 you don't want to say 24 yeah no I think it's 23 no I think it is 23 this is a Michael Jordan game because you had a sweatshirt at last week ahead 23 on it and someone's like Rob should have worn that for 23 not 22 uh I didn't think about that man that's which by the way in soccer jersey you broke the sweater season but okay here's what I'm saying if a this will weed and a tumbleweed are the same thing a sweatshirt and a hoodie are the same thing so they classify underneath the same thing so shut up yes it is that's exactly how it works that's not that's not even comparable yes it is I love the guy that tweeted me though who tweeted us like the Google Trends and he's like you're a Google searches for Russia Russian thistle and like the day and day after podcast like just add massive spike that's probably what the fudge is they on about right now Russian thistles should have never been a thing it's just it's just a tumblr would you know our patreon supporters on the phone on the phone right don't you have that list hello our first caller all that be sick if we at college that beam on cast though it is little monkeys well it might be a little bit better since we're not live dangerous game we play through but like when there's like live streamers to and like those I'm like that's monk could W you're getting this like AB you're asking for traveling like Russian roulette right now and I am finding these names you'll never believe you will I haven't looked at the question since like posting on the patron I swear to you I have not looked you will never believe what the first question is on here you will not believe it hey move it okay uh so we're gonna start with our questions wait let me read these real quick okay yeah thanks very much to Elaine ng Brandon Smith be nerd Sean Logan Boyd Tyrone Lewinsky Chris Jager Blake Russell Deb halogen Blanche Maria brainiest GP hash and Benjamin Thomas for your support on the podcast Thank You Sandra and then thank you bigger stage the biggest success thank you okay this question is from na Barry right yeah have you heard of the theory going around that your balls have taste buds Oh if so have you tried it or will you try it I am not kidding you that is the first question on here I didn't scroll anywhere my bet is the first one I bet usually where speed of all time supported the podcast just so she could pump it no yes we have heard it and I have had multiple requests to try it and I have turned every request down I don't want to try to feel it's just weird I don't know like the act of tea bagging into something I don't even want to try it's just likely well it's just like the the opera angle just like stretching my legs out like a crab and then like having and then like I'm what if I do taste something nose alive Sebastian or like do my balls go like do I taste it in my nuts or do I taste it in my mouth I guess you're nuts see I don't listen I don't even want to try I think it's just a bait do you think it's bait blue or do you think that's a real thing that's really easy yeah I think it's bait well everyone's faint but like you're sorry you in this goddamn Mike to hate hate relationship anyway what are we talking about ham sammich oh god what were we talking about oh wow well I just heard this so much these past like three days I just block it on my [ __ ] yeah at this point they're things like but it's like the person that started this is like a scientist and like they've been doing studies and they like showed this thing because they were studying like fertility or something and learned along the way I guess that all to have taste buds that can only taste umami or whatever and like really sweet there's sweetness oh good thing it doesn't taste [ __ ] salty [ __ ] because then it would be awful to have balls well that's what I'm saying like my balls about taste buds they would have tasted some by now I mean in the past 25 years there's gotta be something that we need to say that's touch those things yeah something but now I'm not doing it I've heard of it yes I've heard of it by not even going to try to participate blue do it and let us know yeah you have to be though you will take one for the team right you do it no but have you heard that that's easiest bait I've ever heard so he's actually bah humbug that's kony2012 levels of Bane that's big bait I remember watching that - first time I almost thought about donating I did I bought like the sticker I was like I'm gonna sticker this on the stop sign doing my part you're so hard but yeah doing my part incredible yeah no it didn't last very long but I was like wow yeah Tony but yes his giant thing taken over ticked on I here's a question from Griffin I think we might have answers but I don't know if we've done it on this episode because we've done like how we met but I don't think we've done how the extended dream team members have all met each other oh that's the extended war yes I see you the extended universe actually makes tell so it's not Canon or is it Canon it depends okay it depends some people think you use Canon okay but usually not always canonical canonical I forget oh well um I don't think I brought anybody to the group I think it was more so YouTube that brought everybody uh more so blue yes well let's see okay so I meant blue yeah I'd already known you mm-hmm we all met and then who was it was cause of pokey watch it must have been shark shark or shark while somewhere in the discord we were playing I've I think my AB may have came forth or something oh I think it was shark for I think shark was first because I remember we needed something we needed like a fourth and I was like oh shark is on sharks hilarious let's get it he's a funny dude and then AB was probably at was probably next because I mean AB I just knew had and he was always chill dude the only one that is hilarious than a bellarius too so all right let's bring Abbott the only one I could can confirm his lore is that at least for me the first time I met blessed is we did TTT with him and his mic was trash I was like all I remember is fruit wasn't sure what to call weather called Blasius or blushes oh yeah I never know well because he wanted out he wants bless yes yes but I believe the way it's spelt is it would be pronounced blushes mm-hmm that's why I wasn't sure yeah I don't know where you had met blessed cuz well I want to say I want to say dort like honestly shark work very well how he came in really he yeah it was a pokey watch video and I remember we really needed I mean we wait we hadn't played with him before poke watch I feel like we would have I think oh no it might have been like maybe custom it was either it was one of two actually I have older Pokemon right they light noise did my daily poker watch videos or those kind of videos that feel like we did those yesterday but they're like four years old 2017 guys those videos dorks ed so little in those videos but people like little he said people were like who is dork I love dork yeah videos see we we talked to dork before that though like I don't remember the first time I'd like met or talked to door now or or shark I just can all have yeah it was kind of just like we were all worship that are your first encounters them were in videos like really like real like actual like first like hey like hey let's have a conversation type thing I don't think you really I mean I guess I'd they just it's just a blurred at this point like that to end because they all just came from blue uh-huh at first it was like I was his blues friend mhm and then okay yeah and then these are my friends now and the dado dado I met dado at like the first III that we went to uh I met doesn't know just from titi I mean well I mean I guess the reason I just knew that oh yeah was cuz all the Bungie visits yeah and the conventions we just get to know each other and see each other [Music] like I remember the first time I like officially met him it was a bungee visit and we got there early and we were like going once there he said let me take you out to pizza I mean mm-hmm we get pizza but like he did as a whole like um so like tell me everything about you yeah so it was like should get to know your war yeah because I think he did that with like you and eros right for everybody that's like his that's his rubric yes I'm not in is the squad his rubric let me go make a syllabus here yeah every time I talk to people they're like oh did dad or do his thing with you and I like what thing he's like he just sits down with him he's like so tell me everything about you oh yeah and that was that the pizza was pretty bad unfortunately Oh was this like 2013 that would be my senior year in high school Oh freshman year of college 15 it had been 20 late 2015 because the first visit was taking king reveal stream mmm - Bungie yeah hey that was my first time wasn't my first time because I I think so cuz wait it was house of wolves what came out after house walls the outbreak Brian right Oh house wolves was taken King yeah yeah so taking must be nice because I missed house of wolves a union as much and and then I said then taken King and I think that's when I first met that oh and then just from there we just became friends bless I met at the first PlayStation experience PSX I'm in Anaheim and is it's very Singh Lee was happening because that's when they announced it yeah so that was a product 2017 something like that so maybe 2016 bro maybe like December 2016 yeah I don't know wherever that was and I'm trying to remember how I met blessed I think it was we we got in late all the destiny billiard Bungie people they flew out and then the next morning um like the DM or something was talking about hey we're gonna grab I hop real quick before we go to the convention it's like right next the hotel I'm hungry shirt let go there I want to dad was there too but then a whole bunch of other bunch of people but as well as bless and for some reason I think we like sat next to each other just started talking and he was a really cool dude just really fun to talk to and hang out with so I'm we like chilled the whole convention and talk to old bunch and that's how I met him and then I kept in touch with him after that and tonic was blues friend this friend as well so I was blue and Anna's friend for sure yeah oh and he's our he's friend too like he's like part of the he's more so I am too then like Matt well gnarly Sammy's the relatively new yeah we met because we've all he's been in videos before but this is like the most I mean obviously the more reason ones like actually bring him in that was more or less a me on the tee know he would be I was he now yeah anyone yeah that was he was kind of like when we do like custom game since we get like twisted and whiny there it like he was one of those first then we played some more he's hilarious I love seeing funny dude oh and then areas he's that I guess the OGS yeah I get he's like the first technically yeah areas there before all yeah I met him when was that high school right I think freshman year of high school we were playing cops or something and I met him through a friend like I hopped in a party of another person's friend on 360 and ariados was there and I distinctly remember this I totally forgot about this at the time I'd started my a bolt fruit channel a very first one and I forget what I'd done I made I was making some sort of videos or something but I've been talking to some dude on Steam that was like on some for him I visited and he was just like you know I know seen in it he's up my good friend of mine and you stay in Z name yeah and I was like oh my god but that's so sick and he was talking like um I think I might be able to get you like a shout out in the next respawn and I was like best dead be so sick yeah like he and I go back to like was it like high school or in a middle school like I met in middle school always kind of stuff like this is so sick yeah like oh my god I might actually like talk to me seen it or like get a shout-out can you imagine that I was like oh my god this is gonna be so amazing and talk to this guy for a couple days it was always kind of dodgy I was like yeah like have you told him anything yet and I got contacted by somebody else on the forum like yeah I don't know if you knew this but like so-and-so is um just like catfisher yeah he's like baiting yeah yeah like he's like a serial liar and like all this kind of stuff like that anything he's ever said to you is a lie and hopefully you told him I know personal stuff there's a hard break yeah but I didn't know that yet and when I hopped into this party um I was talking to my friend about it and I was like yeah I might get a shout out for my seananners there's Cassini's I love that guy like really but yeah as I have a youtube channel oh yeah me too and then we just that like eventually the mutual friend had left the party and we stayed and just talked and played and that was the start of the friendship here we are now and then eventually pack South Eris when I get a meet seananners yeah all came full circle I did and then after I met seananners I gave him an index card I think I've told the story before him I gave him an index card because I approached masters talk cuz I hey I need some advice Baba was like you know if you just check out my channel I was that guy yeah and I was like like I don't know I was like yeah yeah but I was like I don't know like I don't expect you to yeah actually read or anything like you even just giving you a Lincoln oh and you might see it that's cool with me yeah so I gave them to it but on the back of the index card it said one day we're gonna make a video with each other pulling back so Craig imagine I'm at a con and some guys like yo here and just to where you make a video one day and there's some random I'm like huh like I imagine she a nurse thought I just threw it away like that was probably the end of that but fast for like four years later you did make a video he messages me about making a video oh did you tell him like hey I know okay one of these days if you ever see him again hey man he's like you're that kid like oh my god but it's just so funny but like that actually happened because that's like that was so out of character for me to you like that's not something that group it's like I think I think like literally the next day we'd be like a polka watch and like we do our usual [ __ ] around but I mean sometimes we go a little too far i sickly remember i do something that's a little over the top and fruits like brought blue you better watch it dude if you if you don't if you were sir acting acting correct like you I know seananners now dude like you better I know people know I'm in circle I know people and then that was what I like right before he just like disappeared but hey I was in there okay if you think about it you were basically like one of the last people ever collabed with yeah I'll take it does he not release any content anymore like two years now really yeah didn't even put a farewell video either Wow you know just kind of dip the set and he's like I'm out he'd been strolling down as content for several years yeah leading up to that so but if you never say goodbye and you've never left you know exactly oh so you could always come back I'm 13 and this is deep that is actually pretty deep we're gonna record a video together okay I don't know what this means but it sounds like a good question but you guys didn't explain to me what it means this is from Derek as fellow 90s babies what do you feel like was a fever dream and turned out to be real what does that mean like well we were all born one nineties yes okay what's a fever dream like what what Chuck what you felt like was just a fever dream what does that mean I know the idea but if I I might mess it up I feel like I know what it is but I'm gonna look it up um I think that was I didn't understand the question but that means it's a good question there's all the other ones are like do you guys eat glue like do you prefer Elmer's glue or gorilla glue I looked up a fever dream and this is temperature affects the way your brain works and fevers can produce waking hallucinations vivid that's not what I was done ahh I I think what he probably means is like what do you think is real now that back then you thought would be like just so wild to even comprehend I think that's what it means to I think a literal fever dream is like when you have a fever we're like they're really [ __ ] crazy and bizarre and make no sense I I actually have one I remember when I was like 5 or 6 and I was like I was like man I love fast food I was like why can't fast food be delivered to me and I was like that is never going to happen ever I was like they can deliver pizza for whatever reason but I can't get like McDonald's or like Burger King delivered to me oh you could have been cashing out bro well I was like that is just like something that is never gonna happen ever like I'm never gonna see that in my dream because then like it takes all the franchises to agree to it and then it takes like an independent person and there's too many things that's what a five really well I just saw the franchises in the business yeah man like that was possible I just like it's never gonna be able to deliver from the stocks coming it down it's probably the Dow's on the up low but no I don't I didn't think that was gonna be a thing like the fact that I can door - food to me every day I prefer door - by the way I don't know if you ever eats our door - I have them all I do not eat there minute you don't discriminate well because they'll have different things oh really that they don't have all the same so what is an example of one that um like ubereats would have anthony's but door - will have like oh I don't like it you don't the problem with Keynes is the styrofoam box it makes everything all moist and wet hate that moist yeah it's gross you have fever dreams I guess your pokémon's stuff is kind of fever dream me versio I'm trying to think of like honestly yeah probably for me probably Pokemon is thinking back when I was a kid I didn't think I remember thinking as a kid like oh my god like this is so sick I kinda already knew as a kid like where gaming was going and I was like I mean this is obviously gonna because we were starting to get new consoles around the time uh Pokemon like gold and silver had come out mm-hmm but I mean even before then like we had like the Game Boy Advance and like we start getting like more and more stuff like the the Sony's PlayStation and then the ps2 was coming out and Pokemon games are on handheld yeah but I mean just seeing where technology was going yeah I was at an age where I like I was like technology was already like starting like really ramped up so I just remember thinking as a kid I was like oh my god I like imagine how cool Pokemon games are gonna be in the future like Pokemon go like being like the kind of ultimate one and this is at this point I had red yellow and blue because I was so addicted to Pokemon like I loved Pokemon I was like give me the plushies give me the I mean you still did [ __ ] keychains give me everything I was like I need more Pokemon life and I just remember the one punch would be amazing in the future and it was around X&Y that I really like realize like oh my god this sucks this is like literally what I wanted because X&Y was when we got the 3d models yeah and I was like oh my god I had to go out and buy a wait for this since I was a kid yeah did X&Y come out before HeartGold and SoulSilver no way aren't those 2d sprites there no there's the overworld was like a hybrid 2d 3d it was still 2d but the kind of the battles like the movement yeah but I agree with bully like early on like when I first played Pokemon Stadium I was like I wish Pokemon battles right yes that yeah yeah like this in the game and now they're even better but that's I remember it's like man imagine just putting like red and blue or whatever and like this is the battles I'd be so sick oh my god literally yeah but one same two is the superior one well yeah it's a mini games on - were deboned yes but I think my favorite dream would probably just been like I love videogames much like man one day I wish I could just like just play video games yeah that's my job very true that's a really good feel for tree and I guess I'm close enough to it at first it was like I want to be a play tester yes and psyphon you get paid to play video games that was only way you could kind of do that and then you realize what play testing is yeah oh my god play games I would never want like when you did well you know you play tested for anthem you're in the credit home you're in the credit that that's probably literally what QA testers go through in other games but they've brought concentrators like me so they can see how bad it was now like probably okay so they're like this was the day them come out last year like it was it no it came out last year yeah 100% came out last year but 2018 technically like late 2018 right cuz no they came out 2019 yes like February issue so I think they flew me out a year before that was like February 2018 mm-hmm they flew me out to Vancouver EA headquarters for I think anthem for the most part oh cool we'll just get like early look maybe get some gameplay at that point no one knew like anything about anthem at least anything and and it had been announced like four or five years at this point and one like it had been like we're working on this since e3 when they're like it might be like 1883 2015 that game was announced when they showed that cinematic yes didn't resemble anything but the funny thing to know about that stuff - it literally like at that time when they made that cinematic they have like nothing it's what are we just a cinema I they don't even have like anything working in game and Jeff even started on it yeah it's pretty much here's a cinema this was which is why you can never trust those it looks like though they do but I go there okay cool we'll do this stuff it was literally like a QA summit for like three days today I don't even think I got paid either because at first I was just like oh cool like I won never been to Canada maybe I'll have some free time go around there I knew like dad om - and a couple other people would be there so that cool hang with some buds and then I might get some exclusive gameplay and maybe it'll do well with them hmm I don't do that anymore so I show up and next day we get in early like 8 a.m. that's really early yeah and they do like a quick tour of the thing which I can't show us like anything because it's all behind closed doors and the night this is a door where the people work behind everything you want to see is and so then we go into this conference room giant conference room it looked like a lecture hall from college and you sit in seats and then they like gave us packets and they started a slideshow and then it wasn't like this is our game this is what do you think about this what if we did this we're thinking about this is this okay like literally it's like a focus group and I mean it's just what do we get a play a play session okay finally thank God they have me testing the tutorial which isn't even fleshed out it was literally blocks like no textures the only thing textured they only had the Colossus Titan working and it was janky as the Colossus Titan everything else was blocks like a great palette like yeah untextured and they're like see if this makes sense or like to like test this tutorial and then when you finished you'd have to go onto their site they had surveys like what did you think do this you know you have to fill that out right like a little essays about want Dan to be this is feedback boob all right and then played again all free by the way yeah yeah me boot boot boot boot and then kind of how long does that take that play session is how long I mean it's two tutorials and a server is like two hours it's miserable and not only that like movement wasn't even like it would really felt like I was underwater like the controls were garbage so was I using a mouse keyboard or controller you can only play controller uh and janky controls like literally they that's when I realized anthem was gonna fail like it was less than a year to the release and this is where they were and the stuff they were asking you about so this is not something you should be asking now you should have already known this like everything that should've been figured out a while ago yeah like what have you been doing since you announced that this was coming out apparently nothing and so just everything it's just a buggy mess little done nothing around we get to explore a little bit of the open world right outside of the original tower or whatever which was so boring like go ran other some things to shoot super I'm boring to shoot mm-hmm couldn't even like make out enemies there weren't any sensor so janky yeah flying was literally a nightmare I hated it like nothing was satisfying there were no hit markers there's no player like feedback the UI was garbage like what why am I here like what it would be like I'm not capturing this clearly and yeah everything was under NDA couldn't talk about it and then what happened like that was like a day and a half of therefore three days to do that uh-huh and then like third day was literally like six hours it felt like in a conference in a smaller conference room around a table with some of the devs and they're just asking questions we're giving feedback I'm literally just [ __ ] they're like kill me why am I here right now like this is so funny you know what they call it that's when they started to be a game changers oh is that what that is gonna be a game changer I'm doing this stuff for free for us yeah my god never be a game changer again no ridiculous and that's how we knew that anthem was gonna be and that's when anthem was coming out there's a reason I still have not loaded it since it the release I got a free copy I haven't played it on I knew we played a little bit we played like maybe an hour two hours probably in a 20-19 we played the beta yeah I played the beta and I was like this is this is still as bad as I thought blue you played a lot more you got to like the part that they purposely put in that game where it was like a roadblock right where it's like slowed your progress down and then you quit at that point right no I I played way more than that Oh were you I probably put like almost a hundred hours an anthem damn I know you granted it that hard 100 I'm pretty hard I got to the endgame where literally it was three strikes from destiny yes I mean to be fair they were really cool because like the bosses at the end of pretty well designed but yeah like then right around the time I quit cuz I still was kind of like fairly invested because I really liked the game like I really like the flying was so satisfying the all the abilities are really cool it wasn't until glitches start coming out where people were like eh so like there's this white assault rifle that nobody has DPS of all the guns in the game and I'm just like and you literally start with it it's like yeah again the kibosh thought was the best gun in destiny and I saw and people start looking at the formulas and figuring out and they're like yeah so like all the formulas that calculate our damage are held together by wd-40 and at this point none of our loot actually matters because like all the early game stuff is actually better than our endgame stuff that we have to grind for oh my god I'm done with this game are they still putting DLC offer anthem like the xanthor happily oh and something does it have to stop development on the game I'm they still I'm pretty sure they still have a team they're like does bug fixes and those poor people well the hang was they had this whole little like mini winter event thing that was going on but it's literally like you have this so the map is snowy but they say their retirement they're like they invested so much that it's something at least this was a headline I wrote read a while ago that like there even though like this one failed they're committed to making it like a full standing franchise and blah blah blah and we just let it die yeah you messed up Bioware tainted their reputation forever let's just move on with our lives a lot of devs last year really I mean even the year before like Bethesda Bioware what's worse Anton the fallout 76 false everything oh really I give it to anthem well I say at least like if you grind it for a weapon it wasn't like nullified by something that you get from a big like anthem was definitely like the less complete game no doubt but fall 76 was like a mix of not being complete and let me take your money while you do it yeah hi yeah it's close they both have this Hans don't really like industry-wide effect to fallout 76 easy oh yeah for sure I finally agree yeah you're right boss 76 was only 19 um but I mean what I'd forget like I don't remember with anything watch that's it - its I just forgot about it like I just yeah gone I don't
