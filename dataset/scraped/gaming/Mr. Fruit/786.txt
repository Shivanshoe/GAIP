hi ad ho foon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to Calgary modern warfare and my watch has finally ended double app and XP is coming to a close I granted as much as I could while keeping my sanity over the weekend and we successfully max leveled for assault rifles I'll take that but we are here to take the last golden marksman rifle for a spin that's right marksman rifles are done and we're concluding it with the e BR 14 now I must admit at first I wasn't a fan of this weapon honestly I kind of hated it but I have grown to love it it's my least favorite marksman rifle but that doesn't make it inherently a bad weapon it's still good we're using the forge detectors in 20 inch barrel II Corps combat holo sight FSS Raider Jassa solid stock operator for grip under barrel and is it a surprise sleight of hand now as to why this doesn't get me platinum I'll say it again Frick it's stupid did ya there to do the sniper everybody I'm just thinking we got wet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 more guns we need to max level I don't really do new year's resolutions but pretty close this year because I am determined to get this Damascus I'll say it once and I'll say it again mainly to just continue to just jam it into my head and maybe reassure myself and don't like no we're doing this I love to go here oh yeah ooh cyst give it to me it's not a kill not as exciting but it gets the job done now the thing about the EB are not nearly as much damage as the others but it will one-shot headshot although that is dependent on the range sometimes not all the times but sometimes but the fire rate is ridiculous that's it's showing point unlike the car and the carbine it can it can just shoot away why are we far Hoey see if that were the car or the carbine at that range it would have killed hey Can I grab your ammo here digs but wait like why can't I I need scavenger what the heck somebody where'd you come for that was just unfortunate timing I'm here to save the day my friend hahaha and the day has been saved now your whole entire you're welcome you owe me everything in fact you know what I shall take love surprise as payment for my duty yeah I mean I still can't get her which are ceasing to win men you know what I'm saying now I'm hoping we can see yeah see someone far after you say that that was Chester above but it didn't 1-shot good for Joe and I just think I wasn't I wasn't quite used to using the L the old gun oh you're one shot yeah pleb come on oh don't do it you're gonna regret it he regretted it oh let's see four okay well I'm out I'm out I'm just gonna let no way right here I had this really weird glitch the other day while I was grinding my assault rifles okay look I'll let someone else someone might have a rocket launcher I'm gonna let them use that for the counter UAV okay good guy mr. fruit I know I know I've got never mind my reticule freakin a denying it's it's for my friends and they're okay if no one shot it down okay no one's shooting this thing down okay I can't even oh Jesus why do we exist if only to suffer okay there we go all right see if I can't pull this off maybe not Timmy UAB and me precision strike and me personal UAV and we counter UAV man it's unfortunate well no I was gonna say it's unfortunate I'm not granting launchers anymore but make no mistake no that's that's perfect okay Jesus can we would it what is going on here spawn rise all right let me live my life please sir but please cheese what have my friends and they just been feeding these guys Wheaties like what the fudge man hey different killstreaks going I'm waiting I will save you my friend okay careful there's a guy right there huh yo and say shoot house especially running and gunning is the best for the EBR but my god it's what I do anyway gredin gun with guns you shouldn't and on places you shouldn't really that we could petition to possibly make that the motto for the channel oh there's the one tab though what is this thing what was that ah no please go do it somebody else with somebody yes fast now I normally don't do this but for the sake of this weapon we're gonna head into hardcore I know it requires the beautiful art of spamming now be careful kids don't try this at home and I'm a trained professional in a closed course but you is that Damascus yo shut up fur that is Damascus well blade super Jason I am so jealous one day I will join your ranks okay well ha Wow hmm to be frank with you I'm not sure how I didn't hit it okay I know I know those hair it's our core we're getting one shot which is totally understandable because again it's hardcore but oh there we go there's a little one tap I thought I saw somebody run past my face oh maybe not but a head shot double kill nonetheless now yes this is hardcore which means the pace of our play we must differentiate from a regular old game because our abandoned mint will not prove so useful you must take a more methodical approach which is why I normally don't play hardcore I'm stupid me run well wow I can't believe that hip fire worked yeah I just stabbed I just push I see you with your laser friend oh no that's my friend with the laser well what the fudge man you son of a-- we just missed we just missed the bus but there's a head shot we're going Silencio por love ah ah I saw him for a split second but immediately didn't take the shots as worried as my friend it was not my friend like oh my god as kiss hey I can't hit a shot for the life for me maybe I should invest more into recoil control in the cell buddy old pal you know I'm saying yeah that might prove beneficial but again I run again so I'm all about that 80s speed even though it might not always be the bestest choice it's the spacers choice I still need to finish that game oh so much fun Oh God wait friendly white phosphorus hey I might not have gotten my favorite war crime but someone else did for me thanks buddy why it's right pepper him up there everybody else bow does he see me I think he I think oh no he's dead that's here's guy sink in assay office whole week nade Wow guy that's the thing about hardcore there's almost no time to relive to react to grenades like that you just kind of take it up the bed oh did I I got sidetracked and I had tends to happen from time to time but essentially I was playing shoot house grinding out the assault rifles the other day I tried this effing last match didn't I never finished my thought god I'm so guilty of that anyway if that happens and I never finish my thought just know it's nothing personal and it didn't mean to not finish my thought it's just I'm too scatterbrained for my own good anyway it shoot house grinding assault rifles my map was Omega glitched like there wasn't a wall there a wall there wall like I could straight-up see through walls it's like I had IRL wall hacks I couldn't shoot through them still the gun [ __ ] what the let the fudge my gunship is killing me breath with that yeah if he keeps doing that in the gunship though that'd be pretty funny because at some point it like reflects damage so I'm pretty sure he would just like kill himself out of the gunship no because if you die it doesn't kick out of it a kill streak right right right well buddy if you could slow your roll here show some of us could get a little bit of the action - that'd be cool games probably almost over the enemy team is no dad demoralized oh hey they are like okay so like this container didn't have a wall here or here for me so I could see people coming through here are you just like Sara here no Boop up there in the shoot house there's no walls here at all I could what do I see people doing whatever in there was bizarre this was invisible all the all the barriers right behind the walls you normally mount or invisible and then this almost this entire building as well was invisible these walls this wall - like I was like man why can't I run because the door is here can't really blame me for something the games do it it's not my fault it's all admit there was one point I sat here and there was a flag and these people just kept coming and I could just like see him clear today and so I just popped through the wall and they just started getting so paranoid they just kept coming back jumping like wildly shooting Arguello there's only two of them that's why well GG alright but now we'll go back to regular and there's a short our core came on I was I'm pretty sure the playlist update is today so don't you dare take away shoot house if you do fair enough I will accept shipment in return those are my terms you can either take him or leave them if you take it you do that if you leave it you keep shoot house things yeah all right good job let's see here boom mount up that was a mistake my biggest problem there I don't need to mount it took too much time it's not like I need mounted kills spoilers look I've got gold so I think I'm good there oh my sweet Moses I might not be the best but my god at least I try Persia do you remember the 21st night September love was fine - mmm the cup hey best refer could you a butcher sabor SOGs I like I've got a request yeah sure sit in my way I'll be sure to butcher it in my next video look out for what that excuse me excuse me you just tried to run up and shotgun me in my vision my spawn and I said dear sir no thank you that is a well place we're not using the assault rifles has obviously netted me some pretty decent games and with that comes a law up in the OSP mm and that's fine but take note really the only the worst part about SB mmm is it just makes it harder to run and gun I don't care about the other parts of the plate but they're just smarter about people running and gunning and that's really the most disappointing part to me see he had the car we marched been rifled each other hit each shot they're in the same exact spot but he one shot me and I not him that makes sense right guys so really it's a it's a game of trying to get headshots but I aim for center mass I'm gonna be honest you know just like you should with a real gun you know police officers are taught to shoot for center mass not for throw head shots because I mean obviously you know biggest target you don't want to be aiming for head and miss yeah it's more likely fatal well I mean pretty much any head shots can be fatal but again not the point way cruise missile oh wait shoot mr. fruit if you don't mess this up we might get another favorite war crime yeah do it for the people do for the people who love war crimes like me I just know Satan is up there licking his chops like yeah that's right we got a good place waiting for you mr. fruit with you and your war cry listen man it's all fun and games it's just a joke we're all gonna die eventually see I just listened to that Ricky Gerace intro to the golden clubs that's fantastic no why'd you you're stupid okay nobody likes you friggin sneaking up on me like that and cream ruining my streak breath we were going for a war crime respect the war crime oh there's a kill so I'm saying no if I if I get into the groove a little bit we'll get there cuz that's the thing about the EBR first couple games I just never used it I was like this sack says trying to play like the car and carbine ID you realize they're not the car the carbine and so we need to play differently and then like all the other marksman rifles I've talked about once you get in the groove you're good to go but sometimes it takes a little while to warm up to it and I think we're starting to warm up to the EBI pretty nicely here yeah take that Granada you have a OD well played and you are dead you still got to point out my anus yeah I deserve to die also you want to know what's really stupid I don't want to use kill streaks because skill based matchmaking yeah I mean it's the same way you like don't want to have a good game in a sense because right well I'm just gonna get punished but if you're using kill streaks you're like well I could get you a two extra three extra kills here work up to a VTOL get a couple of their white phosphorus get some there but then all that does is artificially inflate your numbers for SP mmm you know I'm saying so it kind of like hurts in a way and that's almost why I've been using special so much well I mean on top of the fact that can i wallbang them okay well you just poked his head out anyway which made that a lot easier for me ah god this game is making want to throw on a OD so fast I'm over it naming all their exposure that's what I notice about the EBR if I missed the first shot I'm in a continuous fire state and the recoil usually takes me off target where I normally think I would be you almost have to like not just fire it as fast as you can doo doo doo doo doo doo doo this is the best spot I think honestly yeah for shoot house if you have C and B is your best bet honestly if you want to play safe you can watch a flag you can look over to the junkyard see you people on B flag coming through the middle it's one of the safest you have to watch out for this spot people showing up here and turn the corner if they know you're there for usually your biggest threat but aside from that uh-huh nobody gets awards for getting one shot on the enemy you gotta get jail also why is that guy just doing nothing about the guy fall yeah yeah well we get the hit Margaret oh Jesus ha ha ha we got him yeah sometimes you just fire away and hope that's something hits the enemy sometimes it does most times it doesn't story my life this is a story of a girl who cried a river and drown the whole world mushy look so sad and photographs my absolute lover when she uses her Christmas oil I not use my cruise missile I guess that would be a better case for why should you shoot hot darn is why I should just use like UAV or kind of UAV and stuff that way I don't get kills from it but I still get some points also thing it's kind of dumb know that your kill trees can't stack like I don't have three predator missiles on board I guess that could be a problem because you could like well I was gonna say you could store up like beetles and stuff but there's like airspace for a reason you know the way the airspace is taken yeah it might be annoying to be like predator missile inbound predator missile inbound prayer missile down but it means I went on 305 killstreaks whatever I'm only gonna get a couple kills get over it hey guys doing today I didn't ask you that was rude of me peace and my mother did her best to teach me some manners but clearly I never learned I hope you're all having a fan freakin tastic start to your new year I know I am you're all making it very special channels doing well in between the Cod god yeah and now battlefront ironically it's actually popping up and I hope the future videos do as well randomly revisit it and I'm having so much fun I wanted to grind that over the weekend like I'd mentioned in yesterday's video but the whole double 11x be a grand for Damascus can I do a good war like I said EBR is my least favorite marksman rifle it's not a bad gun and I know some people swear by it I like the famine or feast approach with like the carbine you hit your one shot you're just popping off and you just gotta aim where's this one is a little more forgiving but at the cost of that no it's just between the recoil the right of high it's just not me you know and I think we should just be able to appreciate each other's opinions and perhaps tastes you know not everybody is going to agree on their favorite clip own but can't we all agree on that head shots are nice and it would have been nice to get right there the OL one tapper risk is but yeah for some reason I just never found myself getting as much head shots as I would think if I had any other Martian rifle right there that guy died and then on top of that it kind of felt like a head shot if I'm being honest but I mean clearly it wasn't the game shed it wasn't and the game is never wrong my friends did you do oh you doing okay buddy I hear you're a little bit of a little bit fiesta hmm you okay I'm coming it is on the way aid has arrived you are welcome a blue top oh yeah hate to see it de fe80 espouse defeat my son rifles done should be plat but again stupid tire with the sniper rifles we got all the golds they were fun to use yeah PBR wasn't bad wasn't a huge fan of it the other ones I had a lot of fun though the grind to Damascus is in full effect as it has been and we continue to chug along so thank you very much for watching thank you for your support in this grind I appreciate you all sending me your energy I'll talk to you guys in the next one farewell [Music]
