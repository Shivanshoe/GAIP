heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to snakerx i don't know i guess that's what i'm calling it we did a video on it and a lot of you thankfully enjoyed it and want to see some more so i'm back here to do another video another run hopefully you guys enjoy because a lot of you were like hey let me go check out the game myself i'm interested and odds are if you were interested in buying it you probably did when you looked it up and realized it's three dollars three bucks to steal so check it out anyway let's get into it we're back and with a brand new main menu they just added this i guess so we're just gonna go into an arena run which is exactly what we did before i don't know if they've changed anything and in today's video i have no idea what i'm going to do we're just going to kind of build i'm not sure you know i'm typically like ooh let's see what happens when i get the full trait you know like six archers and well last week i did like six formers or whatever four swimmer i don't know maybe we just kind of rolled the punches because we never even got to see a tier three i don't believe and that makes me sad so we'll just um hey let's get a sage why not and well i guess i could have gotten vagrant in order to both rangers but uh whatever vagrant has like eight million traits uh shoots projectile that deals damage shoots a slow projectile that draws enemies in oh well wait a second you don't actually do damage but that's fine we're gonna go ahead and get into it oh i'm so excited this game is just so fun it's so simple yes so addicting and that's what everybody says like yo after after uh watching that video i doubt it for myself and i've now played like 20 hours you know some people have already beaten it but wait you've already beaten it that's lame well i mean obviously you just gotta beat a run but then there's like five different versions of new game plus to make it harder and harder uh your boy hasn't even cleared the first one so new game plus plus five that sounds terrifying so see it's cool that it uh you know sucks everybody up but currently all right whatever i'm running into people get this over with uh it doesn't do any damage and it won't unless we get a tier three which might be a bit uh of an ask but we can get a swordsman which will get us warrior maybe some extra defense could be good you know i'm not gonna say no to that we could get uh scout the rogue thing is pretty cool i was enjoying that but let's just get an archer screw it just buy everything i can for now and i might go greedy again and go for the merchants if i get any just trying to get that a strong economy early on not that uh it's probably that's probably ill-advised who am i kidding but look oh look at the aoe combined with the the big ol slow sock ooh give him the sock i'm sorry sorry oh all right we already have one of these ooh dual gunner gives us three rangers but it's two gold and fudge and i kinda i could get another swordsman okay i'm gonna buy you and i guess i gotta sell somebody i don't want to have to do it but i think i'm kinda nuker for sure okay currently you don't work with anyone sorry friend how do i sell that's how i sell you perfect and i'm gonna throw an arkansan because we have one extra gold and that's not going to help us get to our passive gold anyway one mistake i did realize too is when you get the runes or like special bonuses or whatever randomly oh look at the little orbs oh they shoot out oh that's fun look at that we got freaking cyclops eyeballs that shoot out on our own like little tadpoles oh my beautiful little babies anyway yeah it turns out i didn't realize top left there was an option to re-roll the runes or whatever in case you didn't like what you got yeah i didn't i didn't i didn't notice that oh yeah see this right here look boom oh fudge okay they moved it it's behind my head my giant forehead it says reroll uh so i could if i wanted to enemies take additional damage per second for three seconds when cursed i'm not sure which class curses it's nice that they added this though i can now see what my build is attack speed and damage to one mage every round for that round well when a voider dies deals its damage of time damage to all enemies for three seconds that sounds pretty cool could go void could go mage like we aren't really doing anything yet take damage per second when cursed who all curses though okay i get a free reroll here so now it costs eight gold oh lord extra aoe damage creates an area that slows enemies by fifty percent for two seconds on source for spell repeat ranger arrows have a chance to seek and pierce looks like we're going ranger then okay guess i know what i'm doing oh and the lord delivereth we're not gonna hit the income but whatever screw it yeah we'll just be super basic uh shoot rangers uh i don't know what dual build will go with rangers i guess i'll have to see what kind of blue classes we go i said i wouldn't go six range or go six of a thing but it looks like that's exactly what i might do uh classic me what can i say i'm a creature a habit it's just always so fun to go for the big wombo combos you know what i'm saying go for the tier threes it's super unlucky we never got a tier three in the last video i tell you what okay we got it uh tier two archer though that's nice uh healing effectiveness you don't even heal though oh oh that's not what you oh yeah that's your clasp heels unit for twenty percent of its max hp when it drops below 50 percent carbs a statute that periodically heals one unit for 20 max hp if in range sure all right we got a big old train and we got some healers for the time being kind of wasting gold but hey you know might as well just fit them all in there for now i'm not too worried about it this just means it'll be even easier to get through these early peasant levels please as if these could ever choke me up um i think not i think these are elementary oh nevermind elementary as i was saying yes i don't know what that big oh wait was that big i think that big aoe is if i stay in there i heal yeah i think that's the carving rune thing it's my bad uh magician we reduce enemy defense that's cool uh i don't even have a mage so no okay an elite level now we just gotta zerg them down real quick i don't know if that's actually from something aside from starcraft but if you're ever curious that's what i mean when i say zerg down uh it's a class in starcraft uh they're known they're like the swarm insect things and they're known to just be degenerates you rush people down all about you know overwhelming forces you know uh go for a tin pool if you play starcraft you know what i'm talking about i was never good at it projectiles that chain uh gain damage with each chain position seven will stay alive for 10 seconds after dying interesting ranger arrows have an additional chance to deal aoe damage oh shoot wait a second we're doubling up on the ranger stuff oh and i just realized you can actually get is this new you can get upgrades of the runes themselves wait i could i could go for the gamba and by that i mean okay get rid of the source room uh ranger warrior we gotta keep okay everyone else um what am i getting rid of i'll get rid of you all right i bought the two merchants so enemies might drop gold on death this way we'll just kind of build an economy early on i'm certainly not going to build into merchants i don't even think that's a viable in-game bill it's just a way to get a little greedy get a little bit of extra money early on and that's exactly what i intend to do ow ow if i live ah come on rangers do your thing oh jesus that spawn was unfair you're cheating trying to see the aoe damage thing with my arrows let me see what it's oh i think i see it yeah i think it kind of looks like it blows up like shrapnel could be wrong could be making things up probably let's be honest oh shoot i forgot coins i think that was the only coin oh two coins oh we're reach hold up grab this gas pedal wait no i didn't grab it i missed it i'll grab the coins you put grab i'm the worst i missed two easy coins it's embarrassing okay i have a vagrant and i have a dual gunner perfect look at that 30 gold bro telling you hitch different let's reroll let's re-roll okay i'm done fledgling deals 20 damage to some psyche and enchantry see there's so many different builds that i could go it's so fun i love it okay let's go anyway i guess i could have just invested in the level not the shop but i'm getting a little greedy maybe we can try and get a tier three of a unit while the odds of getting such low units is so high like most of the units we're finding right now are gonna be tier one and tier two and i mean that by like you know not the it's confusing when i say it you know level tier whatever in the shop they're worth one gold and two gold and we have the highest likelihood of finding those so while the getting is good you know trying but it comes at the expense of not uh economy for possibly higher gains and leveling to get stronger later game units but again i kind of just want to get a tier three we never did that i don't know how we're we're just tanking through all this oh grab the grab the freaking we got it okay it's fine we got it we nailed it look at the gold 48 already oh volcan vulcanist see that's a tier four that's pretty good but i don't have them source for a nuker yeah that's not what we're looking for let's just roll down baby boom vagrant tier two swordsman actually i could have probably just sold the swordsman right he's not doing anything for us i got a merchant i have an arch driver vagrant i have a vagrant oh tier two okay see just like that uh cost five yeah see right now very high likelihood of getting tier one and tier two we leveled some people up including the merchant gain plus one inches for every tingle up to max of plus 10 from the merchant that's pretty good see dude's popping off our economy is just booming all of a sudden it's all thanks to the merchants guild dilly dilly on behalf of the kingdom of fruit we thank you for your plentiful gold feel free to drop some more for me oh would you look at that ask and he shall receive and we're avoiding it like a mouse grab these that's two gold already add that to the bank and with the extra interest freaking killing it ah okay all right go for this gunner dude out here oh boy he just took one of us down lads are we gonna let him do that i don't know which one he took out i don't know who's in the middle of our train i always forget to like manually order them but again i don't really know how i want to yeah oh no he's charging he's a fire in his lasers okay well there goes the caboose i think that was just one of the merchants so nothing lost there yeah i'm sorry oh god they got two gunners now retreat oh we're about go go for the gunners your plebs you plebs okay i got a little dicey i'm not gonna lie to you oh what do we got here crits from rogues i have no rogues rotating around yourself to the left grants defense when enemies hit walls they explode into projectiles i could reroll here i'm going to re-roll the last unit alive is fully healed and receives a 20 bonus to all stats extra damage defense and attack speed to all allies with at least one enchanter i don't have those whenever hit walls they explode okay my stand is ballsy but you know what if it ever gets to that point we'll we'll be golden swordsman bop merchant bop cleric bop tier two let's keep it going minor sure i don't know why i'm really buying those but um you know i haven't been looking to see if i've rolled other oh see oh there we go okay hunter he's another one okay who do we want to get rid of though we're actually kind of close to tier three warrior we just need three more i know that sounds like went you know you're remotely close but it's that's not whatever um all right farewell cleric it was an honor having you fight by our side okay let's keep it going okay but here's what i need to do deals damage in an area there's extra damage per unit hit i feel like you should be at the back then shoots an error that deals damage ooh a chance to summon a pet gain interest okay merchants you can go in the front so that you guys can just run into things wow that kind of seems like the play maybe no idea but the music's getting so funky as somebody said the music really has no right to go hard this hard it's true the 100 helps the atmosphere okay what's with this kamikaze blue thing what the it's like impossible to avoid those oh and i say that i avoided them all uh no not that one might what happened oh all right go grab the coins what am i doing nothing oh my god oh my god i'm stuck in this wall oh i meant to grab the coin i meant to grab the coin i got it okay that was sloppy another coin though dilly dilly oh no we got we got a crazy one but there's more gold suck it all right we're just ramming them screw oh i thought that was the last way never mind grab the coin over here all right now this is the last okay you know if this is uh indicative of things to come we're gonna kill it let me tell you that vagrant yes miner yes bane i don't have you merchant yes wait what happens if i get your first item reroll is always free okay i'm getting there swordsman bop vagrant bop archer merchant wait one more merchant and we're actually popping off i could get this guy but i don't need four merchants that's just not gonna happen gamble well i could have just had them oh we're one away from tier three vagrant i'm not gonna roll for it not gonna completely ruined my economy but we're getting close and then once i get some tier threes then i'll just start hyper econning to get to later units and hit six rangers i guess and i'm only saying six rangers i guess because i invested in two runes to for rangers so um i kind of yeah i i put myself in this position i don't regret it but this is this is all my life now ah fine shake it out ooh gold oh piece of candy piece of candy get away from me oh another piece of candy oh every time hey stop it stop with the with the sepuku oh my god how do i miss that gold that's impressive i had to try i think all right the middle of the caboose the train why would i the middle of the caboose that doesn't make sense a little hurt here maybe getting rid of oh grab the freaking oh we got it oh there's one at the bottom um it's having some healers might be the play i don't know um archer okay dual gunner oh tier two dual gunner deals double the damage vagrant oh we're doing it we're doing it okay currently does 26 damage now does 52 damage and unlocks champion plus 10 damage and 10 attack speed per active set which is two but that's 20 damage in attack speed you know i i'm not gonna how do i still find vagrants if i have them fully unlocked yeah this unit has already reached max level okay we're just one off from merchant three off from archer two off from swordsman but once i get like these two even though these these are not critical to my build i'll probably invest into later units because we're not really close to anything else but feels pretty good to have dual uh not dual gunner vagrant pop off yeah look at this guy freaking boom he's the white one by the way if you're curious kill the elite oh right that's i should focus on that then kill him so we can get this over with yes ah kill him oh you got pooped on and a little bit of gold don't mind if i do oh this one's a banger okay will you guys quit just flinging all over the place all right arena cleared okay what do we got gold coins are attracted to the snake no rotating around yourself to the right releases projectiles or when enemies hit walls they create an area based on the knockback force an area when i'm gonna be honest all these kind of suck i'm gonna re-roll rotating gives defense enemies taking damage over time have less movement speed and all aoe attacks deal extra damage per unit hit does anyone here do aoe i don't think we have like no it's all okay you know we're gonna rotate for defense i don't know screw me let's level up and reroll ooh archer okay what else dual gunner oh hunter wait hunter's not even two yet what the i'm getting scammed out what are our odds right now really good for tier two which is good because i think you know you're tier one and you're you're tier one and you're tier one okay well whatever we'll just watch our vagrant pop off okay i don't even know what level we're on i i haven't paid attention are we kind of far i wouldn't know because we've just been killing it we're kind of raw with it brother always she feels weird saying that we're raw that's makes me uncomfortable frankly it probably makes you uncomfortable and i wouldn't blame you gold oh two coins thank you kindly okay i don't like this oh the extra defense look at us you cannot kill what you cannot penetrate that's hot raw penetrate you are right there mr fruit you want to talk about it oh it is ooh bopping off the wall with this ow you know we oh jesus okay all right fun's over holy you can't break through this yes shut up a gun i'm not moving i don't need to someone's about to die our merchant in the front is about to oh okay okay all right oh okay i did i didn't oh oh but our vagrant actually hasn't been touched what am i worried about and extra coins freaking easy man highlander extra defense to allied warriors i do have i do have those um any rangers do it for i would have to get rid of rid of our merchants and just freaking kind of killing it frankly ah okay i'm gonna get rid of you and we'll get the highlander that unlocks another bonus set whatever so the vagrant is getting 30 extra bonuses right now oh another another source we almost got a tier three swordsman pull up outlaw we could keep going for warrior but i think no oh we got the tier 3 merchant your first item reroll is always free and that's where it stops i wish you would tell me what all the rangers are i have no idea what the other two rangers are yeah but is it a big deal oh wait i can just buy these oh i thought i had to find more oh okay well that's what i'm buying next time what the fudge have i been doing oh my god we're gonna be so strong oh my god watch out i kind of feel like i should be putting the warriors in the front in the back because they have the highest defense right okay all right well speaking of increased defense screw you guys now that the defense increase buff not from the rotation but from the warrior buff only applies to warriors so not everybody gets to enjoy that but but i'm pretty sure the vagrant's warrior right so he's our strongest unit and he's getting all these bonuses what's not to like and then increase defense for my dudes this is like this is an unkillable synergy we have here and i think i said that last video how could we possibly lose oh okay well that was only our merchant though who needs them wait wait a second yeah why did what happened to our oh there's our defense i don't know why it stopped i hear a dog in this song kill it let them die oh my that's quite a few of them get away from me give it away give it away give it away now easy clap okay arena clear we're the greatest ooh oh who does 22 damage with 3.3 damage per unit hit 88 damage with 13 and the swordsman damage is doubled oh is that what just happened because that was a big increase holy okay we'll put uh swordsman up front here i guess all the warriors do like aoe damage okay increase this boom oh so it costs 15 to the next chance to dealing aoe damage oh and ranger arrows have a chance to seek and pierce bop okay so it'll cost 15 xp it looks like to get to the next here but i think it's probably gonna be worth it although it'd really be worth it if i could just find this sixth ranger but nope and i still didn't look at uh what this freaking is this aoe thing right is that the because it like doesn't hit anybody i know it does a lot of damage but it has to hit people you don't you don't really hit people you know what it'd be really cool okay that he hit aoe right there oh my god oh my god when it hits it hits okay uh what i would really like to see in the future is like a damage breakdown after every round to see what what your units are doing or how they're performing you know kind of see who's popping off for you because like i'd like to see like how many units did this kill or how many how much damage did it do this round blah blah blah blah it'll help too to let you know what what's working and what's not okay we need to oh not these boners yet just we're going right up on you screw you might boy i ain't i thought that was the last or the last of them but we're unkillable as i say that we die yo try and shoot me stupid it doesn't even matter i'll face tank it okay ranger arrows have a chance to knock back i think i know what we're doing enemies taking dot yeah 100 a third ranger a rune artifact thing i think yes let's go i'm gonna go this that's fully upgraded noise and so we got 30 chance to deal aoe damage with our rangers perfect i should really probably i didn't look at the freaking level mr fruit i still don't know what level i'm on i don't know how far because i know it goes to 25 but where am i in those 25 i don't know because i think i'm getting to the point where i should be investing in probably a better shop so i can get the other two rangers i mean so far we're managing but it can only last for so long and the problem with this vagrant is the boner doesn't know or whoever's doing the yellow aoe like what are you aiming for man oh jesus always spawning right on top of them i might as well just omega upgrade this to make this just the unkillable train oh suck oh we're all weak and we got no healing coming but i do have that last stand perk if worse comes to worse you all probably laughed didn't you but i knew i'm pepega i'll probably need it i need it i probably will you guys are doing great oh my god i'm so proud of you you're making me so proud arena clear now i'm gonna look at what level it is level 17 okay the more you know uh do we go for knockback do we freaking i feel like i just go for the shop but it's gonna cost 15 to get to the next so maybe one of that and then re-roll okay almost level three archer a barrager we did it okay but the only way to i got i gotta sell you tier three merchant it has been an honor very well ah my heart what did we activate knockback force to all allies great stuff but we're one ranger away and we got tier three archer okay so currently deals 24 damage and pierces but now deals 48 damage and the arrow ricochets off walls three times yes please i already have max archer i still have the max archer that has not changed ah i'm gonna upgrade this and then we'll finish that next time okay hey we're getting more tier three stuff and this time on non-meme units so this is fun the merchant's great and all and to be fear to be fair like tier three is nice but you know it's not it's helping us but to what degree you know oh my god and look at his ricochets bruh oh my you cannot get through me with the power of tier three's anything's possible it's got a high roll amount or force it really that's kind of what i did donkey rolled so to speak if you play any kind of auto chess hey babe that's all i know how to do donkey roll to victory baby okay okay okay oh ah ooh that was not fun ah fear not i will protect you my snake brother oh okay okay uh these ranger upgrades are coming in clutch i tell you what just wait until we get six ranger i don't even know if the bonus is gonna be that good what does it do actually 16 chance to release a barrage on attack to allied rangers whatever level that up the gambler um um really huh not even anything we use that's incredible let's throw you kind in the middle shoot uh put you like over here let's put aoe damage in the back is this the guy that can't shoot for the life of him i think it is or can't aim his aoe i think he's the one doing the yellow box buddy we gotta talk killed elite oh oh i'm gonna kill the elite don't you worry about that yeah i'm everybody might die but i'm gonna kill him get him show him no quarter or give him no quarter whatever ah fudge this is dicey oh we win okay not even not even remotely close oh my god what was i worried about there was a four times the chance of mercenaries bonus to drop okay i don't have that max cursed i don't have that attack speed to a random unit i don't have that so let's reroll projectiles that chain oh no i still don't think i have that right i'll worry i don't oh wait i do have warriors but once i get six rangers i won't oh extra projectile damage boom enough said we could upgrade that a whole bunch let's go a chance to seek and pierce uh right seems pretty good to me let me just reroll through okay got a little bit greedy level 19 oh we're getting there i i really really need to unlock ranger six maybe not though but you know knowing my luck it's really not that good and i'll get to ranger six and um actually my team will be worse off because of it that's sounds like something i would do inadvertently you know i it sounds like a good idea i just clearly have i don't know better okay i'm like bambi i'm just the last little fan my last speaking of which we got these uh this little bird family um in our backyard uh underneath our deck uh their baby birds just hatched they're terrifying to look at they're really ugly i'm gonna be honest but it's so cute like hairless little i don't even know man really is genuinely terrifying dual gunner does this level no it doesn't i got excited over nothing uh extra projectile damage that's just 15 straight cash so to speak what um next shop level is that uh-huh level 20. okay i think we died 20 or 21 didn't he and and or 22 i don't know i know we didn't make it and clearly we didn't beat it but uh hey this is the ranger build if you guys enjoy this enough and it does well enough i'd be perfectly happy in forcing builds but trying to do like uh a showcase on at least every trade or something or going for new game pluses if i can even beat it getting ahead of myself here but wouldn't that be nice i'd like to think i'm a gamer i you know this is only what my third run but you know i gotta win eventually right i'm just cracked dude like inherently i should be killing it but i think i did the right thing i that going for the tier threes i think is the play and this leveling up the rune thing has to be new right or i just completely whiffed that last time i feel like it was in this most recent update though along with uh having a main menu but who knows okay we're kind of we're kind of killing it right now this is actually like oh my god get off my johnson bruh get off my ranger johnson look at this defense defense aoe damage piercing ricocheting bop oh my okay things are looking pretty good still no archer okay uh i'm just gonna go for another 15 damage like in what world is that not good that was a greedy reroll oh or was it now i must make this difficult decision i mean i got to go for six rangers right 16 percent chance for lisa brash and what does this guy do shoots a projectile that deals 24 aoe damage sick um highlander it was fun but no we lost the warrior buff but what are you gonna do uh we'll just put you in the middle who should be in the caboose yeah i guess you're kind of useless right okay hey we did it we did it six rangers so now upgrade this i'll ha what i assume to be all the ranger items fully upgraded because i mean three ranger items i can't imagine there's more than that uh and then even this project like freaking i'm saying level 21 hard yeah we'll see about that okay i don't think they're ready i don't think they're ready they're not ready look at this and i could just level this up too increase defense for everybody oh i think i've broken it i've cheated the system i've created oh jesus ah okay don't don't maybe stay right where people spawn let's see kind of get away from these guys before they're able to roll up on me okay let's do a little bit more damage here team what was that giant orange damage oh is that the uh uh barrager or buccaneer cannon cannoneer i don't know i genuinely forget what his name is first time i've ever seen him but you know when he does shoot it it that seems pretty cool i don't think he does much damage because he's only tier one like that's the thing oh we got it but he himself is kind of a boner but granted the highlander we had wasn't doing anything it's not like we lost much value it was definitely worth getting the sixth trait for rangers because like see that was like i think that's what it means by barrage or something for rangers i could be completely wrong though oh now okay oh oh so we we're dying now okay we're playing hardball okay well just remember you wanted you asked for this ah oh not even close not even freaking close oh my good rangers rangers op all warriors rip enemies take dot damage have less defense we don't have that poison position five shoots three projectiles per second that kind of seems broken like any projectiles or the projectiles of their attack because if that's the case okay i mean i'm gonna get it and find out i guess all right let's fully upgrade this now they have a max chance to knock back um and then screw it extra defense to all units um so who would i want shooting projectiles all the time i think this guy right yeah i think well this one is a little less damage but pierces um shoots two parallel projectiles ooh see like if that's how this works let's see okay i have to because if this is how this works so then again just shooting giant aoes all the time i'm down to find out let's see it oh okay so it's just a regular projectiles okay but i'm curious what does the damage go based off of like maybe the tier they are though is how much or the projectiles will all always do the same i don't know but maybe it would be a better idea to have it a tear not a tiered um a level three whatever like our vagrant or archer or something to be shooting those extra projectiles not a clue but tier or 12 waves on level 22 [Music] uh i think this is where my first run ended so going forward this will be all uncharted territory for me you cannot appear so this ah fudge this defense oh okay good see the knockback is big we need we need them to get off us oh we're not the tankiest in fact we have no survivability we are all glass cannons one of us one of us hey everybody's a glass cannon nobody's a glass cannon right if nobody's a tank then what is a tank you know everybody's a tank fudge goddess when they spawn right where i'm trying to slither around ooh a hith if i'm a snake this is wave 11 we've almost done it bring on wave 12. huh i was kidding or was i oh easy clappers oh wait wait wait wait that's this is like wave 13 cheaters oh my god guys we might just do it we made just it's a lot of gold what are the odds of me leveling anything well i would can't spend anything here and it's level 23 so i'm kind of at the point where it doesn't matter i should just be wrong hunter ooh wait that was the first time i leveled up the hunter oh i didn't realize um okay we'll just you know i'll throw you in there see if your projectiles do more oh dual gunner a tier three duel hunt uh dual gunner would be sick what would that even do every fifth attack shoots in rapid succession for two seconds ooh barrager that's nice i'm wasting some gold okay that wasn't the smartest but only a couple more levels to go so yellow here we go ah ah fudge 14 waves okay so it's a game of attrition good just the way i like it they're spawning everywhere captain but they can't keep up i i think in the uh the ranger items we got are making the difference getting all those synergies yeah you all thought i was dumb to tunnel vision but hey sometimes tunnel vision ain't that bad sometimes it's good to tunnel you know like a horse take off those little blinders and suddenly he's like ah too much uh uh panic overload you know so for him he's like i love tunnel vision otherwise i get overwhelmed and you know what big sane my dude okay i'm a simple man ranger ranger ranger i made it out of clay ranger ranger ranger that you no you don't i mean that was weird they said they were spawning in the middle and then they didn't oh what the immediately spawned and just tried to fling itself kamikaze ooh that is quite a few of the bus but it stands no chance oh my god they haven't even like they barely touched us that's what i'm trying to say ooh my birthday 9 14 pog september 14th that's my birthday oh you guys remember chat oh thanks wait wait what what are you gonna give me this here guys give me the gift of an alive channel give me the gift of uh knowledge of the algorithm you guys could do that that would be sick that that would be the greatest gift or well for my birthday last year uh was the greatest year uh month of youtube for me ever so that was a pretty good gift that was among us so if you guys could just figure out what the next among us is for this channel that would be sick thanks guys appreciate you all by the way i look at this i'm just meandering and the blabbering because we're just pooping we haven't lost a guy let me face rangers for life bro oh my god yes the final wave means nothing in the face of my deadly snake yes yes okay wait two more levels ladies and gentlemen okay well we actually get a ton of gold so i should just be wrong oh level two bronzer okay currently wait where yeah it currently does browser three arrows dealing 13.2 26.4 yeah just doubles that makes sense one more hunter and we get a tier three canon ear uh extra one that's great wait did i just see a different there's a seventh ranger i just rerolled past him but we didn't have them oh that's interesting oh i think i just did it again what the fudge oh yeah the corrupt so there is seven interesting uh i'm getting greedy here that doesn't do anything for us that still doesn't do anything of course okay i really want to get tier 3 dual gunner that would be pretty cool i don't think we're tearing up like anything else the best we can do is probably a tier 2 canon ear uh and if i'm lucky a dual gunner that would be pretty pretty little jet net but okay we got an elite so we just gotta focus this this man down we're right here you cannot escape us where did it go i can't even see it oh my god we're melting this oh my god this poor elite he's like please mercy okay i already killed your elite guys like like chill what is hurting me right now i'm getting struck down by the by the got the thunder of uh take two by the god of thunder himself christian area slows enemies on another's um i don't have sorcerers defense to all allies whenever a warrior is hit i do have a warrior extra aoe damage we yeah we have something that we didn't why not okay here it is the final level uh i'll go ahead and just buy all the aoe damage oh one more dual gunner don't tease me like this tier two no that's come on okay i'm gonna sell a hunter and a hunter come on we were one off unlucky okay but where are my warriors every time a warrior takes damage everybody gains some defense oh no that's right oh that's yeah duh no that's him i went with the greater aoe damage okay here we go here we go kill the elite again we're pretty good at this i'm not gonna lie we're pretty good at just raw dps this little brown turd is going down oh he's all the colors what the fudge now we're just ramming him get back here you coward oh he's stuck in the corner he's like help my minions help oh did we kill him oh no here he is oh but we got him okay i think we did it we just gotta kill that oh oh oh okay kill these last few good okay oh my god i i did it you've beaten the game i made this game in three months as a dev challenge and i'm happy with how it turned out if you liked it too and want to play more games like this follow me on steam i want to release more games this year so stay tuned thanks for playing first off freaking sick game dude love it also try a harder difficulty with plus one max snake size oh oh ho ho that sense because now you can do cooler builds because like i would have been able to do for instance six ranger and still have three warrior if that were the case ooh very interesting very interesting indeed so let me know if you guys enjoy this i'm down to do new game plus one let's get it feel free to give me a build idea too or if you like want to see certain something you know be like hey do new game plus one with like that six ranger three warrior whatever i don't know if you know the game or want to see me suffer uh yeah this game's awesome three bucks i made it super fun uh so kudos to you sir with that said i want to thank you all for much for watching have yourself fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
