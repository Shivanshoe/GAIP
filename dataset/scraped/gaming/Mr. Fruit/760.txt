hi ad hosiery one my name's mr. fruit and welcome the GG overeasy podcast episode 24 in today's video we open with some somber thoughts and news about the recent passing of Kobe Bryant we move on to still not too happy stuff with the coronavirus talk about that and that was happy what that could potentially mean but then we move on to tempt him and that's kind of tied even the blue kind of random bubble a little bit all right it's tie don't listen anyone honest though I appreciate honesty I appreciate that but I don't need it kinda sounds good and then we have some patron questions Super Bowl predictions and of course the usual shenanigans hey take my money bet if you like the Niners don't with this episode hope you all enjoy let's get into it well welcome to episode 24 welcome everybody gonna start on kind of a somber note yeah as Minister most of you guys know on January 26th the world lost Kobe Bryant his daughter Gianna and seven other souls were on that plane as well or on that helicopter as well and it's just kind of like crazy to me man it was kind of like the first time in my life that like somebody like passed away who I felt was like larger than like life you know like somebody who's just like bigger than life itself like somebody who's supposed to live forever and it was just like it just stopped me dude it's kind of weird is a really weird time cuz I'm a really big basketball fan and in the videos like you're like you and your basketball references like somehow in some way I'll always allude to like Kobe Bryant in game 7 or Kobe's like six rings and people like Rob Kobe Leah's five rings and all this kind of stuff and it's just kind of crazy and uh I was a big fan of Kobe and it was just really we I'm a big Nuggets fan so like I was a fan that he was on the Lakers or anything like that like I hate the Lakers um but I always like respected Kobe for like not only like the player he was but also like the man he was and it was the first time in my life that like I cried from like a I guess a celebrity's passing or something like that like the first time something ever like hit me like that so episode 24 is for the Mamba love you Kobe it was that mom fan yeah blue I know you you were a big basketball guy your you were you're a big Spurs guy and the Spurs and the Lakers always had some battles so I mean uh-huh uh-huh that's how that's what I grew up watching yeah it was just very surreal because like I literally woke up and I go on Twitter and like you see something and you're like no that's not real but I'm like you see all like these news sources and you're like oh my god it's actually real yeah and it's just kind of weird cuz there's like people who you think are like immortal and you're like oh these people are always gonna be with us for sure I think the first celebrity deaths that like really like gots me like that was probably like David Bowie's because I thought David Bowie was gonna live I was what we were playing Minecraft Monday that night I'll never forget that either but then um but Kobe's it was like I was just another one where it's like man I thought we're always gonna have him yeah for me in a way we do always have it mm-hmm for sure as legacy will definitely live on yeah well in it and it's gone past like being bigger than just like a basketball player like he you can draw a lot of things from Kobe whether you are a sports fan or not or don't know anything about sports you can pull a lot of things from Kobe how did you figure out or hear about the news I was there was just recording videos for something and my Apple watch kept like buzzing as I went and I just kept seeing like Twitter notifications once I stopped finished the recording I checked the m's and everyone was talking about Kobe I was like what yeah I like tennis I can't be real and at that time it was like still it was only like TMZ and then the time so everyone's like well and that's when like is super complete that's when like I hate journalism and that's when there are people saying all of his daughters were on board with him mm-hmm people say I'm like Rick Fox was on there just like spilling bags yeah just throwing stuff out to kill the fire and so I waited and still brutal um the thing that hits most those it's not so much like if he had died from old age right would have been a different kind of loss yeah the factly what 41 41 man like and then go out like dad's like the seven like it's just crazy that it's just this puts everything in perspective honestly it's just like made me like text everybody I called my grandparents you know just makes you like appreciate life it makes you like appreciate like the little things because we take this life for granted I think sometimes and it takes something like that to happen to kind of ground everybody again I think it taught oh I think it gave a lot of people like a lesson which is something we need and slowed everything down for a little bit but it's just a super Senate situation and I liked Co because like I was I'm a big soccer player and everybody's like you like soccer field fairies like 18 soccers dumb but like Kobe was like the one of the only like big superstars to like embrace soccer and say soccer sick like hell yeah Kobe so I I loved Kobe and like his shoes were super dope I like went and like shot hoops the day after noon it was like crying on the court and I like to eat what am i doing but I was hitting every jumper bro step back a nice with it um I want to do that for like fruit salad or something like that get us on a basketball court or something and play a horse just watch everyone embarrass themselves myself included you're nice on the court no blue you got a nice jumper not anymore okay see it's a fair playing field then and it catched me a horse and I might get a letter onion that's about it yeah I won't even throw the ball break my arm doing that I think the hardest part for me though cuz I didn't really I don't really watch basketball it's still hard to hear someone like him passing though yeah it's just like he knew he was everything he's done for me the part that really hit home was imagining him on that helicopter and they haven't said exactly I think they said it happened pretty quickly yeah but like just imagine like you're there with your daughter mm-hmm and and it's coming and you know what is I always think about that like in like a plane crash or anything like that just like and I hate to say that's what I think like that's where my mind goes to but like I can't help them and it's just like and that's what makes me even like sadder is like I go to like to that spot and it's just super sad well I go there and then I'll think about his wife and everything yeah sisters like his parents and imagine because he was with his wife since like 17 right highschool sweethearts mm-hmm the the death that hit me the most since then would have been Steve Irwin when I was at that one hit honey really hurt that was crazy yeah I remember being like 11 or 10 or whenever that happened I was right just crying when they showed like on the animal playing it like he's like memorial service or whatever that was really sad for me Steve Irwin hit so hard too because he just felt like the best of us you know he just always seemed like a really upstanding guy happy the right thing how he kind of died too like doing something that like he loved and with an animal that he probably thought was the most beautiful thing probably no bad blood either he's probably like yeah my bad yeah and has like no ill will towards that animal I'm was like hey I was there it was just kind of doing it's natural instinct I was asking for it it sucks because we need a little bit of Steve Irwin but his kids are super awesome yeah Robert I think his name is I thought was like Benji I think it's Robert that's a great name I think it is actually it might be I don't know Robert oh and Benji came somewhere I don't know weird that I get that name it doesn't matter but um I guess like I'm trying to think like number 24 424 yeah so this video coves Kobe Game seven I'm always gonna say Kobe whenever I'm shooting now Stewart I never watched basketball and I would still do that yeah see and that's just how he trends is just transcends the sport and like everybody when they throw a grenade in a video game it's Kobe though you he'll be missed and it's just it's just a super sad situation it has involved a lot of people and it's just very sad and I called my dad because I was at the gym pulling on my phone line she liked the Kobe like the on trending it was like oh my god she co bida Kobe died is it was just like braking so like there wasn't really like any kind of news outlets or anything like that now I was getting in a pump bro Oh like nothing to stop at me I'm getting in these K calories I'm owning and I like read that the first thing I did was call my dad I called him three times doesn't answer finally answers the fourth time and he knows something's wrong goes what's wrong cuz I don't call my dad four times ever and I go kobe died he goes kobe he's at Kobe who I was like he'll be Bryant dad like and he's like oh my god no way he's anybody but Kobe he was like he's like I said Kobe who cuz he's like it can't be Kobe Bryant like no way it's just like it's just like very surreal like it's just like a crazy crazy situation and it's just very sad well there's no real way to transition from that to any other topic yeah so we'll just move on to perhaps I'm a bride response blue or like a eight star not ad read but a review podcast cuz we were like sorry not like blue can you do an ad read every time it's a review I'm you're gonna think people we really pay people to write these but we only read the good ones right blue which what good one do you have for us today or maybe it's actually a bad one but has good constructive criticism no we're not gonna go to the bad ones because every single one of the bad ones are I did it for the meme haha - sorry actually we're still five stop talk you integrate five star values from Josh what a great way to start off the week this podcast helps me get through my homework on the Sunday night after I procrastinated all weekend hearing them talk makes me very happy their rants are unmatched and they're topical areas eight stars nice okay so I would like to state something real quick these audio review these are audio reviews oh boy and we don't know if this is gonna be it should be good we we need to like we is that they're out of town it's just that there's something wrong with it now I guess when everyone it's the issue seems to be getting deeper and deeper first people like I can't play it people can't download it people said once they've already download it won't play anymore the crafts like all platforms I don't even know how any of this happens so we got to figure out what in the world is going on and nobody's like why do you tell audio listeners because right now they can't hear you but it's way lighter hear this they know that we were thinking of but it's also if an audio listeners like you know I'm gonna be a video listener but I'm gonna have the video playing in the background so it's almost like I am still an audio listener but I also listen to ads that play on the video oh yeah so maybe like it's for them who are like whom I'm an audio listener I'm gonna go to the video and see if there's any up but then they probably thought this into the first minute don't hear it and they go hey where's the audio do you guys know where the audio is hey weed it out every week - no one cares we do care we'll figure it out yeah Oh some more stuff what do you want from us we're 5 star podcast now ok we're allowed to do that ok 8 over 8 so yeah even after all this controversy hey we dictate it ok we're eight is there you think this is a democracy shout out to China showing us how to run our podcast yeah thank you speaking of China to run a virus oh the corona line buyers it Korona blows this [ __ ] when I say I like Corona lines they're yummy can't say I've ever had one don't know plain I know a corona and a lime I was thinking Bud Light Lime limes but Corona yeah dude that was so wack like in the first SRO they're like Rob would eat ringing oh there's that Oh Bud Light Lime limes and it was like [ __ ] I'm like what did they taste good they're good so I'm gonna drink it hey don't let anybody tell you what you can or can't do run but okay blue before he c-3po over here gets into the stats about Coronas and why we're gonna die we all are you afraid like are you at the point where you are scared or like on alert probably not I guess I'm not really worried I mean we have these we have these outbreaks like every single time I agree every couple years and it always ends up with nothing happening out of them like we had what [ __ ] we had SARS and then we had the bird we had h1n1 well what as far as the one that hurt man as well yeah I thought that was like bird flu well I think it's ours and that was like 2012-2013 this one's already five times worse than that it's barely started I mean I guess once right now but I mean I think I'm with you I'm I was super scared of Ebola like when the Ebola was like a thing I was that that was like it that we're over that means is that that viruses that pop up and every single time usually doesn't end that badly we figured I'm also not really that worried about coronal line virus because I already have all my own [ __ ] [ __ ] to deal with so is that like it might actually cure it do they have this taxes I don't know the only one I think I know of confirmed is Chicago I thought oh I heard there was one in like Lakewood I heard I had I have no idea it's too late for all the audio listeners when this is up I put my hands over my mouth - my mom asked if somebody was like when Rob does his actions he doesn't really think about the audio listeners right like oh I'm corpora normo so audible gasps yeah for the audio listeners when you hear this in 8 weeks when we get audio up that's what I was doing very good if you're um I will say I excite a nightmare of it the other day what I usually have nightmares you really this is shaking you I I'm not really shook that was the weird thing I had the dream I was with like my family uh-huh and I was getting so bad that we had to go somewhere else and for some reason I'm in San Antonio so we went to San Antonio and we like we like but we're like okay we gotta go like we just get a hotel but I was like wait a minute everybody Tran one's gonna go to hotel they'll probably have the virus so we got an Airbnb and then we go there and then it turned in like a weird horror film but that's not like wow like this is like you still have like an Airbnb website like hey can we like rent this out like during this time it was a nice house way I went through the whole thing on my fan I just woke up and I was weird but I do have the stats here because um I don't know who made this could be a whole bunch of walla WA hugi whatever you wanna call it okay a bunch of hoopla yeah I'm here to stoke the fire and cause mass hysteria okay so that's Terry that's what I'm here to do I don't really think it's ever gonna get guys disturbia yeah you're like me and right now when I did mistake songs dare me so looked up this because I saw this on Twitter what does that say so it's Luhan corona virus infection okay so it was predicted versus so far actual yes Robert how did this start just bats I think or some fats or something here okay here's my conspiracy okay as someone who is incredibly naive and uneducated on all of this so I just want to I want to discredit myself before you hear what I have to say and think I'm being serious or I should try that before I start saying yeah I am NOT an expert I know next to nothing and most of this is handfuls of comments I've cherry-picked from reading done I agree with that because that sounds cool yeah so this is just this is conspiracy theory time okay okay viruses don't really serve a purpose and we don't know where they come from or why they exist yes I know why they exist because it's mother nature okay a mother nature is pissed and like it's over there in China like bro there's way too many of you so boom coronavirus this is how all these viruses come from huh because the weird thing about a virus - and why these new ones can be so deadly again apparently I read this from a guy unready who said he studies this stuff which means he probably doesn't okay but I'm gonna take his word for it because that's how that works yes yeah yeah he said he said it's 19 it was true so yeah that viruses the whole thing is new viruses are so deadly because they haven't mutated yet most viruses they're not trying to kill you because that's it's against the point the whole point of the virus just to spread but if it kills it hosts fast enough it can't spread so that's the problem the corona virus right now it's new and it has a mutated well enough so it's killing hosts whereas normally a wouldn't which is why he was saying like AIDS is so bad because it is deadly but it's also delayed mm-hmm so it still takes a couple years and then kills we don't have a cure for AIDS right or do we know I'm not gonna answer that cuz I don't know I don't know you already sounds stupid enough so I'm not gonna keep okay I'm not digging my grave any deeper alright I found charts on it really is only mother's attic now you pop up with no difference wearing masks oh no um but so I think it's mother nature okay just just messing around sometimes or you know like this little crap crowd control mother nature's gonna get us all I heard it came from like livestock or something like I heard yes I'm cool from from a seafood trader thing is what I heard from whatever I heard it was in unicorn feces oh yeah and they've been using it as manure I like that one probably the I well there was one that I heard and I don't know if it's kind of credible basically there's this king and hey alright it gets to dictate whether or not you have this virus or not um King virus oh and he said you guys get Corona that's for a right not the Budweiser one nope ah that one was easier yeah this was we failed yeah we had it we had a serum ready for the Budweiser virus take your dice by the way that's why oh no I need to okay my bedroom I need to that they look nice yeah very nice so anyway back to this some guy did some prediction I don't know who he is someone just said the name and of course again like me and I go oh yeah sure I can trust this Mike Anderson mm-hmm sure so Mike Anderson predicted he has dates from January 22nd okay all the way to February 21st and he has predicted confirmed cases and confirmed deaths yeah okay then on the right we have actual results mhm and so far it only goes one two three four and five so you soon like a week okay cuz it's the what is today 30th 30th so this hasn't been updated with the 30th of it has been updated to 29 right so on the 22nd of January confirmed was 495 deaths was 10 now he then goes on day-to-day to say how many confirmed I mean s he thinks and then so on so forth as his builds exponentially exponentially exponentially and he thinks going from January 22nd where there was 495 cases 10 deaths that by the time of February 21st there will be if I'm reading this correctly 57 million death a day here and yeah no no sorry sorry 57 million cases and I come 1 million won there I can't read for like me 1 million one hundred seventy thousand one hundred forty-four deaths you're telling me a million people are gonna die in three weeks but here's the thing in the past seven days it was called a world national crisis because in the past seven days it's increased tenfold and that's the thing about a virus it's exponential because if you think about it if it goes on stopped run checked or you're not able to contain it over one thing one person spreads to one you got to two spreads for eight signe you know understand pyramid scheme yes it's a pyramid scheme that's all it is so that sounds ridiculous right yes it sounds absolutely a million people so you like that's stupid so February 23rd he said there'd be 730 confirmed there's only 654 he's off that's 15 he predicted but there's 25 actually so he lo bought there okay strange Oh No so January 24th he predicted a thousand eighty confirmed cases only 901 he predicted 22 deaths only 26 then he says it went up by one only 26 in like the odd days but January 25th about 1600 cases he predicted January 25th 1100 so he's still he's still overshooting yeah we're doing almost by half he thought 33 deaths but there was actually 41 so the deaths however a little bit higher than he thought not too much though no January 26 he predicted 2300 cases now there's 2,500 confirmed so now he's under estimating he thought there'd be 48 deaths now there's 80 it doubled in a day okay January 27th he said there'd be 3400 there was 4200 be 71 dead 106 next day January 28 50 100 cases actuality 5500 he said there'd be 105 desk 131 Oh January 29th he said there'd be 7500 there's 7900 he said to be 155 dead there's a hundred seventy dead they started out with a wall bond but now the numbers are exceeding what he has predicted prediction but this keeps up this again spooky I bet but but it's only because it's so radical right now and it's so new and I think I think it's kind of like how h1 or like the swine flu or whatever that was called and Ebola was and I think well nope nope nope never what kind of just figured hammock no we'll just hang it we'll see I'm buying MREs I'm going to bury water how you buying stuff well did I tell you about that oh my no no so I don't know if you were there you might have been away right before we recorded battlefront with ohmwrecker oh no you weren't there I mean I was there but I mean I didn't hear so he saw this whole thing and he's freaked out about it so he found this thing we can get these like frozen MREs or MREs I don't know if it stands for meal or military but it's like something ration whatever that you eat in the military that comes in like a little pouch yeah it's just something with them we found these frozen ones that stay good for like 30 years and so he bought like 20 40 pounds or something something crazy and he's getting him he's like might as well have him food for 20 to 30 years but you do that back up on some water batten down the hatches he even started looking at some some doomsday for vaults really yeah some bunkers yeah I've looked into this too have you not like seriously yeah but they were really interesting yeah that's what it would have like fallout mm-hmm so he said there's one in like North or Illinois or something where it's like 50,000 a ticket and there's still like a spot and there's still some spots open but he's like glad that wouldn't really work cuz I can't get tickets for my other family so I'm just make peace I'm gonna be but the thing he said about like that bunker was I only hadn't know is that how we got on the topics of that like one movie that I've seen that bunker it makes everyone yeah that's how we got there okay he said they only had like enough supplies for two years I'm like what I don't know what doomsday you're preparing for but odds are that's not gonna be long enough yeah so he was saying it's just like it a way to go out and your own terms and slow over nothing what if that's the case I'm just shooting the brains oh yeah like if it were to happen it's either slowly die and go crazy underground for two years and then die oh geez i right now oh dude what's in there right now but if it was like a vault or a bunker that already for like 30 years 40 50 self-sustaining forgive it chance for sure why wouldn't you but the interesting to talk about yeah interesting thing he talks about like those bunkers though is what they do they actually provide free spots though it's like doctors nurses engineers technicians is pretty cool so instead of having to even lie I'm sure something like that but that way you'll be stocked there so if things go wrong you already have X but you'd like to tell a doctor now or something like that like you pretty much so is interesting stuff and I'm thinking you save up freaked me out now save up digging under my basement one thing I will never forget as a kid do you guys remember the whole y2k thing like to like or like when I think it was what when the cloudy like it's 19 no what you might call it the clocks would change to 2000 and was and when computer would show zero zero zero zero hello and it wouldn't not so it reset everything yeah it's I mean it was that one and then 2012 was pretty I'm remind calendar pounder and like literally nobody was like do you regret do you everything that they just kind of stopped making the calendar they're like we'll never get there if we did we'll make some more like for y2k my parents like made us put a like litres of water underneath like the basement like an like a little spot they made just in case because our neighbor across the street was like filling his bathtubs with water and I said like gold was gonna be like the newest kind of thing so he sold like a bunch of his furniture and a bunch of his stuff to buy gold which in hindsight was a great stock move feel good for you but you haven't heard of it yet but Bitcoin he's knowing it's gonna be huge like feels crazy he was making the best investments but I just remember yeah y2k and then like you said 2012 I didn't but I didn't think 2012 was gonna happen at all so which one was easily the dumbest one I heard yeah I mean 2000 was dumb but I wasn't really like I didn't know I was just like a dumb yeah we're six so I didn't like what's y2k but 2012 was I easily like like why like this is what I've been freaking out over every century we always have something like this was like geez just stupid idiots this is it it's over so with that information shed I I don't think it's gonna be a big deal I watching like two months that is the guy who they're gonna ten Reese's in forty to fifty s gonna be the hard ones I don't you've known to been wrong but I hope you're not I don't think you you are expecting this to be like the Black Plague or something like that like something or like the bubonic plague or something that is gonna wipe out 33 percent of those well did you see I like China's like they they're building some hospital in like five days or something like that and that's crazy yep manpower just done unite and be surprised what it could happen so we add today how many confirmed cases are they I'm not sure all the trying like that up why do they name it corona like why that there's something to it Oh is the sheet I think to the only reason these numbers are inflated to is because we're talking about China who had is such two big billion or whatever yeah so that's the reason I think it hat if it is going to which I don't think it is it has its best chance in China because from what I understand China's not exactly been doing the greatest job of handling it so how they not but also clearly of in America where people don't want to vaccinate their kids from polio and measles so I mean like you know II think we have that much room to talk vaccinate your kids her own a virus map online dashboard shows nearly 8,000 cases worldwide 8,000 and how many in the USA like two or three are one confirmed she just keep it out of Colorado we already got three dream team ears here we got to get the rest and then Colorado's a sanctuary everybody will be fine and safe here the content will live on corona or no Corona first person to person transmission confirmed in u.s. how do you die from it you know what you know what a headline you like that is the beginning of zombie movies where you just see like flashes like a society falling and it's like first confirm in news cases like the corona virus nothing to worry about in this which is - this is an epidemic and then like everybody of Veck martial law uh-huh that's how it starts you're saying that reminds me of what was that what's that one movie with Sandra Bullock but like they can't see and they're like oh bird box box called yeah that's what that reminds you it reminds me more of like what's a Shonda the Dead was worthy such a bad movie actually it had what it's kind of bad it was decent but a pacing and the ending I mean even Brad Pitt and stuff talked like just kind of lost it it wasn't supposed to be how it wasn't oh yeah definitely word pays me but movies very underrated gonna have to watch it again III think it's a surprisingly solid movie to be honest as a Friday morning Beijing time which was only eight hours ago or something ninety seven hundred cases my god which is nearly two thousand more than yesterday including nine cases in the self-governing island of Taiwan so somehow I've got a river which is why we've played plague inc we're going to Greenland let's play you're on our best you so you pretty much it's like a pandemic simulator huh huh you start like I'm gonna name this one leg my leg my takes over the world but so literally about all my computer classes we use be playing Inc yeah what are you like you have like a skill tree and as you're going you infect more people you're trying to have a pandemic yes kill as many people as can let's spread the whole world iris so you mutated and then they're like scientists have figured out a cure so then you mutate the base or like resist this antibiotic blah blah go and almost every game the last place to get infected Greenland really so we're going to Greenland so we're going to Greenland the United States confirmed a sixth u.s. case marking the first time the virus is spread from person to person why with experts saying a vaccine is still a long way off loopy more international cases of the illness have appeared Australia Vietnam and South Korea all announced new Corona core coronavirus infections while India in the Philippines had their first ones I'm stunned okay now I'm starting it now it's just I def tolls raised 2 to 13 if you think about it though and the grand scheme of things 213 people in the world population is not big at all like before virus that literally just started not long and not even two weeks ago how do you die from it like what do you get I don't know like do you just get like flu-like symptoms but Omega Missy said the important thing is the World Health Organization announced Thursday that it was declaring a break a public health emergency which legally legally requires States to ramp up the response to the crisis but the idea is like yo this is serious let's stop it mm-hmm beyond the look at you know hey stay so hopefully we didn't head up yeah we can contain it infections have also been confirmed in Italy France Hong Kong and Japan Nepal Cambodia Singapore the United Arab and rattie's Vietnam Taiwan Canada and Sri Lanka it's crazy how much we travel as like humans over watch Willy cancel other Chinese games absolutely you have to because in their upcoming season they were doing it where like you play home games now like it's not just in LA you go to yeah Dallas San Francisco but Beijing Hong Kong Beijing together so they said yeah all yeah no any travel and I mean we're talking about games I'm like April May don't know it's so scary man and then like I heard like towns like woo hyung is like on lockdown like you can't like leave like you are locked in your apartments all day every day to see if they're like just talking about it and seeing what it could be just sounds like science fiction or something you know just doesn't feel real yeah like we heard of the Black Plague and how terrifying it was before did that happen like 7 6 17 I thought I was like the Renaissance or like the Silver Age or what did I I don't know that those ages the BC okay let's see you know you don't really mess me up the other day that like when you say like 850 BC 650 BC is earlier than 850 BC because it counts like downward oh yeah I'm an idiot wait earlier soap me up fun fact the first recorded case of the bubonic plague was actually in China and 224 BCE Oh God but the most significant outbreak was in Europe in the mid 14th century over a five year period from 1347 to 1352 25 million people died which at the time was some ridiculous way purse in the pocket I think it's like 33% of those is crazy and in today's for that for a we to hit that would be billions you know what uh I think was the actual like cure to the Black Plague was just a poem sanitizer and he was just a far so actually and it was you know what else oh he's crazy uh I think I know I don't this every oh hey I did know welcome back to the podcast we're all we talked about is sad stuff and hey were you a comforter hey you need a couple rainy days to learn to enjoy a sunny day listen on Santa's it's better to be prepared I'm just saying everybody should know because that's what everyone's saying like it's not it that's how it starts he's gonna be fasting I mean I'm not joking maybe one day I build a ball you know just kind of build a bunker don't [ __ ] around and build a fault it's not work so I gotta pay DLC to get in that vault or you know you gotta bring something to the table I mean I am funny I and I would have to be one of those like sad movie moments where I have like my family we're like full and you're like no and when you're like bang within like I punch the door as hard as I can and it blows open cuz I'm a super you know I can see you in the glass and then the zombie cream you know I like punch the zombie off of me and then I fly away no you punch it Oh get me a hooker you come in and you shot it bit your hand yeah you know it's nothing dude it's like blue and I are running in and then like you close the door like both of us and I'm like well this is blue and I look and then like blues not next to me and I look inside and blues like loses a bomb flash goes that's all i sees the last burn did your bravest blued a beat and then i turn away to look away and sharks on the other side taking the first blast oh god okay so and I've sad stuff let's move on to more exciting stuff for you too yeah it might be exciting for you to dados getting on it ninjas getting on it turn the tap man's getting in on it alright Tim Tim I try to talk about it last week but then I got sidetracked and just as we do I don't know yeah I was like 10:10 yeah actually I want to talk about something else okay and then at the end of the bond guys really oh we did talk about 10 10 people we already I the producers already I can't wrap it up wrap it up um I haven't played at all I got a code and everything I just don't know why I haven't played your boner yeah that's probably a big reason why my beer could be it also could not be that but blue what do you think about it so far is it the Pokemon killer no not even close like not even her not even in the back your mind I even back in riding on this okay so let me go over the I'll tell you why it's not even remotely close it has nothing to do with the gameplay the gameplay is fantastic I really like the 2v2 battles I like singles but that's cool but I like to v2 is way cooler singles and pokemons got a little sale it's always to be - right only to be - well I mean it's always you know you send up two creators if you only have one left or whatever then so um I really like that I like the difficulty of the game I think the game doesn't hold your hand I like that there's a lot of areas for you to really go around and explore actual side quests that are optional I like that there's literally side quests like actual things for you to go do and fetch and and actual rewards you get from side quests I really like that the game is so grueling that they literally give you like a heal all a one-time-use thing for your party every time you go to the poet's at Pokemon just attempt him Tim Tim Tim I can't cheat your stream all the time saying Pokemon over Tim Tim I have to stop em - every time we didn't play through yeah at this point is like 28 something every 10 I'm like you mean tempte right I'm sorry it's hard dude so I mean the game is good it's not like it's obviously the formula is the same I think it's if if this game was released as a Pokemon game today people would love it right they'd be like oh it's difficult and look at all these areas and their side quests and Wow - V - and the Stannis is so cool shared world co-op shared world coops this isn't the full game right the whole games that out it's like a little less than half seems why are they doing that I feel like why every game does really EXO smell hmm now the reason why it's not even close to beating Pokemon and probably will never be that close to catching up to Pokemon is there's nothing to of the game it has everything to do with the temp temp designs do you don't like any of them I had like 5% of the temp temp designs are like not even good enough to be Pokemon reject designs they're not even getting past draft stage not even getting past Drive stage like Masuda was like that's its foot how about how about this how about how about horse number one and horse number two and then there's like it's not it's it's just a normal horse and that's Larry what I get from temp time it's just very most of those most of the time designs which is really boring there's a couple like with like you say in the name ones I'll put them up on like the this creation should be easy well platters that sad about it you got Christian just frowning like a baby over here I love the game like the game is fantastic it's just the tempt em designs are very like me give me your top three tempt em designs one is Plata pet that's like the key little platypus huh yeah yeah and he's - he's designed to be a Pokemon he was originally mom yeah and what was he like a fake starter or something like that yeah but read like blink someone bought the rights to that design and then they did the Kickstarter goal where like you get to put a tempt him in the game Oh how much was that a lot couple thousand he should have done it just put in a mr. fruit I mean he pledged to be in the credits just a little more gonna tempt him a lot more my second is probably the whole para line to gran bond the whole bird with with leaf is really cool and then my third is probably adorab Oros which is like as Kim sleepy I know yes it has adora in its name adore Boros so horrible so what I'm getting blue is you have those 3:10 Thames and then the rest are just trash and design I'm honestly just being as realistic as possible the only one of my three favorite designs that have a chance of making it in Pokemon would be Plata pet and that's it and that's because well they also have a different design like holistic approach yes week I there are some headedness it's like every Pokemon I enjoy them but they're just like they're not do you see them and you're not like oh wow like that's I think it's that one yeah they don't stick with me at all and that's why Pokemon let's continue to be like just this huge money-making machine cuz like their art direction is just fire their art direction to just fire it's just and that's so important when the image is not and I'm gonna be honest with you blue I've been watching and I haven't seen one Tenten that's like Dan that thing is hard looking exactly and you as in a casual big that and as a casual then that's those important part is because they focus their money but I can still name you all the high pass pokémon like Bellsprout was that your opinion automatically does not matter so Bellsprout I like victreebel he's cool um I like what are you looking for you freak did you lose your little sore just fell oh dude is it like have you ever been in class and so everybody can relate to this have you ever been in class and you have a pencil and then you drop your pencil and then you go to pick it up and it's gone the world is eating it just like all the socks it's gone I can't tell you how many times like oh and then I like look down and he's like dude a desert of just nothingness my heart and so now you found your knife okay now put it back no I stop stabbing you're the one that broke the stand for it anyway it's not important Genki and kazuma like come on okay but giggy's like give me a life I'm in at the put your nothing like write these names down for me [ __ ] is just very basic I just don't don't like give me your tier list I think people I think people are partial to Genki purely because jenkees broke into the first area he was always my boy I lock up all of them and I'll just tell you the ones I don't think okay because especially as you get later in the game I think you started so you're saying like most of these would be in your Pokemon tier like it could they could well see I know I I completely separate I know the art differentiation stuff and they're enough that like oh that's cool enough they're like I just want that because I think it looks cool I like Ori no wait I'm supposed to the ones I don't like yeah I actually would prefer the ones you do like because that's probably I know there's probably more there's probably more than you I'm saying Wow Michael always hating over here and then we have the complete opposite over it I like to live life cup half full okay okay okay I'm a really hard guy to displease me so when I dislike something oh yeah sois Lee I like low Ally but I don't really likes wali totter is a hitter mess sometimes on my gear sometimes might now I don't know I have no idea what these look like I'm just gonna have them pop up everywhere the scale is a hit but skunk her scales a mess but hunch is a hint is that like his evolution I'm assuming or fill a niche Drasil sick I don't know how blue doesn't like those ones yeah freaking me look at it he's like a little like he's got like three heads when he balls and stuff that's it yeah home st. your man okay no I am come on Bona P and Copiah don't really like those ones you know you like a lot of these I wonder what which is your favorite Masuka sounds a hit or a miss mushi it's pre evolution is great but then it evolves and the face really bear what happened have you ever designed your own pokemon no no IV blew I'd be disappointed by what every minute I've never designed my own pokemon I've designed my own yugioh cars though Paul Oh what would absolutely not make it in um they might make it a Tim Tim though you don't like talks a waddle blue so he's so stupid you don't even like blues that's your name he's so cute look at him he's like derpy and then he has like poison gas coming out of him that's like the black stuff I like it yeah I don't hate it I mean but it ain't no Charizard that's what I'm saying dude yeah that's all the ones I don't like which is your favorite show me your absolute favorite it might be canker kazuma I love them so much what's ganky is he like a monkey no that's what I imagine this is game King Kazuma oh isn't ganky the one that app is trying to like catch on or bloom on luma now that's like the shiny version intent M right mm-hmm now that is one thing I really like about time time I like that it's [ __ ] impossible to get a luma form because well it's 1 in 6,000 good keep it that way don't give me this BS 1 in 400 and then you can have to some sort of because like I want everybody to feel included I want everybody to have shinies nay I say you okay to be fair though you can shiny huh very quickly in temp time but but yeah but I'm just what I'm saying is like it's just it's better to have those 1 to 6000 odds and 1 to 400 even though you could do 6000 encounters and pokemons time of 400 you're not gonna like this then because they said they might have an in-game area that makes it easier to lose well they have an in-game area where weekly it's gonna rotate a Tim Tim which will have a better chance of better SVS and a possible higher limit chains which for all we know it goes from like one out of six thousand like one out of three thousand three thousand of still yeah they're still hard it's and that would be double the change I just like how it's like one six thousand I don't want when you see it shine it's a man like they had a grind for that like a biz like unless you're blue and you can't do like two encounters or something like that and then you get it might shock his nuts I'm not gonna angina hunting oh now the thing that's cool though is if you have two Lumas of the same type you can breed them and then your chances so it's interesting because Tim Tim have fertility when you catch them it has like a little tree with leaves for each the stem and the leaves for each one that's highlighted that's how many times I could be breeded once it's out you can't breed anymore that's cool so yeah I just have like a did of [ __ ] yes so like making perfect Tim Tim with like these stats is really hard and currently expense like Eevee training or something like yeah trying to get in this kit equivalent of like perfect IVs mmm-hmm except IVs the equivalent and Tim Tim are a lot more important and so if you have one luma with another type so let's say you have a nature luma and a shiny nature luma your chances become one out of 600 I believe but you only get max like eight of those maybe and when you catch a luma because it has it comes with perfect stats usually for each perfect stat it reduces its fertility so you may only have like five chances I'd say a CS roll that's a good trader and then on top of that let's say you have a shiny major and a shiny nature now it's one out of twenty but you guys probably probably lesson eight yeah well cause like if they has like perfect stats and everything you're like three that's sick I like that that's cool so that's even more like you got it now I have another chance and then imagine you own oh it seems like they've taken that I what I don't know how to describe it but that hardcore aspect of a Pokemon series that you don't ever do in Pokemon and I feel like they kind of enhanced that which is pretty sick yeah and ads are definitely different kind of layer to just with Pokemon you can have a team of six of the first pokémon you catch on a route or a route and then just stay with that six and you can win and I think just the pure aspect of how it handles battling with stamina and stuff and always double battles and stuff lends itself to be really interesting because you have certain moves where you can't you need to be in battle for like three turns before you could even use this move if you wanted to and then maybe this move does more damage and you can use it term one but it's going to use like 3/4 of your stamina and once you're out of stamina you're gonna hurt yourself and then once yourself it it herds itself as your stamina gets down to zero if you go past that so let's say I have 10 stamina left and I haven't moved that that's 15 I'll lose that 10 and then I take 2 damage for each stand when I go over so I would take 10 damage and then I'm over exhausted so all you can do next turn is rest and how much of their standard D like returned from that rest not much but like a quarter or half no 15% maybe oh dang twenty maybe punishing so you have to really yeah you have to well in trainer battles like if you're doing competitive battle you can use items that's when you have to manage I thought you could use items in trainer battles I'm saying like PvP Oh like when you want to do PvP even Pokemon PvP you can't use items I thought you could you can have held items but you can't use items like you can use like hyper potion and whatever but like mine but like you can put like a magnet thing on yeah it's on there or a berry yeah same thing attempt them they have items I'm just a big fan now are they gonna release evolution like have they released all the ten times yet or what is it I think they're currently I like 7d in the game and a full launch they're gonna have a hundred sixty-one have they have they shown all 161 look like all we know of is wasn't so there's a chance blue there is a chance they could look I have no doubt that there's a lot of tempt em that will probably look sick but you just don't buy the art style for time being III like the art silent I'm Tim the I just the designs are just very men mm-hmm Barry I think he was a good art so I love the whole cel-shaded thing I see them and they look very neo Pet II you know that's literally what I'm saying yeah they look like Neopets kinda I like mutant I love Neopets but like that's why I'm saying you just have to do you can't imagine you can't go home on I can't see this in the Pokemon world well yeah because it's not this is a tip and if they were too similar I think that's when they would probably Pokemon try and crack down you think Pokemon you surprised Pokemon hasn't even tried to like throw something that time well they can't they like did a whole thing is that first that's what everyone I was even worried I was I got this isn't gonna happen and they got the clear and everything Nintendo can't do anything really what what were the steps to like get around you know but I mean you have to think about it just be Pokemon has a monopoly on the genre but it's just like Call of Duty has a first-person shooter mm-hmm and then battlefield comes out called you can't be wait you can't make that like we have shooters yeah it's a genre it's just the only popular one there interpreted Pokemon yeah and so anything that comes from that derives a lot of inspiration because that's what we have and there are other ones but they're usually smaller really niche Indies stuff like that when is the full game release I think they're hoping for early next year oh gee so it's not even like close oh I thought it was like March or like April dang because I assume they're gonna launch it cuz that's when consoles will come as well I'm assuming they're gonna launch before release along with like switch did it yes it hit its backing thing or whatever like it's fundraising goal mm-hmm how much does it raise eventually that's a good question [Music] um I don't think I don't think I've ever backed anything the first one everybody does gonna say is this the only thing you've ever backed no wow have you ever backed anything blue uh yeah Tim Tim Tim Tim I don't really back a lot of things cuz I've never been comes the games they usually don't turn out fantastic yogscast game that and i turned out to be like a huge controversy thing i almost back that like back and call heroes the controversy that the game didn't ever like beam was made and then they just took funds from it or something like that yeah it was very like yes very easy so they asked for a gold seventy thousand and they raised five hundred seventy three thousand dang that's pretty good yeah um and they're like although any company and how it was it to put a tent it means become a dojo disciple my game oh who i want to do that what's a dojo disciple it's like one of the trainers in the gym imagine you're one of the trainers before the gym wiener oh that's cool you're like i'm mr. fruit you're battling me which is that the dojo disciple yeah twenty-five hundred Wow engineer for thirty five hundred you to design a route that sucks why would you want to do that that's nerdy wait if I do the 3501 do I get it still the dojo guy mm-hmm that's it you also get to design and your you get like an exclusive in-game title breeder help us design a Tim Tim it's in the sketches and work of art team six thousand so somebody first had to buy the rights and then gave six thousand six K and you know what's also gonna be cool um when it fully releases there's gonna be a dedicated Nuzlocke game on Oh so you create a new game and it'll play with their Nuzlocke rules and you have to add and so there's no so you don't have to like follow your own kind of like honor and system right and there will be no cheating yeah if you're tempting guys yes you gotta play and it'll be like a separate save so you don't have to worry about like ah messing stuff up but I'm gonna be exciting that comes out um what's their highest like come to the studio for 10,000 or something like that that was it the breeder Oh 6k was the breeder that's uh we don't have a super cool so I'm excited like what are they my only complaint right now is I just want more mm-hmm like I just want the rest of the game are they gonna shut down servers at some point and like oh wow so the progress isn't getting resent last that's why I'm going so hard because I had like alpha access and stuff but I never really played mm-hmm because I wanted to wait until I could I cry ask anybody you want um and that's there so it'll be on PC switch ps4 and Xbox one how many I wouldn't be surprised by next year it'll be also PS five and whatever it is X menu well how many uh how many Lumas do you have you have just one that one that you call it all in one I haven't you haven't grinded though second stream I literally just luma hunted cuz I was like I saw the black and gold and I was like I have to get this and which one is that it's over and that's the one you ended up catching yeah thousand research people thousand seventy six whatever well abs at like seven thousand they seem really tanky yeah oh my god my orangey lug is pretty yeah I'm not gonna yeah gave me follow yeah I wish the orangey luck would transfer to real life talk about because I saw bluesy I can't wait the luma hunt then I click on versus stream all destitute sad 7,000 woo I was like and you know what the - that's probably more like me yeah the - like spectrum yeah like where it could be right I need to be realistic Oh off to carefully decide what I want to look mom he did end up taking you blue 1076 which is like not bad how long was not bad very early because like that's about what it took for me to get my shiny Kramer in when the odds were 1 out of 512 his odds were 1 out of 6,000 and he got in a thousand wait that little squid thing you caught which is the first shiny ever know well so I that's Club a push but then when I was on vacation I have an official share but this is big news I caught it or I hatched a shiny Kramer and I was shiny hunting uh-huh and it's the little bird but it's orange were you on the beach shiny hunting mm-hmm and it took me like 973 or something but the odds are one out of 512 then and you have people like blue like what was the longest egg like what was appling 1500 something 1580 and then AB who seems to have the worst is like corsola took him like 2,400 and then it had the wrong ability so I did it again 200 or something I remember I remember that and that's all we've add what almost 10 times greater so intent em it's I'm rolling a dice a 6,000 sided dice yeah and I'm looking for the luma every single time and there's nothing to increase your odds nothing you just unless when that thing comes out and what right that'll be the only exception that's nuts so blue got it yeah I got like when you get it blue in the clip like don't mess this up don't mess this up don't mess this up I'd feel the same way I wouldn't even hit it I just keep throwing tim-tim cards until the problem is it can that overexertion it'll eventually go to where users an attack runs out and it hurts itself I can't tell you how many times I've tried to catch one and that's what happened you try and weaken it and they use a really high attack and like no stops and then they're just good knows it comes Oh what was used that's gonna happen to you at some point I hope when you find your first time Tim if ever I mean I would I've only found one because this is technically full odd shiny in the in the case like Pokemon I only found one in my entire life of Pokemon mm-hmm I'm not holding my breath here on temptin so him really getting that one is insane yeah especially for only thousand yeah that's crazy blue good for you I'm happy for you no we tell us that we popped off did you name it no I I'm not naming any Tim Tim and my first run-through cuz I want to familiarize myself with them otherwise I won't remember the names yeah what I do it like new Pokemon games Tim can you name all the temp teams like if I showed you like name this temptin why not I think probably get close with some of them did you name every Pokemon that there is ever probably blue could you they memory temp them no Pokemon I could probably name like 90% of them there might be like the ones I played least probably like Gen 5 and Gen 6 there might be a couple where it might is that x and y x and y our pride is probably my weak spot yes his diamond and pearl before but that's all I ever played that's like forward to one right and those I got on lock I study for the five I love but didn't play as much six I was in college I was busy I didn't play as much of that but in Sun and Moon I familiarize myself more Sean played more that via X&Y is probably you name all eight of gen8 probably I'd like to think it good or at the very least like would probably 90% um but you know what else I could name this ad if I knew what it was Oh enjoy if I knew what it was did the GG overeasy podcast before we hop into today's patreon questions we almost forgot about it then the clutch job you did clutch up super bowl what is the what number fifty fifty-five in the 50s I think yeah 54 maybe in the I think 55 they divided Fischer 55 that one predictions let's start with blue because he probably carries the least yes blue blue team do you know the two teams in the Super Bowl no okay so you have the in the NFC you have the San Francisco 49ers good team good defense and then on the AFC side yet the Kansas City Chiefs who do you like in the matchup off the top even just maybe the names which one would you go with or even colors San Francisco is gonna be in the white and the Chiefs well the team cards they have gold red that's kind of 49ers yeah and then Chiefs are red and white yeah mom blue give me a prediction I you're asking you're asking to do doesn't even know who's like who they are Packers okay I wanted them to go I did too so you have the Packers let's just so then let's just go with 49 inch because they beat the Packers okay so blue says 49 okay what is this goal of the game just in case there's a tiebreaker amongst us it's gonna be 27 to 12 okay Wow 12 don't see that very odd their number might be a might be 49ers defense preventing Chiefs from getting touchdowns and then he's got like a person yeah I am like blue I'm not a big football guy I'm just kidding I love this um hmm I don't know man like the Chiefs are really good but the stigma is that the defense wins championships so I think the 49ers put a stop to the Kansas City Chiefs and I think the 49ers win give me I want to shoot out I think 3128 why are you 128 Wow coming down to the water yes it's gonna be very tight okay I don't know I might want I'd like to see my homes win I would I think 49ers are gonna win okay nice still think defense is going to prove superior I'm gonna go 28 - honey only 8 to 20 yep 49 I like that but I still think that might be too generous cuz I feel like they're just gonna shut down can't cities often really you think those are like kind of garbage time points or something like that how like kind of like a there it's like 12 to 28 with like a minute left and they say there's something like that but that's my prediction so those are a Super Bowl prediction right and you guys bet on my money line I want restitution so for any of you out there who who raw pigskin there you go otherwise you're probably the whole ball sport Lou who's gonna be your MVP is it Billy white shoes Johnson or is it going to be a Tim Blake drill Montana [Music] Johnny Manziel okay Johnny Manziel okay I will have my MVP is going to be George Kittel I think George kibble has a monster game I'm gonna say mr. peanut commercial because they're going with the whole advertisement campaign were they dead yeah how do you feel about that I don't even know how that conversation went down okay guys next one kill him he's dead like what a plantar's isn't that what these guys you talking about him though right I guess they did it so I mean I'm not a big big peanut guy I am not over but I am a big patron question guys today we have here Rob all right um let me pull these up um I just pulled these up give me a second okay we have a question from Santos Jaco of them saying that right for everybody what is something that you like to collect ie coins figures cards or etc I don't collect anything I have no I don't know why I've never collected anything specifically just the tears of Patriots fan I guess I guess hoodies I have a lot of hoodies but I know and shoes but I don't collect them Jews but that's more so like a but like I don't collect shoes I think of collecting shoes is like you collecting something I think you have to have more of like 30 up like I only have like maybe okay but also shoes aren't exactly cheap but I also have like only like 10 pairs of shoes like dad oh if I have one I think data at this point has more shoes than I do and I wouldn't say Daddo collects shoes collecting I think is also like you don't you take care of women's stuff I would say maybe hoodies but then again like I don't do a lot of hos that's probably I would say you collectivities okay that and that's sick that's some sweet I love nothing wrong with it so he's saying this is a supreme blue do you collect anything I'm too poor to collect anything did you ever try to collect anything I mean pokemon cards probably the thing I've clicked with most of and you can't like me my answer oh how about that okay like well I got I got my three blue-eyes White Dragon Funko's right in front of me right now oh no way um that a Hawkman replica yeah nothing's six I didn't sell it someone it was successful and he could afford those things hey if you want to sell it these fine as I said and I'll buy it then I'm not resell it yeah then I'll make a bra and then you sign it and sell it and I'll buy an off sign and then I resell oh and then blue buys it back oh just keep I'm not gonna buy he actually liked it yeah my probably pokemon cards pokemon cards easy now I guess that is pretty easy or maybe Steam games steam games yeah how many games do you have on your steam like 600 600 games I guess I'd like 160 I guess I didn't realize how many I had cuz I was at like it's not my fault it's gonna make videos I was at like a place and this guy had a really nice computer and I was like oh let me check out a kid's like Steam account and he only had like 16 games was like how do you live like say kid meet a for those in there I've never even played their comeback catalog come on bro you're not a real game really - you just like buy games when it like the steam summer sale comes no ok that's usually it's like I think I'll make a video on it unless it's like a game I knew I wanted to play otherwise it's like oh this week's interesting this was new let me try it I try it I go no I think like 95% of my libraries probably just videos that we've done and if I can - the games I've also gifted no all right this is from sell probably a little late but who is your who is everyone's favorite content creator to watch in their spare time nowadays excluding us because we love watching our content our own colors I didn't like cranking up a mr. fruit video and I wake up first thing in the morning you don't I do ever want to do I just
