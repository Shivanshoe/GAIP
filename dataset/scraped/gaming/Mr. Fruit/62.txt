check this out pew pew pew oh i just didn't dude i am so fast oh my god i know what you're thinking miss true that you're supposed to showcase this help me my friend watch out boy i'm t hiltiered hi eddie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and what a great skyline it is today what a day to be alive because i'm going to be scum of the earth i know i already need to preface and i already need to apologize because i'm going to be an invisible hunter today but i have a solid reason as to why that is we're checking out lubray's ruin the brand new raid exotic glaive that you can get from our hulk hulk i don't actually know how you say his name but the raid final boss look at this thing it's sick looking and glows i wish it rotated like his did but semantics this thing's giant this thing's ridiculous and i'm all here for it we have here ballistic tuning increasing the range decreasing the shield duration that's perfect it's like what me block no thank you swap mag increases weapons ready in stow speed although probably could just go magazine size because i'm pretty much going to exclusively nah whatever killing win final blows grand increased mobility weapon range and handling for a short duration unrolling team defeating targets triggers health regeneration guardians apart from commands count as more than one kill and the raid weapon origin trait soul drinker gain health based on the number of hits before reloading i don't know if it scales since you know at best i can hit five shots with this glaive i have a feeling too it doesn't count melee hits if it did that would be sick but yeah i don't think that's how that works i do need to add a mod i don't actually really know what what mods are good here because like it it has like perfect inner accuracy doesn't it maybe sprint grip ah sure so the idea here is pretty simple bear with me i'm gonna pull out the glaive and wait for it i'm gonna run it down let's go that's the idea we're gonna go pew pew with the glaive but mainly go and just run around slicing everything i'm 100 mobility couldn't even tell you the last time i'd seen a mobility trait higher than like 20. so the idea is run around real fast whack things with glaive damaging combatants with my glaive suppresses them and defeating a weakened suppressed or volatile target grants invisibility and true side and also dodging makes me invisible so the idea is run up maybe shoot depending on you know the range of the engagement slice slice kill invisible do it over again the idea in principle is easy to execute but we'll see about that the coolest thing about lubrey's ruin the glaive is it's one of bro pretty much the first raid weapon we've actually got to take from the final boss and use for ourselves like then there's the whole thing like well we took orcs of soul or whatever and just touching mouths yeah but he wasn't using touch of mouse this is straight up what lubrio is really using to just poop on us and we took it from them like hey thanks have a nice day now for those curious things to like gg we can see what uh what all the perks they can roll with and specifically just like any rave weapon you can craft this so you get enhanced perks for practically everything if if not everything like enhanced vorpal on this could be cool this slide of hands a pretty cool trait it has this immovable object projectile impacts grant increased weapon energy while you're stationary with your shield raised could be good in some actual like higher end content or you want to go you know pvp right maybe killing wind or grey robber the bait and switch i think is new to these uh weapon things pretty cool deal damage all equipped weapons within a short time to give this weapon a damage boost not so good in pvp but pve it's pretty good i have one with bait and switch just preparing for my match drinking some advanced gg link in the description box below get it couldn't miss your fruit for temperature now super great we have a we have a flavor mister fruit lime and delicious anyway yo what up all right look at this thing it's egregious it's huge it's pointy and i'm all here for it does that make me kinky maybe i mean obviously i ain't that invisible um i just didn't do i am so fast oh my god i can't even control myself hope okay all right it's it's a goon squad careful i'm almost so fast i feel like i'm drifting almost yeah okay i got a little bit energy now check this out skirt okay all right i don't know what that was uh yeah i really don't know what that was sorry we're playing i got three four four six eight stack it's it's actually a sex stack sick do not fear my friend for i am not here why don't more people play pvp i know because maybe they want to have fun yeah dude why are you killing them i am in busy play i am in disabled it's harder to hit people than you think with my oh my god dude they're everywhere which actually lets me hit things you know with increased projectile speed it makes it usable in pvp without it i can't do anything frankly okay all right you know what i'm just i'm out of here i know what you're thinking mr that you're supposed to showcase this this is just a death montage what the fudge am i supposed to do right here all right everybody's got the last word penis pumped running around eight stack you know my bad all right geez i'm trying i hold i just need to walk around the corner and then i'm spamming i'm spamming it come on come on run run to me like lovers do okay i suppressed him actually wait this is big no don't give me i will say there is one thing bungo and i need to talk about with the glaives what's with this like melee lockout after attacking is are they worried the the glaive is going to be halfway usable like no other gun has that the shotgun has no melee lockout and can kill like three times as fast that's just what doesn't it's like it'll still be a war shotgun in that situation why do we need to lock out the melee you know that's all i'm wondering my god you're [ __ ] teammates man that's okay you know what every game can't be the best or you know wind itself the uh okay it's it's not there's no trap it doesn't okay all right i can't oh my god i got you bro i'ma suppress him i'm a supr it was good in theory in execution it doesn't this hurts frankly i'm i'm not having fun run it again from the top i have to say that did not go at all like i envisioned it but sometimes that's life you know you squeeze lemons you expect to get lemonade right but you know today you squeeze lemons and out comes orange juice like how is this possible i wasn't prepared for this i have lemons i squeeze lemons i'm expecting lemon juice why is there orange juice and that's just the universe throwing you a curveball and it wants to see how you're gonna adapt i am invisible yeah yeah i got a kill okay already off to a hot start that's a fat 1.0 kta ratio my friends i'm living for it i never noticed the ship up there help me my friend get in there he's very dead yeah i'm going to find where come here come here oh wait did i suppress him apparently because i'm invisible what why did that happen though what let's see believe that shotgun melee in half the time i'll ever kill and why doesn't it two-shot melee i mean regular melee two shots this is essentially a regular melee yeah i don't know like i don't i don't get paid to figure this stuff out i get paid to look like a buffoon well the sad part is i don't try to look like a buffoon but i end up looking like a buffoon that's that's where the there's the melee lockout just just let me melee man conimator that's kind of kind of sexy kind of i'm kind of aroused right now now you probably have a shotgun and i know this which is what a fusion rifle in fact it what's faster is it melee shoot or shoot melee i feel like it's melee shoot because the shoot melee appears to have the quicker quicker lockout you know what i'm saying ah really really what the fudge was that yeah yeah yes okay this shoot melee it's the play apparently not that i ever do okay how did i not get that okay stop taking the kills the sec oh jesus come here yeah and why was there a lock out there i don't understand you you disgust me sir how did that not hit him where'd you come from the taco man were like the boner man oh dude [Music] i mean my problem is yeah i'm strictly running around with a glaive but you know if i did that with most other energy weapons you know what would be happening right now it'd be succeeding okay i'd go i'd be somewhere in life but instead here i am how's that not come on i've seen enough come on i'm calling this one no that was my that was my kill you fool it doesn't look good when we mercy them but i didn't do much you know what i'm saying like come on guys okay all right so we run it a third time fine rumble that doesn't i i think you you need more chaos on the map that's the other thing it feels like half the glaive perks still don't interact well with the gla it doesn't make sense nothing really works with melee but the whole appeal the weapon is its hybrid and you can do both but why melee when currently nothing's interacting with it you know it doesn't really make sense same with unrelenting though i don't understand why it says guardians count as one more kill but you still need two to activate unrelenting can we can we talk about that okay all right it's time to show the good people of youtube why let me put this way i need a title frankly so somebody can click on this video because here do we care about results no what do we care about fun right guys right somebody's okay had that now there we go okay i'm gonna reload oh it killing one is active it's finally active it's here oh wait a second i'm like doing things now uh aodom check this out did you guys see i missed all those shots kind of crazy right okay yeah oh my i don't know what is going on right now but i know it's going well i hit him once which means he's weak which means hold on hold on i'm starting to see some promise here hold on maybe if i don't just randomly ape it down every single time you know i don't just have to hold oh it's the projectile speed bruh like i just straight up didn't want to shoot when i was farther away but he wasn't working because i was like if he moves a centimeter i will undoubtedly miss him moses gonna do what are you doing over there do i have tracking on this i don't know but you're dead yeah okay i wanted to kill both of them but i'll take one i'm a warlock slayer yes yeah yeah i'll leave the tracking on the melee here we are maybe i should exclusively stick to rumble what what an interesting turn of events i'm always apprehensive but evidently this is the only place i can find any sort of results so all right he doesn't know where i am hey andy spawn behind me you gotta be kidding me what the [ __ ] what what is this i love you you love me i'm gonna die everything it was going well it was but i think they've become privy to glaive wielder don't ask me what the fudge that was uh did unrolling proc there it kind of seemed like unrelenting products there now trust me when i say i want nothing to do with this but i do know there are two people fighting here now there we go yup you just gotta buy time get the kill doesn't matter how you get it just get it it's the projectile speed's so bad man it's it like all he has to do is that just a d a d left right and then it's just like well yes i die now got how in that span of time i cannot shoot twice look give the glaze i'm saying just a little bit more love no melee lockout maybe increase bass projectile speed a little bit or just give it a quicker rate of fire and do work good but for now it's just it's just a troll pick to be fair i feel like over time like what about sidearms man again what do sidearms do exactly in this game i don't know but this guy's super he's about to win it's a good thing that third place you've got to be kidding me hey third place baby podium finish whoa in this game alone i think we got more kills with the glade then we did the last two combined so no shame in my game gg look the lubrica is ruined i think it's going to be even better once you finally get enough deep sight to craft it which good luck what the fudge why is it so hard you need five for each wave but uh know semantics i'm getting ahead of myself it's it's cool i like the glaive it looks sweet but just buff glaives in general they're close they're almost there i think i don't know what do you guys think porn is ah freaking ah what am i going to title this people to watch look when you hey are you new to the channel hey hi how are you welcome i'm sorry you didn't make it to this part of the video that's for sure but if you did feel free to stay uh you know subscribe uh because this is what you can expect a very honest destiny gameplay i think that is a very nice way of putting it it's it's cold hard truths that's what we give you here we don't sugarcoat it okay i'm just like you i'm out here struggling okay that's it i don't know what i i don't know i didn't have a speech prepared uh see you guys the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
