the room you fell off the map going back to what we're going back it's going back to the bow it's back baby yeah oh no let's go let's go right side we got to swap it up because whatever we keep doing it ain't working we've had some close cells but at the end of the day they're still else they have wall hacks because wishing he oh jack there we go oh i'm dead one minute left that's a super all right we're coming back just hold it together go outside again the other way believe in each other and ourselves that's right i'm just reversing spawns i'm doing long roundabouts try not to die or

push me oh no oh my god i'm one they're gonna be pushing me bro yeah please until you're right mr fruit behind you miss fruit you're not they're going to you know wherever you oh no you traded he's on my body with both yeah why not minimize everything we are in a round i don't know what does yeah i'm really i don't have a lot of intellect so i don't have any super that's it'll stagger the supers that's the best part okay they know what we're doing now watch out they're a little firing squad i don't like it i don't like this one minute left my friend i'm gonna die here above you that's a super and i'm out of here just run just run disrupt what whatever corn dude i'll eat you later uh i think i'm dead here oh blue owned it behind you blue he's poisoning yeah they also have another super oh he's trash oh wow all right that's all right first game all right yeah it doesn't that's nice we just go ahead and reset the car it's like nothing happened you know yeah yeah that was our warm-up press f to pay respects yeah there we go nice warm-up game all right so that's that's a warm-up guys blue's first game now now now it's time to start taking it a little bit more seriously yeah especially because i mean we did okay right i mean previous results yeah we did great very i mean six seven eight if anything we are very numeral mm-hmm just trying to make us feel better here guys i feel better already i just i just don't feel like i i jibe with any gun right now you know and how am i bad with the chaperone i don't know but i manage you know what dude i'm throwing out the acre scepter dude they won't see it coming all right i'm pulling up my britches i'm ready oh depression boys hey let's see now they all use the chaperone they're going to be oh they still use it oh so it's okay i think one person is getting carried wonka s whenever i see two people in the clan and then one person how many times i have to tell you you're not getting carried okay you pull your own weight i know you don't mean that what you think i mean that you are getting carried that's not true well if i'm getting carried i want my money back and this sucks okay be mindful aside from scout uh mida they don't have any long range watch right to your right rob i hate that i traded oh my god stasis i'm pushing nope nope they've argue oh boy this is going to be fun and interactive behind you oh dude what happened over there yeah he throws a grenade and dives into it one shots both of us that's what that is what is that again just fun and interactive all right i'm switching back to snipers after this round i just want to cry and die [Music] he's half what from where he's one shot oh what i can't do anything i get shot one time in the face and then i'm already like low all right well then let's let's stay together you know we got this like i can't even use my my chest piece because i don't even get my supers what's your channel cause i lack intelligence not intellect what do you wanna use a different like wormhole screw or something i don't know i don't know because this is the chess piece god gave me guardians okay i gotta tell you something dude my ass burns there you go rob from this light level differential i got one going i'm going i love it watch for the shotties on the body press escape instead of one he shattered where the fudge is he oh nice all right nice guys we got around boys will you after you good homie i'm fine i'm just trying to figure out what we're doing here i just haven't heard you for a while i was worried the quiet west flow is a scary westfall it's not really oh that's i was watching some dream teams earlier i never realized too for so long like like rob was going to westflow we didn't call you blue i was like that's weird really yeah i think it makes me a company that's yeah that's cursed i'm pushing with you he's burning uh back right they're both back right they're both back right oh my god don't give up they weren't that heavy i hate that [Music] ns okay dude they threw like a stasis thing and made an imaginary door me and blue blue finally break the door and then he has a rocket launcher like what why did heavy come up so fast well no it's just that round that like the fourth round or whatever is when heavy comes up yeah nobody told me that ow once half on the back left stairs [Music] appears they're trying to flank us i love getting shot behind walls oh nt let's go rob he's just gonna slide into me all right okay all right okay all right i'm gonna get the opener that's what we're missing here i shouldn't i should have stuck with it that's what we're missing we're just missing the opener [Music] i pushed him oh god rob that's what he wants you to do yep and i have a hunter that's so dumb i'm in trouble one minute left all right let's reset those cars okay all right all right quickly let's reset those cards hold on i need to do a loadout change this map is so bad i have to do like just think about this differently um okay i'm gonna do that all right that should do the trick okay i don't i switched my head to you it's like none of them are even primary battles i know there's like this do what i did just switch your heavy that should be that i think that's was my issue i did that like mid battle or something though but we have to get heavy for that uh you know that's a matter huh okay someone said cqc i don't know what's that that stands for um canada i was using cqc didn't work very well i think one of the problems is uh we have no team shot absolutely but we don't have team chat we don't have coordination okay but we do have spunk but let's turn that into those two things wait what why are we going in wait okay so i'm switching shotgun no i thought you just switched it up no i went i went oh you gotta wait bro oh i just i mean for me it's just like i'll just click this click that i didn't know my back oh see i want that dance man okay but we're going to win this game then you can switch reset your card blue all right let's let's go left let's go to the heavy side left okay uh-huh um they're not gonna say coming they they don't know they do not no there's one out oh ho he thought about it he's got a shoddy i'm coming with you boys that's right we got the flank on these suckers he's half that's what that's what i get him he's half oh god i got him yeah oh behind us behind us ready let's go oh if i hit that it would have just be bridges oh my god he's half health oh my god i almost jumped look how low i am all i did was punch and i can't why i like it's incredible that i can't use a shotgun like how's that oh i can use a shotgun dude just point and click not with the chaperone you have to head shots i just can't then why don't you do something that's not the chaperone there's a lot of shots because then i'm always shooting farther than i think it works because people always kill me at that range there's the opener let me disarm you these dudes are feeding it yeah they're like us it literally feels like we're uh what um what's this happen excuse me he he head shot me and then the thunderbolt killed all of us oh my god what what does that even do it's i literally my chat is telling me cloud striker what i think we got owned is what the from the reaction person died and suddenly we're all dead i'm hitting those dudes i got you blood i got you do i on me on me on me got you he's half just push him push him push him yeah nice okay where's your clown strike god now huh that's what i thought let's go baby you can whirlwind guard what the hell is that this feels like um an actual first round on the card going for the heavy oh blue you're not did that one shot him he's caught track on me clutch strike on me what's happening he's got bodies on the body oh that doesn't do like any damage he's behind me does he have heavy one minute left i don't know he doesn't have sniper ammo he's invis we go maybe it wasn't the loadout blue it was just that those teams were way better than us i refuse to acknowledge that i i i have a much better hand cannon for this map now what's the hand cannon what's the sauce you got over there oh it's the true prophecy oh yeah i see what you're going for there he's got sniper careful he's gonna head shot kill all three of us again oh he doesn't he's out of sniper ammo rubber up there tight beat i can't do anything i got behind you blue so watch your left blue hey that's what we're talking about c diddy what he's what how does my melee not register dude i shotgun and then melee no damage he melees me i die not registering hey behind you bro how was my melee not racially my fault dude i don't i mean you just got owned you died without killing anyone you got him all right i won't hear it well i mean i just witnessed you you know you don't witness me getting up so there's the opening that's not going to hold up in the court of law so i just got it i got you cover okay you guys are just just keep running in there good stuff all right we almost got it one more i feel like i'm using a sniper that was like in the destiny 2 beta i swear to god what does that mean like it's just like it feels like i shouldn't be using this well it just feels wrong yeah it just feels like the game's like not wrong but like i'm wrong for using it because like it's just bad oh titan's burning i don't have he's running any other choice he's one what a baby let's go get the last one where is he i don't know he's hiding don't get paid by a name oh yeah yeah i'm pushing and pushing and pushing he went invisible he's in busy play he's in busy blade oh he's going for the rezzes actually going for rez where i killed the first guy he's going for it okay now what is it quit running why are you running no running guys i use my super and then i press the f oh what did you do and then it it went away how is he infinitely invisible what am i missing here no i super chat i wanted a super and then so i super and then like my chess piece it says deactivate whirlwind guard early guarding does not consume extra energy that's with a sword why do you have an exotic for your sword on no no the moby is conduct no that's with that's for the that's for his thing in the jig oh arc strider uh i thought you were talking about the sword i was like what no this is kind of bad i'm gonna switch i'm gonna go back to my legendary helmet what again why aren't you putting on the exotic that like you know like the heel when dodging your people or freaking what's a good one if you look at my destiny item manager it's like i want to puke what about jivin's vest i don't know what that does uh vanishing after spectral blade kills for more super energy okay again that's for super that you'll pop okay probably not once uh improves arcbolt grenade chains lucky raspberry that's more useful okay we're on the right track here um oh uh we have the ophelia's set uh scissor fingers uh grants two knives per charge you're not gonna use that do i have stomps did you just get work just put on worms i have zombies i have zombies we just put on warm husk but just put on just put on warm husk man a worm husk you need what is that the helmet yeah you need that do i have that i hope so i have it and slap that baby on boom okay well apparently i'm wrong people are saying stompies is the best exotic oh see well i'm just saying i was right okay well that was your idea and secondly i think the healing from the wormhouse is gonna help you yeah but think about like all the slides and dives i i do in a game and around you do do those like i sprint a lot i slide a lot is that the loadout blue you guilded dredging 1285 to 1283 what is that yeah no hold on oh love the fell winters some asa spods usa spa days let's go boys this is all it takes just an easy dub because that's all what we do it didn't reset my card why one real quick wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i reset it before oh my god yeah i really like it before it but now it says loss has been forgiven am i good i don't know look at your thing this i don't know mine says forgives one loss per run so i don't know doesn't why did yours clear my mind it because i pressed f well so did i all right all right well you're screwing us just just can't lose again it's fine everybody looks really cool that time does look pretty nice although i'll still never forgive them for what they did to the fur chest i'm telling you guys you and daddy need to do your drip or drop and that is like the next content way that swings destiny 100. careful they are blue i'm going to go for res i'll just get one shot oh no wonder i'm getting annihilated what happened um see that's why we lost that round aha that's it a go heavy side we literally i don't think we've ever won when we go that way oh really like ever yeah okay and they know where boys rob what part of going that way i i know i i was i okay i was making jesus christ i was all right all right we're not sticking together we're dying left and right the bad places yeah that one's on me i thought i thought my jump was on my scroll wheel and i forget that destiny's literally the only game i don't have on scroll wheel all right squad up team shot like some defense without my rocket when i wanted my sniper out and i was following blue it's understandable follow your teammates that's fair one's a little weak careful up top they're pushing that yeah and i got shot around the door i got oh rob let's go rubble he's right around here and shatter dive i hate that dude that's so dumb like what like what what betty do you use that can come they're bullying you it's not fair i'm going heavyside well now we're correct okay mr fruit's not going to decide okay i like it i like that call i was just worried see benny i knew you were cool oh please okay there's still okay i'm questioning why don't my melees do any damage but his do a lot of damage uh light levels that's right that correct all right we got this boys let's uh you know i'll just get the opener let me disarm them real quick [Music] i didn't disarm them oh where'd that wall come wow the jerk face man like go and touch some grass bro all right take off let him know okay that was a desk pop i thought you were going for like a no scope or something nope just a dust pop dash popsito this is how we do it down in puerto rico all right well pretty well this is sad [Music] no ah and if i were them i would have left next time yeah why didn't they all right all right i'm resetting my card because you have three six stars do what what i'm resetting my card i did that what blue now we can reset yeah he's that's why i'm answering what blue said well no i was like blue and then and then you and i was like now we can reset because that's what blue said now we could reset did you reset mr fruit yeah i'm resetting the reset just to make sure the way i could call a little double condom it's actually it's not the play there's really just no loadout where i feel like i'm doing anything because this map makes me want to kill myself retweet i mean if i if i could choose any map that it would be oh there's so many good ones um um those same all ones what's the what's the one that's like um on the mountain and it has like a base like a little sniper perch base built into the mountain there's like a little tunnel oh the vostok yeah something like that yeah yeah that map because it's the worst map in the game [Laughter] got him they took that map out that's my favorite map though all right first game we can do this first game of this trials weekend let's go here's the deal we have it's friday there's a reason we picked friday because we still have saturday sunday and monday well if monday if monday is our last hope we're in trouble i feel like that's probably the worst i feel like today or tomorrow would be the best right now most kids are out of school and i think that's the problem i think the kids are just more cracked than us i used to think of them as the easy wins i think they now see us as easy ones i'm just bad though so it's like even like the casual player is better than me oh they sat jump off the map if you hear me that's the last way i want to win oh what if i got seven straight rounds of people jumping off the mat one's burning they have arc soul thing keep that coming careful oh yeah my nade didn't get him one in the oh jesus oh pushing you pushing you what a dude so stupid up in the air and one in the tunnel on my ex right behind you blue oh blue one nice drive we got some fun ark souls if you use ark's soul you have no soul nice can we get that trending on twitter hashtag ark soul no oh he's burning he's won they're both one go i i can't no i'm not really oh now they're in their freaking arc soul they little penises just waited out okay we waited out i traded i traded i got one one minute left my friend there's an ark soul around the corner yo watch out that guy's done vault of glass he's dead nice oh he got the red one nice blue [Laughter] ahead inside more people going flawless it'll actually become easier no mr fruit throughout the week oh they're all waiting

different holes let them know i just got to keep popping off i can't be average man that can't be what the kids tell me i am oh i mean i'm i'm probably below average i i strive for average they're going to go there they're heavy oh yes they are they have a wither horde i can't do anything because wither horde wither horde again yeah you got this oh how's that not headshot that should have been a headshot that felt like a headshot what the i feel like they literally put on wither horde for heavy run i was so dumb all right just go outside screw it oh yeah i believe that there's a whole thing he's burning i bodied him or you bodied him i don't know oh i think that guy was just tea bagging in bm careful rob rob rob all right to be fair this is my first game with stompy's on and i'm not used to the added boost that is given by the zombies so if anything i blame benny that makes sense we'll just go i'll go top ring thing don't even go through i'll bring okay we'll surprise him he's burning oh he sees oh he's so easy he don't let him get away blue he's coming to you he got away are you kidding we got watch out drop one he's got his dog i'm getting out of here run just run he's gonna go

rob i'm a little late opener's not going to be there oh i don't i can't kill him with that overshield with my light level even if i head shot him oh i attacked two tag two no cap they have a healing rift so i would like to just stay on the record on my orb is completely behind a wall so that shouldn't even happen you guys can get my reds easily like i'm literally behind the wall oh but never so someone's there now i did not mean to double jump he's pushing me he's pushing me nice shots blue he's burning oh no he's not fudge i love him all right ow you're nuts real quick back up back back up
