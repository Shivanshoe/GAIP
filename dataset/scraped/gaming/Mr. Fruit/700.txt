Oh bye mr. fruit I'm sure oh my god I I always win those I win these oh my god I'm just I'm just up hidey-ho doin money mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny - and I'm mad I'm angry merely because I couldn't help my boys get flawless this weekend we're gonna attempt next weekend but I need to get my light level up though to do so I'm gonna play some more trials of Osiris with some random clan mates as long as I get a 5 wins there's a tier 3 reward waiting for me plus it'll be some good practice I'm looking to mess some kids out it wouldn't it be funny - if we accidentally go flawless for the head that'd be crazy right then I wouldn't mind okay what do we got here okay so my light level is still terrible did I see that right that they all have flawless gauntlets on it's okay cuz check this out I'm gonna get the opener nope because I can't because it's the opening and all I bodied them I'm okay I got a kill this is it team this is it this is amazing now unfortunately slight problem out here oh yeah burn baby burn oh you tryin to use your handheld supernova get ricocheted let's go okay first look at this we don't even have comms we're just in sync I'm gonna keep it up with a crispy little snipe here check it check it check it check it are they they're not pushing careful buddy oh what a clutch res Jesus Christ they'll call me the leaning tower a piece of because I am tilted right now I missed got one push that team push that oh wait help me hello misadventure I don't know he's dead 1v1 1v1 what'd we ever wonder out whatever but see if we can beat these people flawless you know I'm saying it's like I should be able to go flawless now the difference is a lot of people like tried multiple times or whatever oh my god I'm just I'm just I'm just oh my god I've gone I've gone for the sweep I'm going for the sweep I've go let me go son let me go see now that I don't have to try and impress Robin blue the the pressure is it's gone it's exponentially less and it's Oh Mike I'm feeling it so much so that no I was gonna melee him but I don't even need to wait all right give me this all right that's some nice heavy machine gun and just just let me go call me the janitor right now because I'm mopping it up right now baby I'm mopping it up I got the rest because I'm insane my grenade didn't connect because well I'm not entirely sure why didn't you you got to be kidding me you got to be kidding me that mist you got this buddy you got this you okay okay okay so it turns out I'm Meharry I don't remember us setting up terms and agreements like I didn't give them my paypal and photo so like I'm good getting reimbursed for this right all right well these Rascals out here trying to tell estou me boom I don't care I'm going in ba-bop ba-bop okay yeah go in get that pressure going let's go I could have saved it yes but again they don't have any and we have one so I'm just doing the simple math here and part of the reason I think I got my super energy so fast is because I'm using the the mod or whatever where it's like getting a sniper kill gets you a whole bunch of super energy okay i body one yes yes go on son go on my fellow hammer brother yes they looked like the nail didn't they and they fit the pot you just hammered them in the bunk size up the competition okay okay spring rations love it a serosa okay okay and despair rations ona Alton listen the reason I'm here trying to get five wins is because it gives me a tier three powerful okay I'm trying to raise my power level your guys got to believe me I think they all went outside and my friend is in is in desperate need of backup I'm shooting I got one body but miss the other push together lads I'm going chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga okay nice headshot nice edge on I'm feeling good and this has always have trials go I feel good until we just play one team and just get absolutely wrecking them like and everywhere they played trails ever again and I was debating like well I can just play some regular a crucible try and warm up but no regular crucible plays completely differently I always rely on response but I can't do that anymore and I kinda I'm trying to flag him team but I can't for the life of me figure out where the heck they are oh oh I'm gonna die I'm gonna I'm sorry I'm a detriment quite literally did is zero damage there they've yet to try and challenge me with their sniper probably lies on their part oh we're just okay okay believe that yeah I saw you peeking there you all rascal and oh okay yeah let's go let's go good stuff so we want to push outside essentially right cuz that seems to seems to be the play you guys go out there I'm gonna go out here or you follow me and the other guy does we're gonna do something he's above me I'm still burning

two of you there's two of you wait for your friend though because he might oh the rose okay I'm coming yes we tied it up I almost got my super this is doable unfortunately that my teammates probably aren't near their super though so if I don't win my round using my super then we might be in a bit of trouble okay there's the pic again I'm coming I'm coming I'm throwing nades let's cut them off they're burning I'm trying to figure out where the fudge their own holy range Batman okay but if I pop super we have a chance this is doable and they don't have a super so just don't get picked again and I'll be able to use my super if I can get a sniper pick here might just be GG but I don't see them they're all hiding outside they might be trying to team shot with their Snipes Oh thought I had it turns out I'm just a deadiy okay okay I'm trying to get a feel for where they're at oh they have Archie straight or no there we go let's go Oh watch the sniper I'm terrible I tried to just run in
