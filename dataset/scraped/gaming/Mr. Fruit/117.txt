got well the second one the first one i got wasn't great this one was the better of the two so i'm just gonna rock it anyway you know why not with fluted barrel mm-hmm yeah look at that the stats ricochet rounds you know what you love it they ricochet rapid hit for that stability reload and headseeker so that you know if i can't aim when i eventually can it'll do more damage and i put on the old masterwork and have targeting adjuster i don't know i don't know what else to put on it but look at the little mcdonald's gun though you know like when you go when you go flawless the whole you know so that's it that's a sin tweet oh actually i already did i i tweeted out that you know i played destiny with false it is kind of ceremonious because come this tuesday or well i don't know when

super dusty and i like peanut butter and butter ah yes peanut butter and butter and peanut butter and jelly we just start playing things get going i feed we sing and then we wrap it up yeah it's the concert nobody ever wants within and that's why i uh hand them out wait what somebody's a phantom on the enemy team what the [ __ ] are we doing what else is going on over here up here i am with a whole bunch of nincompoop he spawned over there uh okey dokey and i think that and just like that he didn't see it coming and i'm probably gonna die here chief one minute time to prove yourself oh my god get out played you do have friends though oh my god yo i can actually just like to burst with this that's kind of kind [Music] i gotta hit all headies but you know for me that's not a problem yuck why do i why do i do this my bad timing is actually incredible timing it's not the right way okay look at the damage y'all coming out of here [Laughter] victory that looks good on us doesn't it team okay positive katie not much just i didn't pop off like nub you know or gilded unbroken impressive what um what were you using huh okay shotgun and cannon okay okay freaking yeah sure and next up halo infinite take notes we're just gonna play uh the the equivalent of a slayer team deathmatch yeah game of progress yeah all right i'm locked in hold the fudge is that dude using yeah can we still talk about how for whatever reason they don't give people who join the game in progress some freaking energy for what wait what what the fudge die you demons like you're just pun that's it i gotta jump in like oh this is fun super oh i don't know what to bother oh that was that come on come on we both know um this guy says holy it's mr fruit but like music symbols he's got that on like speed dial how's this man doing them crazy oh wow that was something damn much if i do say so myself well consider me a fan what did he load a machine gun yup i lose that one pretty sure there's there's p variances bruh bruh oh my god oh he almost he thought about running into that oh my god man i thought about just a dying apparently do it it's initiation do it do it no you no no you you no you all right fine it's like oh my god you actually did it how stupid and we're back ah this is terrible frankly imagine hitting shots oh my god imagine freezing that many people well done oh what a handsome devil you are are we losing i feel like we're losing but they're weak i don't know why he jumped this is not good because they oh we're behind ah come on y'all we were so close why they put me in so so early i'm so happy probably controlled right is where we're just gonna most likely get some dual action and i choose it because i feel like it's the most populated playlist but i don't actually know okay all right this is a map yo that guy looks sick in the back it looks like a little spider thing like everyone's like why do you wear pepe the frog on your face because it's a sick helmet and maybe because i like to be different okay so unoriginal i do think just because other people don't do things i feel like one of those like basic white clothes like my personality is um i like to watch um the office on repeat what do you what do you mean that's that's not that's not personality because that's that's it that's me if you can't handle me i don't mean to call it just girls i mean there's plenty of people like that i mean how am i much better you know what my personality i used to be an among us youtuber that's my personality like am i gone that's kind of sauce and here comes the really imagine just kind of threw that out but imagine but you know uh i don't really can i is that like a take it or leave it lost my only option frankly i just uh what man's like oh i never like destiny destiny excuse me you know why does it feel like everything what is hitting i just what what is this a multiplayer pvp game but the objective is to kill the enemy like first off let's have a little dialogue about that what does it even mean to be my enemy purely because someone hired and charged in he pointed that somebody said that's them that's who you kill and can we also talk about how this man literally never misses heads and granted yeah i keep jumping into them doing the exact same thing over and over but yeah i figured it would just work eventu so anyways i started oh my god no no you've already frozen me once was that not enough greedy now that's a man i can get behind my kind of man yo yo i got you homie even though you're using your super you don't actually need me i'm damaging them though i'm shooting them that's pretty good hey this gun's really good when they don't shoot back at you you guys ever tried that because because i feel like you guys haven't but it's it's pretty effective i'm not going to lie to you yeah they're like wait regrets i have a few oh yeah i just really give them a free kill or not that that was a kill and we both know what a grenade all right all right everybody they can't no they don't know they lack they're critical they they lack the critical i'm dead i just know i'd rather go out my own terms ironically enough my team kind of like showed up and saved me they're like dude you're [ __ ] dude dude just like dude we're here do something like no it's too late i did you're being dramatically it's you're fine no it's over i can't what a crude world why me lost enemy has advantage i've always been one to be bit dramatic a flair for drama if you will i am pretty excited for the new update because it's going to slow down some abilities and holds and hopefully like you're going to get more energy for like primary kills i'm hoping that would be pretty cool if that's a thing right give me the double give me the devil you make me sick yeah how's you like it when i had shots you huh now man every destiny what if that is i'm not that has to be the entire team no meme what the [ __ ] every uh d2 gamepl they want me to be afraid but i won't your fear mongering won't work here yeah what what what yeah that what that what that what what you know now i'm thinking about it yeah when when i just jumped up to that hunter every time and he killed me it was like a surprise pikachu face but yeah i really made that easy for him didn't i one minute won't be long now okay what uh do you want to explain how that second shot hit me directly behind that pillar anybody nobody that's right because you don't have an explanation i already have early signs of sleep yeah okay a lot going against me in the world i don't need to hurt myself anymore you captured zone c yeah i did yeah i did get out of my way i'm sorry what am i thinking ah those fireworks are so bright hey that kind of works i totally missed it i definitely wasn't just clicking every email button wondering what was going to happen i went to time again what is going is this it's just like the state of pvp a little slower i got an exotic i'm missing a lot of exotic springs i haven't done much in the past couple seasons but you they just refused to give me the new ones i went positive don't ask me how cuz that was sassy anyway that was the messenger adapt desperado would have been sick but we don't need that but also hey mr fruit you need kills with the messenger to even activate desperado did you think about that no yeah because you're bad i am bad i am bad you guys are right anyway i have yourselves my dad i'll talk to you guys next time [Music] [Music] you
