oh okay all right all right if you want to 1v1 then let's do this oh hold on hold on hold on hold on i'm walking around proper 1v1 weapon okay we'll kill me okay okay okay oh okay walking on walking on one walking shooting turning on three okay let's go taking three steps and then and then just when he comes off and then go yeah yeah okay three two so you're walking right now iris you're walking right now okay i can't come on see anything these sights suck i'm so joey kept talking so i had to keep walking so we were very far away well i thought i thought he was counting down to us walking that way losers versus joey machete oh my jet there all right you guys got to use the tac 14 right here when i start counting and you walk when i say go you turn around and start seeing what did i just come into okay one two areas areas yeah with shotguns joey's trying to get the advantage he's pushing but he's back he's using the subaru suv thing you got a lot of station wagon with a hatchback he's using a snooberroo come on that's not legal oh joey's oh let's go oh joey i can't believe it's not fair he was using a subaru yeah that was i don't remember saying that that was although this is all the tutorial i needed honestly now you're ready veteran player uh whoever's leader you're gonna have to do it um that is robbie it's wrong okay isn't it did you just call him rob i don't know yeah i don't really know why i said that's either rob or rabbi like come on wait you call me rod i don't know no i did not call you rod what did you call don't know why i said robbie i mean you can i mean

okay gotcha punch i'll have you know we tried veteran before however apparently it was glitched and it was actually harder than it was supposed to be so oh wait really yeah well apparently the problem was it spawned way too many elites i never got to see it but you know whatever all good we're just skipping anyway you know we don't want to watch it we're gonna live it you know they're gonna make a highlight off of us all right watch out everybody okay we need to bring a specimen container and we need to aim for the head easy so with me then you know maybe try not to shoot me too much that would
