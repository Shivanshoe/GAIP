hi a top-1 my name's mr. fruit and welcome to today's video where you guys assume stuff about me and I let you know whether or not it's true this is apparently a trend going around I know I know wait a second mr. Furth you're getting on a trend like not a couple years after it actually is a thing new me yeah so anyway I asked the members of house fruit which if you didn't know there's a button down below on YouTube you can click join to become a member you don't have to you but it's for the extra stands out there I appreciate you all anyway I asked them what are some assumptions they have about me or they think other people have about me and we're gonna take a deep dive in the mystery of fruits life and figure out what the heck is going on arguably the most important thing that happened is I finally got a haircut Chad Thompson the absolute Chad I always aimed that fruit watches more animate than he really lets on like when he plays games and makes like references ok I'm getting mixed it makes references he says he picked them up somewhere and my friends are also messaged me and go is mr. fruit a weeb or something [Music] you take that back I wouldn't really say I watch more anime than I let on I mean I think I've pretty much said every anime I've watched i watch a decent amount and i used to watch a lot more i haven't as much time recently but I guess the most recent ones I've watched I've only watched an episode of bendlin saga I don't want to watch that I watched fire force I mean obviously I'm all cut up on my hero Dragon Ball super all the sword arts attack on Titan but yeah I wouldn't say I'm like a huge leap I mean I like anime and I watch it when I get a chance Yes No maybe so I see we're off to a great start we're really we're really finding some concrete answers here good stuff mr. fruit thank you who thanked me hundred ring Kurt says they assumed that I had a friend who died young who went by the name of the content so as always I do it for the content you know that is that is a great that is a great let me write that down this is going straight into the Warbucks all this is good such exposition christian bernard assumes that i'm at 6 foot and 2 inches can dunk one time before my osgood-schlatters acts up I have a knack for accents and a really big brain a lot of those are debatable except for the osgood-schlatters acting up which isn't to say that I can dunk one time it's just that guaranteed my husband footers will act up I am NOT 6 - that is very generous II I'm 5 10 just just a little above average and that's all I could really ask for I can't dunk unless I had the vertical of an absolute Greek god which I don't have a knack track sense I mean I do some a knack for it though I mean big brain no you would think with such a large forehead that it has to be housing a big brain but no I have an exceptionally small smooth brain here that just hollow Ella folio Diablo assumes that I put the roll of toilet paper so it goes over the top rather than under like some degenerates and I could not agree more if you put the roll so that when you up you unroll it it's coming down instead of over your degenerate I'm sorry his words not mine although I do back them so yes I suppose they they are my words it's the easiest way to go I why would you do it the other way and of course I'm I'm a man of culture three-ply up in here hey no mr. big bucks Rolla Cody assumes I'd really like to play smaller Indies or just generally non mainstream games but can't as much because most people wouldn't watch them even if they may be really fun wouldn't really say it's assumption I feel like I've kind of mentioned that sometimes that's just clear I mean I would like to I like to play the mainstream games as well but there are a lot of hidden gems out there that I think could make for some really cool videos they just wouldn't do as well so sometimes I bite the bullet and do it anyway and then sometimes I don't really have a choice Mach Phoenix assumes I have a secret passion for knitting no no I don't however I did cross stitch when I was younger and I was actually pretty good at it there was something calming relaxing and entrancing lawful nugget gets the feeling that I talked through the door when taking a poop could be wrong wool I mean yeah the alternative is have the door open and talk which I wouldn't mind but my fiancee would disagree with you so I talk through the door I don't think it's weird everybody poops okay get over it except for girls girls don't put that's weird about time Joey says that he feels like I know a lot about dinosaurs I wish but no but my favorite dinosaur is a velociraptor so I can tell you that much Jai des says I wear shorts at all times partially true yeah unfortunately in Colorado you'd be crazy to wear shorts all the time there are some people that do and they're not alive anymore come winter there are times where you have to wear pants even indoors but for the most part if I can I'm wearing shorts actually yeah what are you talking I don't even have a lower body I'm this is me this is mr. fruit I don't have anything else I don't need to wear shorts I don't have a bottom half so the answer is no brood 7:24 says he'd always assume that blue Rob and I have been friends since preschool turns out he assumed wrong but we have good chemistry okay well he would have just disproved his assumption sigh I don't know what to say Chris Shepherd and my sister and I assumed you were a Mormon because you don't drink and hardly ever swear and much of your content well actually I don't swear at all there were a couple times that I do it for like comedy sakes but I would really bleep it and it's normally not my normal Cabul Airy it's just to accentuate a joke or a pond or something like that but now I don't I don't swear my content I don't swear IRL I know some people find that hard to believe I've just never sworn I don't drink because I don't like it and I have an addictive personality so I know and worried that let's say I did start drinking that I would become addicted and I would become an alcoholic because that's just I know my nature and I know that's how I do things which is why if I do something I go all-in and if I try and stop and go completely cold turkey just because that's that's just how I operate and I know so best to just avoid that and not even have to worry about that but no I'm not Mormon I was raised as a Christian but but it was like nondenominational I won't get into where I am now in my life but there you go Gabriel Montes assumes I hate college full of learning absolutely hated college in all of school but you're right I absolutely love learning and I think that goes for most people and they just don't realize it when you're learning about something you're interested in you go all it people love to learn they just don't realize how they like to learn they equate learning so often to like oh whatever in a public education or you know like colleges and this this is learning but if you devote yourself to learning something that you're interested in you're gonna find that you are actually love learning ahhh I'm an advocate that everybody loves learning bash monkey assumes I'm a really chill guy in everyday public situations don't do anything too crazy in parentheses that is apparently a really chill guy yeah yeah I feel like I've kind of mentioned this mr. fruit and Christian it's so weird to say that like that like both third person anyway I would say they're two sides of the same coin one is my more energetic extroverted self which would be mr. fruit and then the other is the less energetic calmer more relaxed introverted person and that's Christian the way I've said is it's not really a persona because mr. fruit is often how I am with my friends and stuff when I'm surrounded by people I know higher energy I'm comfortable in my situation but if it's not that super shy super laid back go-with-the-flow although that's all the time but in public almost always yes I'm chill Ryan Wiley assumes that I'm a genuine ganyan for a wonderful person stop it but seriously I really do assume that about you I mean like I guess I would hope that most of my friends and family would agree with you I like to give people the attention they're due keep close friendships relationships I guess wonderful is completely subjective so I've no idea headed to that but I'd like to think I'm pretty genuine sweet daddy kane assumed that when i was growing up my brothers would win more games and it drove me to be more competitive and strategic yes you're my favorite youtuber keep it up praise the god dad Thank You suite dedicate actually no quite the opposite I was always better than my brothers at games younger brother older brother ya know they could never beat me at video games so that wasn't it Carl the pigeons assumes I can pop my pecs like the rock can what why would you assume that that's in that's ridiculous being able to pop your pecs like that I don't know what you're talking about a group TC leo no lion-o I'm sure I've messed that up my apologies I assumed with your usual workload you either had no time for anything else or didn't sleep just waited for the next day and when I started watching your channel some years ago I assumed you were maybe Mormon or other religion due to how many times you say fudge and don't cuss okay apparently this is a common thing no again I'm not I'm not Mormon I just say fudge because I don't cuss I don't know there's there's nothing to it it's as simple as like I just don't cuss it hasn't been a thing so it's just stayed like that and with my usual workload kinda kind of hit me hard right there what the fudge cuz like I do sleep I value sleep and I prioritize sleep everybody should be getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep but I do have a big workload and so yeah I just don't have time for anything else and if I do the weird thing is and actually I'm doing it right now technically I've been working all day and I finally got some free time but then I didn't know what to do with my free time nothing really sounded interesting and part of that's also kind of my depression but also I'm a workaholic so instead I wanted to feel productive so I'm like I'll just go ahead and record this video yeah um I have a problem unban rescue cat says I actually love horror games when did you find out that you're a dirty liar no I hate horror games I don't play any Hort nothing horror movies not so bad different story scary movies whatever horror games though nah dude miss me with that rad machine one two three assumes my closet evolved only my merch and nothing else yeah that's actually kind of true I mean I don't remember the last time I bought new clothes in the past like five years so the only time I get new clothes as my merch and then it slowly just builds up with my merch and then free shirts I get from like Expos and sessions where I get flown out for games and stuff so just it's it's kind of depressing the overwatch guy would I be correct to assume that you're the type of guy with a level of fulfillment you get from you doing YouTube is mostly dictated by personal and constructive feedback on a video rather than how well the video performs view eyes yes I would say to some degree view eyes it can be it's two different things I can be happy and fulfilled with a video whether it be how I edited the content whatever it might be but at the same time I can be disappointed because of views so they're kind of separate things and they they can both exist at the same time when I when I really do like a video though I love reading comments and see what people think especially on those videos to see what people are seeing and if they notice you know the extra effort or if in particular they really like that video that always feels good but yeah it also the sucks the video just kind of tanks Devin Adrian when I first started to watch your content my father thought you might actually be fruity based off your name alone but those unaware of fruity is sometimes slang for you know like homosexual I'm not I'm heterosexual not that there's anything wrong with the other way but I remember this vividly because one of the shirts I had said mr. fruit or something on it and someone's like I can't buy that because I'm gonna go to school and every was gonna make fun of me because it sounds like a gay joke or something and I was just like kids are stupid albatross pictures I assume that you're secretly shredded massive biceps super muscular legs huge pecs I wouldn't say shredded I would say in shape I would like to be bigger and shredded I'm getting there but the biggest problem my biggest vice in the world is food and currently seven days into intermittent fasting with a healthy diet and no sugars which is no small task for me my sweet tooth is off the charts so we'll see if I can keep this up but yeah usually that's my downfall on I will put in the physical work but then I I'm always like brought pizza oh my god Kyle Gifford I always assumed you didn't need to find the content you were the content all along keep it up yourself that is unbefitting of a king Thank You Selter make me proud nate gilbert assumption - despite the memes who actually more veggies and fruits given out of high car but many fruits are big if true because it is the higher carbs and then the sugars their naturally occurring sugars so not that bad but if you have too much fruit and then too much of that natural sugars that's also bad for you i would say it's pretty even i don't seek out more veggies and i don't seek out more fruits rocks banana i assume you think you're weak for having depression that's why you push yourself so hard because you need to prove that you aren't and why you're so hard on yourself but no matter what you're one of the strongest people I've seen and I wish I could beat you because you've been a huge inspiration you're doing great fruit well thank you very much rocks I was kind of thinking people people would be like a little harder on me or like a little me me the most of these are like wholesome what the heck love you guys I would disagree with you at one point in my life I thought I was weak for having depression but then I realized it's not a weakness everybody has something in their life like that that makes life a little harder maybe or difficult or different than somebody else else's path but I realize and I want all of you who have depression to realize it is not a weakness you are not weak for having it in fact you're strong for pushing through it and that's the way I see it in fact the reason I work so hard is to prove to myself that I'm not weak and that I'm not gonna let depression dictate Who I am but it wouldn't say that I feel weak I definitely struggle with it and it's a constant battle but I've allowed myself to assess and realize and tell myself you're not weak you're strong and that goes for all of you guys Annabelle the dark mushy assumptions incoming I assume it's hard for you to grasp the impact you and your videos have many of our lives how comforting your company is on many of our dark days and how the small snippets of vulnerability you show here and there makes us cherish you so much have seen how hard you work doing what you love inspire us to do the same well if I can do even just half of what you mentioned then I'm a happy fulfilled guy it's definitely hard to grasp the impact because for me I'm sitting here behind the screen most of its just numbers so it's really hard to see that's real that's why I really I go into conventions and meetups getting to see people getting the talk face to face or getting like some letters and stuff and I can relay because like I've mentioned when I was younger there were certain youtubers and stuff that helped me through dark times so I know what some of you are talking about and it's just it's hard for me to comprehend that I could possibly be that person for somebody else and that's all I could ever wish for if I could help somebody out like that so Thank You Annabelle oh yeah I guess you're right it is hard to grasp Jackson Houston assumes I like going to renaissance festivals you know you're gonna crucify me I should crucify myself I've never been to one isn't that strange you would think I have I need to remedy that someday they seem like fun my parents uh stuff were just never into that I never got to go Luke seems I think people assume you talk to yourself and refer to yourself as mr. fruit outside of videos um I mean I have inner dialogue just as anyone does the conscience or whatever you want to call it but the weird thing I do notice sometimes is I will consciously when I'm you know self dialoguing refer to myself as mr. food and that messes me up just because so often when I'm doing comedy I refer to myself and third personally come on mr. fruit like sometimes like I'm working out like come on let's get it mr. fruit in the way what that's weird but it I may - can you blame me more people know me as mr. fruit than Christian I hardly ever hear that name anymore so talk to myself not really if you mean like out loud but sometimes I do refer to myself as mr. fruit and it messes with me finesse breezy I think people assume you don't work as hard as you actually do they hear your youtuber whose plays video games how card can that be when in reality we all know just how much hard work and dedication you pour in everything you do I would say on average yes but I know that there are people that work harder or have harder jobs just inherently I mean I'm very fortunate for what I get to do but I think some people don't understand that a job like this also comes with challenges and hardships that other jobs wouldn't come with I mean I could I have a huge list but it could go on but I mean like isolation lack of movement which I guess some office desks or desk jobs and stuff could share the same kind of with the same isolation obviously like no co-workers you don't have a boss you don't have a schedule everything you have to do on your own you know it's your own business you have to deal with you gotta answer all the email as a business that you gotta take calls you get to all the stuff that doesn't even relate sometimes to videos just to you know keep your business running and the thing too is like most people think oh so you just play video games and III know I've talked about this before new that's maybe like 20% of my job Jony universe assumes i want to make a wider variety of videos but i'm worried how it would affect the algorithm especially after sec urinary stealth killed your channel wall leve fruit thank you very much jonah and you are a hundred percent correct kind of talked about it before how i'd like to do more stuff the algorithm is screwing me and it's always changing it's so hard to tell and then yeah after the sechura incident hajj it's like brah so that alone is frustrating being at the mercy of some zeros and ones you don't even know how it operates there just no transparency there the past four or five months have been the worst months for youtube since I've gone full time in that six seven years I've been doing this so it definitely sucks and especially when you think you've only improved your contents only gotten better you're still putting out good stuff and then sometimes that's just not enough I love sec you're on I love that place room I don't regret doing it I regret it nearly killing my dream and that concludes the assumptions you all have about me maybe there are still some assumptions you have who really knows are they right are they wrong if they weren't answered in this video maybe we'll never know I do appreciate all of you for watching though and supporting me and the content that I do so with that said I want to thank all very much watching happy Tales of Phantasia I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
