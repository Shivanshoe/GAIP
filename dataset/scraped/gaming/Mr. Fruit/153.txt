oh so i'm gonna put that in there oh no ah their fish is too strong oh a dodo you know what farewell okay whatever hi eddie ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to super auto pets it's an auto battler very similar to hearthstone battlegrounds if you've played it i heard about it it kind of seemed ridiculous and i was like i don't believe the hype but it's free on steam so i'll try it and next thing now is three hours later i'm like huh i'm addicted warning you might be too so play at your own risk enjoy the video i do like the music customize customize what stand an expansion pack i don't even know what i'm doing so no okay here's what i know not much i hope this is a tutorial i'm sure it is buy an animal for three gold are all animals always three gold sell two give two random friends plus one health oh boy start a battle deal one fart cloud damage to a random enemy if you sell them give shop animals plus one fist and plus one heart i assume i know it's like you know attack power or whatever but fist beaver beaver is so cute i mean mosquito would you know help me win an early battle but beaver's too cute where do we want to put them right in the front oh wait buy food give an animal plus one plus one i mean i'm gonna sell beaver i don't really want to do that so i'm gonna put that in there and then i'll give mosquito a buff get new animals in the shop i'm out of gold ah fudge i could have got i could have gotten that otter oh my god it's so pretty it's adorable okay time to test your team by having a friendly tousle with another team uh let's go uh housewive oh wait oh this is my team i thought um poutine housewives that's right that's my team mr broods the poutine housewives versus rob the withering arms uh mosquitoes start a battle do one damage to a random enemy yeah they have a mosquito no and they have greater forces ah yeah press play well this isn't going well uh in the mosquito reigns supreme we lost ah okay duh select an animal to move it doesn't really matter i don't think so oh look at the little piggy cell getting an extra one gold summon a one one cricket ah otter buy and give a reign of friend plus one plus one well that just sounds lovely i want an order ah no no [Music] yes another beaver and a horse that was i mean give it plus one attack until end of battle if i have a duck i can sell him okay you know what we're going horsey oh wait was this giving animal honeybee someone to one won't be after fainting no that seems pretty good another beaver okay great i think we're killed let's go pouting housewives oh the suspicious bikers uh go mosquito what if i auto play it yeah and then push oh oh no oh their fish is too strong oh but my mosquito is stronger and we lose fudge first you suspicious bikers okay this is going well i reached turn three tier two animals unlocked dilly dilly team is full choose one animal's self uh i'll be the judge of that give an animal bone attack attack for five more damage or make a friendly animal faint what why would i want a friendly animal to faint what i got a peacock i wanna see your peacock your peacock sorry frankly i think i'm going to sell you ah let's go peacock um get rid of otters put you there re-roll oh a dodo start a battle give attack to friend ahead all of your attack like do you lose your attacker how does that okay here's what i'm thinking here's what i'm thinking farewell beaver ah do i want to ah my beaver friends nice very well beaver ah no nice okay check this out dodo bird bop and then he'll give his attack there boom second skeeter oh wait oh i thought i had it i thought i had to wait until there was three of them because that's normally how autobac that's how those okay wow okay well then let's just dump on them why would i want to make a friendly animal faint is there something i'm missing here i got to be missing something right a spider yeah but wouldn't i just wait for that to do that in battle why would i do that right now oh maybe for like a pre-battle wait let me wait what hap so then i'm just give friend behind melon armor take 20 damage less once what it seems like it was a bait okay whatever all right my spooder do i get him back next turn they've got hats oh no well we can't defeat this ah okay give him melon armor yes oh your beaver stands no tense screw you little ant that is a large oh my fish what okay animals can be frozen and saved for later they really didn't think i'd already be losing but little did they know how do i freeze how do i freeze oh then you just click on it so does the spider never return is that how this works oh but wait i can combine spiders yes good good give me another spider oh wait a second wait okay i'll freeze because peacock boom freeze you know what farewell yolo again it's a tutorial not enough gold no no no freeze that come on hit me with your best shot what do we got here huh the folded glasses [Laughter] what is what do these things do hold on i'm terrified um friend eats shop food give it plus one house holy jesus this is terrifying ah okay okay give me something good an ox that's powerful that's powerful what does it do friend ahead faints but it's in the front no oh my god i'm gonna lose to a rabbit no i'm not no i'm not check this out ready because he's gonna die melon armor boom we won oh my god we're gonna do it we're gonna do it oh yeah oh screw you you're exting for reason dodo stupid let's go i'm almost there wait is this a tutorial or i just figured it's like battlegrounds where i'm in a lobby but does it maybe just match me with anyone in the game on the same round or something this is kind of cool what is this what did i just do wait what what i was wait what what oh is that a replay doing uh oh it's not on y'all stupid garlic give an animal garlic armor takes two damage less putting that on the peacock oh shoot i'm gonna buy that level two now it gains four attack shoes a little hippo knock out game plus two and plus two a whale swallow friend ahead and release it as level one after fainting wait a second if i swallow this with that then summon something while also going within the whale and then the whale faints and then it puts out another spider that would then summon another thing probably not but it sounds like a cool idea deal two damage to a random enemy oh but wait if i give this melon armor it's surely gonna get a knockout right hold on i'm gonna buy it you can't stop me you give this garlic armor and he keeps knocking things out boom okay that was three gold i did not [Music] okay me let's uh let's freeze the turtle the pouting housewives are gonna come out successful who we up against the motherly presidents what is that thing it's a shrimp what is this camel doing hurt give friend behind plus one plus two eddie oh no copy health from friend ahead i'm gonna lose to a crab that's the greatest strategy i've ever seen the end of turn give other level two and three friends plus one no what end of turn gif yo this dude got double cheeked up stuff watch me win though i don't think i win ah okay i'm like oh but oh wait i forgot you only do two this is fine but we will be feeding oh my crap okay but now we're gonna spawn something sick check it ready oh my god it's yes it okay it does nothing okay oh good news so melon arm oh check this out ready spot we lose but melon armor then he's gonna get a knockout he's gonna get thicker and then he's gonna knock out the pit he's going to be unstoppable and the hippo wins check it you you don't even hurt me boom oh my god the little hip i told you guys the hippo was to play oh my just like irl the hippo has no natural predator you know so i understand so if so anyone can just attack for five more damage i also that would replace garlic armor i'm gonna we're gonna combine this and then i'm gonna re-roll for a hippo come on ah oh we get a level two spooner summon one tier three animals have four four is a dolphin start of battle deal five damage to the lowest healthy enemy i'm gonna freeze you i'm gonna freeze do i do i freeze the drive too okay you know what i'm just gonna unfreeze this i have no more gold but a dolphin sounds sick and a giraffe can help buff up my hippo but it's also very slow gonna happen very slowly but i think we keep it i like it i like what we got here [Music] here we go the insulin puppies oh oh they have such cute hats okay i'm a little afraid let's see we're working with here when you level up give all friends put okay it's not leveled up give attack to friend ahead oh my god that's gonna be a nine-nine camel and then every time so this thing's gonna okay before attack deal one damage to friend behind what oh my i'm gonna lose to a dodo bird okay this dude's got like omega strategy jesus oh my okay don't give it to the oh that's probably best case okay before attack ah and then oh wait why didn't that work i thought that would that would give am i okay i mean i'm not gonna complain oh oh and then it goes off fudge okay here we go big tier three not a big botch not feeling good about this um wait the little hippo that could okay the melon armor shall be stole upon us ah and then oh no we're one no we're quite a bit off i think we win this hold on dilly dilly yes dude even with his cool little strategy you can't beat a hippo dude tier four animals have unlocked i've oh [Music] i could get two dolphins brother i think i get rid of the skater wait what is this give all current and future shop animals plus two and plus two uh yeah oh my holy is that legal okay sell you to all my do this [Music] oh my now how do we do this because melon armor is great it pretty much ensures hippo is always getting a knockout faux free but i could also keep continuously buffing hippo in between turns but then i lose out on our peacock who has yet to have to do anything but if it comes to that it's gonna pop off you know what i'm saying so it's tough it's it's tough if i sell one i have enough to buy the giraffe i could give it i could just get rid of the spider but it's so good like a 4 4 with a 4 4 sometimes surviving a hit like that's good but i could do this put it into that then that but then or i could do this i think you stay in the back i feel like this order is pretty solid but i like we could just oh mecca build up this hippo you know it could be a six nine nice then a 17 but i don't know who to get rid of man get rid of peacock let hippo carry sorry friend ah all right giraffe you're in this is the way do you know the way okay nice we can't lose with 69. who do we got huh our team took a little while to turn on but now the dry hipsters don't stan they have a lot of buffs they got honey they got garlic they got honey okay deal five damage low south enemy oh my god that's like one of these that's nuts watch this ah he's already dead oh swallow friend ahead but it's oh but i'll take oh what the fudge is going on right now what some of the chick with the same attack as this wait so the faint does work so i could have wailed the spider this whole time i should have done it ah oh my start a battle game or game one gold that's pretty good okay but the spider lives and then he's gonna get another knockout and he's gonna spawn another one and knock out the chick still useless but boom and then this thing is gonna hit this give me the armor and then in two turns even with your garlic thing boom knocked out check it out bop saw friend hadn't released it uh that's fine oh my god actually that's even better because now you're not i'm just eating on your crickets oh wait but i forget you do that ah but then i i'm back again oh my it ain't enough hippo wins again hippo wins again let's go hippo whoa wait what oh where that doesn't matter hanging on by a thread this is in creable you don't say what is it someone a chick with the same attack as this okay as as people point out it's kind of useless because the first turn the melon armor and the garlic armor get taken but let's do dolphin boom deal 10 damage we straight up just oh my god it's a rhinoceros knockout deal 4 damage to the first enemy well hold up now we got a rhino now we got a hippo what do we want to do we i mean the spider is so good i think i might get rid of the turtle oh i think seven deal attack damage to adjacent animals so yeah that's gonna hit mine though right i don't want to do that um here's what i'm thinking we put turtle first then rhino then hippo so then melon armor pretty much guaranteed to get a knockout boom next one up bah you know you see him you see what i'm saying but the spider is essentially an 8 8. i might get rid of the turtle we already got garlic garner the spooner's too good maybe i get rid of the giraffe but i like the stacking possibility here with hippo it's greedy but it can pay dividends farewell my friend you served us well let's go rhino i'm gonna give you garlic armor oh i could i guess i could have bought the duck that's true i didn't think about that it's too late fudge what are you gonna do okay we're gonna roll what is this garbage if two i mean freeze uh re-roll again what is this garbage nothing i don't want that was it make it friendly no i don't want to do that that was not optimal if we lose it's because of that that was bad i could have had it an eight nine rhino the fuzzy finger the fussy fingers holy heckers what give attack to two frog my god how does what is this thing on what if they fed this dodo end of turn give deal um i see you put the badger at the end holy i think we lost let's play okay um the rhino dies fudge because it we're going to kill this but then the rhino it's going to tr oh man this is bad garlic armor ain't going to help me against 16 attack whatever yeah take that stupid okay ah wait wait give me a good spawn ah deal two damage to a random enemy is that that doesn't help us right yeah wait what oh he has to stay alive fudge okay does knockout steal work i don't think it does oh what oh my we lost [Music] hey that was our first try okay considering we were we were oh and three and then came around for four wins you know i think that says something [Music] [Music] you
