gonna get onto trials um but let me show you the damage should i switch to my hunter now now that like i'm oh yeah i guess yeah okay i'll go switch to 100 rob is 12 29 and you have to be at least 1280 to even get access to trials so guardian now things have been different oh my god blue's actually gilded dredging i love it dude no shut up please stop no no no i forgot to take it off dude actually though with the vex on your back dude that's kind of heat i'm not gonna lie whatever your transmog is right now i'm all about it yeah i worked really hard on this i tried i tried to go over like hey you have to have the style on the kids in a little while hey go give them a little look [Music] who looks better giant toblerone or um oh yeah true final fantasy character but i do vibe with my warlock yeah oh wait i can dance with you oh we're doing the conga yeah get over here what's up the blanket has chloroform in it you like how closely i'm grabbing i got all my i have to get all my bounties again though because i got them all my titans so i had to get them yeah what's this thing i'm looking forward to it with you guys i look forward to anything yeah so and that's why i was like wait a second if we're just gonna grind it out anyway boom dream team does gambit and then after that whatever else dream team does you know what i'm saying public events dream team does road to trials yo what's up boys what about my trains hey wait wait he's got to get jesus like you're dying you look like you just got here okay it looks like you haven't played in months is this looks like you got hemorrhoids on your shoulders all right see he didn't talk about me because my glam's really good kind of look like a blue hemorrhoid you look like sonic the hedgehog's hemorrhoids now all those tick tocks can be like oh my god yas throwback when they look good all day i have to go get my banshees don't don't stop i don't i don't like this is ours i don't have any hips to grab dude destiny doesn't account for ethnic hips they're back there oh yeah yeah those are some white pasty hips [Music] oh yes i love how nothing changes no matter what i don't have anything mr fruit has always played a little bit to get like his feet wet blue has gilded in his level rob has no idea what's happening after all these years we haven't changed at all yeah i call that growth i'm also using the the cool new um exotic i remember when you were a trial running all the way back you were you used to be somebody dude i know i used to be a child streamer and then you couldn't use your final shot anymore and now look at you look at this bro back on console i used to be like no way those shoes and then i did a little bit destiny too and i was like this sucks oh i didn't even look at my bounties you're going to do great you're going to do great first talk see my bounties quest shotgun sidearms you would have literally thought you've never played destiny a second i gotta put on the huckleberry i could be your huckleberry wait oh gamer oh yeah primary or kinetic gamma whatever the fudge primary there's now infinite yeah that's quality life change yeah i like that that's a good change it's been a little contentious and by a little contentious i mean only skill up with a very clear literally only skill the worst cold take i've ever seen but wait what was that he just basically didn't like the primer he was like i never have to think about the trigger pull and i was like is that where you said like okay you're wrong yeah internally i was like bro what game were you playing where primary ammo ever like mattered are you good bro no i agree with you i saw that and your reply is like amen yeah i just read your reply they're draining on pro modes it was pretty ratioed by the tweet oh he just dominated you holy crap i'm grabbing heavy and i'm going in [Music] great rotation can't hit a thing thank you yeah it came out when there was no emotes didn't think about it like that okay mr fruit thought i had more health than that yeah that's you're already dead hmm oh yo i forgot that i could press v and reload maybe i should put a sniper on yeah okay so anyway the one you like yeah i don't know dude i'm not a hunter all right i came back and i was using top tree sunbreaker and i got raised to dude okay so like don't listen to me dude that's why the destiny directory scares me like that's why like i'm glad i'm doing this and not on stream i would be getting roasted yeah i'd be like a visceral can i play the game at 12 28 they'd be like shut up idiot stupid  buy some silver you haven't even bought the season bro what kind of destiny stand are you hey i'm really sick of it where's this guy where is he are we playing four straight he's good he's been he's on he's on the dock oh i know where that is i don't know where that is oh i'm so dead i'm dead rob where is he he's on your body the vex mytho class is as good as it was in year one yeah pretty much really ow is it really i think though that's like one of my biggest destiny one regrets ever was not getting the victim class week one so i could just bump kids it's not death well now we can get it bro but it is going to take it off wait wait what oh you went right hey what the is that we both did about the same so what's a what what i just got sniped by uh so the vex has an overcharge mechanic where you get kills and you get overcharged and when you get missed when you get max overcharged the vex gets like super powered linear fusion shots all right you're close i'm dm and dmg did you give me the streamer look rob that just means we got a grand vaulted glass huh yo cosmo i know i haven't played it forever yo bro let's talk about it and i know you don't do that at all save us blue blue trade me your vex now ah well hit the wizards first oh and the on voice i need to save my sunspot kill him damn i could play games with you guys any day oh thanks man i'm burning this we're almost there our health is on the right and right it oh i got a scout rifle i got an fmg oh i got a lot of stuff yeah or knows you need oh 12 38 okay 12 34. let's go yes and 12 37. dude i'm 12 29. oh my god i'm gonna tell my clan 12 i got 12 29. guys guys i'm 12 29. i want a gz everyone easy no see everyone's not gonna say jeezy i want everyone say gz that's what we do in this commune dictatorship commune dictatorship i don't think that's a thing a little bit of best of both worlds take what you like from both oh what the fudge i forgot bullies not in our clan anymore wait wait hey imagine what matt what plan are you in good math class for life that's right he's cheating on us with datto yeah do they actually play but and now it's popping again it is popping especially like rob's back anything's possible bro you got to let me know all right a crucible match oh i knew it shut those targets and thank them i ship it yeah steven like at one point i was playing a pvp game of destiny like what yeah i don't believe he's still in it made me happy i saw that i was like oh yeah he's still here just on the off chance he got to see you again anything oh my god oh my god it's wrong i didn't think i know for me it was oh my god it's jimmy carter he's still like he's kicking he really meant it back then not yo mama like because like you guys said like it went through cuts and through some different changes he survived and he made the he made the the purge you know what i mean that's right so it means like i'm a great recruiter i'm a hundred percent and everybody i've recruited you know how to pick them rob yeah well yeah i do just know i'm gonna read the comments for the next one screw you plebs that's the one that's house root material right there he doesn't he never misses oh i can't melee i can't melee my mouse doesn't have that button what so i have a gpro wireless and oh okay flex a little harder why don't you well no i'm just saying i'm stating the mouse that i have so when the buttons pop out let me pick those up with you son of a joint guardians i finished all right who's going in i got uh okay let's go oh god get me to those modes let me bank those moats brother i got 15 for this get ready i know get ready are you ready get ready go my son i'm so proud he's so strong he's come so far oh one i think one oh wait oh i forgot rob let's get a couple let's get a couple go for the go for the ones with the portal go for the one with the moats ah you can do it you can do it ah how's it going over there i got it i got nova okay yeah you you dry to super nice i also need to rebound uh melee yeah that would be that would be very helpful yeah i might we have another invade in a second so oh no it's queue holy banks ow i don't see him you know mr fruit there is one thing you got right about this where is he rob where is he yeah but rob collins hello oh i got killed by him oh he's buying me jesus we're not even playing that job i was really low anyway so i thought like the scorn had killed me our dude is afk oh no i mean rob is trying for now don't say it like that i'm not going in i died well you said that after i popped and i was like oh i'm gonna die what are you dying is it a player this time do you even know i need i need one more brother i'm hiding i'm hiding i'm hiding i got 15. he wants that how did he shoot me behind the thing no blue that's a rocket launcher poetic rum okay i'm going in not that it matters i'm a bank these moats brothers it feels really good to be really bad at a game again i can't hit a shot speaking of bad what the fudge yeah okay oh and that's okay all right dude cause we tried our best okay they're all hiding bro like 10 seconds left show yourselves you cowards i got one oh my god let's go aj are doing things so proud of you buddy big moves okay opposing team okay we were evil honestly but next time it's ours we're getting progressively worse well we'll play oh no remember why we're here i'm 12 30 at one all right right yeah it's that's a small victory no no no 12 32. huh wait a second hold on hold on to your horses folks 12 20 so 12 33 oh oh okay you're no you're not hitting it today let's be honest that's it that's it okay nice nice yeah good you almost had it wait we're not hitting it today is that what you just said under your breath nope no i no that's actually yeah i was like look blue's 12 34 and then uh no uh he's actually 13 don't run that one back there's a pretty big difference there but you're you're pretty close well my fps counter on my monitor covers mr fruits so all we have just just one win boys come on one more game again but let's do this okay let's see the bounties i finished um oh my god three let's go nuts dude well i didn't get any guns or anything that's okay but you said that would help me i mean you shouldn't be getting drops like maybe you're not getting the drops you need because destiny's loot system one leveling system is bad but like you'll get there it is a bit archaic well so okay when was 1200 like hey damn your high light level because that was probably the last time i was playing this game whenever the last time you played like beyond light yeah you're all you're only a little over like what you're a year behind i mean this could be worse yeah because yeah the last time you touched was what when we raid did that the spread deep stone i guess so i feel like i feel like my chemical romance you know there was a time when i was like it was great another quarter happened yeah now yeah now i'm coming back but then quarantine happened and it kind of screwed up my comeback but in 2022 i'm coming back and everybody's looking forward to it until that'll be it gets cancelled then it gets pushed back 223. i can't wait for you to come back to the witchcraft and last a week let's go whoa dude you're like psychic why would you ever wish scorn upon us huh it comes to the score i said gg sorry i was bad i don't want our teammates like to really think i'm trying that hard dude it's gandit like if you literally lose who cares rob don't beat yourself up like that you tried dude i mean like when you do it it's different like you're doing it in a condescending tone like but like when the other guy says gg i was bad frowny face like i don't want him to feel bad about it yeah it's just gambit dude now if there's trials on the other hand oh i'm wrong he is never recovering yeah he's not going to be like jimmy carter saying he's going to get banned from destiny as he should i got that kind of power why does the huckleberry take so long to reload what does the huckleberry do again because consecutive kills reloaded from reserves that's so you shouldn't really be reloading okay sorry well i mean like if you check in usually completely wrong but yeah yeah you're like you just heard me ask like it's you know what i've been using the huckleberry this long and i'm too afraid to ask what it does [Music] because i need to use an smg and it's the only smg i have i respect your honesty submachine gun if you guys know what that smg's different holy you're losing why did he do so much damage yo someone res rez rob rez rez rob the rest nice dude love the turret they can't i'm almost dead they can't hit you well i did that bankrupt bank i'm coming up those moats brother go evidence you're telling me this guy's 13 20. this guardian's got a higher life than me who you who are you recruiting these days guardian i have depression god i hate you oh dude q q is my melee why do i do the cool uh masochist q what's uh what's how do i do the cool melee when the ball is above their head the world only knows yeah who knows what your command is but probably c that or a mouse button mine's a mouse i value target identifier i probably press c nothing v yeah well they have to like be lit up like well they are oh then you're just bad yeah i don't know okay have you ever thought about that i'm sure he's too lazy to figure it out i appreciate it he's the right word i'm going in there oh my god i just realized that double smg oh i got a high value on me oh my god this guy's 15. oh my god corona great work blue i'm doing what i can invade let's go rob wait i just hear rob yellen and you're invaders dead wait no i got 10 miles kill kill kill this stupid thing die ah jesus christ show

that happen i can't hit anything let's go mr fro death kills prime evil or hero whatever well they tethered me so you tried really hard yeah i don't know how freaking some of those hammers did okay oh

12 32 12 33. you guys enjoyed it what's the fusion rifle you're looking forward to oh cartesian coordinate is servant leader any good servant leader is very good that's a scout rifle yeah that's my that's why i know you like your scouts would you roll on it so glad you asked uh rapid hit and adrenaline junkie yeah dude that's sick junkie does like two shots for one right well adrenaline junkie is if you throw if you get a kill with your grenade you get a damage bonus for 10 seconds you were so close rob you were right there yeah i get that one and pallet jerome confused in true dream team fashion we lost all three games i mean to be fairly cute in the game but what we expect and i just have my pvp loadout like you would okay but hey and we had rob i mean let's look at the bright side what did i start off as like 12 28 right something like that yeah big stuff and now we're 12 33 so just 57 more to go yeah and which means we get to play the game and do strikes whoa let's go dude so next time on the road to trial strikes or i don't know what uh what what do i do next yeah whatever i don't know don't don't ask me that's a blue question yeah who tells us uh that's the end we're not
