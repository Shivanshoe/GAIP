[Music] welcome back to segaf sundays are good for it's been a little while hasn't it sorry it's uh we got what like two episodes into the series not my not my fault okay don't put this on me uh obviously it's my fault but it happened when i took a break little unexpected hiatus well and then i came back after two weeks so it's been like like five five months okay i don't have a good excuse but the important thing is it's back because we only did like two episodes but so many of you wanted to see some more and i think part of the problem was i tried to do too much in one video so for now literally this episode we're going to be opening fan mail because i have to catch up on some and i have nowhere to put all this and also i've been sitting on these for months and i've been dying to know what's inside of them um p.o box in the description box below if you want to send some stuff uh i'm thinking about doing some more irl stuff like this you know i'm willing to mix it up doesn't always have to be video game stuff it's up to you guys if well if you watch it and support it and that's really all that comes down to it but let's freaking get into it it's been so long so let me get this out of the way so it focuses sundays are good for wow okay you know i was debating just putting fan mail all over it because that's all we're doing today but it actually baron square landed on fan mail which is great because we're gonna do double duty to start because i lied i opened one gift what i might have okay i opened a few gifts actually i think about it but the point is move like build a sword and he went to the fudge hold on oh jesus hold on here's where i'd open it with my butterfly knife if it wasn't fake because if you don't watch the podcast what the fudge you doing gg over easy dude's sick when i'm doing i i fidget with whatever's closest to me and the only thing on my desk at the time was scissors and so for some reason i'm like okay why why do that why didn't i just fidget with a knife but best of all i can get one that doesn't have a blade because trust me i would have cut my hand off like eight different ways by now but i know one cool trick just one cool trick and it's it's like the basic most space check it out give me a second yeah sick right i know hold on watch this again right okay it's hard [Music] nope thank you [Music] that's why this doesn't happen all the time [Music] whatever okay look i'm we're learning anyway oh my god wait what the yo this is so much cooler than i thought it would be oh you guys don't see what i'm opening screw you guys look at this freaking tonto blade man you don't know what a tonto is clearly i haven't played ghost of tsushima or weeb like me it's the other blade a samurai would carry with them the smaller blade they'd be like why do you need a tonto blade oh jesus christ oh my god i'm gonna hurt myself it's a freaking tonto letter blade opener dude wow that's that's actually sharp that's pointed oh boy you done you done messed up now okay i'm not even uh it came with this thing oh sick it's a it's a sand i can figure this out i'm a gamer [Music] no that's upside down no that has to it's not even instructions because it shouldn't be this hard to figure out it has been assembled see this thing oh wait it's backwards that's some letter opener freaking tonto blade dude and it goes perfectly with my samurai sword you're like you have a samurai sword ah red and black steel must look like tanjiro yeah it's very it's it's actually extremely sharp i can hurt myself but check it out and then just like a samurai i got my katana and the freaking matanto blade dude yeah i'm gonna hurt myself and you know what the best part is this is what they used to commit supuku i can commit proper supuku i'm not going to oh yeah we weave now baby so the reason i knew it was letter openers because it says keep your gift a surprise unwrap your present before opening this envelope so obviously i open the envelope first japanese katana samurai scissors make scissors i'd like to think i know what scissors are this oh fudge like i said it's been a while i wonder if the receipt or whatever that went with this one the letter is jumbled somewhere because there's a mess ah fudge okay um if you sent me this incredible letter opener please this tonto blade please send me an email with the receipt so i know it was you uh but i want to properly thank you i'm so upset i don't know where it went but instead i got this uh dear missed fruit we saw these and thought you might love them as much as we do we have your content especially nuzlockes and new minecraft yeah the minecraft is coming back just like sagith baby keep it up stay healthy and happy from jackie and daniel thank you jackie and daniel what do we got holy smokers [Music] look at this like what the fudge you got the little katana blade ready oh yeah curved and everything oh they're nice and lubricated too you know what i mean they're real smooth like no wd-40 needed here this is incredible apparently just weave a clock here is this what you guys think of me i love it thank you yo between these and the tonto blade do what can't i open now more importantly stop sending me sharp things i should not be tr there's a reason i got a blunt butterfly knife well i know not to play with these what the fudge man this is sick it also came with the stand thing let me figure this out oh see that when it's on the ground it sits nicely and you can take the case off if you wanted and display your blade i got so many blades to display now thank you jackie and daniel yo big pogs i didn't realize we were gonna have like another letter opener technically sundays are good for whoa more fan mail you wouldn't say all right we got ourselves a big priority box paid 15 bucks for the postage shout out to you my friend um taylor powell i'm not gonna say where you're from but you are very close to my family very cool dude hey um i love carrie hilliards wait no that's not quite that's but you still probably know what i'm talking about you're fine the first opening with the tonto oh boy remember cut cut away from yourselves what could go wrong with this wait don't show the address i'm not doxing anybody okay all right i'm putting this thing down you can't see it but it's for the best so we're gonna go with the uh other staple pair oh yeah cuts like a real blade oh ooh red bubbles it feels like this is already opened so let me see yeah oh oh maybe not they're all they're all here waiting to be opened never mind look what we got baby came with the shaming the ex promo good old 20 anniversary sleeves looks like there's no letter or anything i think this end because right after i stopped recording i was putting everything away i realized in that pokemon generations box was the letter that i didn't see so adding this back in mr fruit did a dilly even put all infos public thank you just want to say thank you for everything you do for the community you've built over the years i didn't start regularly watching until ligma started but i have certainly watched a lot of your back leg for entertainment and to stave off the big depression i know it's not much and not a current box but i just want to send you this 20th anniversary pack i bought it back in the day thinking i would open it but i got distracted here five years later and i can't think of a better person to open these packs thank you taylor i'm sorry i didn't see it at first taylor thank you very much taylor and well let's see what we get i'm not mistaken this is like the the reprint of the base set so we're looking for that charizard of course all right first pack wait what this isn't what i was thinking of oh no what is this set why is jinx already here oh what the okay is that full art that's i don't even know i don't know what this set is but we got this look at that florida and kudo what's going on here i mean back to back bangers the hat they're two rares in this set or something oh go on then oh see that's like one of the original slow pokers though but see that's not cool gasps we are just not the original oh whoa jirachi with a crazy pattern thing on it it doesn't come across very well here but cool hollow effect and then that oh that's a rare too apparently i've never seen the set before i have no idea dp poopoo poopoo pp reverse hall haunter is pretty cool but now the double banger alert we did it we did it everybody charizard i have a feeling he's not as rare but it has that cool hollow pattern again and it's a charizard and behind it was we got swirlex reverse hollow and then just like this special hull which doesn't always have to be a rare and then a rare it's very strange i'm just doing the card counting trick so oh flareotti eggs look at all the eeveelutions they're all so cute look at my little jolteon oh oh shoot the back to back nine tails ex oh go on then we're kind of popping up this flareon art is no kidding sick we've got oh look at that holographic diancie and it we've got oh it looks good sylveon ex another eeveelution people probably feigning for these as always the new set coming up has all these alternate arts and they're going crazy and oh kangaroo with some nice hollow love the artwork this feels more like a japanese pack because japanese packs have like eight million rares i like how you can get like two or three another diancie inductor swirl eggs and our last pack what will it contain nobody knows oh no way okay we got another flareon x and oh tauros may not look like anything but this is the original tauros art oh that's sick not bad poles some sick artwork and pokemon in this sundays are good for woo fan just mail a couple over because bbd booth need to not dos dios it's just little manila envelope here my handy dandy katana scissors oh it's a good thing i stopped cutting where i was because i would have pierced something do we have here i don't know look at
