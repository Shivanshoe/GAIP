adventure it is legend psyops brand new this week i haven't gotten around to doing it yet and i figured hey i wouldn't want to do it with anyone else other than you that's right you i believe i'm getting close to being able to craft some of these new seasonal weapons so i want to get there and the new season things get us a lot of insight if we do this so figured out i should probably do it and you guys from time to time are like hey where's the pbe well it's probably three commenters over the course of like a while but you've been heard and you're gonna and you'll probably regret your decision to have me play pve you'll see remember to engage with this video like comment subscribe otherwise will smith will slap you all right yeah but some people might be into that zavala will grow hair on his head yep gonna he's gonna rock a bowl cut okay you know what time it is time for rage shadow legends that's right this video is sponsored by rage shadow legends raid is the first game to bring a true console level gaming experience to your phone that's console level gameplay in your pocket unless you have women's pants it's just like fake pockets i don't i don't even know what the point is they go so far as to it but they're not there's no function they're just they're just fashion but you know what is functional rage shadow legends explore millions of champion combinations and master countless tactics as you take on raid bosses dungeon runs campaign battles and pvp arena matches raid has over 600 champions blessed with unique abilities but personally out of all of those here are some of my favorite first up we have elder scarg of the barbarians look at this dude he fights for honor well and elder skirk specializes in taking down legendaries with loads of buffs let's not leave out for gum car a lizardman this would be fake this adorable pack monster is the king of the scarab king he also brings a car load of healing defense and even ignores enemy provokes dude literally blocks out the haters and who could forget astralon of the sacred order you see what i'm saying right do you need an explanation as to why this guy's sick well he also wrecks arena that's why combine him with the champion countless licks and it's pretty much over before it's begun and you know what's great about raid anytime is the best time to hop in and if you click my link in the description box below or scan the qr code you see somewhere up here probably cover my face you'll get a free starter pack worth almost 30 dollars now we're talking a free epic champion named ana 200

ztx mena from house fruit thanks guys give it up for give it nobody nobody you guys ever just destiny anybody also night watch [Laughter] sausage sausage saucer i don't know why i didn't use it bruh bruh bro i'm gonna show you wish we could quit i don't know why i didn't use this thing more before it's been fan freaking tastic dave got that curated roll the freaking what is it uh rabbit head explosive payload it's great it's great love it especially now that armor piercing is on scout rifles yeah this is like my go-to wells don't mind if i do not too excited about this match game though match came respectfully can suck my penis i didn't even feel like you know hiding that what the just jesus i'm popping off a light heretic that's against my religion i bear the light not you jesus christ everything hurts get reflected uh team uh any um any any dp ushers any got it i've got to go go go go come on come on anyways ooh light hoarder wait i need this for my challenge and well i'm here for that risen umbrella energy brother i need it stop stop i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm getting back you know what's the best about gujarat horn though it's like hey i need i need something for this in-game activity don't even think about it just put on just put on a good jolly horn that's all there is to it boom i'm gonna die mistakes i've made a few out there it is it's just that's the wrong thing it's just that easy ah wait i got it i got it bada bing bada boom does anyone else have armor piercing i don't know i didn't check i trusted my teammates was that foolhardy perhaps but that's i think that's something we're lacking in the world right now you know trust and belief in others we were so close to greatness right there oh toughest thing is trying to stay on track doing pve well actually no i struggle with that in pvp too right just kind of one seamless conscious stream of of thought but usually it's all over the place because frankly that is my subconscious that's how how i work oh yeah that remind i talked about pringles and banana well i don't either lazy stacks but i say pringles because more people just immediately know pringles i go lay stacks and some people like what and look hot take okay i'm just gonna say it okay i'm gonna say it don't hate me i look more pringles i said it there and i don't regret it okay at the very least their salt and vinegar hit way different bruh and like good way different no so yeah the whole food thing uh recently got put on adderall what is wrong with this dude what is his shield is this is this broken what it what the this has to be glitched what the my first legend psyops and i think the game's broken the fudge is going on i guess we all we just have to triple sword them even though i don't think that's how that's supposed to work it regens so fast everybody at once go go go ah it's that simple that's all it takes spamming it with three people not solo friendly by the way yeah so i've been on adderall and there's a side effect reduced appetite loss of appetite and i've gotten that side effect gotta tell you not a side effect for me because i have no restraint no willpower i eat too much frankly always have always well and so i've always struggled with moderating myself when it comes to eating because i just can't moderate but now adderall does that for me it sounds terrible and for the most part it is but i can eat like a third of what i used to eat and i'm like feeling bloated you know it's not even like oh that's i'm just like oof i can't do more and yeah probably not sustainable or very good long term but what i am eating is good because it's actually easier to eat what i'm supposed to because then in between i'm not craving anything because i'm bloated yeah the more i try and try and reason this and explain it to you all the more i'm really it's not it's not healthy but granted that's not i'm not saying it is all right just saying it works out for me and to be fair told my psychiatrist he's like any side effects i'm like yeah loss of appetite but that's not really a side effect for me it was okay you know i blame my psychiatrist if it all goes to i'm just kidding i wouldn't do that or would i neither here nor there right here vibin you know killing some hive as as what guardian does any guardians win guardian leviosa i actually want to rewatch the hero part here hear it hear it paul harry potter movies i've only ever seen them once and it was only a couple years ago right before the first uh fantastic beasts movie my wife's big and woman i just never watched them and i really liked them and frankly i don't know if you guys saw it that new sony state of play where they showed off a whole bunch like 20 minutes of gameplay for that new harry potter world the wizarding world or whatever gonna be honest looks pretty cool and it got me hyped i'm like hey i kind of want to like dive back in that world right now that that's quite the derailing but that's you know that's what i'm good at i'm good at not doing what i'm supposed to and if that were a life skill a desirable trait for somebody a job anything well sheesh brother look no further i need to grab a sword because is this thing gonna you guys got oh you guys got it you don't need me i'm not kidding you though holy cow i'm nauseous oh it's fine i'm fine we're all fine we're all fine i mean lace stacks and banana isn't the only thing that was a snack okay my breakfast was my classic protein french toast okay so i don't want to hear it but yes i think i'm going to take another swig of water here yeah it's it's it's moments like this that make a man what did um what did denzel tell will will smith during the oscars you know it's it's at our highest moment that the devil's gonna come for ya i don't really i mean i don't know what that frankly i don't know what that had to do with him hitting chris rock um and i don't know what that has to do with me being nauseous but it was just it just popped in my head yeah it's moments like this when i'm recording this video i'm like wow how did i go undiagnosed with adhd for this long like looking back it's painfully obvious oh i'm not looking forward to this last zone on legend though about to be a whole lot of death the show must go on you have chris rock and carry on the oscars after getting slapped out of nowhere i think i can carry on with the legend psyop recording even if you know a little baby throw up not entirely sure what you call it but i feel like there is a word for it but you know like when i called the baby throat because it's like you're sitting there you don't really quite expect it like a little throw up goes up in your mouth but you swallow it i call that a baby throw i'm sure there's other words for it you're probably what the fudge is this dude talking about yeah and if you're new to the channel [Music] this is this is me this is me this is us this is who i want to be i don't know what was i singing this is you this this is real what is that song this is who i wanna be i almost feels like it's a high school musical song although i don't actually know oh god you know what you know what you care about throwing up it's not the throwing up it's leading up to the throwing up because like nine times out of ten you throw up you feel better right it's it's the state of nausea that's what i hate and then i think the dreading the throw up but really when you like you think about it usually it's like dude just just just get it over with like let me let me throw up you know stick those fingers in there you know okay that's gross actually i have done that though once in my life and it was miserable i think i've talked about this in a moment of weakness a couple years ago i was lazy um was on my you know you know uh cooked chicken only protein diet miserable days and i didn't really feel like making a new one for breakfast so open the container in the kitchen gable get one of those you know and it's a little funky you know but a little slimy but it wasn't like pungent you know i wasn't like sheesh and i looked it up i'm like you know how to tell if meat's gone bad you know and it was it was a gray area i feel like it could have gone either way okay um yeah and so i ate it mistakes were made so realizing that about uh an hour later i thought okay i'm either about to have to deal with food poisoning for a long time or i try and just get that sucker out of my system before it's too late so sure enough went to the bathroom this is how desperate i was because i hate throwing up went to that bathroom hooked up different ways to try and make yourself throw up uh wait we tried some fingers right we try a toothbrush because apparently like the underside of a toothbrush or something really really gets it going i guess or something uh that didn't work ironically uh it kind of scratched my throat with the the toothbrush probably did it wrong and i'm thinking about it that can't be right or maybe i was being trolled too i should have been using a toothbrush i know neither here nor there it didn't work yeah i tried about three different ways just tortured for about 20 minutes and um i never threw up and that's the story when i tried to make myself throw up the end good news i didn't get food poisoning no so but you know kudos to me for well no not kudos to me i would i put myself in that position i was like well as well you know i tried against much my better judgment like generally there's probably nothing else i wouldn't want to do in this world but that's how committed i was to not getting food poisoning and then it didn't happen anyway one of the story kids is if you have to stop and ask yourself is this food bad the answer is usually yes and even if you're unsure just don't eat it right like that's just the buck stops there if if there's ambiguity then that's all you need to know just no don't do it sad thing too is the chicken didn't taste right either i didn't stop myself that's how lazy i was and just not wanting to make more chicken that morning yeah it wasn't my finer moment really you know i feel like i had an idea what we were going to do when i came in here and it was not going to be story time it's turned into story time as it always seems to do also yeah i don't know what i've just kind of been autopiloting i can't multitask this as well okay you know just freaking come here stupid stupid stupid easy god this game's so so freaking ergy god give me the loot i want the loot who wants the loot i want the loot no way oh jesus christ what was that what oh my god wait 1560 all right this is crazy because the reason i was getting risen umbral energy was to get another sweet star because peep it okay i guess well that looks bad one out of five yeah everybody's just like crafting the things because like i did the video on on peace of mind the pulse rivals like oh well crafting isn't really that hard if you just do this at this you don't think i know that people are like well if you you can eventually get it so in the hell you could just dismantle the first thing every week and get deep sight yes and when i made that video that was the first week it was available and you know what oh it's really funny i'd already encrypted or decrypted one engram before i got that upgrade that week so then i decrypted another one and it didn't count so i couldn't even get one that week okay what else am i close to anything else anything let's see what we got here what the fudge is this thing's name all right show me my explosive personalities we have no deep sight okay so not that one uh thoughtless thoughtless we gotta be close there right any no deep sights okay but well surely this oh wait wait wait wait wait wait recurrent impact any deep sights in it no deep sights okay but we're one off that's close okay well boom there's another insight i'm gonna go get some helm upgrades for my troubles all right well what can we get here see the first legend battleground you complete each week we'll drop an additional weapon armor item probably not going to count this week to screw me i need more risen energy so like probably these things i don't have enough what do i decrypt now i'll eventually get the machine gun do i go after the auto rifle do i go after the the pulse rifle maybe probably not the sniper yet what about these can can they come in this because here's the thing too everyone's like we'll just decode yeah i spent like 70 80 90 years of number of energy on weapons no no not at one deep sight but i'm gonna get one here i don't know okay well they just keep dropping helmets that's not nope that's armor that's that's still armor all right clearly they just misunderstood the mission and they're trash like what well i mean that's not it's it's trash i can craft it or something right well that was this video i feel like a fool i've been had the swindler was myself i tricked myself it's so jesus anyway i hope you guys have a great life love you so much see you soon hope you enjoyed the videos and if you have stuff you want to see and destiny or some other shooters or something let me know down below adios muchachos also don't eat rotten meat [Music] [Music] you
