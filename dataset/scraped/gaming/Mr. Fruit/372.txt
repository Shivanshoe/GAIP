heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and i know i'm not greeting you in destiny 2 with my character i'm breaking the fourth wall and quite frankly i don't feel comfortable i feel weird you probably do too so let's fix that ah much better much better now i can address you all i look much better this way anyway so the dead man's tail is a pretty cool thing we we saw some gameplay of it earlier when i used it it's freaking fantastic and has single-handedly saved this game for me because it's so much fun oh and i got the freak look at this catalyst boom done increased hip fire rate of fire and removes hip fire accuracy penalties that's that's right last word who am i right i got the roll killing win final blows grand increase mobility weapon range and handling for a short duration seems pretty good for pvp i know there are some other roles i people seem to think or at least told me i'm no expert that vorpal weapon is good for pbe but we we don't want that i'm here to slay in pvp and that's what we're going to do using the dead man's tail with the catalyst and it's only fair i mean at this point why even ads you know i need to be rooting to hit fire shooting cowboy so that's exactly what we're gonna go do let's let's get to it yo wait hold check this out chap check this out you won't believe it even if you see it your boys passed thirteen hundred past thirteen hundred thirteen hundred so that's pretty cool what's the good titan pvp exotic right now anybody let me put this way what's something i'm going to use i do like finished or sprinting we'll just go do marches for now why not right oh yeah oh oh yeah oh yeah oh yes also look at this look at this look at this mobile 62 this season i don't think i've ever been this high in a season without purchasing it okay we got the catalyst so we're going ye ha brothers look at you gilded region i'll see you soon no i won't i'm not killing dredging let's be honest all right so we i can i'm only allowed to hit fire and die hit fire and die so shake it from the top and try and get that capture but raids got it himself now would it make more sense to just abs here absolutely but i ain't doing that because look at that though who cares i'm a root to cowboy yeehaw with kill and win too they don't stand a chance hit fire hit fire hit fire hit fire that's right oh it's a scout rifle for range well what if i were to just wait a second wait a second who is what the [ __ ] is going on right oh you're friendly oh you're knocked up i'm just panicking everywhere right now my apologies yeah why he's a scout rival for range and ads'ing when i can do this and hit none of my shots in crazy bleh i don't know why i'm using a linear fusion rifle i'm going to be honest apparently i'm not glutton for pain or something here i go i got you wait what i didn't somebody stole that kill we're gonna have a little talking to here buddy old pal come on show yourself coward cat coward cow what wait since when does that no one shot body shot has that always been the case well linear fusion rifles stuck even more than i thought one oh jesus easiest game of my life anyway [Music] you know i should have tell them used line up i have no idea i was thinking about what i should have used and then my mind blinked i said it and it just disappears never mind i don't know what i should have used i should just keep using dead man's tail though with the catalyst you're gonna ads try and snipe me clean me up with a primary no i'm gonna hit fire with a big iron on my heel the big with the even bigger iron on my hip because the big iron it's a pistol well then brother i don't know what a big old room toot and i hate this i hate everything okay i've seen enough no no you're not all i forbid you i forbid you yeah i could not ask guys we were only supposed to we want too fast how am i supposed to get content with the dead man's tail if we went too fast come on fellas too fast is that a bad thing well my wife would say so hi oh i'm so sorry just low-hanging fruit all right it's big iron bigger iron time brother i'm so sorry for playing stasis by the way we got a precision kill i'm not activating the um cranial spinal cranial uh uh what's the name of the the first this isn't even fair cranial spike by the way that's the name of the the thing oh i'm reloading i'm dying listen i can talk about it i think i had okay i mean i really want to i really want to abs but also but also integrity use the catalyst for what it was born to do what the fudge just happened ow couldn't tell you the last time i saw a devil's room yo get me in on that i still have this stupid linear fusion rifle never mind what what am i doing what am i doing right now oh and i i didn't even use the ammo i swapped when i oh no it's all right you know when my when my parents birthed me they just forgot to spec into an intelligence so it's fine it's cannon all right i'm 80 acid i'm so sorry but i wanted it okay but now i don't have kds maybe i should that didn't make any sense my melee literally went through him can we talk about that but aside from that yeah that was great believe that killing wind i got the pvp roll baby you fiend you will not defeat me in my cranial spike oh he beat my cranial spike yo get slowed oh well stasis is fun isn't it you're dead i'm so sorry crystalline for a mission you gotta get information oh he's so weak come on yeah oh i'm greedy oh i'm greedy and it's paying off and i accidentally press the character button my bad should i peak that no would i advise anyone else to peek that situation no did i peek it though absolutely i'm actually going to go play the objective i know i'm feeling a little under the weather clearly but we're okay look at the pace on this menu they could not teach me in my stream oh no i'm so sorry enemy team no hip fire penalty just the way i like it come on now keep me with that sniper boy pick me with that sniper oh he died see like realistically i i should just be 80s in here because i mean it's like perfect oh line of sight to do so oh my god i'm built different i'm built different wait i'm just built different and so is this god this gun has single-handedly saved pvp for me because even though i'm possibly hating my life i have would you get out of my way sir oh save me because even when in the face of stasis and adversity and shotguns we still manage hit fire hit fire hit fire all i do is hit fire there are more than one of you though so i exit this fight bro ow oh my god is this friendly i hate this why the cell i'm ash bob and just like bro this melee is trash do i hate it because it just doesn't auto aim for me like every other melee yeah cause every other melee does it you know why does that one have to be the black sheep excuse me sir i'm the law around these parts here okay oh we got cranial spike we got killing wind uh i've got ice stasis in my face what it's not exactly is it okay i don't really know what his plan was there and that's a fatty dub right before i got kamehameha thank god there we go untold glory you've been awarded extra glory rank points points what do i have on here oh jeez oh that's why i got it what is this investigate cryptic notes left in the captain's lawn acquire cabal gold report to the war table where i don't use i don't use um grenade launchers not something i do should i i play more i'm gonna waste some gold it has to be done what was i about to do i don't know anyway we're going back in all right here we go partners now i could go down c with my scout rifle because that would make sense you know long range engagements and down sights but i'm gonna do it for the opposite reason cause i can hit fire oh my god they got an enemy hd 130 above and i already got a kill and i'm already dead so many people are unbroken dude it's not even cool anymore okay even though i don't have it just because i'm i'm too lazy to get max rank glory bro you kidding me you're asking a lot although am i gonna do it this season probably because i've decided one of my one of my missions this season is to work towards unbroken why because evidently i i don't know i have no self-preservation mainly that evidently i have no idea what that man was doing but it worked out in our favor i never thought i'd see the day i'm that's what that's what i get for ads and minus the fact that you get hit with a pistol because that's balance but you know whatever i've come to assist like that hit fire boy yeah bro respect the one i'm broken does take three seasons i've only done it once so it's a two season goal but like but like i'm working towards it this season and you just bro you ate me with a shotgun and you failed to secure the kill you make me laugh oh i barely got that kill because i'm cracked no don't ads mr fruit don't cheat because that's what you get when you don't cheat stonks oh stones help me help my stonks oh my god i'm kind of built different right now okay okay okay okay okay where did they all come from but my grenade actually killed him let's get it who is back here somebody's trying to take her obj and i don't be shady here i go yeah that didn't work i stand by my statement that i hate that melee so much guys level's 169 on the season pass well please sir oh that's what i meant to do oh jesus it's a firing squad bro good lord they're like raptors they work in a pack raptors are sick we lost b this just won't do i'm actually on like an insane valor win streak so i got to keep going oh what up um okay i don't know where he went but get him whack him but what the [ __ ] shut them down oh i killed i am here to say i can't see dick when he gets my own rule went against my own role why why do we have rules to follow them and why do we follow the rules to protect us they're there for a reason it's fine i'll just capture the obj it makes me a little sick inside gives me a little visceral reaction in my throat makes me want to throw up a little bit but man's gotta do what man's gotta do he lost his own beard we got a couple of rascals out here taking our objs oh okay i'm a degenerate yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry i actually didn't even wait i killed him with the shotgun i swear i didn't hit a thing with that shotgun but we're gonna take it and again i'm capturing the zone holy this must be the most captures i've gotten in destiny 2 in my life in one game too it's incredible yo move five minutes i'm not talking to my friend box move i i had the ads look at that point it was just the smart thing to do and i'm about to i'm about to sin i'm about to act up it didn't help but i acted up giving those horns alive you captured zone c you we're just playing ring around the rosie i capture this they go whoa yo can i cap this without dying probably not right spend all that i'm ready in one place kobe oh kobe kobe fudge it just falls short you know just the two of us we can make it every time just a tease you ain't nothing oh now what you think you're doing boy i got 80s for this though you know i do this man out here trying to embarrass me and he nearly did bro look at the stupid stuff just that get that this is the worst haven't i've yet to connect one may i have you had to connect one mainly lord have mercy if you're good with this your god teach me please because i make literal potato with it now watch this they're gonna rock they're gonna walk never mind i'm just not gonna finish that thought all right we keep capturing the zones i love what i'm saying they're gonna capture me but i'm gonna take it right back and yes i'm using the felwinters yes i feel dirty zone b lost but he should feel dirtier because he's just me unironically he uses all the time all right look at this look at this look at this crucible opponents defeat 61 since this weapon came out 61. you know what let me look at some like zone is this the guy that killed me let's see how many keep it up and victory is yours wait that can't be right only 69. it's nice well that's embarrassing okay but there's other people that probably have a lot more okay so he hasn't used it that much but you know i could have probably picked anybody else and had like a thousand that was an unfortunate specimen oh my god get out gun okay okay i'm gonna prove my point give me a second give me a second this guy has he's not using it this guy see 435 okay i mean that's not like but that's that's a lot more this guy has he's not used it this this guy this guy has he doesn't even show it that's how you know it's bad what about our teammates what do you have what do you have 352. you see there is in the hundreds how about you there we go okay just delete all the other ones this is the only one c dude a thousand one hundred thirty case in point told you a victory oh we won hey great stuff guys meow meow targets eliminated nice work [Music] you
