yeah but yeah he got a 2k no 3k yeah but we gave it to him you know we uh we're just we've been wanting too much and wanted people to feel better about themselves what is the point of this yeah it's like i always get baited when i walk in rooms like that i'm like oh this will have some good loot and then that's sure because nothing's in there and it's just like oh that one would not even furniture just yeah it was literally just an empty room also they're shooting to our right from the northwest oh i see him i see him okay just wait probably gonna come right at us right left yep to

is clear so we're just vibing right i want to be spooned yeah we just got to make sure no one can see a spoon first oh jesus oh there's some loot in here too hard metal and metals ready cartridge battery that's it notch i can't help but notice not scrap metal uh here's a strider head if you want got me so atmospheric all right my immersiveness i've always wanted to be stuck in a place like

that up hey nice nice nice let's keep let's keep looking how much do you need though how much do i need hey let's focus on you first well would you look at that what are we looking at i don't know but something very large is down here what is this marauder oh my gosh i don't know i hope you're doing well we're good we're good we're good we're just going to come this way secret wow that's loud secret tunnel it's really loud what's happening alone in the frick okay i'm out of there and i'm out of stamina yeah i'm going up the stairs okay all right oh yeah oh he can't he can't come up here he can't climb stairs he should be fine you can is it is it too complex for him yeah radio have you been in fruit have you been to texas roadhouse oh wow of course how many of those cinnamon butter oils do you think you you could eat like 20 in total i don't think you want to know the answer to that really well because i kind of do uh minimum two dozen minimum two dozen nice um you just want you back cause i got room for nothing honestly i'm down i got a full bag of loot uh i know we didn't get much done but that's all good all good that's gonna have runs like this happens we did get into a little bit of pvp so unless that was that last match i can't even remember now that that was going on so long oh okay yeah oh it's right here right yeah the swamp when you murk those two guys right uh well i'm oh yeah yeah and then you murk the guy oh and then when you mark the guy in the tower and then the storm came and now we're here right right there's like that was any moons ago uh let's just cut over to we'll go the one near water facility oh cute intense battle music let's do this so because the ship always leaves at a fixed time we could just kind of wait out here okay okay and then you know i like your tactics dirty but effective but it also does leave room for us to mess that up so now we got this we got this we got this on top of us good maybe see if anybody's coming to evac right yeah we just gotta keep our eyes peeled oh okay did not think it would land right here uh so far i see nothing nor do i yeah then yes i do captain you can try yep straight so not on my marker but getting getting going get it i'm getting shot oh jesus can you get it wait you're dead dead i'm dead dead sniper bolt action wait the ship left without taking me i was in it you were inside of it yeah and it just left you there yeah i just like phased through it it said sorry nerd you're stuck with us what so you're still in there yeah then i just hear him running around i'm gonna make him think i evac because i can call another one later i'm sorry ariel hey it's all good well i'm calling the ship we're committing yo well get it get out of there please don't kill me please don't kill me please don't kill me i'm in the ship maybe won't break this time okay successful this time hey there we go i did nothing different so the thing just left you there yeah like i'm not kidding i was just in the middle of it and then it just started flying and i just left and it's like nope [Music] [Music] foreign
