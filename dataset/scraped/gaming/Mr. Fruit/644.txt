wheel yeah no longer one of the 25 year old virgins in your parents basement hey let's go now you show the 25 year old virgin in my girlfriend's basement let's go you stole my joke goes back but that is why Rob has a new location Location much brighter too is it really yeah like you're actually getting my considering your previous installation was a basement so I was audio is I'm wearing a Tom Brady a game what is this stuff on stone on your head can you even hear us from I can't hear anything that you're saying this is a terrible life that's like about how just get some air pods yeah you couldn't just unlike air pods or well corded earphones but I know like that's like corded on my wall Oh as you say it was just like it was just like so I couldn't you say it'd be funny if he uh yeah I just went deaf and he's didn't realize I put the helmet on I was it that was you know was I I got you I was gonna say I was like Jesus how much would you have if he even sold those I doubt it yeah Tom Brady wore this in a game that's cuz Tom Brady doesn't sweat dude he's a he's a he's a he's a different beast well what a go past actually yeah let's talk about that real quick are you so you're gonna stay a Pats fan absolutely you know my dad literally say the same things like when you get in your Buccaneers Jersey I was like wait a second I was like do you guys think like I'm a Tom Brady fanner I'm a Patriots fan they're like you're Tom Brady oh no like that doesn't work but I'm you know I will die with the ship dude if we suck this year shirt but I doubt we're gonna suck we're gonna get like seven to ten wins maybe get the wild-card and then whatever whatever happens we'll see how this turns out about a year later gentlemen it must be so hard you like it oh no you might have a bad year I can't imagine what that's gonna be like man ah Jacksonville is just absolute shambles dude welcome to the club Rob this is how people were like talk to me whenever I complain about the Spurs having a bad year like oh that sounds miserable as if you guys didn't have the best team you must every year that's so but that's so sad I was like poor whatever when like the NBA season ended and I was like oh like it's gonna be kind of nice without sports for a little bit like kind of like dude it's I can now I'm at the point where I'm like thinking about watching Korean baseball that's one like I need something hey sorry man Japanese baseball is pretty tape stick dude my favorite part about it is they love the bat flips when they hit a homer and they just rolled the bat up in the air and like they've better baseball the we D like I was gonna say it up front baseball better baseball than we do I hate baseball anyway better baseball than we do I could not agree harder I have been to some baseball games and the only fun part about baseball game doesn't have to do anything with the actual base game yeah no one's paying attention no one's watching I never played it either I like the thought of like I made my way with the ball really fast and then somebody hits the ball back at me really fast it's just like not a good combo I played like with my brothers and like cul-de-sac friends like in the backyards and stuff but that was the extent of my baseball times and it didn't never really went well there was one time I was pitcher which I didn't want to be because of that very reason like that's terrifying cuz you'll see I'm so kidding well you'll see the few times where like pitchers just get decked like they send out the famous cool it beams and that ball back double what you just threw it easily so I was like pitcher well more or less I mean roids and he hits the bat that balls come back at me faster than 90 miles an hour easily yeah I was gonna smack me and I thought you're implying that the momentum is like carried through with the swing so like you literally double though you just add that well ninety miles per hour Plus this ya know we I was pitcher and I guess I didn't hear this this is how he tells the story I guess I didn't hear this apparently he said like because my brother was catcher and then one one of the neighbor guys was which brother Ethan okay when the neighbor guys was hitting and I guess even say they hold on like like don't pitch yet which I didn't hear is this old neighborhood that like yeah okay and I saw I guess he said something like well I don't like don't pitch jelly-like time out or something I didn't hear this cuz he's like still like hunched down I don't know what he was doing but I guess he had to like reposition or something I don't know and so I go to I go to throw him a pitch and the guy goes sets up his swing and in the follow-through to hit the ball Ethan had like lean forward and just the crown of his skull cracked open and he had to go yeah had to go get like 18 stitches or something on the backswing like the follow-through know the initial just though yes just go and yeah that was uh that wasn't gay so he had to go in I wanna say like 13 okay did you get in trouble I don't think so like honestly like there are times I've messed with my brother like I mentioned like I threw the rock whatever right like that was intentional this was not intentional I wasn't like he's not ready jokes throw the pitch it was like oh he's gonna take a back to the [ __ ] head and get cracked I I didn't still hear like the bat hitting his head dude he was like it was it really like like yeah well I was like it was like right at the beginning of his hairline on like that crown of the skull kinda yeah like yo yeah literally like middle over right there yeah and yeah so that's cuz it split open like like Omega or was it just like I was up and down but yeah it was like so it was it I thought it was gonna be just no not like that no no you could just kind of take his scalp off kind of just plus there's so much blood you couldn't see anything oh my god really oh I don't do good with blood is something like I can't do that's what I knew I couldn't be a doctor I'm the only time I'm not good with blood is I can't watch someone draw my blood they can draw my blood fine as long as I don't look yeah but if I look at them I like another reason why is I kind of like you Christian I have a similar story I was it was like I was must been senior year summer so like going into college and all my jock friends are like let's play field hockey let's play this and like one day I was like let's play softball at the at the field from across the high school remember how like it had that Park across and then I had that like baseball field was like let's go play softball there and I was like ok great and so we all go there and there's like 16 of us we split into 8v8 and I'm like I want to play the position where I have to do the least amount of work out feel like ok yeah he's going out feel like that possibly you can't possibly get hurt out there so I was like ok so like we go up and resell eeeh is up to bat and he like cranks of grounder dude and it gets through like the shortstop so like I'm like now I'm waiting for the ball I'm like waiting just kind of draw dee-licious he's hunched over in the back here we go it's coming to my glove and so I put my last second it it like hits like oh dude and like it pop up and like I had like a fat lip that was like two sores so embarrassing dude and then like that might have been I think the second at-bat and I just walked and there was like oh and I was gonna go through guys like I did I already have like I think at that point I had just got done with my Invisalign I had just gotten my to fake veneers in and I was and he was so embarrassing and I was talking to some girl at the time and I just had the biggest fat lip it was so embarrassing I mean that's I was like this port is so [ __ ] stupid seriously like the baseball games are cool to go to I think ok but I will say this about baseball games I think I have the most fun at baseball games like to go to more than I do it like a football game a soccer game I think more so because I'm drinking it's more socializing than it feel like there's more socializing than watching actually that's the stigma like at the known stigma about majority of baseball games outside of playoffs there's a lot of it's just like yeah let's go hang out oh they got like dollar hot dogs at the baseball game we get like four dog take it sick let's just go the baseball game cool stories what you got you played right no I think no no no I did play baseball maybe I have I think I figured out I have an internalized hatred of baseball and football because baseball is what caused me to play football because I kept tackling on baseball the only reason I played football is because my parents put me into it because baseball I would keep getting mad like when I got out so I would literally tackle whoever was on the base Hey first baseman come man yeah yeah Louie tackles [ __ ] some dude and I'm in my pairs like I always go to football I know I hate football so moral of the story is I should've just stayed in soccer does anyone soccer or at least I don't remember I might have so I might miss the I meant more so not the sports but we're so splitting you're playing someone else's head oh dude I've seen them I've see some bad stuff on a soccer field like a lot of bad injuries I feel like yours you could have done rugby blue that I feel like that's what it we just hit people but that's so not an a like you can't just go play some rugby like playing football over here mate I did have a friend I met in freshman year of college she played rugby and she played for the CSU rugby team like women's rugby team oh my god she she was more metal than I ever could hope to be and the stuff that she would like him I was like okay I thought I grew up like stuff her like I could take a hit she's like oh yeah just like yeah so and so just broke their leg again today but like they'll be bad like I got my like 20th concussion we she's got like huge bruises everywhere like oh yeah that was just like so and so just got angry and head-butted me like well that and then Claire's dad when he was younger played rugby as well he did he's kinda like seems all the slender kinda sigh well what I mean as most older people are well yeah I guess like he could he held his own and he would he played like semi-pro rugby I guess yeah but now his back like he's getting surgeries over and over and over again already did and then I guess a lot of concussions but I feel like that's literally that's rugby you just the only piling on his head the only thing I've really had was soccer was shin splints let's and I still get really I still drive and I had really bad flat feet so I'm supposed to wear like stuff that like curves your feet but I don't gel in mcallen what is that yeah it's like your foots best friend something like that but shin splints is all I ever really had in soccer you know I never got I got more injured playing just with friends than when I was actually playing sports I never really got into it that way but then as soon as I would do anything outside of like a sanction thing oh it's game over him I'm a mess although I had a broken a bone still I haven't either I mean I've broken my big toe yeah but that's about it I guess I didn't break it I cracked it so and I guess shin splints are technically a bunch of mini fractures in your shins so take with that information you playing a lot of technicalities yeah dude I'm just a technicality kind of guy you know that's what that's what happens when you're a soccer player that reminded many ways of getting out of this bizarre story I'm not gonna go too far into it but there's there's this girl in freshman year of college and she told me that she is technically a virgin and I go wait a second what is that he's got a way to say how are you technically a virgin and her explanation was he only went in a little and she's like so I don't count it and everything every time I think of like well technically a luyties yeah like I remember sitting there like so you saying you're not like that's I mean like there's no all right oh so bizarre me and she was dead set on saying like yeah no I'm she doesn't know about the the poop hole loophole figured it figuratively you added a few syllables in there I did all right what it's not this address oh oh do you have a review yes I good cuz I was gonna said what does this mean I've every from Jeff over here he gives our podcast 69 stars and that's very good interview so what you need to do is to print Kol is to combine the elements that make up call and squirt them through a tube into a coal shape the problem is that combining those elements in that way takes more energy than what is possible you can print a thing that looks like Cola printers actual coal isn't going to happen thank you Jeff for that incredibly Jeff you can't create more matter than the matter you put in what's the law of equivalent exchange number to see if you've watched Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to get on that dream dude I'm sorry I have just been watching my hero that's gonna say let me guess first episode for like I don't know 30 times now I just I got done watching it again after watching the past seven days in the [ __ ] I watch it in the shower I don't know why who like has a bad day you go in the shower and you just rewatch you just really watch you three watch like all my verses one for all all for one and I I'm jealous I wish I could rewatch stuff I just can't no like not even like my favorite movies there are some very few movies that I've watched multiples of like multiple times and by that I mean like three or four yeah I was gonna say like no tens are over and like the three or fours are like the Batman trilogy that's like probably my favorite I like the only ones I'll really rewatch but even then it's like once every other year every couple years I can't do it and I don't know why but I see and then I I'm the one who can't start something new like I want to start something new it's just that I feel like oh my god but there's so many new episodes and I create so many characters I'm gonna get like and then what if I want to get another tattoo like I don't have room for that like oh there's so many commitments I have to make here a thrill I get and I think the problem is I did give Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood a chance but that was like before I goes like actually trying to like that's what I was like so those are stupid I mean I'm watching the dubbed FMA it's not been yeah i heard of FMA he's actually not bad and it's one of the better sides of the dubs but then like it does it's just like I can't like I'm gonna get you like they all just sound the same but then I feel like when I'm like watching an anime sometimes I feel like I can hear a voice actor who's like the same and I'm like who [ __ ] is he like dude I heard his voice I swear to God I had my quirk I think I figured out what my quirk is you know some people just don't realize it but I think my quark is being able to identify people by their voice because that's like it manifested into your new quark yeah well that's my quark I I don't know what to do I can literally be sitting in there cuz like that you'll be like who is that I'll hear that voice and I'll immediately know like wait that's that that person is PACU go like yeah like I might not know like the actors name but I'll be like wait that person does that voice and I'll look it up I'm right every time I'll hear like a sentence and I my greatest I've ever brought like I was playing them the Wild West this a wild rest roguelike I made a video on the other day and I was hearing him say a little bit and I'm saying to myself like that sounds so familiar and those are equate a minute isn't that the guy that like plays Hellboy I've never even seen how boy by the way and evidently that's where Ron Perlman and I looked it up and that's why Ron Perlman that did the voice acting but then we rewind that to like any show Claire and I are and watching she goes who is that voice and I can milk oh yeah that's that's so so and she goes knows it not and she looks it up she's no my god it is and I don't know why I I can't remember faces I can't remember names but voices I don't know like you should do like I'm gonna do like a test at like fruit summit 2021 yeah 2028 looking great let me do it yeah we'll set up a voice thing where you'll have a blindfold I remember the last episode the mandalorian or the the episode that what what Teke Teke Teke Takata did what's his name bro how are you why why you talking to make an S here movie because when he made Ragnarok mr. fruit you calm down he made Ragnarok and then he made the last episode I don't you a Jojo rabbit dude look rien Johnson's a good dry he's not he's not Taika Waititi good what she's new Tyco y TT o see yeah I didn't even know his name Tyco white TT I guess I never like touches becomes mortal he plays the purple giant funny British guy in thor ragnarok right yes the voice right yeah I like that guy but he's probably the [ __ ] up Star Wars I hate him is it gonna be it better be Old Republic you just you should where are you why don't we have a public stuff dude I don't get it a hookers in to be like the pitch that easy alright guys alright I'm thinking I'm Christian representing the so guys I'm thinking another Skywalker saga and I'm like oh my god just Old Republic it's like that theme in the office they're like hey any new ideas and I go Old Republic and they throw me out the window Star Wars Skywalker series yeah I know I have faith like blue saying I feel like any time I'm hesitant and he's somehow involved in something I love it so I haven't seen Jojo rabbit I heard Jojo Ravi's really good Jojo Revit is tight not seeing that wasn't Scarlett Johansson nominated for like Best Actress in like that or like Supporting Actress in that movie and like another one she was in I need to watch it Oh Oh Thank You Stan psycho ATV okay we do I hope he does well man but like you need a series is one thing let but like a movie like you got two hours yo you like a boy we'll get Ragnar right okay with that I want you to tell me I want you to look at me and say before Ragnarok it's not one of the best my legs exactly thank you it's my favorite I love that yeah it's my favorite too how are you gonna I cannot go into the next Star Wars movie and say tell myself I don't think this dude knows how to do sci fi Healey redid thor ragnarok I I just still can't believe we're living in the time line where ten years ago looked like Star Wars like pregnant like nothing's ever going to happen right a suddenly Star Wars franchise is back and we're at a point where we're instead of like more Star Wars were like Berlocq stop people are like stop making Star Wars because like it's more like I got a Star Wars poster right here okay yes it's just that yet the the approach they've taken like I feel like they could have done yeah I just don't think bring you back that saga the way they did and then everything that it just wasn't the play anyway I guess we'll see where they go from there well I I'm so depressed when I think about it because I remember watching force awakens and I was so hype after the movie ended and I was like oh man the net where's this gonna go I get to live in a timeline where I get to see a whole new God Tyr Star Wars franchise that's better than the prequels well that didn't happen but we're not pissed about this ad breed you know what I love movies and shows you know what I don't love movies and shows that I can't watch because

AE a 12 I did some of my favorite dude those means yes I think like Elon was I hey like let's do the world a favor babe and can we name our kid this market well it's bad there's like the one where did you see the one was like um x8 however the fudge you say it like first birthday and it's just a bunch like the demonic like you're like babies running out of my favorite is like when Elon Musk and grime reprogram him after his first tantrum it's like a chick type and she's like okay because someone I forget who put this in our DMS but evidently this is like what they named it after and this is so bizarre so X is a part of the name X is the unknown variable apparently that's what that stands for the AE I don't know what that actually is or how you say that my eleven spelling of AI yeah it's my elven spelling of AI love and or artificial intelligence that a 12 is the precursor to the SR 17 our favorite aircraft she says no weapons no defenses just speed great in battle but nonviolent and lastly a is arc stands for archangel my favorite song wait I didn't realize that Grimes tweeted this like this is yeah this is the official just speculation no this is what really why why they named it apparently and gone by 12 it's just like Grimes is just Elon Musk is going through mental breakdown right now and I would not have expected them to name them my favorite can I expect the name but they're gonna name their kid like Kyle right so it's like hey Tim my favorite move is like it's like it's like Elon and like another kid like a teenager kid in the car and it says dad watch my brother's name xae a 12 it says because your mother's like abstraction and Fox are deenis and it goes thanks dad and it goes no problem pickle Rick well I was so I'm curious well how do you guys think this is actually pronounced like what's your guess coz coz coz coz you aren't actually tweeted at how it's actually pronounced I if I had jaw 12 ax j 12 a sigh 8 well as Isaiah as I as I age I know I would try and say it I'm assuming the X I just assume like Chinese names we have like that it's usually jaw like Shia yeah so so she's Christ so so the name is apparently people have gone through like the meanings and apparently as simply as they could put it if the the human rrrrr classic are Homo Sami and under are homo sapien understanding is referred to as excess Archangel X that's how that's like or what's it it's middle okay so what I see is that it's so it's that and then musk or is there a middle name after that or is that the full name then a middle name and then a last name or is that the full name then last name you know I mean like is that X is the X we're in the world the beginning II middle atoll s so AE is a Latin ligature of the letters A and E that is still used in some languages today but in early English English it translates to ash a 12 could refer to a specific type of aircraft the Lockean a 12 which has the internal codename of arc angel this would make sense given Musk's fascination with anything automotive and aviation related plus Archangel bears a striking resemblance to the title of Grimes 2015 album our angels which would give the name a special meaning for her as well basically these guys have it covered on just about every single frame you could possibly imagine thanks art Kane no I really like can you imagine that like yeah first lesson yeah ex ash arc angel like sorry how do you okay so like ex and then there's this Latin word it's like a any combine and they like you gotta think and I don't mean to call it is it a boy or a girl I don't know I feel like this is I feel like sex ash Archangel is pretty something you necessarily yeah they actually gave birth to just an AI it's actually just a computer I don't know do you know blue what do you know if it's a boy or girl it's a boy oh boy yeah like my favorite thing it's like wind crimes in elon take the particle a refute er away from X and it's like Superman flying in the sky like lightning striking him and it's like his first tantrum so funny okay this might be a little out there but I'm just gonna say this one I didn't know Elon Musk was married he's not as his girlfriend okay I didn't know he had a girlfriend I didn't know he was expecting a baby nonetheless and I've never heard of Grimes before this well Grimes none of that he did like she tweeted like a picture on Instagram or on Instagram I should say and it was like one of those artsy like things it was like her like with like water coming down and then like in the body you could see like like a fetus or something and she was like expecting and Mike Elon was like [ __ ] yeah like it's like here we go yeah yeah they're weird though they went to like the Met Gala or something like that and they looked really weird I think well like I've never heard of Grimes before either like I don't know who she is she makes Mike music that's that's fallacious in every way shape or form she was she was a huge independent artist one of the biggest for sure and it's just kind of jarring that someone like her is because she's - she's like Elon in her like total opposites but they're still both pretty weird so like they're weird opposites it's pretty crazy how they I still don't understand anyway apparently she is according to her Twitter 75 years old it's incredible yes I mean have you ever seen them together sometime together yeah like in elven years probably or some [ __ ] yeah it says elven technocracy that's her that's her bios it's just that dude he's from like the futures he's not from this planet maybe she's not I don't know she if eon is it then she's definitely not crimes is just [ __ ] weird but that's what makes are so cool I don't know how to describe it I mean I don't think I've heard a grime song along if you've been to me in AB stream you've heard a grime song yeah oh did you see the picture that he tweeted of the baby though he put like a snapchat filter on it and had like the face tattoos is so funny I gotta find that how long have they been together maybe they're quite a while now really I want to stay sane together is I want to say like several years at this point I don't know how long they've been together quite a long time I think interesting yeah and then he like tweet he's like I'm gonna own no personal possessions no more homes and I was like word Elan I'll take it I got 20 bucks here hey Nate I'm with him dude you know my heart crap mine mine are hardcore minecraft sir I still don't have a house I'm with him dude so they tied us down [Music] they've been together longer but they don't have any date but yeah look at that picture that's how you fish with I was like what am Lord this [ __ ] with those with eyelashes are you have any I do you have any investment in Tesla mr. fruit like actual investment yes no I certainly hope not cuz after what he tweeted like a wig what did you stop tweets I starts to hi man okay down 10% yeah why is Tesla stock so high like it's way too high and then it went down 10% that reminds me went in it went under the Joe Rogan podcast and smoked that blunt and it went down like that day went down like eight or nine percent stupid I guess I can understand cuz you're literally the CEO of the company going is like hey you guys are over valuing this what do you do take his Twitter away well he's another e's an alien so what can we expect from good for him speaking of I guess aliens and weird people and AI you can customize your cyberpunk wiener apparently what does that game actually come out now isn't it September really something it hasn't been delayed again since its last way September I thought it was coming out in July I thought the thing was like not a lie okay your hopes up I can't customize my wiener IRL so you're goddamn right I may customize my wieners I mean I need to fill mine like put some socks in there I need the September 17 how else am I going to obviously haven't seen those ads blue that promise you you need a little extra you know I'm saying that's we'll see the interesting thing though is like women at least breasts customizing is nothing new there have been games where you can like customize bust size but we've never had certainly somewhere where you can mess around with you bulge I said like I don't know you could oh that's true you could make but see like I don't understand dog but see the thing too though is like cider putting about nudity so like is it straight up like just gonna be your dong they're like and it's like yo you want to like correct your dong like go for it or like sorry phone's gonna have crazy I mean I mean it's a man it's a CD Projekt RED game like what are you you're not gonna get banned it's just what a CD Projekt RED made before which the Witcher the would chat but I mean cyberpunk clearly you're gonna be there most and I haven't watched The Witcher that's kind of fun what possible to you're whittling like I said man I can't just kill valleys or plenty except this isn't even an anime anymore cuz normally this is entertainment it's to entertainment you're missing out you know like last night I think I started the office again like what am i doing I'll see for me it's just if I already know what's gonna happen in something then I'm not my focus is elsewhere I have something to ask you oh you recommended the new Westworld season for me to watch yes now that it's over I will say ironically one of the week episodes might be the finale but that way it still wasn't that bad but overall I mean there are some bangers in there and a lot of people are like I don't get this like two or three episodes into the season yeah I like literally like wait one or two more and like episode four or five they pretty much not even subtly they're just like this is yeah like this is what we're talking about and some of them are no I think was a great season and did you watch it blue world yeah the new season well I recommend it I think it's really cool I'm gonna be interested to see what season four is gonna be though because for the most part it felt like season one and season two were leading up to season three so now I don't know like the future of the series's is a more of an unknown right now so it'll be interesting to see what exactly an ER was before like well yeah like we kind of knew sure like new eras going or like okay they're coming like Dolores or whatever the AI they're trying to do so and so but now it's like and I can't say much like giving it away but it's just like okay where do we go from here it was like oh what was that ask on well that's cuz it did this court like there's like that joke what was it like March when the quarantine kind of started like flew by but then April everyone's like why don't this month end but for the most part it's just like it's just day after day I lose track dude I don't know I just lose track of the days now like every day just like blends together yeah what are we the only the only way I knew what day the week it was was how many days since or until Westworld so now I'm just gonna have no I have no date is it's over is it it could be whatever I don't have schools like I don't have any way of like dictating my days how many days consecutively have it played halo see mine isn't mine is like turnips mine are like okay I can't buy turnips today so like today must be a weekend or like a weekday it just is today can i buy tarnished today no okay not Sunday that's all is we can roll that which either Sunday not Sunday I respect that so it'll be interesting to see what exactly they're talking about as far as customization and I'm gonna be honest in most games where they offer that like super deep character customization usually it's too much for me and I'm like I just want to play half the time I just click like randomize until I'm like that's fine and then I play like I know some people get crazy with it but for me I'm probably gonna be like oh that's cool that you can do all that okay okay except just one clip of like a streamer and she makes like a character in Final Fantasy and she like puts it over her face do it oh yeah our big copy of like come skin it was so weird you know what I'm talking about right yeah I've seen that one like you see that or like people like with fallout 4 I remember that came out people just only do like character guys me like look I made shrek and fallout or like people let's just go like super in-depth and when I got that I was like oh cool drop jawline yeah sure okay like give me much like a scar I bet ooh oh wow but like it's like your nose bridge how much do you and I'm like I can't tell different okay well it's like animal crossing with like the little design feature thing like where it's like you can draw and stuff like that say I cannot do any of that so I'll just import those kittens I guess the real question is below how big is your cyberpunk Wiener gonna be like really RP into like the character I'm making yeah so I gotta like micro you know what I'm saying he's like a dick like just a huge like [ __ ] [ __ ] character and like his weakness like the like the like the drawback is that world you just got a micro like grain everything go around blue so I just I just go rubbing a total [ __ ] on cyberpunk and it's just like yeah but micro you got all your strength because your testosterone rolled to the rest of your body because I feel like that I mean honestly as a joke that's might what I do because I have a feeling that one should be like how big can I make this like that's pretty meta if you do like the micro - if I make it smaller - that means whatever scenes are Nate nude I'm gonna have to see a less [ __ ] like so maybe that's better so funny dude who's not gonna see this watchman thing slinging around in midair all the time movie still gives me PTSD and the fact that Zack Snyder was like they didn't let me do enough blue penis what we call avatar watch my scared you that much huh oh just like it was just so funny he's like yeah like what you saw in the movie was like 30% or so I'm off like what I originally wanted with the Manhattan penis like I've never seen that it's good there's actually in the news too now but now I want to see it for blue penis hey who doesn't you know I mean hey there's plenty of it don't worry where's the director's cut I think that's what he there was a director's cut or something what I still didn't have all the blurry minute it said 30 minutes of more blue penis yeah that's the blue penis cut like give it to me a walnut blue penis there has been some news though gaming whines we got a good bit here we have a peg season 5 announced with a cinematic obviously a new character I thank you blue and I saw the cinematic but I guess you haven't have you how are you like how is it somber well no because I haven't seen the character I just saw like the law so you didn't see the other like yeah we found him and she's like I'm pissed yeah so like I was like why didn't this show any gameplay so I guess I missed it well they still haven't showed gameplay but it was like a cinematic version and it like alludes to some of the stuff she does and it essentially looks like Sombra she's like I'm surprised so fast I thought it would weigh like in like 2 or 3 seasons and be like Oh remember this chick from the rats well I thought - I thought they do like maybe two characters between the two and it keeps more relevant than yesterday I don't know oh yeah she uh she pretty much look she looks very similar to somber from overwatch she has a teleporter she throws she tell her wares to it she's a loot goblin so apparently she can apparently she can link loot from a distance tight yeah the trailer they showed it she literally just you link to loot from a distance and then I guess in her dad of mine she can like actually see Lou from a distance and like pick which one she wants or something along those legs that she's a thief for whatever yeah BC get your ol is like you're on one side of the map and you can like see where weapons are something like ooh I want that gold one I'm not sure but I'll be imagine something like that just I'm sure there's like a limit to how far she can join Clute from yeah that's super useful in general like even I can last circles we're like you need something it's like oh well let me just see what's in the area and oh you like it that would be tight one is the season come out um like go to week a week or two something like that I'm sure but apparently uh skull towns gone rip rest in part but I guess whatever's happening I was reading something where someone's saying like skull town's gone it it got a tilted treatment so it's probably for the best though because now I'll die less there I meant to mention this the last podcast we did because I forgot fortnight stays undefeated in events I actually had to redownload you actually actually like win yeah I saw it's not yeah me Benny in the song we were like I damned a man you were drinkin like what yeah he's like Ukraine I was like no I just went to the Travis Scott show and then I had like and then if vote is funny is when we laughed like the show and when the show ended Benny text means like get home safe man like that was a big it was really funny but they stay on defeated man that [ __ ] was so sick I meant to mention that but when we got to the wolf or that part like yeah no I think they've they're still above and beyond and the well and I mean we've typed better like the way they do it in the pace I mean it's just not not feasible for any of anybody else to really do yeah I forgot what like the exact like numbers that they had it was something like 49 million players were like online like the first show happened or something like that whatever it realized apparently there's something like a hundred thirteen million monthly Minecraft users did you know that 113 million something like that surprising but even still though that's like I know minecraft but that's that's a lot which I guess if you but I guess have you talked about thing about like all like just the younger kids - like who cuz like literally like for me like if I was growing up now that would be my like oh like instead of hundred for slaying with Legos I would just play in Minecraft cuz you need to buy Legos you just go on minecraft you have infinite Legos yeah you'd have to step on him you don't have to like ruin your fingernails trying to like get to a part you remember that do that was terrible I think minecraft will always be relevant purely because you have a constant stream of people who grew up with Minecraft introducing their kids to more minecraft and that's just gonna keep on happening just because video games or computers are gonna be even more omnipresent and it's not exactly a hard game to run yeah and what's the first game you want your kids to play you don't play GTA what like what like what realistically like what game can you say this is the first game I really want my kid to play it's not gonna be me I'm not over here like yeah alright so we're gonna start you off with gta5 alright so we're gonna show you the strip play like this is where we're starting alright searchview minecraft there's no consequences throw them in creative mode and you have now my kiss I start an art course they'll learn like what are your kids on like have you thought about that like cannoli nothing gang for life what do you mean well [ __ ] PC they're gonna learn dude see I regret I regret I regret all my natural skill being on the sticks cuz now I'm gonna Smee do ker mouse and keyboard player for the rest of my life I didn't learn how to start doing mouse and keyboard I was like 20 21 okay so I'm never gonna be good at it because and this kids just [ __ ] goaded on this kid's gonna be goaded on the mouse consoles blues kids you know we have we have a we have PS 11 sorry does this thing yeah look how am I supposed to know what talk to me right now in it pretty sick yeah I just have no idea what I'm gonna store naman I will say I think I'm excited for new consoles purely just for the new games that will be coming to PC because of the new console even though we're probably not gonna play I mean I'll get the new PlayStation but probably I don't need to get the new Xbox cuz all the games need to come to PC true so I'll get PS 5 but we say sir wait what are we on right now ps4 right no PS 6 yes yes no but here's for you play yeah so the new ones PS 5 yes I can't remember ok so I'll get the PS 5 and then the Xbox what do they call this on the xbox Xbox X xbox Xbox one X no but that is that it I can't remember it's so confusing it's the Xbox one X which doesn't make sense no it's not Xbox X they could see at least at the very least PlayStation I go wait a minute okay for okay so five but this one hour thanks Fox series X yes maybe that's not that hard it seems like they go in the way of cars or something yeah I don't know like just keep it simple why didn't you just go 720 and this could be 1080 that would be lit like I'm kind of glad 20 and then you go 1080 that's it no 4k because if they did today that would be the problem people would be like oh it only does 1080 well my PS 5 does 5 destroyed yeah no I'm just excited cuz he got like God fall coming out that'll is that way is that PlayStation exclusive what's God fall I think we have a lot of it they showed the trailer at the Game Awards I guess third person it's like a third person a RPG think like Diablo melee yeah we don't really have all the info on it but I have wanted like a real third person a RPG for a long time if people like but you are the third person in Diablo and it's like listen buddy I'm not trying to play I'm not trying to see the top of my character's head the entire game right yeah this this is more this is like third-person camera not top-down like a traditional a RPG camera isometric yeah I don't really high summit isometric just doesn't grab me I just don't like feel like I'm playing the game I don't know how to describe it yeah it like third-person it has to work for the game cuz if you're what you're trying to go for is immersion isometric doesn't do it but the but we got like games like that and these new games that I know a lot of studios have been waiting to release because they've been waiting for new Jin's or whatever which just means new stuff to play everywhere ideally PC or at the very least with Xbox so but yeah I'll probably get a ps5 but yeah it's so weird like ps4 like I was so hyped for that but but now I think you're next yeah next console cycle though it's like I'm no longer a console man you know we like we we have what people will be getting ps8 like PS 5 gets s SD cards and like somebody like pc and former was like welcome to 2012 it only took you in nearly a decade come on it's not that cool they're like we now have USB 3.0 just not uh other gaming news did you guys you don't have to say what the leak was but did you see any last of us to leaks I only heard that they were out and about I didn't go looking for him I didn't see any I'd rather not but I'm not like I like the game I'm not like a die-hard like I love this franchise game I think like blues Stan like I'm not as Stan as blue when it comes to this did you see any blue oh uh okay see any what did you see any last of us two leagues I'm not like a Stan I think last of us was like one of my favorite it's still one of my favorite games but I'm not like see I'm the type of person who believes this game did not need a sequel at all no I don't think I don't think it needs a sequel so I'm still excited but I'm not so I'm not coming from like a stand perspective I saw the description of the leaks Oh see all the leaks so I did see what happened you know the details of what people people thought it was an employee that was like disgruntled or something but apparently not that no apparently it someone apparently hackers had found like a security breach and like an old Naughty Dog titles which allowed them to get into Naughty Dog's servers or something along those lines where they found a bunch of stuff you know that they could take from it and uploaded Internet I see no any of the leaks I've read about them and kind of like okay this is some pretty serious spoiler stuff so don't worry and I was like well now you have my attention you know I'm about to I'm about to mess around all I know is that people really don't like the game the game story at all right from the lease they're like what is this yeah they're like what what is the story and why why did this need a sequel and I would probably honestly I feel like if I read the leaks I probably have the same response because I don't have like I loved Naughty Dog and I hope this game is good but but you got it it's one of us it's like it's like Toy Story it's like Toy Story 3 right Oh toy story toy story 4 turned out great which so we didn't need it because picks it but we didn't need it like I don't have I don't know how to describe it like when something has a perfect ending I no longer have an affinity toward that series like I'm done with it so with Last of Us I hope it's good but man if it sucks I'm not I will rip into that game yeah like I'm the last one dude I have affinity toward Last of Us I have no affinity toward last one - yeah like with the way it was so well-received and the way it ended was doing a sequel you're more likely to mess up the franchise than you are to like advance they're like yeah put it into place like there's only so much in doing it so I agree with that I haven't seen any leaks but like same way that like I talked about I can tree watch stuff I try to avoid spoilers for things because if I know stuffs coming up or happening in a story or something that yeah it can ruin it for me like the one of the only things that like one of the only times where I'm like oh I'll look at leaks was like Pokemon cuz for me nothing matters like story or something yet right it's just like yeah let me look at these new mods what do they look like ok that looks pretty sick that's really about the only time I ever actually will be like Oh spork like not like behind storyline or well yeah if they're like oh yeah possible poke me yeah like of Galactica's so I'm like ok I don't care I do Gary I do read and I have tried to read if there's like destiny leaks I do read those as well but that's just to get my hopes up and then to not have any bad delivered so do you think those destiny two leaks are real I don't think we talked about that did we on 4chan or those real kind of we mainly briefly doesn't it I hope the real enemy may be some nuggets of truth there oh yeah I think we talked about it cuz there's like the shadow or darkness subclasses or whatever oh that's right so I can only help Jessie but apparently Bungie it's somebody tweeted or something hold on I think like Paul tasks or something between them look at you being a little journalism making sure you're not misquoting and yeah oh okay wait well evidently there's something new here them with yesterday's victory worth double points it is now locked in that tightens when the Guardian games let's go well if you're really upset that tight okay I'm looking if you're upset that tightens one Guardian games please oh no why are we talking about d2 not like this bro just please be upset I mean I made a like a troll video about it just because we're people tilted in your comments and I really I know most people were like yeah we agree but that I wanted to make it just because I think the people that are like so upset about it it's hilarious like there's nothing to this this is still arbitrary it's bizarre okay I'm trying to see the where he I just wish it was like real or like oh destiny to director says in quotes you are not prepared for what's next oh my god no because a so like you're not prepared for this because what he's what he's meaning to say it's like oh you think we're gonna change from a bounty simulator no we're doubling down on the bodies and you're not ready for this I'm like they got me again don't watch it like geniuses like these guys know what I'm doing did you see those did you see the remixed Guardian games by doc you see that like there there's like the realistic guarding inside just do it and then when someone's talking it's like like each class has to show their prowess with and then it's just like you look like a computer voice bounties in this extreme bounty simulator okay it just goes all thing what it Garden games really is but of course there's some more Destiny's we have some more video game news that we'll get to after this ad break oh hey guys once again this podcast is brought to you by Harry's now if you guys

that's because we are and forever will be the best podcast that's true eighteen twelve pioneers used to listen to these babies for days ranked omegle wall that's what blue has written down here bell ringing Omega Lowell I will say a little Valerie we're talking Ballerini um I'm not gonna play ranked that game see the thing about Valerie is you need serious like I don't see us goes tight but you can you could frag on your own in csgo and valor it you do not frag on your own you literally need especially in ranked when like people are like working together more I'm only good you know just like you don't just like get a pic then you're like let me get a pic alright let's go in it's more like okay I need you to set this flash sage you're gonna put up a wall to put us over it looks like no one's there alright we're gonna rotate to a okay we're gonna need a flame wall over here and there's a pic right let's go like like it's good time hold up I like csgo a lot more and it's not even close I'm gonna say valor is not gonna kill see us go at least for me I don't think like ever gonna kill csgo yeah no csgo I think they'll coexist but she only cogs there yeah but I think it'll be if it ever does it'll be a long time before it overtakes it because I mean game's not even fully out then they're doing the grassroots eSports scenes first then they'll do that like csgo is what like 20 years on it or something so I mean it's it's it's not a magic it's come out valve has been like kind of throwing like ooh we'll throw you get this new scope feature Oh the creeks nerfed and like just throwing all these things and it's like oh now because valor in sout you finally saw her horns start uploading the game which hopefully it goes to source 2 that would be very sick I see that's why I competitions good it's forged well they're saying they're saying that after the Brazil Rio major but they're gonna announce that source 2 is coming to csgo at some date what is that I don't know what that means so so right now the game plays like that engine and source 2 is like what half-life 2 I think was made on and I could be wrong but like it could be like that sort it's just their new engine valves new engine software new engine is there half-life 2 inch and then doing things that v 2 engine is the one we're currently playing that's like that's like 17 years old or something so that's there it must be that then okay so hopefully that up UK's yeah that would be very sick because then my skin's would go they go just on the up baby all I know is I put two games of rank Valerie and I was like bruh this is rough right yeah I play with like - well we were gonna play with jazz and we go it's like why can't we play and Jesuit only played nine valor in games ever like I didn't realize the times I'd played with him were the only times he'd ever played so you have to go he need to play eleven more and I got on already play ranked some I'm sorry dude but like it's not hey yeah like I'm not gonna spend seven hours to like just a be lightly odd we're gonna go play right I'm sorry chat that's my day yeah like that's what we agreed I like if it was like one or two three games maybe yeah all right but not like seven to eight hours No I'm gonna go play Minecraft a test case which I did and it just wasn't going well or I don't know I'll I'll try and finish but like maybe two we were doing it too soon I mean we were playing bronze like they were bronze and we were getting just destroyed I'm like what is going on and then I go to streams and see like these random people in platon I'm like how are they plat I was like yeah we playing in bronze like yeah I placed bronze to pretty embarrassed but like see I don't even I don't know maybe we are bronze I don't know but it's show strange like we were playing and then but and then we played some silvers and destroyed them and I was like how does any of this make sense uh yeah but I don't know yeah it's just like it kind of making it yeah when I said it was like when Valerie came out - it's like with most games can I make content on it yay nay depends on like how much I'm put into it and valor and certainly isn't doing much on the channel and most people are like this is really boring to watch so that yeah initially just kind of like I enjoy the game and I like to play with friends but like it's not something I'm just gonna grind or no I'm not yeah like as much as I improved that's probably as much as I'll like actually commit to like I gotta get good at this mm-hmm instead I've been just I went back to TFT and I was grind and ranked have you did hit dive in no congratulations I didn't percent I did it I am the 1% up one it's like one point six percent or something and if I go to diamond 3 it's I think it is like top 1% because once you get up to masters I think that's like top top point point zero five something like that and then challengers like point zero zero one whatever you have to play so much deity delegate challenger that's like yeah well if I even want to get data back to masters do like the grind from the ground from platfor to platanus for me but then plat one to diamond for was a nightmare cuz it was like quit early I think you can see it on like a website from my e low literally just like I'd be like plat 150 LP plat 250 LP plat 150 Bell Pete plat to field like what are we just up down up down I would fall into plat 275 LP I'd when literally it was like I'd fall win this game yeah I'd win that game every time as soon as I hit plat to back in the plat 1 lose twice go back to plat to win go back in the plat 1 and I'm not kidding you I was there that was a loop for like 50 games and I was like I'm losing my mind too but then it's just everything I knows a liar what was the pushin well so the the new patch came out which is almost why I didn't play cuz normally on new patch is like yeah new patches are usually like alright well might as well just tank like here we go let's lose everything and I just heard of this new comp they'd had just been getting picked up and I was like screw it I'll try it whatever like I got nothing to lose I'm always suck on patches and it was called the Candyland comp and now it's considered a but with another one like the best comp but no one knew about at the time ok and I was just hearing about it as art whatever I'll give it a try and it was yes they call it candy land because Poppy's the carry and poppy has this terrifying it had like a rework but she has this terrifying like Candyland kind of skin and League in fact I'll try and like link you guys the picture of before it got reworked cuz it was literal II know but it's literally just like signaling like back to those days yeah that was the literal art that's not like yeah that's not like fake art that was the art for I think it's sweetheart or no what oh yeah it's called lollipop II yeah terrifying yeah so it was called ke Lancome no it's much better well she also got reworked which helps well now so this is the skin now much better much less terrifying I don't like yeah that was kind of like a callback to the butt so it's you hyper roll papi Leona Twisted Fate and Zoe and that's like your mein kampf like you don't level at all like you only natural XP you try and hit whatever you can early but you're not rolling well you don't roll yet and then right after crog's oh yeah you're you're 18 out of 20 that was like that one strap but you're well that's why I like people are some people are happy some people aren't because hyper rolling hasn't been a part of set three at all but then they nerfed it or they buffed level one two or three s and then also yeah and how often you find it so when you're level for it right before right after Craig's if you haven't leveled it all your 18 out of 20 so this is your last chance at best odds and you just roll and you roll to see if you can hit and so no one knew about it at the time so I was hitting like every time I was hitting Tier three Leona tier three puppy Tier three TF and Tier three Zoe and then you build the super defensive items on Zoe they're uh poppy she doesn't die and then you just build AP and mana items on TF and then you build into like vanguards or sorcerers but you just let them carry and I was like I couldn't I couldn't not get top four I was like what's going on and then like six games in a row I was water like yeah I was like alright screw it I'll try this and it was like second third first second first fourth I think I got sixth once and I was like oh dollar what I was like four LP off I was like I would really just have to like top four and I got top four is like I put my hands in the air is three in the morning there by the way but my hands like yes I was like dead inside doesn't I can go to sleep like I did it and since I've played I played three games top forward and two of them but now it's a debate because I said like if I get diamond I'm free but now it's like well now I could get yeah but like now maybe Matt early diamond - diamond ones so I think as soon as I hit 0 LP diamond for I'm gonna you'll stop because I'm not going back to plan I'm not gonna do it I can't dude oh yeah cuz I look I I didn't realize I played like 160 ranked games this season TFT yeah and I was like dang it doesn't feel like yeah sounds like like I showed that stats like that's meant like that can't be right but then I kept losing you you've roughly if we're going by those stats well no you've spent at least 80 hours playing ranked in TFT alone 80 hours maybe I'd probably say cuz like if you don't talk more games yeah but like if you don't top four sometimes you can be out in like 20 minutes sometimes if you win if we go up to 40 Gordon by the time you got the diamond you know and that's why I feel about TFT I played three games he I'm like it's 6:00 in the morning well I was only gonna play one it was like after a Minecraft stream and it was already like 11 o'clock because we all play one TFT game and I did that comp and I was like why is this so good and why did I win so I was like alright well no one knows about this I'm gonna do this for right now before no one does and I kept winning it says like this is it this is the night I had diamond and it was like no no I'm staying up Candyland babe candy lane but I hit diamond feels good like that's the problem too now but like I still want to play yeah I still want to play I know I'm addicted to TFT and you don't like it I don't like have you tried it I have I won't play ranked on mobile I don't I can't I don't think it's bad it's just like especially now it's not so bad but like when you're trying to pivot and like old comps and it's like game-changing like okay I have to pivot now I did it like there's no way I can do it fast enough like so that's the only reason I don't like it oh yeah so TFT we're liking that what else is coming Oh Assassin's Creed Valhalla was revealed as skidded maybe a playthrough I'm sure on the second channel that's gonna be something at the very least imma play it because I'm uh back the what sounds the best out of Assassin's Creed Valhalla it sounds like it has a lot what Assassin's Creed 2 had in you could like build your city like something like settlement and stuff like that that was super cool in Assassin's Creed 2 it sounds like that's a huge part of it and that's dope for me building build in the Viking village dude I'm down yeah and it sounds like like if you make one decision it can affect your settlement so like settlements can look different and oh no as I love Vikings but there hasn't been aside from God of War which was sick and for honor there hasn't really been like a big Viking game that I can like sink my teeth into but now you're gonna give me like an open-world Viking game bruh where I get a pillage some some stupid Templars and stuff oh boy I'm going in and it helps to that recently I've been watching the last Kingdom which is a Netflix show whenever I don't know why I'd never heard about it but it covers it's kind of like the Vikings show on History Channel oh I love that one too I'm just waiting for that it only has half a season left to come back this year it's gonna be sad when it ends but I've been watching that too so I'm just like I'm back in I'm like yeah Vikings Odin let's do this for all right and oh yeah it's like they're well they have several gods but Odin is like yeah like isn't Zeus no not zeus zeus the god of gods dad turn remember who that is oh it starts with like a key it's not me Zeus no I think it might be Zeus cuz now it's it's Chronos Chronos is Zeus his dad because Kronos Kronos ate Zeus and somebody else I forget what it is there's a lot to go Stu it yeah I'm not he like ate his babies he ate like Zeus and someone else cuz well I mean I don't think Khurana even if he's technically his dad he's not like the God of bone comes yeah it says who's the strongest of the Greek god Zeus okay so I'm pretty sure it's Susan anyway doesn't matter if that is like the god of all gods for like Greek Odin is like the god he's ordered caught the all-father because he's like the father of all the gods and then from them the descendants of obviously like the Vikings and stuff yeah he said they like what I kind of like to is in that little cinematic trailer they did they practically ripped like the Vikings pilot like to the T because at the beginning of the Vikings pilot Ragnar is fighting on this hill in this battle is kind of stormy he's like fighting is like about to die and he sees on this tree this hooded man and it's like Odin and then it shows a crow cuz Odin typically it's like believed that he Ravens are his like are Odin you like yeah like that's him showing up like him taking that form and watching over you so then he like sees the Raven he's like Odin is with us and he does that in the pilot really yeah I was like nice I'm down that I'm just I'm back in my like period peace games I want to do I want it I want to play more see thieves I want to be a pirate I need to I need more Viking games I need more medieval games anymore samurai games we have ghosts of Tsushima or whatever coming out it got delayed but I think it's coming out yeah well now everything Herod for sure because it was supposed to come out in like a week or two but then obviously everything changed when Koba 19 tanked would you guys like to do some patreon questions if there's anything we didn't touch on we can skim over it real quick uh I think I think we're pretty much good hey it looks too young pcs gonna be sick oh yeah so we just want to thank all of our patreon stands appreciate you with all these questions that we have it in today I said ask better questions we got like 30 new questions Oh yo guys I've been kind of going over some of them and this one is from Jameson Tanner right forward if you were a Pokemon if you were on a Pokemon journey what Pokemon would you want as your ever-present main also rip to our boy swifty not only not the only loss we've had but definitely the one that hurts the most even if it was team Avril even if I was team Avril so can I talk about your spoilers real quick on your video cuz I've been watching the house watching your nose lock I'll put it like before Rob says that but I'm not looking forward okay Oh literally the next minute is going to be spoiled if I hearing day it's times four but it's row Pokemon and bro did you set up [ __ ] Pichu and I was like dudes making a mistake you're lucky you're fast for the Picchu and I thought I'd be fascinated ellicott and I'm like he's okay and okay to be fair I did a damage calc he hai rolled normally doesn't one shot yeah it you lost well no I'm not dead but my girls died we mostly Gyarados to an elegant exactly why why should that happen anyway because elekid see I didn't know can you say not only was the Elkin higher level not level you don't know the Eevee's and Ivy's on a randomized run yeah but I'm not worried at all how are you gonna risk a four times okay okay well to be fair I didn't think like I thought okay this might hurt but I'm just gonna attack first so what does it matter but then he attacks might hurt what do you mean this might hurt it's a forward I can probably just it's not porn I thought that's last episode awesome I'm also pretty sure he hit you with a hunger punch which is a physical and Gyarados does not exactly have the best natural he also I didn't think it knew thunder so much I did it I would I just went a little too you live elekid I wasn't okay and actually cry fair I looked it up too and apparently in black and white original it wouldn't know Thunder punch but in black and white to ill injure that 29 so it does no thunder punch and then I did the damage calc and it could have been anywhere from ninety percent to 110 percent and he was literally a 50-50 game yeah I also thought it was faster and he's like oh it's a high roll it's a 50/50 you know still but that like he could have lower we could have lit there are so many ways I thought we were faster now I just know it well up until this point I thought all babies just sucked and I looked up elekid stats and I was like that's not terrible like what the fudge yeah after the fight you're like the rest of sensor doodoo and I'm like well his attack I mean he is like his defensive stats are Pro bad but his attack and speed or like he's like 90 speed I'm like what yeah I was pissed dude sorry for the sidetrack was your Lucario right what about my old car that was swifty right no that was a chandelier literally just like threw out there well in the pakiya is what was it using it was using ours no I think Howard gym or something I was like a Rahman it hadn't even showed earth power and I had to swap out some way okay Lucario he'll eat this and it and it wasn't even attacking that slot and it attacks into the now switched in Lucario and randomly hits earth power one shots at like so far like what is he doing well you give me so you give me so much anxiety Jamieson I guess your answer to that is Ellicott I would have led you could take down anything I want right now is that I pulled him from my PC I was like okay I guess he's not that bad so what so what so what was the question again would like Pokemon would you had like start your journey with I guess well well and I'll make I'll put a stipulation on it can only be a first starter evolution you can't just start there lugia yeah part of me would say I would probably do like to do like mud kit for the memes for the mud like it has to be a starter or it could be like well the question was Amy yeah yeah I'd go a boy Croagunk that's right or die yeah I'm out I was really close over him but that's what I'm saying if I had to choose any I might as well choose Croagunk dragon and then well know what think Rogen could then I'd evolved in the Toxicroak but oh so you you would sort of T me become a drag a bold stand but droopy is such a bad pick as repeatable so late yeah that's the thing about the locks is when I find like I found like Dino or whatever is like great all right I'll see you level 65 yeah right I want to go yeah I'm gonna go with the classic Piplup and Polina is just so good on those locks cuz he just resists everything I think my second classic Piplup my second pick though would probably be because I always liked the flexibility of being able to go like anywhere you know I hate that like it's like okay I'm gonna choose Umbreon but then it's like ooh bad code shows like Jolteon or like I'd probably go on Brown yeah thing is a Nuzlocke tanky Pokemon are very much valuable was your Gyarados considered tanky not really he was my just my absolute damaged beast because he learned acrobatics with the TM which he normally can't learn and I didn't give him an item so it's like 110 base attack stab move which he should never learn and so that did was just like composure like this is sick oh my this is sick was like yeah and he's like wall baby Pokemon thunderpunch and I'm like breath but but I like I mentioned in some of my let's play that I like also kind of playing a little fast and loose because like I could play every battle like it's life or death and like shoot like and if that was the case it'd be like alright just swap into Snorlax every single time okay do this do you know but I also kind of like the and unfortunately it's I have not gotten a good gamba yes it's okay but you'll be fair again I thought I was faster I never thought I was gonna get hit ridiculously risky Gambas I don't think you realize how risky they are until after the fact you read three Pokemon - the risky risky game yeah well it was funny like that episode where you like hit a Pacquiao on a trainer and then you just run into another pause yeah like well that's when I realize like Jesus I have nothing against the Palkia and then another one shows up and I'm like oh my well then like a triple battle though at least like that was let this started the the the lock to fruit the first like five to ten episodes that was the problem like rock-types I had nothing if a Pokemon used to roll out it was essentially okay who do I send out to die like I would ready had nothing and sometimes exactly yeah sometimes that's just how I would do be and so like you against PAOK it's like I got I got nothing so we're gonna go to Chris Cavazos Kosmos Cavazos this question and it says is nobody gonna talk about the aliens which we didn't get to talk about did you guys do classified like Declassified a video of like I don't it was the air force that like a video like there it's like looking at an unidentified flying object so but this is like the Pentagon like was it confirming it i hade yeah i mean i mean that leaked like two years ago so i already saw it I did and I mean it's cool but like I don't know man like it like Thai aliens exist that's like a side plot to the 2020s be inquest we got more stuff going on than aliens at this point maybe they're yeah like legit real repenting unconfirmed ok well we also don't know that well they said unidentified maybe it for all we know it was some new Russian aircraft that we we haven't seen before right I wished it was definitive proof but that's not defending the proof oh we know they don't know what it was yeah this is about last question from jelly I think this is a really funny question 2020 has been one of the worst years of our lifetimes what do you think inmate could make it worse um I will start and I will say the Majora's Mask moon all the sudden coming down to the earth I think that would be pretty pretty funny to make words or murder Hornets those are real yeah dude those are here now I always knew about those it was like good thing I don't live in Japan well game over doesn't matter anymore I have I have a rather poetic response to that that is not a meme the worst thing that could happen in 2020 is after all this the world just goes back to normal that is the worst Wow yeah that's that could happen made like my skin right like we didn't learn anything I was always thinking really diva and I was like what's the war I mean to cook in any way be the worst nothing changes that would be worse oh well what's what you live in that timeline all my favorite memes are like it's like like a majestic bald eagle and it's like us in movies during the pandemic like we'll solve this and then us during actual pandemics is like a hmm like yeah it best up looking like bald eagle II yeah it's just some of the stuff going on man I swear so yeah worst thing I guess would be I don't know I almost saw I don't want to think about it cuz it'll come to fruition if I do the covet a halo ring all of a sudden slowly coming in um destiny pyramids yeah I guess like every video game publisher goes out of business or developer oh my god that would be bad news or we lose I am kind of afraid of that I hope not I think we're going to I think because I go did you see like that trolls World Tour like it was like the first movie to like launched like straight digitally and it had over like a hundred and forty million dollar pre-orders watch something like mm-hmm oh my god I mean I wouldn't mind if they did both but but see then that's the problem less people go to movies but I love that movie that I'd still go because you gotta think like there's good always gonna be that niche community that enjoys going out to see a movie rather than seeing it from their home I don't think they'll complete like even if that does become the case I think it'll be that will get like indie theaters will stick around but I really hope we don't lose them in but I can only hope but when you manage the moon that reminded me back when I lived in Florida and I would stay at my friend's house when we played Mele I remember we heard a rumor that if you waited long enough the majoras moon would on that little turtle island with that it would eventually fall so we had that running for hours waiting never dead I remember I never I've ever that one - and that was back during the days when I couldn't affect you I do what Amazon Prime you can rent trolls World Tour for 20 bucks I'm interested to see how it does cuz you're gonna everybody's gonna look at how that movie does in the sense of 12 world tour reportedly made 50 million in Vaude sales and its first day watch it I guess isn't that great I don't I mean I wasn't projected I certainly didn't think trolls would pop things dude kids [ __ ] love trolls like the like the little kiddos nowadays I don't know what creepy little red ones they love trolls we're all about hey dude back in my day trolls we're Smurfs dude all right we get Smurfs this is about 50% of the weekends original 2016 oh so I guess it's not that great I guess it made like 50 million its first weekend but that's half of what 2016 trolls made mmm what is this equal to which usually doesn't do as well but and you gotta think cuz like well and then like a movie like trolls because you gotta think about this if you take your kids to troll so that's primarily a kids movie you you're paying for tickets and then you're getting at least two snacks like that's $100 day for a normal parent or a $20 rental on Amazon Prime like I feel like some movies can do really good digitally like kid movies and maybe like an adult movie or like pg-13 rated R movies maybe can't do as well or it can't can't do as well as maybe a kid show could or a movie I don't want to do theaters I don't want to either and I want this podcast episode to end but it has to but I have to have two hopefully movie theaters don't have to close though that's crazy you guys can find me everywhere a blue slip you find me everywhere at Robby V mr. fruit it's been a pleasure to having you all join us today audio listeners got this early you know they
