heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to enlisted thank you very much to enlisted for sponsoring this video believe it or not this helmet is canon at least it's on brand more so i have it and i never get to wear it so and i always forget to make the strap a little less tight because it's like unless it is a world war ii multiplayer shooter it has a strong focus on historical authenticity while keeping gameplay dynamic and players always in the middle of action it's available on pc xbox series x and s and playstation 5 with cross platform support there is no purchase necessary simply follow the link in the description box below to download and play for free my favorite part though is the squads all squads start off with four soldiers but can be expanded to include more soldiers through upgrades but you control one member in your squad and the other are ai control you order them around and if you're to fall you can just automatically switch over to another person in your squad so that way you're never out of the action personally i like the assault rifles and submachine guns because i'm an ape and so i could get in close and do some damage there is a free bonus for registering by following the link in the description box below where again you can play for free on pc playstation or xbox it'll be an honor to have you on the battlefield and serve by your side soldier and i know this isn't a world war ii helmet but i don't have a world war ii helmet you know i don't have one of those laying around crazy right oh i'm with my squad dude oh squad up
