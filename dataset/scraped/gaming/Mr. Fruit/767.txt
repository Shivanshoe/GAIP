hi 81 my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and a new update has dropped bringing with it a new weapon 5 loadout slots other things I think but the reason we're here they added a freaking crossbow it is a marksman rifle now in order to get it it's not like blocked behind loot boxes we like to see that it's actually locked behind the challenge I believe it's using a reflex sight get 5 kills with marksman rifles in 25 different games however I haven't had the time to go in through it myself so I got the ornament ornament what is this destiny blueprint the iceland's now interestingly enough I have no idea what these attachments do because I can't I can't read them arm is 200 pounds maybe that's the tension or something the bolt is a back burn 20-inch slide a hand out like that and to speed track so I haven't the slightest clue what any of that means but apparently this update has just been borked for so many different people I'm talking it's straight up just reset people's progress completely to level 1 I mean I want prestige back Infinity Ward but not like that well who cares about that cuz I get to use the crossbow I'll leave this I don't know why this wasn't in since the beginning the game but Holly freakin will yeah anyway I can't tell you how how good it is to see this thing look at this I think this is gonna set but we're gonna find out I don't know maybe maybe this thing's just gonna be cracked and I'm gonna be like you made a mistake Infinity Ward oh Jesus yeah I was trying to figure out how this just works in the first place check this out oh my goodness alright this is good this is gonna be rough wait wait a minute man what the fudge just happened oh shoot this is a new loadout I didn't change any of my perks or attachments or anything okay we're good now I got my stems back my crotch okay so it turns out that Holborn bolt thing um no what the fudge it wait what that didn't that didn't hit him I think it took so long to get to him he just crouched and dodged it like me oh except if neo had like just the super crutch where everything was super slow I think this guy's trying to quit you know and that's not a crossbow he's firing far too fast we got a kill okay so if this is all about burning first off why does the original one normally one shot if the answer is yes I want to know why in the world I would want to slowly burn an enemy when I could normally just direct hit them in one shot then with a normal bolt but we don't that might not be the case maybe with the regular bolt it has to be a head shot for a one shot if that is the case wow this thing is garbage if its chest up rebut like maybe stomach up I don't I honestly had to think that would be okay because so far I mean we have will get us we have sleight of hand okay yeah if that's light a hand oh man this is gonna be a doozy isn't it and we missed that not only is it gonna be difficult but it's not hits can and I'm burnin watch the door for me would you buddy you're a pal a real pal check this out swoop and they're gone all right I need to use my dead silence though I have to take advantage of this I said oh hello oh we didn't get him I thought I only heard him with like the AoE he was barely angled and so it completely missed him my wife is a joke but we got the kill oh my god it takes so long they could have very well gotten time to still kill me before they died oh this is interesting I really wish I had a regular crossbow to compare I don't even know how is the drop drastic like I don't even I don't even know what I'm doing with my life right now Bob I mean that looked good that felt good but yeah it just seemed to completely oh if the a me your guess is as good as mine as to what happened to the bolt oh okay that was kind of sick that was a that was a miracle shot and a half holy cow between the travel distance boom oh wait a second okay headshot tater shot that's still one shot well that's good to know that gives me some faith yeah rich so kind of my worst fears realized just like everybody else who'd go why would you use a crossbow in in military setting like this with all the other guns and weapons you could choose from and yeah it's proven itself it's literally worse than everything else you could choose from it doesn't do anything better than anything else doesn't seem like I mean I guess I you're probably pretty quiet um so I guess that's cool but you get one shot if we very precise reload time is a god-awful I don't with at least these bolts you have to hit them and then wait for it to kill them oh you know what this means I love it I love the weapon because it's wood it literally in practice on paper it's oh my god how did I just I don't even know what I just hit anyway it's just screaming I am garbage do not use me and for me that means Oh we're using it all right watch this yeah burn baby burn and then watch this wool long shot maybe not oh my god we'll get that drop that's actually pretty insane between the trip I'm gonna have to I just guessed I don't I don't know I don't know you or do we have to go that's c4 hold on oh my the the the opposite of drop it just rose uncontrollably that's mm-hmm hey yeah yeah if you think I'm sexy and you want my body please don't chase after me watch this this is for you body screw your c4 no thank you okay I go now all right I've got it's so shaky but I got that kill that's revenge the other thing too if you find more than one person you're just you're done you can't kill more than one person there is literally no hope every other Marchman rifle makes this thing look like doodoo in fact I'm sorry I'm surprised this isn't like a secondary weapon this takes up a primary slide I think it might be work worth it if you could use in the second hand that'd be pretty dope but you can't but that's what it feels like you should just get overkill for free using this thing out of pity and I'm not even gonna take the time sometimes I like to play devil's advocate like well this is just my experience maybe somebody else's has a good experience or you know maybe I just need get used to it that is no I merely that dude killed him well he was dead to rights I hit him with a fing way out cool and then he just has time to kill me and I go cool guess I'm dead and the guys were right behind me but I can't turn fast hold on time for the real test I thought I heard enemy UAV I was gonna try and shoot it down and you imagine yeah you just kind of kind of shoot and forget open you paid for prime delivery so that thing gets there ASAP because now we got oh we got oh my god what economy shipping or something geez ground I mean I know it's a little more expensive for like next day but I'm willing to pay the price right now okay come on it's like we're going back to but it looks so good I guess the advantage of this bolt is like oh it's like a mini thermite on the wall no it's not it's again it's worse than the thermite it's it's just mediocre a lot of things and some how terrible you would think putting like sugar spice and a little bit of nice would make them like you know decent Powerpuff Girls but now this thing just makes absolute horrors they're like they're not even Powerpuff Girls anymore wait what oh wait who killed him Oh an actual thermite you just end up creating mutilated horrified slowly dying and agony all the time Powerpuff like voodoo dolls and there's like kill me please we went negative honestly I think I do better with a knife because at least then I can kill a couple people if I sneak behind them in this case I shoot one bolt hopefully I hit him if not like oh Jesus oh god I'm like fumbling the bone oh my god not yet not yet oh sweet Moses anybody else using the crossbow anybody else dumb enough nope nope okay nobody's dumb enough it looks like they're trying to unlock it I'm so sorry spoilers it's rough you're all using the other marksman rifles and I'm just going G golly wilikers I wish I could be using that hay but we hit him aha afterlife yeah I get used to that using this thing at this point it might just be better off like oh my god actually just randomly predicted that I'm dead again imagine a direct hit gun doesn't need travel time Kim one shot relatively easily reloads faster can shoot the next guy your bullet faster doesn't have one in the mag what did I just subscribe literally every other marksman rifle I think my rather of the pistols I went through hell and back sold you for them platinum pistols and honestly I might do it again over this and again that's why I'm loving it I'm a glutton for pain baby cuz that oh my god not to mention my teammate getting in the way of an arrow well there goes that one because we were in into it the most tragic part about the crossbow is that I am left to play passively yeah get rekt just because of the reboot that was nice the reload speed and everything like this that's how it with that and then and then that you miss and that's it oddly enough now I just want Damascus so I can use the Damascus crossbow and everybody laugh at me I get killed by it like what are you doing with your life oh oh wow I thought hey maybe the mini thermite will kill him no but he practically stood on top of it their whole duration you know what happened he laughed he peed a little bit because I took with him he's like stop I'm gonna pee I'm dead fun fact that happened to me well I didn't pee when I got tickled but my brother did that just tickling him one day my story short he's like I'm gonna pee and then he did all over me yep so this is going horribly you know I'm gonna I'm just gonna assume like some other guns it takes the right attachments I played with some god-awful blueprints and attachments and maybe that's just the case this is the blueprint with the stupidest attachments cuz they're like no one's gonna ever use this so we got to put it in the blueprint I'm just gonna I'm gonna chalk it up to that I'm sure with the right once we unlock it right attachments it's probably be God to also I'm not doing this this is no you're Muslim now take it game in progress where we're losing I don't have a choice using the crossbow and no one else should priceless I'm thinking well I don't think you're thinking anything in mister fruits oh you're dead which means you ain't got no brain says ain't brain ain't no working in even know if I would have killed him I think I hit the oh boy I don't know where you was Oh check this ready it might be harder than the RPG oh my god do-do-do-do-do-do oh my god I can't even tell how much it drops would I have if I shot a little lower I don't know maybe how your this thing is a pile of trash but I still use it cuz I'm a glutton gotten for her pain did you do Katie whoo Katie what I don't care a lot cuz it's just gonna tank alright I'll stop singing but I will shoot this down those may be actually a little too much dodge what that missed alright that I mean that looks good right I give up no I don't I don't give up that easily sure yes I do I mean that was half my ammo too can we also talk about that why do I get like no ammo sorry got anything else going for me it's not like suddenly I'm like oh no he's got more bolts he's not even gonna be able to use in a life because maybe that's why yeah they're like trust me you're not gonna go through all nine don't worry about it kid I can't prove you're wrong so far so oh sweet Moses hello thankfully I have oblivious friends oh okay by me I have oblivious friends and a crossbow that won't put a freakin bolt and and even if my life depended on it oh we didn't hit him oh wow we actually killed him no just a little bit of flame damage little tickling on his pickle that sounds weird my apologies there's someone right here and we gotta believe that ever that might actually be the play oh great I can hurt myself with my own mini thermite why not all right do more damage - oh Jesus Oh see I think this is actually why core maps are gonna be dodge be better for the crossbow though because I can shoot somebody like that and then run away reload it gives me enough time to do that kind of stuff he's right here I know he is were you at I didn't get anyone this is bad it did so little damage you didn't even notice probably didn't even care he's like is that someone using a crossbow hilarious Jesus Lee that I had to shoot him and run away praying to God that he didn't kill me before it burned him out oh my god wait a minute wait a second mr. fruit are you about to use every bolt in one life not only that we're actually kind of on a killing spree um I think there's someone right in here though oh no it's my friend I'm scared but that's okay because I I'm going I'm gonna get one more kill watch watch watch are you watching keep watching he's right here now he's over there no oh you ran away did I hit him yeah oh my god we got a VTOL with just a crossbow yeah boys pop it off airspace to crowd you kidding me also I thought I had me I do have scavenger on what I've been walking over their bodies wouldn't I didn't equip a secondary because I never thought I'd be but oh my god if I had killed chain on could have maybe actually done something there or if my scam is literally none of those lives I ran over like every body is is there something to do with like the burning that doesn't my what the fudge team this is a crossbow VTOL inbound how copy was in oh my god you were in that with the crossbow that's right and not just any crossbow the flaming dragon crossbow I got switched my pistol okay apparently I'm just gonna have to get used to that I'm running out of time dude I don't know why you have to crouch every time hold on give me a second give me a couple minutes I'm almost ready ah I'm dead it's not my fault that it takes so long to reload okay or not CH is that that's still like the proper term even though I'm using right quad kill Hank well least my VTOL can do something right I think my VTOL is now gotten as many kills as I have gotten with my crossbow so it's just not happening it's really not if you have the lower ground give it up if you have the higher ground well the odds are almost even but you're still too disadvantaged with your fruit I can't help but notice all you're doing is ragging on the crossbow oh sorry right let me um let me pretend this is the sick ah this is the greatest new weapon they've ever had in call duty everybody was like wait a crossbow that can't be very good and you know what they're like bet because we were right essentially they're like yet you're you're why would you use a crossbow and even I'm asking myself that but my god we'll get it Damascus one day but make no mistake my friends that day is very very very far away I wouldn't worry about that hmm okay yeah I'm just gonna have to get it for myself and see if we can't you know figure out the right attachment concoction that's e23 kills is he gonna get it forth he thought about it okay so he got three kills in about one second if I wanted to get three kills the cross but that would take me what like nine ten is perfectly fine it's perfectly fine I figured out why they didn't put this behind a loot box guys because they knew no one no one would bother buying crates to try and get that thing so in summary I love it thank you very much for watching have yourself a fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one [Music] [Music]
