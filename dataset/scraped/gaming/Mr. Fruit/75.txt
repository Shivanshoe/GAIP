okay yep that's how that works oh it responds stuff bruh oh my god how does he do it bring it on take on me this isn't a bait and that opens the other side which i don't have ammo for now i'm not a

better you know that now than later alright this is the last time i have to do this segment because this is the run thank you thank you yup i just got paid okay come on man it's just resetting the ammo though maybe i just don't reset the ammo well there's ammo right there though tempting no no no that's fine i have the high ground it's over anakin yes the slow but steady grind okay okay we got some thralls here because that i know that now easy the look away the disrespect okay just don't choke yes even if i press the wrong ones i don't think they can kill me that's the good news better to be slow and methodical and we're golden we're golden we're floating we're gonna run back for our lives to be over all right then i'm gonna i'm gonna hit this dude with the sauce okay we're going the right way because there's a there's a little plate there really really really okay so you guys just this is just the thing you do all the time huh that's all i'm doing all right just ignore that left one it's a bait don't look at it all right this is new grounds this is new territory there is a wizard somewhere isn't there where be thy wizard i know there's a there's a wizard somewhere oh is that

here okey dokey all right now indiana jones taught me anything i can drop this right i think so fool me once shame on you i've died to that a little too many times i know this looks easy but a little there's a little slope there's there's a world where i die there okay that was closer than it probably should have been i'm gonna be honest all right i don't need to pick those up yet because they will get me killed now randall randall ran the bruh hey yo hey yo hey yo brus chill my dude yeah that's right you don't have to go all the way up top all right everything is okay yeah i i ain't even trying because i'm gonna get 10 and then i'm going to be fine i'm going to get my old back right all right where you guys at you guys are making this a little more different oh did i wait too long i thought you waited too long yeah i thought you can get like 20 aside did i really mess it up that bad okay slight problem i i kinda watch i have to put these in because i'm gonna die otherwise this is not ideal if you're curious this is not part of my plan but sometimes it do be like that okay that wasn't quite as optimal as i'd hoped but it's okay it's okay because guess what if we need to throw in an extra dip space i'll do it no shame in that game thank you ogre friend all right and we're going dude dude what is wrong i dude why i was like i'm fine i was about to bubble too this freaking
