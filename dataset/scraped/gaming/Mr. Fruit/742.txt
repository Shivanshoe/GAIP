hi ad ho moon monning's mr. Furth and welcome back to more bleeding-edge in today's video we're gonna be focusing on the support cool of its design and premise is too cool not to try out again love the design because it's actually the snake controlling this dead body as like a host in order to move around I'm a big fan - first up basic ability he is one of the ranged characters in the game so his basic attack is acid spit he also has a passive lucky charm continuously hill's himself and his nearby allies now his specials first ability sacred ground someone award the damages enemys and heals allies in the surrounding area best of both worlds deal damage heal damage good omen shield an ally or double cast to cast on yourself curse target takes 25% increased damage from all sources now remember there are two supers as well that every character has and you can choose one when you enter a game bamboozle mind control an enemy bending them to your will now I do a terrible job of showcasing this in the second game speaking from experience being on the other end it's really good on maps where there are environmental hazards or like edges like cliffs you just control their character and clip just walk off the cliff and boon empower an ally with 25% damage 15% defense 25% spear so cool AK definitely feels like a jack-of-all-trades he's rated advanced though so let's see if I'm big brain enough to use them to its full potential I'm gonna use my boon super first but then I'm gonna change later and I can mind-control an enemy fro the one Oh God get them a thing alright we need to collect the batteries I'm coming hold on er okay hey stay in my ward you're gonna be I'm gonna jump on okay hold on he's taking increased damage and I'm gonna get it back in the ward I'm gonna shield you I almost
