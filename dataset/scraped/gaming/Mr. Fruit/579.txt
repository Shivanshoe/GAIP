hi ad hojoon moanings mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and in today's video we're gonna try and explore why everybody and their mom is currently trying to get the god role for this weapon got to admit though kind of stepping up my trip game the nine hunger currently what everybody is feigning after this was a weapon introduced way back in the season of The Drifter but has gotten an updated role in the new season and everybody's trying to get I masterwork this role and I don't have a good reason as to why we got extended barrel flared magwell Zen moment and to swashbuckler yargh so all in all really nothing crazy but bear with me here for a second first off a bit of a baller handsome extra enhancement course that's a lie I don't have that many but I'm gonna try some armor mod shenanigans I can become charged with light by picking up orbs of light and having a master weapon means I might have a better chance of picking up an orb of light combine that with the high-energy fire which wild charts with light I get a bonus to weapon damage then combine that with swashbuckler I don't know we're gonna see what happens and honestly just sounds like we're gonna have a lot of fun with this auto rifle which you know for me isn't exactly a tall order I've stood by auto rifles through thick and thin solitude bringing me back to my old lonely relationship 'less high school days well for the record I did have a relationship on and off but she uh she cheated on me and it gave me trust issues and that's not weird that's our we're here to try and get some orbs of light which I think I think I'm loving a bit of a fairy tale here I'm thinking that whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa mr. laggy Oh let's cop let's calm ourselves that dude was so laggy nothing I don't look at him look at me oh hey I'm still waiting on that orb of light to get charged with light but that's gonna happen any second now I don't know why I swapped to my old sniper rival the holy hackers you see that melted oh wow okay it melted again alright swashbuckler kinda kind of real right now what just happened did I get team shot cuz he just kind of like chunked me or was I just did not realize how low I was that is always something I have to check on cuz I know I'll be like recording or something but oh my god I can't go get and they look back and as I li had three health that's how yeah sometimes it's you know I'm not the most aware player I was chasing that guy who was captain RC but I chased him off it appears let me just out gun this guy next time this time he got me no I don't know though with this whole unflinching reload masterwork swashbuckler Zen moment you know maybe I'm onto something here maybe I'm on to the new God role that everybody's sleeping on give me that kill all right we got swashbuckler going which is great great I love what I'm seeing but it's already gone I loved what I was seeing but it just didn't last for very long we don't really have that range mr. fruit little ambitious ooh but that was just ambitious enough still no orbs alight but I know my friends are gonna be popping their supers any second now right guys protect me from the sniper rifle thank you very much oh this thing do kind of be nice with it though even I didn't really understand why everybody was going for it but I'm alike in what I'm using holy hackers oh we got an ape a blur help I've gotten charged and I can't get up brain this monkeys running at me with shotguns please send for help like I should have died so many different ways but I know I shouldn't be alone right here I go skirt thank you very much all right always swashbuckler times five oh gosh dang it forgot get the melee kill start shooting because times five swashbuckler breath want to talk about real right now well that was really god that insane you think you think he'll teach me if I pay him for some lessons how does he do it the way he left clicks me oh my god it's coming ah okey okey uh-huh you like this Oh what up what oh really you're just gonna so you're just gonna pop yo super I reckon I could have done the same but I did not I'm wrecking him a bit of a dum dum hey wait super gets the worm my mom always told me Oh turns out my mother was a fat liar tried about when to use my super and she lied about who my real dad was thanks mom I don't know why I keep pulling out my snow here like and like I'm trying to go for Snipes cuz that's now that I mean I'm trying to use the nine hunger just this map is just like breath snipe and I'm like alright okay oh wait a minute is there an orb oh I'm in the hornet's nest I'm in NoHo Cod they were they like kept going in and out in and out so I just like got both of them we we've yet to start activating this charge with like shenanigan re but fear not I can look at this I get so many people weak and I end up killing one just too many of them man they know I have a TD I can't focus on one target for that long okay sure buddy no go take that kill yeah we're teammates and stuff right so fun and games or whatever there's a kill get a nice little nade sorry I'm sorry no okay oh fudge oh shoot okay this guy's got a super come here come here raka yes give me a normal life give me a normal life go go did you you didn't get one or blight you boy say psych right now okay hey this guy's role is feel primped emotional omal at least I didn't mash to work that one am I right or am i right guys hi oh we had a good start but I've gotten distracted by sniper rifles and orbs of light which I have yet to see am I blind orbs alight maybe that's the problem you know I don't see orbs I accept all objects you know rhombuses of light squares of light why do they have to be orbs I can't they be like dodecahedron or something the car song Crusaders ahaha I mean I do like like that reload speed though that is nice totally worth the mash to work never mind all the pretty much every other stat that would've been better to master work but it's fine game over but oh my what's going on over there I'd like to announce that it's now that time for the [Music] please keep all eyeballs on the viewing device of your choosing and let's get into it slight problem gonna be even harder to get orbs of light because now I don't have any teammates to generate me some orb of lights but whatever clearly this whole horrible light charged light thing bit of a wash but it'll always be there you know with further builds we can screw it might as well just do this for all my PvP billets right pick get charged a little bit extra damage sure why not I'm not gonna say no are you all were you all at I mean are you peeking what are you doing over there you little rascal what wait what what was I looking at oh god I just hate smoke grenades on radars bro like why are they why does this show as an enemy and can I just why aren't I finding anyone what is going on why am i bad oh god the little hearts cover that could I am actually I'm actually the worst just kill me now ah let's check this man's role a master worked in moment rampage not bad I mean honestly Zen moment the swashbuckler it's not the worst thing I've ever seen okay I know I know that's a snipe but what do you want for me okay I'm always swashbuckler times five please engage me please okay but unfortunately the swashbuckler ran out bruh I'm oh what's going on here mmm I like that look at that stability standing right on the head mmm oh that feels oh wait a second that feels real good hold up wait a minute oh my 9 hunger beats yours hold up suddenly we're in the lead and things are looking up for us which is rare I'm not gonna challenge you because I know you louts night me it looked like I was gonna challenge him for a second but that was merely a debate I assure you oh my god you'll crouch shut shut up well guess what I end up winning it okay that over shield and that burn she do hurt though I'm outie hey who's grabbing the heavy yeah oh oh wait what are you doing over here oh how did he just die okay well I'm just gonna take the heavy just to deny it and maybe I'll shoot it and miss okay I saw that plane out much worse Oh some guy just like took it up the butt from my shield how does one take it up the butt from my shield well I'm so glad you asked perhaps another time I'll give you a proper walkthrough of what that would look like all right I've got super I just need to pop it I'm I always sit on it for too long but now there's so many are I screwed dude one kills good enough for me huh no I'm saying Bob okay there's one we do boo boo boo boo don't get stabbed in the face come on come on quit playing are you kidding me why I mean dent was totally calculate and I knew exactly what was happening good absolutely did oh he just begged me you shot me with a golden gun like brick that rumbles a little sweaty that I'm not able to just use my nine hunger currently having to use what feels like everything else in my arsenal except oh oh it's supers goal or it's you like what am i oh okay really that's just that's real mature real mature you miss two supers on me then I kill you yikes oh that's embarrassing and I'm just better I'm just better right now I'm out gunning people like it's it's my job oh my okay I definitely add some mist what kind of a spawn is this what dude came in brief and on me I know we spawned on me because I get smells breath get a mint brah this is my time this ah rip this is my vein turn back - there's something dude oh you gotta be kidding me yeah you want to do this how are you oh my god he took both of the kills and now what are these sponsor are you trying to order a frosty after all this is just Wendy sir chocolate frosty - sometimes I am strong the willpower to resist but a chocolate frosting I'll tell you what not that one okay okay people just keep spawning here so I'll do my best to just keep killing them art trembles I really am ants all done up here folks and a bit like what do you think what are these spots what are those I say he already had the pre-fire nah I gave him the lead oh my god he only needs one more kill no no these sponsored janky brother what is going on right now you have a sword okay look I have to come clean actually don't regret Master working this it's not the best role but my god I'll make it work it's it's fine honestly and if only we got our charge with light thing to work would that be nice we might not have got that working but the nine hunger is certainly a weapon to be sought after go get yourselves a god role if you can the chances of it are fantastically small for this I don't think you very much watching have those event actually I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
