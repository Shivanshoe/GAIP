hi do you hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to overwatch custom games it's weird to say that because it's been a very long time hasn't it but if you've been with the channel for a long time you know we used to grind these and i don't i'm in the overwatch mood man i don't know what to tell you the video they did in overwatch 2 got me hyped too the little gameplay or you know blizzcon panel thing whatever and this custom game we did actually was a whole bunch of fun and it turned out to be a whole bunch of custom games in one so i'll let you guys watch the video for yourselves and if you want to see some more custom games let me know now before we get into today's video i want to thank nordvpn for sponsoring this video now most of you probably heard this thing thrown around in the past couple years this vpn what is it i'm glad you asked it's a virtual private network it is quite literally life-changing i don't know about you but i prefer my life to be a little bit more private look into that as much as you will and that means a vpn is perfect for me and i wouldn't choose anyone except for nordvpn the primary reason i got a vpn was for security sakes there's a lot of things out there a lot of people watching a lot of eyeballs i don't like it so i said got a vpn it ensures no data logging nordvpn specifically comes with a cybersex suite which acts as an ad blocker you get double data encryption for increased anonymity this way you can be doing whatever you want nobody knows who it is you can protect your data while traveling in public places hot spots wi-fi's all that sort of thing and best of all you can try this with a 30-day money-back guarantee but that's not the best part uh security is an important thing but more importantly is entertainment me and my wife like to watch netflix that's no secret and what bums us out is when your region's library doesn't include some of the content you wish you'd have so let's say i'm living in america in the uk's got something cool on netflix i'm like dude what the heck that's not cool oh wait turn the vpn on suddenly they think i'm in the uk and i can access their library and watch whatever i want like for instance currently they have semi-pro one of my favorite will ferrell movies just re-watched it if you haven't seen it you're missing out once you use a vpn specifically nor vpn you're never going to want to go back i can guarantee that and because i partnered with them they gave house fruit a nice little discount click the link down in the description box below and for every purchase of a
