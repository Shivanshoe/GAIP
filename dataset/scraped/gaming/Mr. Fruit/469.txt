hi everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to hades and i say welcome back because it has been a long time but we have in fact made a video on this very game even though it's just now everybody's jam i have a knack for puppy my goodness you just gotta keep dragging the bone all over the wooden floor don't you anyway hades has officially released out of early access we made a video way long time ago in early access and now everybody's all about this game and like i said i have a knack for getting ahead of trends but not in a good way i discover things first but i never you know get them super popular and then i leave them and then it becomes super popular and then i'm like guys what what the heck good example would be i mean it's just pokemon cards i used to always play pokemon cards and collect them and now everybody's all about them so now all the weapons are unlocked when i did early access i don't remember how many there were ma there's probably the bow maybe four but since they've added these like fist gloves twin malphite whatever something like that and a gun you can just enter uh the joker smash brothers gun meme here gun gun i could show you all the house of hades but there will be some spoilers because i have beaten the game quite a few times and by beating the game i mean like actually completed a run and so i don't want to spoil any of that for you guys that's not what we're here to do right now we're going to be taking a look at veratha otherwise known as the eternal spear now i have unlocked all the variations i don't think this was in the game at all when i played it my last video again god knows how long it was a year and a half two years ago i don't really know but now there are new aspects that you can unlock that change one not only the aesthetic of the weapon as you can see here but also the special perk it gets long story short i like the super duper secret aspect the aspect of guan you the stuff you get from this is sick so i only started 45 health which sucks however when you attack it's a slow 3 combo but lots of damage and i can reset it with a strike not only that my special now becomes serpent slash which is that which i guess if you don't know what the original spirit none of this really matters but the i can live steal okay yeah it doesn't really matter yeah okay now we're gonna head on in and here's an interesting thing when you beat the game once you unlock the pact of punishment so essentially what this means is you have a heat level and you can see right here two skulls two heat level i've already beaten it you can see this is what i would have gotten so if i up the heat level i can re-re-earn them okay so we're gonna do extreme measures each underworld's region boss gains new techniques and then i'm also gonna have to speed run this because i'm giving myself only nine minutes to clear each world then we're gonna do foes and standard encounters appear in greater numbers plus twenty percent per escape or whatever okay so ironically because i'm doing the time i don't care what you have to say dad shut up dad i'm not a part of your system anyway bottom line if you're gonna see the timer whoa i got nine minutes and it's gonna start counting down so i gotta go however we're in a menu it pauses like this so we can take a second i'm gonna be talking real fast throughout this whole thing it might get a little complicated but here's what you need to know hades is probably the best roguelite i've ever played ever you need to play this game it's it's on like is it on all the platforms i know it's definitely on steam and epic game store and if you use epic game store co mr fruit if you don't that's fine just letting you know anyway we're talking to dimiter who's actually my grandma uh goddess of seasons blah blah blah shut your mouth grammy let's get a boon so my special can be it's trying to flick chill out my cask can drop chris or my dad shoots i guess i had that influx chill let's go with a dash that shoots chill sure wow look at that ooh so cold so especially i'm going to kill you obviously these first rooms are really easy we're going to go ba we're heading in the next room like i said we gotta speed run this i've never actually failed with this with the timer but then again that's because i wasn't recording i didn't have to take my time to explain kind of what was going on here but it's kind of amazing i could never beat hades this game the final boss as you would imagine is my father hades but i'd only gotten there like once out of probably like 12 13 attempts and then later on it was like 15th or 16th attempt i finally beat it and then i'm not gonna lie i won like five six in a row and i think i've won the last 10 out of the 11 runs i've done like i just went from never winning to just crushing it every time which is dope and it's my boy zeus what's good my cast is a chain it's an epic we like that sure let's go with that and not only that i unlock the thing where i get a fish now this is a cool little update and just like animal crossing i suck at this all oh hades has so much content it's so story rich the cool thing is it directly ties its story into roguelike elements and it all makes sense and it's not like some like made-up thing where you're like but does that really make sense and also i got hit so that kind of sucks but yeah if i throw this you're gonna see my health each time it hits an enemy for a tick i gained one health there's always something new to shoot for which is why i've been putting so much time into it because i guess my problem with roguelites is i love them but like as soon as i beat them and i don't have a reason to really play them again except you know differentiate runs i'm usually not wanting to play a lot because i always like to unlock things and have something to chase and there's a lot to chase in this game so we love that and also i hate this boss mainly because this takes forever so but i've encountered everything there is nothing that can surprise a rootstor here skirt skirt skirt skirt screw skirt i'm going to need you to die sir hey there we go flawless i'm nuts now we can talk to athena my attack is stronger and can deflect my special australians can deflect uh let's just go with attack is stronger and can deflect deflect is super helpful i don't know like if they're done or they're they're playing that other stuff all i know is i love everything super giant games so i hope they do otherwise i'm looking forward to whatever the next game is but here you go daedalus hammer so it drastically changes how your weapon performs rather than giving you boons to upgrade things so my spin attack charges up and recovers much faster my special deals 400 damage to armor or my dash streak hits three times i'm gonna actually spin attack one because if you see this little scroll icon it means i haven't gotten that says faded choice one of the prophecies indicates i will choose this so this is just part of like an achievement if you you know use all the different options from gods or weapons blah blah blah you get you get upgrades and um resources and stuff and not to mention uh the spin attack on this is actually really good so it's boss time if you played this game or watched my previous video the first boss mageira and then they added all of her furious sisters it's usually one of them but because i added that packed difficulty i have to fight all three at once so they're all helping their sisters or whatever it's pretty cool we're gonna fight them right after i go to the bathroom because i have to poop and also my throat is killing me dude i don't i don't know what's going on here chaos actually hasn't given me the power to kill you in fact he's actually made me a little bit weaker currently ready freaking hit you with my lightning so there you go that's one of her sisters helping her out not very fair if you ask me but whatever i'm not going to get upset about it 3v1 kind of cheap yo and i will say this i certainly hope by uh i complete this otherwise well you guys aren't going to see this i've been winning too much to not show you guys what it looks like to finally win because that was the whole point i was like man i actually don't suck at this game anymore i should make a video on it um so it oh fudge i just got hit by a trap with the increased trap damage oh now everything's going horribly oh everything hurts frickin throw this heal heal oh what when did i do that much damage okay all right okay because i will say even if i've lost runs recently i literally have not not made it to the end um if i lose it's always at the final boss now and you know yeah it just feels good because for a while i was like man why do i just suck at hades but how do people do this and then some just clicked and then i'm like oh wait hey look at me go mom throw them as they spawn quick quick as a flash oh we got a little ah nice little deflect there me i'm nuts all right see we're almost half health back then we're we're making this is the one thing i like about guanyu you know as long as i don't use one of my death defiance which bottom left is the little head of me i've essentially gotten enough upgrades to that the first three times i die in a run it doesn't mean uh the end of a run so as long as i don't end up having to use one of those i'm usually able to life steal my yeah see i'm already full health usually able to life steal my way back up which is nice especially stronger and can deflect your abilities that can deflect also expose when you deflect the tax it deals more damage uh sure let's just go with that you know i oh another chaos gate heck yeah man it's it's chaos is always a little ballsy let's just be real get him off spawn easy peasy scream oh my gosh screw all you guys what's that big idea here oh i'm full health easy skirt where's this last guy huh hey what's that big idea here watch for that bob grab that i'm nuts this is the boss level isn't it what up ares okay special place doom or take damage but after using death defines do more damage than encounter let's go with after taking damage i inflict doom sure i want to save my special slot for something better although i might not but it's on to the bone hydra i don't think we are it's been many a times we've fought hydra and you've yet to win and you know surprise today's not that day either yo this thing does so much damage though all right first phase of the boss on oh god use my cast freaking lava lava lava i don't like this lava lava lava i don't like this you have no more tricks up your sleeve i'm afraid you fall fiend bop bop bop throw those casts boom oh wait what let's let jesus take the wheel boom trying to add that for a dramatic fact and then he wasn't dying and it was awkward we still got five and a half minutes actually falling a little behind pace probably because you know i'm talking and stuff for shame mr fruit for shame we made it to elysium and you know instead of getting max health which as we know will give me um nothing pretty much i'll just go in here and get some gold let me just kill this thing then they'll stop respawning okay let me kill you i will not let you respawn oh my god stop with your little bow and arrow [ __ ] what was that what is going on i was full health like a second ago make it stop okay and somehow we're fine we're cool we're cool totally fine uh whenever you cast damage froze around your boons become calm and then gain rarity every three encounters i'm just gonna go specialist you're stronger and it flicks chill now because i'm not sure i'm going to find any other one for special so i just have to give in but here we are elysium's boss fine yikes with how low health i have it's going to be a miracle if i don't die but once the thing i got to fight both of them bro it's uh it ain't cool you know it ain't gucci i'm not a big fan a fudge so i'm just gonna have to life steal as much as possible because when they hit they hurt so fudge you see that hit me twice i'm nearly dead okay but i actually think i deflected this thing so that's nice ah i didn't deflect that what's going on i just don't have any time to freaking ah i have one health holy suck this is going so poorly i need to at least kill this guy come on kill my god wow i i'm so sad this i swear this doesn't happen spoilers though i don't think i can get through my dad without using the death defines this is so bad i should i think i got honestly the reason i'm dead here is because i got greedy with my freaking artifact keepsake whatever if i done the other ones oh no this one in the final encounter aka the boss fight of each region i take zero damage to first five times i get hit wouldn't that have been nice and also there's a rare chance to refill one of my death defiants that would have been nice i'm out of here all around it's looking real bad with having one health regenerate and i only have 60 health that's straight up like two hits from a boss you know what screw i'm just going to stubborn roots who needs step defiances am i right if we could just not do whatever there's going on over there dash strike death strike triple triple strike little little right i might have to go typical combat here instead of a guan you style i might have to go mash everything against my keyboard style usually the style i like to play when i use the shield very effective very effective get away from me hey boo-boo life is like a picnic a basket die a boo-boo all right we're back to full health we're nuts we're nuts we're nuts we're gonna grab this stuff we're going baby we're speed running this actually this is one of my might ah everything hurts one of my slower runs too just all around you know i'm in a bit of a funk right now okay guys don't no hate on me it happens to the best of us night oh i guess i wouldn't have enough money there was a chance i could replenish the death defiance but it cost 200 gold anyway oh we did it okay let me get my boon from aries i'm using death to find steal more damage i encounter i might need to do that yeah it's good whatever okay we take a drink even though i don't need it now i'm headed home i can buy the last palm see look we're able to buy everything about the diamond worth okay um just go with this remember to use my cast during the boss fight give cerberus his treats yo get out of my way boy i don't want to hurt you you're the best boy hey we don't want neither of us want to do that turbus destroyed his meal in three bites i see because we didn't actually destroy him it's you get it and here it is ladies and gentlemen i'm not gonna lie to you this is gonna be very tough i don't have that much faith in myself confronting you like this shut up dad i've been here so many times oh okay okay okay i gotta play like a god almost like hades god of death i'm the prince after all as much as i don't need the lifesteal the amount of damage this does is nuts just that it takes so long to wind up much does that do oh wow that actually has a lot more damage i'm going to give it credit for oh you're going to call in some backup yeah pleb oh no it's because i'm using my i've used up a lot of my boon too dang see i think my shield just dropped so now every time he hits me from now on it's actually going to hit me yep there's and so it begins it's fine he's going to try and surprise me not today must life steal must not use that defense okay i use my greater call just makes me impervious that's all that matters flex the life still life still i made it out of clay life's the life the lifesteal fudge fudge fudge oh no no freaking penis pump looking snake looking the fudge oh screw you you're not my real dad well i mean you are but i rebuke you or whatever oh fudge me man by the way there's two phases to this fight so i'm not feeling great i need to kill the oh my god look at the aoe on this dude are they doing this boy oh one hit away boys ain't looking great [Music] uh okay i swear this never happens uh just performers anxiety or um it's uh failure to perform is i'm gonna be back okay let me know what you guys you better like the heck out of this video because next time is my redemption arc god that's so embarrassing like i wish i could show you the stat straight up that's probably the second run i failed out of the last like 15. it was the guan you if i hadn't used the it was just too ballsy it's too ballsy next time i won't use the guan you oh this is so embarrassing [Music] [Music] you
