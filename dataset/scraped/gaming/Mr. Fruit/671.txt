Jiji over easy that's the podcast you're listening to currently boy why don't you say hidey ho well cuz I did I remembered that I said it after went after they're gonna hear that I said it so I'm not gonna double say it like I usually do I remembered episode 33 we talked about some stuff I you know I was getting some people are like you shouldn't do a dead row it ruins but like I feel like aside from the fact that I'm losing my voice I feel like it's good you know let people know what's in the podcast if they maybe want to see if they're interested I don't know some people are like it ruins the surprise so we're throwing it TTT spoiler free intro baby throat I just farted bro I just remember that one he did like in the room dude it was bad he puts me to shame sometimes high 80 hope you and my name's mr. Furth and welcome back to the one the only the highly loved acclaimed infamous podcast that was pretty good GG over easy I was gonna make a self-deprecating joke for us but no now we deserve know we're doing we're great coming to you from a box yeah you know what quarantine came along and we're like no it's not stopping us this isn't like a positive term it's like your block yeah but like but like we're cut well like I say Rob's infamous no usually it's your infamous very like notorious like so you did something and that's why you're yes not like in a good way like I think notorious would be the good one now I have to sorry is good oh yeah infamous well-known for some bad quality or deed so actually I think that's pretty fitting yeah and it makes it seem a G than most part oh we're different but see if I say notorious famous or we're all known typically for what also for some bad quality or deed what the fudge alright nevermind information the Tories are the exact same thing but we don't want to say famous because then like we don't we look like we're conceited yeah you look up synonyms or famous let's find one that's really fits this acclaimed I think I said that though brilliant distinguished English that's not the worst excellent I wonder there's a pretty glorious grand grand honoured oh this one's good illustrious for some reason I think of steampunk : one because I see I hear a lustrous and I think which is the opposite yeah I know influential clearly the ripples we have on on the world is insane actually Joe Rogan gets in a lot of trouble for that because he people complain that you the JRE Joe Rogan experience whatever his podcast obviously he has millions of millions of millions of people listening every episode I would die for I rest my case and a lot of that like his biggest demographic is like young male like young adult male but like like 20 to 35 it's like is his main thing and people complained about his influence and what he does and so when he talks like politics or brings on certain people and then says certain things he influences him and he got in trouble recently for a political comment he made about the presidential candidate wall oh yeah assumingly the to the Democratic presidential nominee and the Republican he said something we don't want to get too political here so I didn't bother mentioning it but like just like that he got flack because he said his opinion and then that's gonna ripple and then people didn't I say something about 3d printing Cole and it was trending on Twitter yeah and suddenly everyone's like get get on this right now they're like they're a vaccine no this cold right now put that number one priority read ePrint Maxine I was gonna say that if we have any influence let it be that memorable so all the doctors listening right now okay see this see a synonym for famous though is notorious okay but it's a synonym in that's similar and that you are famous just not for some no that wouldn't listen I'm too famous then I feel you if you go both I know we're not famous we don't have no check marks on Twitter that's how I know we are not famous that's when I've given up bro you take another step a lot of people got verified you dad Oh our boy do you know what you know you're longer we can't assume at least we have one of us one of us got it right old dude yeah yeah it makes no your point of shark oh that guy in the extended dream team chat I told him like oh sorry dude this is for plebs only we got to kick him out now like you gotta kick we can't have verified people in here bro come on oh did you know like no matter what even if somebody has notifications off on their phone they get notified that someone oh yeah super annoying that's why I want to do just start bugging everybody like hit up Joe Rogan bbbbb preeminent pre-eminent is that that really like something bad is about to happen though no that would be like pre-eminent like there's a preeminent danger coming pre-eminent surpassing all others very distinguished in some way I think you just mean a medium like there's an eminent threat on the way what's the difference between that word in the word you just said and preeminent means for passing all others very distinguished in some way what I'm thinking of I assume imminent but they sound the same a pre bit okay one snap word uh what else we had to come up with we you need something we need to we need to settle on remarkable we need something that has the literation because studies show with alliteration okay they're better to remember it the glorious GG overeasy the grand GG overeasy the great GTV win I don't know claimed because we are a nine star podcast so I feel like I thought were nine and a half now maybe even tail where's like sixteen oh wow stocks are going up huh opposite opposite the other one realize I'll have you all known I just set up my very first Charles Schwab account oh yeah dude me too I just like like do you want was everyone everyone sane like right now I'm getting stock advice I've never done it so I haven't done anything but I made it just in case stocks I really do they're scary wait where did you were see track right in elementary school did you ever do like the stock thing in sixth grade like they teach you about the stock market and stuff like that that's seventh grade it was sweet all I remember is like they taught you about stocks and then like you could invest your stock like you can invest your fake money into stock and then the next day bonds show if your stock went up or down I was like this is my resident everything in a way that like 30% and I was I was Palomino you weren't alright uh I was Caspian well I'm thinking this was like sixth grade so this was like a track B track sixth grade I remember there being tracked in elementary school there was because I was in the trailers I was - mr. Li had I had the trailer adjacent to you I don't know it's not important anyway we'll just settle on the greatest podcaster ever was did you amazing yeah okay yeah great and speaking of the greatest podcast the code reviews oh no we're ten minutes in get together buddy the world's the world's the world's on fire but not our podcast all right so we'll see the 112 stars review by Giblin every week island forward to an exciting co-creating Sun sneezing video game talking and just fun-filled podcast with enjoyable banter between three friends that can't follow an agenda really do suggest this podcast because it's the only podcast around that really deserves 112 stars I was like what does that mean I will say though we're pretty sure Claire is currently in the throes of the kovat 19 no and I have started dry coughing so it ain't great but you know it's it's fine I mean I know I guess the walls see I don't know from its like how would we have gotten it's either to somehow in the grocery store or like people delivering the food that's the I mean God anyway well how often do you guys get food delivered to you like every meal uh like once a day okay house how sick we talk like I mean just all the symptoms of like seemed is darn good hey I have symptoms or like or like pollen it's like paw and read the room like leave but yeah okay pollen there's a lot bigger things going on but um I mean it's so hard cuz like it just takes one person delivering to be like not sanitary than moat well yeah it's it I don't know man like well my parents were like we need like so we were doing I was doing D&D and I got a text from my parents and it's from my stepmom and she's like Robert come upstairs I was like I'm I'm a scout ro I'm Claude the shadows Robert is not even a real person who's come upstairs and I was like I can't I was like I'm literally in the middle of initiative right now I just rolled an issue and my dad and then my dad texted me my dad doesn't text and he's like come upstairs like oh [ __ ] okay my be my be okay so I get out there in these legs we need to have a plane I was like oh my god what kind of plan are we talking about you guys we need a plan in case one of us get sick we're going in the basement and I was like what I was like that's okay first of all that's like the worst idea ever and they're like why Robert how come like you have such the best ideas than any idea we ever had his back and I was like because there's no bathroom downstairs it's like if anybody's got them in their sick they literally have to walk all the way upstairs past everybody's room to go to the bathroom well you mean I your point should have been because are they trying to quarantine yeah like if anybody gets like sick yeah okay then at that point everyone else would already have it because they're gonna show symptoms two weeks later yeah that's why I said totally true but most part I mean they'll still need a quarantine room in your house you stay your dad is right everyone does need if someone in the house does get it there does need to be like a quarantine room we're close we decided on that the master bedroom so okay all right I'm getting sick in the head no that's a bathroom in there they're like the best idea because then they were like we gotta like move stuff into Eric's room if anything like happens it's like why do we have to do that I was like just go upstairs into your own room and just stay there it's like that's just how it goes I think you just give whoever sick a suitcase and don't just start walking never look like she's had everything fever difficulty breathing dry cough they went through the I'm trying to look at all the symptoms she did that and in stage she called a doctor and of course you can't get test it unless you're high risk so so [ __ ] backwards dude any and then but then the other thing was like you can come in for testing if it's like an emergency like you have to go to the ER and it's like that point what's what's the point but then like I'm just gonna go there with other people who might maybe do actually have it so now I for sure have it you know what I mean it's just so we couldn't tell she has asthma too so do i so they like sent over an inhaler and she's been quarantined in quarantine I have thrown holy water everywhere we're fine and you know what been sleeping by myself these past few nights they're real Romi it's phased way cooler just saying anyway so yeah I think I'm I might start seeing symptoms but like there's been so many times - I don't know if for all I know I've already gone through it and I was just asymptomatic who really knows but yeah like if Claire's showing it now GG I have it like it's but uh but I mean certainly oh I mean you guys I mean Claire and I ya know however she got it I got it I mean we've been with each other like no that's right I got a germ exiting right here brother and this thing white gold practically white I started like like weighing everything where it's like oh like if things go south like this hand sanitizers like this is the new Oh like hand soap this is this is worth a lot of money I could sell this like for like loot and stuff like if the apocalypse game first up like an ek like that like one hand sanitizer one AKD like I'd like squeeze some of it onto my hand yesterday like I think I got like dominoes so like after I got my Domino's I like squeeze some of it and I put way too much I was like oh I'm trying to put it back not too much - drips I'll trade you three of your chickens for 2 ounces of German yes yes please take it all there egg-laying like chickens - what's their highest fever been like 100 and like wha when we last flickers like I mean this was like a day ago or something ninety-nine point eight I think it's not bad as long as what is it as long as it is to go 105 and that's well yeah I mean if you're like 102 102 or 3 that's you gotta go in it doesn't matter if you have the Cova - yeah that's just - I - darn high I don't think I've had a fever like that a long time but but I mean like that's like we're not worried that we're not really at risk aside from asthma which some people it seems to be shown - like even in our age group asthma doesn't play much of a factor anyway so I'm not like worried if we have it which is not like Oh Clayton it's just kinda like trying to reduce as much as we can well my parents are in Florida they've been there for like a month they they had to go down there right before the quarantine and then they just kind of got stuck down there they can't leave no and then uh and then my brother is here we've let him know Oh how's Ethan feeling he's feeling fine feeling fantastic that's but uh it's crazy how I'm and this whole thing what are they just so easy to spread can we can we update the numbers can we like remember that one podcast we did we were like hey there's this thing like Chrome like let's look up like what would actually like that like they probably dint did I predict like a 10 million - yeah I mean at this point if they follow this I mean that exponential curve would have find it eventually but we're not on part of that but like stretched out no no we're getting there Plus that initial exponential number chart actually doesn't look too far off from America's numbers right now which is kind of scary well the other thing too is it's probably close to what Wuhan was experiencing but we all know they completely lied about and are still lying about numbers America is doing the exact same thing - so it doesn't really matter everyone's lying to not look bad but when they go like we haven't had a case all day my wall yeah you're telling me poohbear that not one person coughs today who do you think pays for this YouTube member watch it oh sorry sorry sorry we love you No well that's the thing like even about America we have way more cases it's just like in this case like Claire probably has it but she won't be counted because you can't get tested we have a lack of testing and then on top of that people aren't being completely transparent like there's a whole bunch of people talking about hospitals like hospitals we'll share numbers inside their building or whatever like within their members and stuff like everyday or whatever but they tell it you can't tell anyone these numbers or all just kind of stuff and we look at New York right now and it's just crazy New York's getting boned and it sucks to see and the thing is um if this people are talking if this virus doesn't leave like if it comes back and fall it's going to be even worse apparently so let's hope that doesn't have like like I'd have to read up on it again but Claire's dad also works on the medical side with the government branches and stuff and he was saying about papers he's been reading and stuff he's very smart in fact he's one he wants some important awards I should probably remember the name of yeah no I think you won the Pulitzer Prize dude I'm gonna ask you something and I don't mean to stress you out okay have you thought about your wedding bro okay well let's just get into that real quick people you can't get refunds for anything right now even if we like oh like we're not sure what's gonna happen maybe we should like postpone it or like change it or something unless the government it like says officially during that time like you can't have because right now like let's say because Colorado extended it like April 26 currently which I'd be surprised if it doesn't get extended yeah but up until like the 26 right now if let's say our wedding was April 20th we could get a full refund because like the government is officially not like you can't have gatherings of this you can't go out bah bah I can't no more than 10 people right but if it's not breaking the law if I hold this event yeah but if it's not official or like or it's just like guidelines or something coming back because you have to think like let's say maybe things start to slowly get lifted August very well could be at a time where they're like all right a lot of stuff is slowly coming back maybe they don't outright do that and if that's the case we got to do it or we just don't get our money and they won't like deposits and won't give anything back unless the very specific case of government will really says like no you can't because the dumb thing too is even if we do hold it I wouldn't blame I'm sure there can be plenty of people who don't even want it people who don't even want to be like in a crowd of people and a lot of them not only bad I have to fly and stuff and I wouldn't blame them for me like nah which socks do that's like yeah and and now it's like in August where it's like kind of there but like just far enough but people think it would be normal is it but I mean even then I think most people who I hope it's normal and everything it is and I would love for it to be but I don't see it happening 2020 sucks it's so terrible started a decade though I saw like this tweet and it was like somebody just like looking down like this and it was like I really wish I wasn't living in a very historic moment in time in history ok it's all it's all fun and well bullying no big deal just from Millennials going through their say it might collapse and then we still have to like plan for the wedding like it's going to happen so we still have to get like I know no bachelor party it's been yeah well like Claire was like we were thinking New Orleans which like now what she was like and it's also like really hot in New Orleans Rob I was like oh my god like that being would like that's at least of our worries right thank you never mind all that other stuff I mean we can have a bachelor party but it's gonna have to be one of those boomers zoom parties you know I you know it's unfortunate it's actually funny because you say that because I think it was arias who joked about it not this pax but the previous packs when I went there he's like what do you think about like for your bachelor parties I don't know and he joked like what if we just all meet and discord play some games except you'll put it in the DM and shark will say he'll come when everyone's there but no one's joining I'm and I'm in my car it's Rob's like that and no one shows up yeah and it's like and then it just never happens but yeah that's and unfortunately my that might just be it no that might actually be your bachelor party now what feels bad that's right plus we can always hold up post just you know like a year later be like a bad report I tell you this it'll be a lot easier getting everybody in there than it was getting my family that this quarter call dude that was seriously so frustrating so like for all the people out there if you guys have families who like don't know how to use technology you're not alone it seriously like my stepmom was like I wanna have a board game night and I was like okay like how do you want to set that up she goes I won't play quit equipped splash and I was like first of all it's not quick splash splash and I'm not making this up she's like I won't play quit splash she said all right I'll make you guys at this chord and all this kind of stuff dude when they minimize the window like I'm gonna minimize there my window discord and I'm gonna act like they do Robert Robert I push something and it's all gone I push something and it's all gone I'm like you just click on the thing again like click on what like are the discs or thing what is it discord a thing good thing it's the thing that looks like a little alien okay okay okay I see well how do I get the four boxes on the thing I can only just see you okay so this would use you to click on the webcam okay bye kids I don't see it well you're gonna have to move the mouse over the webcam thing okay well I can't do it I'm not feeding you it was like that with my parents so I was like okay but their parents they're boomers like the last time they did this was like Skype like my dad still has a Skype he's like why not just do this over Skype and I was like a hard dad dad come on now that's so dreamteam 2014 come yeah so I'm like okay so now I'll get my stepbrothers in here and they're like they're like my age so I was like this will be easy it was like even like holy well like my step-brother like Gary unlike yo dude like let's uh like let's do discord and he's like well I can't download it so I have to use the browser but like if you use the browser you can't see people's webcams pop-up he's like it's just loading for me like getting pissed and I'm like dude it's not loaded because you're in the browser like can you download like the program he goes well whenever I download something I can't download it because it wants an admin password and he's like and I don't know what that is how do you not know what your admin password is to your own computer I don't know what it is like it sounds like you've never download anything I know like what the [ __ ] is my family like what is this and then like he's like well let's just try Google Hangouts and I was like oh so we and we mind you we have everybody in the discord all either and like I'm setting this up I'm running up and down the stairs like Meredith and like this and I can't see Mitchell I can't say I'm running up and down the Quinta we're we're an hour and a half into this you haven't played a single [ __ ] game a quit plan quiz splash and dude and then like I'm looking at my dad and he's like my dad's like why don't you guys just talk and I was like I don't know cuz Meredith wants to play the game and I looked at it I go and I go and we haven't even got to the quick clash part and I was like once everybody gets in here I was like I can't wait to explain to everybody to open up a new browser window open up a new tab and type in at jackbox dot TV and to look at my screen and to type in the code name and I was like we haven't even gotten to that part it downstairs I go okay so we're gonna open up a new window for every I recorded it I recorded it on my OBS cuz I could not believe like what I see I actually have footage of my family like in the background playing quick clash when we finally got it going dude like we started at seven o'clock when it cut from 7:00 to 7:30 it turned into everybody giving up and saying oh let's just do it tomorrow and I was like no we're doing this now like if we're attendees up I think yeah exactly where say we're going like we're here like we're not giving up and then like 7:30 to 8:30 or 7:30 to 8:00 was like trying to get discord to work 8:00 to 8:15 was going to Google Hangouts 8:15 to 8:30 was going back to this Court 8:30 the 9 o'clock was getting everybody set up with a house party which my sister recommended which I've never heard before so I'm given all these people my access to my webcam my microphone all this [ __ ] and then from like 9 to 10 it's like just [ __ ] let Robert what's your screen like I can't see it wait we can't hear anything how do you turn out it was like it's like overwatch costume games when I go all right you guys hear the rules and I get done are you guys know what you're doing no I wasn't listening what she would live like anybody like minimizing they Beck what what happened well that you would think like a nuclear codes were leaked like it was just so ridiculous and then so if you had any families as they're going through the zoom and or whatever just know you're not alone and I hate my life cuz it's just like when we have to meet up now it's discord and then dig hate it I hate it but you know what I don't hate Rob what the sad nice I mean just look around you right now there's wires

/gg thank you Ray Khan for sponsoring this podcast and thank you guys for listening welcome back to the Zoomer boomer millennial X or whatever all the names are uh it's funny you mention that because I will be playing jackpot games as well tonight with all my brothers and same thig like I have a brother younger than me yeah like a year and a half right then I have one four years older uh like six and nine all pretty Tecna water pretty despair yeah but like technological set I mean like my oldest good one my oldest brother is we're like an IT consultant for like hospitals the one before that he was literally like a cyber hacker for the Air Force and then my older brother there's a lot of older brothers the least oldest brother what I saw bored um he um he teaches himself everything he knows how to like code some stuff he does all this excel programming all this kind of stuff right and then my younger brother well you know he's younger he's Craig's 90s like Craig's nine Zoomer he actually yesterday for like an hour of the cash Cup he was second in the world really yeah go on then so anyway all pretty Fabian yeah I remember like a year ago I told my fortnight crankin brother but hey like meat on discord same thing did you would have thought that he's never used a phone before that's like it's not this like just pulled up he said I understand what do i do where I'm on it wait how do I I need a minute how do I get in a voice Channel wait I only see how do I join you it's like bruh and then he gets into things like I only see like announcements no you got your likes cross and they but I don't and then he couldn't hear anything and then he couldn't talk and I was so if that's anything of a preview of my other brothers like you would think it should be like about of being about a boom because they all said like hey let's do zoom and I said hey how about I don't just give out all my information and let's play discord instead so and then like I was like guys it's so easy like I'll literally livestream like my screen and like you can literally see everything it'll be a big thing and you guys can hear each other and like your webcams and everything and I was like and I'll make our own little family discord I literally have VND Venegas family discord and they're all added and it literally just went to [ __ ] and like would it be bft oh yeah VFD yeah my bad without the VND you know yeah dyslexia man well what if but they're like you know what what if instead we just send out the quiz splash questions by Raven and it's slowly no I couldn't even imagine well the thing to like when we're playing quick not only would that be difficult but then playing the Jack barks games I can't imagine how much would just go over their heads cuz imma be honest which can be interesting because I'm gonna play it like you know like we play it oh yeah my family probably super nor me what would suck to is like this [ __ ] stupid party app that we were using like didn't allow me to like my screen share didn't have audio so like I had to explain the rules and like read the questions and stuff and then like everyone's like hold on I can't hear Robert like whole lot of Robert what do you say oh my god I really hope your discord call goes way better than mine ever did because then like when you make a call this is the one thing about this square that is kind of confusing when you start like a call like we're in right now it starts like its own thing like you can't just add somebody to the thing and like it creates off of that it creates like a whole new thing so like if I add a blue to a call and then added you it wouldn't just add you to that little group think it would make a whole new thing that blue has to join out to like and then that was like weird because it's like I can't join the call I don't see anybody what do I do and I was like this wouldn't have happened if we all just joined the family discord well speaking of hate in your life I don't hate this stuff there's a rut about it Jesus Wow rapid fire in here no let's move on to a hot-button topic for the most part right now if had a run hey just valor right I know I said it we not important I have never had to sell my soul more than I had to sell my soul about it and I'm and I'm not proud of it but it was done and I it was worth it because it's sick I have a lot of fun with it granted I do get very pissed yes super I haven't seen you that angry would early it would be like first game five rounds it's what you like here I'm in the background like I know it's over like doors like won first game yeah it's more about game like it but I want to get like so good at it I wanted like I want to get like it's fun and like I'm addicted to it I mean I would say addicted to it I like some aspects of csgo more than I like some aspects of our but it's still like a ton of fun and I'm having a lot of fun getting good at it and teaching my friends that not to always a pout and that you can just hold an angle for a little bit you know it may be a little boring for a little bit but watching an angle and having them come to you on CT side is better than just pulling w key well what do you like more and kind of strike compared to Valerie and vice-versa I like that like the abit like the fact that everybody in csgo has the same ability like I feel like there isn't like everybody's kid by a smoke and a flash and all that kind of stuff and I think like when you throw a flashbang or like in csgo and like you blind somebody I think you have a better idea of if you knew if you know you blinded that person from where you threw it and like that they I can't look at it or something but like if you look at the phoenixes flash and that he just goes like and it goes around a thing and if it is in your area like if you just like see it you're flashed you know but with my paranoia on omen I have to look exactly Adam maybe even through a wall and hit it through a wall and then it has to hit him directly through the thing not the sides of it like it has to go directly like through him his hitbox and it blinds them but it's as good as the blind or easy of a blind to pull off as the phoenixes well I think it's more powerful huh well yeah because they they can only see like five feet out other than probably three seconds and they don't have a minimap blind though like I mean but but I'm pretty sure that comes down to the fact that his kid is very aggressive whereas yours you have ridiculous smoke scoot along with your kid so if your blind was as easy uses his that I mean you would kind of be like like what's the point of playing other characters yeah plus phoenixes though like well I does blind you it's like ah I can see again it's so yeah it's very short yeah it's super jank to you sometimes and mine's what three seconds yeah it's still that's a long time and you also have crazy smokes in a teleport ability like yeah I'm jealous of you I do love I do love that smoke throw smoke in front of me stand in to smoke those smoke out in front of me and then teleport to that smoke in front of me so they think I'm in my old smoke but I'm in my new smoke another kid can you just walk through the two smokes well no I throw a gap in between the smokes so like there is like a seeable gap like so I teleport from my smoke to the other one and there's a clear gap like they're not together like yeah I could walk through him if they were touching but there's a big gap between it it's sick it's a lot of fun I like omen a lot that's the only character I've been playing now I'm just one tricking for the time being I respected I do like the thing I like that valour does the csgo doesn't is that each side has the same weapons I like that I do like that yeah cuz then like you're not T sided with the [ __ ] Krieg God that kind of so broken literally literally ruins like seat like m4 versa Krieg it's insane it's so done so that way it eliminates some of that and it's more so just how you utilize your character's abilities at whether you're T or XI T and then obviously like your strategy instead of just like oh well if I had that gun on this side I would have won that you know or something like that well and I I get very angry cuz like every game feels like a ranked game in the sense of like I'm trying to get like better and I'm trying to like I think like once the game is out and it has like a ranked and a casual playlist and I play like the casual play looks like with my friends and like all that kind of stuff and then what I'm playing the ranked one it's like alright like let's square up yeah like I'm gonna be real with you like if I miss I'm a thin to let you know like like be prepared but like if it's a schedule like and that's why I like these games like I always feel like they're just like ranked games and even though they're not at all cuz i only play ranked on csgo too but i'm having a ton of fun with it have you played more than that one game that or two games that we played blue what you only play those two games hello grammarians with you our it has not been kind to me yeah start off with hey guys I got you code fruit and I'm just like so then I was like well I guess I'll streams well what you don't I mean so hey Ferg you got code to my uh well I guess I'm just sitting a stream I hope I get help I get access to that I guess and then I sit in the stream and I'm just like I would do this and then I play two games and I'm like I'm not gonna play this well do you not like it I'm hurting out I'm already out I'm already out it's not even with first-week a beta 2 you can still get in I mean but I clearly though if that's how you feel there's something else preventing you like do you just not like it I can't even get a code to get in and I don't want to play them I mean other people's accounts are cool but I really want to play out mine are you sure you're not in I'm never gonna get out I'm not I literally have done everything like you're in like it says you're out you're not in so I've given up okay but because I would also argue that yeah like you you could start time it's not even first week of closed beta don't give me plenty of time it's you'll play it eventually because everybody in math class will eventually start playing okay well it's a lot easier to say well you're in the game and you don't have to sit in streams and you never had to sit and dream so I mean like I said streams - I actually got a code well you said streams one day and welcome to me it's been about a week I sold I mean we all sold our souls I can't believe that you're not in it I really can't I've read truly Vimala they followed all the stuff that's on say like did you message them I message them like where it's wind what you really dive already DM them I haven't gotten a response I just kept it up not relevant anymore and I'm just gonna sit in the stream Cosley watching sequel right now and you know hopefully hopefully one day I get in but if not I'll just accept my place as the least relevant player well I'll have you know I was [ __ ] in streams to try and get you a code and then it's like you got a drop I was like yes and then I realized it's not a code it would've just immediately linked my account which was already like yeah yeah so I wasn't like oh I can get no I can't give this to blue so I did try I'll have you know well no I'm saying but I thought originally like they would just be like here's a code so I could just give you it to give it to you yeah yeah I thought they'd be like here enter this on your riot account not just oh it's that right account is now it's linked I don't like that by the way just like just just send an email out like just like doing this hold twitch drops things to get into a beta summit wonder you would disagree he's hovering quarter of a million viewers like every day now and then but then like it's like don't I have a better chance if I go watch somebody who has drops enabled and has like 500 viewers like that's what I know it's just a pool apparently like as as once you've watched like two hours actively which means that don't know like if you if you have a stream up muted like that doesn't count twitch knows you're not it's muted and so like they don't count that as a view but if you watch them for at least two hours it essentially from what I understand it just puts you in the lottery essentially and then from there your random I get it or not I don't know so like I I like it a lot and I think you guys are finally finally turning the corner of learning the the slow and patient play guys you guys whatever you guy hey you see my ace today I did see your ace that was nice that was very nice I've had a lot of four pieces but I never had an ace until then I got that ace yesterday dude blood choked so mad at myself I'm definitely all right no you go ahead okay well like and then and that's what I love about this game is like I feel like everyone's grabs raging again yeah it's just like I finally care about being good and like learning and adapting to a game finally like it's like a good feeling to like suck at something and wanted to be good at it you know and I mean like knowing that like I'm at this point and I know I could be at that point being a way better player and then it's just a sick and cool feeling even though I'm not trying to go [ __ ] pro or anything like I know that's not gonna happen I got signed I didn't tell you oh you did yeah I do like that's a super new jungler Dana well I was like I gotta get decent it'll be fun to learn I can make some content and it ain't looking great right now chief I'm talking about those stands out there listening please watch the okay so but everyone here knows this though it's not csgo is not a youtube game so valor it's not gonna be a youtube game it's a witch game that's what I'm saying why don't we just put the drops on YouTube because I'd be all about it that would be tight but that also be ridiculous you know well know that they're a huge like siege and go channels you can't like people don't really want to see just like full games I tried one today because people get but I did like highlights which people like like highlights or funny moments and tactical shooters plus there's a lot of hype so I was like oh the very least like we'll see but not even first video was like it was under me below average is a great YouTube game csgo is not a like csgo is only great if you already deep into like you know exactly what's happening in csgo see just like very watchable regardless if you know the game or not that's like I feel like csgo is super viewer friendly for the arm stream sure but that's because people who everyone who wants to watch what's going on csgo is watching it as it's happening I love CSKA but I do not watch any csgo youtubers yeah exactly rob is a great example in this because like I place there like this I don't I don't watch destiny too well the only kind of like things like watch me CS goes case openings and you know I mean like you don't we don't want to be well shoot right when you add in K so and then now with I would okay now I'm down now I'm all the sudden I'm Watson Ballard videos feels bad it just sucks because one it means I can't put as much time into it and two I have no idea what what the next thing will be for the Train because there's nothing on horizon I'm just looking on I'm just like just looking see us go up on on YouTube it's like it's all like highlights like whoa simple simple hits this OH shroud NSYNC like there's no actual csgo content creators they're all on Twitch yeah it just depends on the unfortunately the community that and I mean csgo has always been twitch so the community is always just gonna I'm going to twitch see you guys this it say everybody happen well please because YouTube revenue really non-existent but that's not important this base is bad out there well I I'm having a ton of fun I think it's a lot of fun and I can't wait for its full release I can't believe people are like e the graphics look bad like when you expect like graphics I don't know III hate that excuse of the graphics looks stupid like I mean competitive game the graphics have to be accessible to everyone that's like I honestly don't think they're bad style I think they look great yeah but they're definitely not cutting edge but the art sounds cool yeah I mean they're not yeah it's not breaking barriers or anything now do you guys see this being an eSport like do you enjoy well now would you watch this like would you watch a TSM valiant versa thieves let's absolutely you would probably too because like I've now played it and invested into it whereas I head in with Counter Strike but even then I'd find myself watching Counter Strike sometimes so I'm one I'd really like to watch it too because as a player it'd be interesting to watch and see what the pros do right like that's what I can yeah he's playing he's playing sledge I love sledge how the fudge does he use them because I suck with him like oh he he does that there and he uses like that so it'd be twofold and they'd be entertained but I'd also be able to learn stuff it's what I used to do watching like LCS when I played League I still do but well that's what like I don't play league at all and I still like to watch the league a lot like I was watching Tyler one stream yesterday and he was getting like coached by like this jungle guy and it was seriously so interesting to like hear what the coach says and stuff like that and then I was also watching the LCS split 100 these vs. TSM because I like to watch the big the big TSM games because I knew almost chokeboys freaking out like about to throw up because yeah that one was a series where I was like I was literally watching tonight and I was like every like series that I watched TSM chokes tank well they've been on the bus you missed they're like gold in there and dude it's not important oh like Reggie in them well well I mean when Reggie was on the team but then also not like literally up until like year and a half go two maybe two years we were like always undisputed practically number one and then I always go in and then Steve and teamliquid got the Disney money they bought a superstar team we made some terrible trades and it's all gone on him but that's not important that's entirely different thing I also think it will 100% be any sport because that's would re what rights designed it to be and also we speak of LCS that's right they have a whole infrastructure with League of Legends with the league championship series so I imagine they're gonna do the exact same thing and make a big league with Valerie and with their history their experience and their money I don't see how this is not even no other game is going to be getting orgs like leading to them than this game and I also came in probably the past five years will get it works pleading to them amending the way that riot wants them to because I guess like fortnight but does a little different I mean four night before night before that was more na though I feel like it yeah and get like the Asia market yeah the the whole point of valorn is to hit like a Glock finally hit like a global because even csgo doesn't hit new markets at all it's may not even if you look at it CS goes na it's pretty trashed mainly Europe yeah it's it's EU for sure but so yeah that's why I was gonna bring up to Val rant because it's right initially already has the advantage of potentially being a global game because like right now I'm a varietal own yeah enough to get people to play it and like for them this is like oh right games made a second game that's not League of Legends like this is their first like true new IP people are checking that on that alone and then yeah because like in a really we've never had a huge FPS like the closer we probably have is like Call of Duty yeah he has well yet way banging the Halen house joke EU has like counter-strike Asia has like crossfire and some other ones that I was pretty big of a massive yeah but so I'd say the closest thing we've had would be overwatch by the side from overwatch which right now bro I was Lu talking to someone about this the other day I feel like overwatch League killed itself when they went to youtube I don't even hear anything about it anymore likes to play games yeah like all the time that's what that's why I was like wait they're still like doing stuff they must have gotten so much money you know like they're the money must have been so worth like but like it feels like right like yeah but it feels like they sure have like killed everything like yeah like I don't know if they can like well I mean Amazon did for the first light year whatever pay huge amounts cuz they had like the twitch like ticket or whatever they had and like the Bo DS and the all-access pass yeah maybe they're like nah like you can take him Google like I don't want to get if the Easter event isn't on Twitch like I'm not watching it like more often than not but I mean we kind of talked about this too though even as an FPS player even as someone who's played tons of overwatch overwatch League can be pretty boring or hard to follow it's really not a spectator game for sure you really have to play a lot of overwatch to know what's going on but that's why csgo so successful is you don't have to be great at csgo to see what exactly what's going on it's very simple mm-hmm spectator sport and when people watch it I think that while some people like omegle all like this is so boring and slow that's what makes it a better spectating game because of the overwatch the problem is it's like no action no action 5v5 def met ultimate ultimate ultimate like what the fudge okay a team one all right reset nothing nothing where it's like counter-strike it's like oh we say him approaching around the corner holding this I get flash like the action usually isn't too convoluted and it's really suspected cuz like overwatch if you want to understand what happening half the time use on the Skycam looking overhead which doesn't do much justice because like with league of legends I think it's I think we've talked about I get that way with weeks so when I get big team fight happens I have no idea what the [ __ ] is going on like but it looks cool there's a lot of true but like I think they'd vanished there though is like that is that's how the game is played anyway cuz like if you're looking over overwatch like a lot of why you want to watch like a first-person shooter eSport or something is like the people skilled right we've never had yeah you can't even tell like are they hidden shooting there's Ultimates you can't even really appreciate what people are doing and you can see that in league 2 because it's like you have a 1v1 up in top lane you have like a 1v1 amid and then you have the junglers going kind of gainst each other that's why the third about jungle dude is like you can invade the jungler and laminate on their buffs yeah I didn't know that that's what I was learning watch it's why I told you dude it's like 5 b ches and it hurts my brain so like you want to steal like their buffs and like go in there but you can't go too deep because then you may get jumped well yeah that's why like you need you need vision ideally or information like all right there their jungler just it blue and just showed bottom river brush near bottom I can go into red now yeah so like if I'm near top I can quickly run if he hasn't done red let's say grab that or grab his Raptors leave one like counter-jungling he doesn't get as much XP stuff like that and then that's on top of the fact if I my ganking I need to be farming myself which lane you tell but you're falling like when the turret kills the enemies that's technically like econ that that person's missing out on an experience that that person's missing out on so if you're like winning your lane and your turret is killing those little minions that's like a good thing or they know I take a bad thing for you but like a good thing that you're doing to like like to mess up their economy and stuff yeah that's like when I learned in the TSM game when they won Game four and like rolled up or no was it yeah Game four where they just yeah absolutely that sounds like off sick like alright we're back in Game five just on Fiesta Pro yeah but that's why you probably heard the term like freezing lanes you want a for instance like freeze CS if you're if you have a big advantage you can kind of manipulate the minion waves where if you can pull it back closer to your turret but not close enough that the turret actually Agro's the enemy minions then you can freeze your minions right there and if you're not hitting them except for the very last hits you're not gonna push the wave really it's just gonna stay stagnant and then if you have an advantage the enemy that enemy top laner like can't contest and go in because if he goes in for CSU punishment kill him yeah and so if he gets too close or like that's the other thing if you have the minion wave next to your tower there's no gank pressure from their jungler but your jungler could pressure them yes so they have to play safe they can't go in they're gonna miss out sometimes they can to meet close enough for XP this way like you can deny them like that so yeah I can't wait for like those little things to show up in this game like because this is like beta I think there's a lot of things that like are going on hidden or like unnoticed and with like those like from the pros like really get their hands on it and like start like breaking it down and stuff like that that's things I think that's when the game's gonna get really cool it's like when it slows down and everything just kind of relaxes a little bit it'll be really interesting to see strats yeah like open extra clumps yeah I think we tied you by this hole but I think sage is gonna be on every comp ever unless they know for me the healing and the res is too important at the wall which is so annoying it lasts forever and it you literally have to put so many balls on there if you want yeah the the wall and then this is what you kind of talked about it how there's like not feedback if you flash someone for instance like with sage I believe that her name when she throws like this flowy orb if you're in that you heal like yet yeah so you're like oh I know someone's on the ice but like every other ability if you hit him with it nothing you wouldn't know I think that's almost Oh Pete like you shouldn't even be able to hear them yeah is so much going for but I it's so sick though like did you play League of Legends when it was this early in beta or no no beta was like oh nine and I didn't play I played a little 2011 and it didn't really start to actually play like late 2012 like by 2011 like all the medes and I had to play correctly like was already I'm sure like solidified no early the early years of League were fiestas because like what they did at first for the first like two years almost when beta started they were releasing a new champ like every two weeks non-stop and these champs would be broken they'd be insane baby adding new items so the game was just like never figure it out for a really long time I you had rough ideas obviously but like even when you see in competitive league like a couple years goes like man like they figured this out there's nothing new and next like next season they do a little bit a completely different game in the next season they figure out how to do this better a completely different game or like people figure out how to micro better or macro better a just like League still looks exactly the same to me as it did four years ago when I was watching it well see yeah it's like the the more nuanced stuff like for instance like like the very little things like yeah we're like like Keystone masteries that these people are using or these new picks in certain lanes flex packs pick bands more important like how that works the elemental trails game like we're banning sage this game or like that's what I want to see in ranked it's like oh we're gonna ban ohm in this game or we're gonna ban like this one in this one so like they can't have this team call yeah be shocked they may be they may have to introduce more heroes if that's the case then I I mean I'd be shocked if by full release we don't have more I feel like they will how many do we have now ten ten that's enough to do bands I think whoa at did the team of five that band what - yeah yes or you bein razz every [ __ ] time Razia still grass whatever I don't give [ __ ] I hate her so we're liking bowring Hills blue is tore nonviolent but it seems he doesn't but you know when you get witless and when you get an out when your time will be there for you we'll be waiting with open arms we'll help you okay well he's out you're playing apex born a lot though aren't you I like a pig's a lot hmm you got your gloves which is cool how many packs did it take you don't talk about that I don't want to think about that well then didn't someone gift you and you bought like 500 packs whatever so you like guaranteed the rooster fruit yeah just about a hundred packs no 500 rock buddy oh my god cuz yeah you're guaranteed in that fine yeah one out of five hundred pants but you get that heirloom shards and ass so I just picked the Pathfinder look I'm sorry Rob unless I find her too much Pathfinder sick I respect him I was a I was surprised with this new event they didn't add another heirloom I'm really surprised to you this event is well what is the event it's [ __ ] dark well that's that's just map right yeah I read in them like the email or something i I thought there's supposed to be like a mode where it's almost like PV VP but I haven't seen that is you have to go it's like a new place on what it's it's only on I think it's on I think it's on the new map only and it's there's like this area in the new map where you can go and it's like a PV trigger like a PV event but I mean you're still in a game so yeah I really don't they really don't explain that very well at all that would well that would explain it cuz we tried and we were the rotations just ape Kings Canyon yeah I'm like well it's dark it's spooky but like I don't know if that's the update we were confused yeah and I'll say going back to that since we've been playing war zone oh my god it feels like everything's a million miles an hour it's like like no I don't yeah I don't not like it but it's like 15 minutes in there's like three teams left I'm like this is what in in war zone you'd still have a hundred hundred people left and but I'd like both for different reasons like I like that I always feel like there's a million people on the server in war zone I also hate that a game could take 30 40 minutes for a win yeah but at Apex I do like that it's like it could be really fast placed and then a slow kind of mid game and bike picks right back up like it's it's it's not just like a slow burn like I feel what the Call of Duty is like it's just really long but I like them both for different kind of reasons I think like I like modern wool or war zone that it can be so big but there's so many people and so much stuff going on that like there's very rarely down points unless you're purposely trying to camp otherwise you can always find people or like find something to do and a better at it better it wasn't so I think I think that's more fun and the third party and it does exist but I think it's easier to turn around if a third party than it is like apex is also just easier to be at in general like yeah if with apex like if you just don't have your shields in your third party it yeah you're either like you got to hope that they have potato and you're cracked or it's like there's not even GG because if you it cuz like in call duty like there the armor goes away pretty quickly like it's not as much health as like a purple shield is versus Undong purple shield and and it's normalized too which is nice like you don't have to hope like all I only have white armor but that guy is purple and cod armor plates aren't hard to come by and everyone has slots already like the same amount of slots it's a pretty quick to like yeah all in all wish my channel liked Valeria more and that'd be great guys just change like last last I mean at least with new APEC seasons come out you can rely on that yeah for like a week but it is a fun week and then it's like yeah we're a pecs is back and then there's just that one video it's like and it's gone and no one cares again yes funny you mentioned that Rob we'll talk about that after this ad break though welcome back to this episode of GG over here's the episode oh we didn't even say the episode is thirty four three three three yeah because last week we were on our TLC episode and that's TLC was on thirty two so now we're on ABC Family in 33 then next week it'll be ESPN and then 35 zsp in two and then thirty six is the History Channel and then 36 was a lot or like 36 was like CNN and then that's when he got to the new stuff that's where I stand then I'm out yeah I mean I started picking back up in the 60s 60s 60s something was cheap 1466 was like H vh1 like 68 was like II oh yes I love you my mom want some bangers my mom watched that five o'clock entertainment show or whatever all times my style Entertainment Weekly whatever no you know a Rob briefly mentioned this about content on the channel and at least everyone wants last Oasis and the funny thing is yeah did you not like I've been getting hounded like non-stop since that video I actually looked up lost races on Twitch after that apparently that game pops like do you what you guys don't get is like that video took us what three and a half hours yeah I think I literally like okay my bad so but like I literally like at one point you guys were like running off and your giant thing I think I left just like I think I died I see a new side of water and I was like that's a Nike I was like I can't contribute more to this video yeah there that's the hard part too is like we couldn't even find PvP and sit like bit like blueish geo come at the end of the video it's like I was trying to run over I could car zone he's like let brow like we there's nothing else man like we can't make PV but they're like we can't bite anyone I'm like no because like it's cool and fun it was supposed to be one off and it will probably most likely be a one off and then there were so many things I will do another video people but what would we even do one it's just like rust we're have to restart and then we have to hope we find PvP or something well that's what I was talking to Sydney about it because I was like I was like we played this game today now it was like I liked it and I was like but it's one of those games were like it is like 10% the game 90% us like been approving and figuring out what we're doing is making somehow making building a thing the most fun and interesting thing ever but in reality it's like just hitting wood or you know in this case just Pitt yeah picking up he pick up here pick up christian pick this up oh wait this isn't working are you output this year oh wait this isn't working here let me put this here okay now it's working I only do that for so long before I'm just like the most ridiculous thing there's there's so many people in the YouTube video that was upset with me because they're like what's even the point if you're gonna make it a one-off what do you mean did you enjoy the video that's the lord of the point I didn't make this to be like the rough season for is really just a game that I've done all the time where I'm there's a new game megavideo what do you see episode 1 that's what you should start getting excited that's what someone means we did a fatty sesh and we expect to do more in this case we did a semi fatty sesh and it led to a 1 minute video or not a one maybe at one video and let me tell you it took a lot of lovin to make it entertaining yeah I like walked away from that I was like he's gonna have to do a lot of it well the next day we were supposed to I don't know what we're supposed to we're gonna do something I was like yellow I like you guys give me like another hour this thing's taking I'm trying to edit the last waste video bro nice taking some extra time and some that's what but that's like yeah I guess you gotta give me a second yeah I think it came out well but oh I mean I haven't watched it because I literally lived it Christian would you like to read our patreon stands before I start these up patreon questions I'll raise you one better oh and ask blue to join in with me I lose I'll read the first name and you read the last are you ready there's a list it's in yeah and the discord challenge got a scroll up of other kuriboh mm-hmm okay ready put Yan spa dust in green pea no no no no the last like yeah like I'll read like the first half and you read the last half yeah yeah I know I know but like that's why it's a dustin GP hash what no no like the last name yeah that's why I said the way he explained it was very weird well okay it's a take great dustin Weirich Green Pete Benjamin Thomas Wayne ng Brandon Smith in seven Falco Maria brynnie Asst GP hash hey see there we go thank you my bad thank you big sexy Omega arts the see the I was like just you like do the ii happened to me i was looking at the name but then i realized that i was confusing my first and last so i thought you were like going like this way like you're trying to sandwich it I'm not teacher instructions on coat this first question is from Jaclyn if you could be any read write speak just one language in an instant what would it be Japanese so I can understand anime so I could watch anime and it's true for like no no dub no sub it's just a show you know what I mean I once would say Korean cuz I really want to watch Paris on it without some time yes parasite yeah that movie is yes I mean every go so why you trying to learn Korean like you going into family you move in there oh no I watch parasite for the first leg just one that actually wouldn't be bad because one you have the lck like the best League of Legend players for obviously in Korea so I could watch that understand you watch CK's no usually I'll watch highlights sometimes but usually I just keep up on just news so that like when world's comes around I know like who's the best or what do they do sub and dub for like that I mean yeah I mean like for a while before overwatch League it was Monte Cristo and Doha they were the ones in Korea doing the English cast but uh they got that they got kpop I haven't watched any these but Claire says they have good Korean dramas it's not I don't know she's like actually she loves Korean soaps and Chinese hopes I don't get it because I'll go on Netflix because we share an account it's like recommender for you and I'm like what is this none of its English it's just like random bizarre oh my god so I think that would you were a bit Mimi you know what are we just for parasite but I think it would actually be good good idea well yeah I mean yeah you know I'm saying and then they also have a second question attached to this similarly if you could play any instrument like a pro what would it be I would love the world's tiniest violin oh shut up my would be the piano if you can play the piano like really well you can play any instrument really well is what I hear and I think the piano is really cool you do a lot of things with it but I'm an idiot and I don't know anything the closest thing I've ever learned to play I know he's pullin out and there's a couple years now lot of wear and tear on a lot of throwing on this thing believe it or not these things take a real good beatin no whammy bar though yeah that broke I remember wonderful why well well I was trying to stream guitar hero and my guitar wasn't working and I was like what the [ __ ] is like the way everybody else so I was like I just saw the whammy bar and I just grabbed it off and I was like we're not playing guitar hero poor guitar but it works I think blew it what instrument would you play I mean I already play a couple oh this is new blue war hit us with it I mean I'm not I'm probably not get it anymore but I played guitar drums shortly I know how to play bass I mean I I don't think I know how to anymore it's been a while so I have to learn a lot yes Rob how come when you play a bass you have to do this and you can strum down on amazing why do you have to go up I mean you could strum what a base if you want it's just generally people do it because they want like more control over there's less things to there's less strings to pluck so there's less fingers you need to you have to strum a whole bass two fingers and you have half the basses like strings on your access to you so it's like it's kind of a preference thing you could easily strum the base if you wanted but you would look like a total it doesn't make sense it sound different you would absolutely like totally cool not only are you playing the bass you're also strumming it down it's like your finger picking guitar right you're you're doing it okay like more residence on like a bigger you're plucking something right and we don't get the same sound from instruments to play so I don't know if I mean I'm not really like you really putting a fret on it's hard I tuned it all out of whack could you tune it yeah I could do it okay see ya you're smart I mean that's not smart that's just okay now let's mean you're really over you're really over okay anyways back to the topic I don't know probably like I'd replayed like a band instrument like like I like any like horns or like trumpets or anything like that so maybe something like that I would like a saxophone like a saxophone yeah take my idea that would be kind of tight I would be cool for that okay Frank Sinatra over here of course you'd pick that okay please tell us what your it would it would be a saxophone saxophone was cool too my little brother started playing it as literally all I heard growing up in those deep filled with so or no real nice crab bagel because you have to like blow it weird like I don't get why I can't just go right you all right what do you mean you already know how to do it Wow incredible yeah cuz I was lately describe do that I did try very shortly to do band in sixth grade I had the trumpet that lasted two days it was I like I don't know they get and then I just I tried yeah it was Sam wouldn't come out I kept going like red and like about to pass out I couldn't keep my breath I wouldn't make noise I mean I gave up best decision ever meant doing bad I returned to ectomy that took the recorder no idea but I know how to play on cross buns oh and Mary Hannah mary had a little Dustin Ridge one of the producers what is everyone's a favorite video game weapon gum sword and floppy dill Bach blank are all on the table I think that's the Saints Row weapon so better choose them I'll start the it's not my favorite game at all but I think it's one of the coolest guns ever the Lancer from Gears of War is easily still like one of my favorite weapon don't ever like so sick like I remember the first time I chainsawing a locust I was like so that's where it all we're not going to do that there's this one glitch you could do when I get first came out before any patches it's like you could get a Lancer and like still like do the Gears of War run but also still have your Lancer like propped up so you could literally like just sprint to somebody I would literally go for two I just literally cutting them a half of the best till they passed but Lancer for sure or battle rifle from Halo 3 well do you have one ready cuz I don't mind a little war underground oh no I love Killzone I would suck so much dick if I get kills it on PC Lord Jesus Christ yeah there's not it's only ps4 maybe well guerrillas doing horizon so maybe one day we'll get a kill zone but ok point is we're gonna get out of station I'm full the back to the station gun uh it's this gun called the m55 rumbler from Killzone shadow fall it's so tight to think about Killzone is that gun doesn't do anything like crazy like he doesn't have a chains on it it under shoot like a like a railgun out of its it's out of anything right but it's just like the way that gun feels I've never felt a more gel - I've never felt a weapon that feels better than anybody I've ever played in my life then when I was playing with that gun and Killzone Shadowfall there's something so satisfying about that weapon is it of poles it's an auto rifle oh and 55 runs sound like that destiny nor me they're called bursts pulse rifles dude yeah yeah I've never felt a gun that felt better than that gun the kill zone has always been really tight guns like the way they feel is I think kill zone has like the most satisfying guns ever played in any video games and the m55 is like a like a like an evolution of what my previous favorite gun was was it was the m82 rifle and Killzone 2 which was basically just like a futuristic m4 but m55 rumbler that guns tight feels so good mmm now I know what to eat you for your birthday a real one yeah if you could find kills when guns aren't poverty' have replicas unfortunately so we'll just get you a real AR and mascara came out was like early ps4 yeah well cuz guerilla made I mean guerrilla had been making Killzone games since like the dawn of time yeah they're over it so when horizon came out it's like they probably I think there's a little bit I think they'll make more kill zones but until now the gorilla now that gorilla that has like proved that all right like we can make a bang or single-player like maybe they'll maybe Sony is like here's here's a bunch of money just go make another kill zone if you want have you watched on YouTube from noclip the documentary on horizon no why you might want it because it's been a while since I washed it but if I'm not mistaken when I wash it it certainly sounded like they were done with kill them I would be surprised but I mean that's also that's also like the game that gave them the capability to even do horizon well I mean I think they type out like that's why they had to do it too and yeah I mean even at the end of shadow fall they talked about how they wanted to make like not a shooter so I'll take my bones heal yeah it was super popular I mean I mean infamous because the first game was a halo killer for ps4 I killed it was supposed to be P like Sony's halo well they both killed themselves then yeah it was me halo halo if you got it I'm not I don't think infinite is gonna be anything special I don't sadly I wish it was I pray maybe I can make videos on that in the meantime no I have no idea I really can't think of it I can't think of anything man energy sword like I think of all the games you played if I could say Christian I can get you one replica of a gun you can use it again like your favorite weapon dude give me cloud sword it could be Buster Sword a is cool a that might be or decides I don't know I'm not good with these questions man a Pokeball dude I guess that's a lot of it is a weapon for enslavement that is what I would say a Pokeball is weapon you know what you know what fruits answer would probably be would probably just be whatever the flavor of the month is of the game he's playing in modern warfare like what's your favorite model warfare gun oh I actually didn't really like it until war zone I probably say my favorite one is the PPU mastic is that's the camo price Appa you're a peacekeeper stand apex - right like you yeah well I love peacekeeper design I like the auto well Oh probably well it war modern warfare probably the mk2 carbine because I like lever action I like like Wild West throwbacks see so maybe okay see that just made me think maybe macri's Oh Normie Normie Normie Normie Normie over watch you barely even played that I'm thinking like if I was okay what it felt good no pot what no yeah new combo like you wouldn't pick like a Halo weapon for me I was maybe gonna say battle rifle and he said it so they well I can't do the same thing well I said like it second okay I'll pay I'll put the kingdom Kia second then it just seems to normal huh I feel like there's something I can or I just can't think of it I'm bad with these super open-ended questions man we want the boy it doesn't matter I'm joking about the Normie thing Mario RPG all the batteries is if you like it or not what weapon is that I you know right now I'll show you either the halo through battle rifle diaper rifle it's hard time there's a sniper rifle that [ __ ] like that little noise when you like zoom in oh you know what I never understood about the hell with your sniper rifle maybe you can like bust this myth for me did you ever like scope in from 10 and then sometimes you knew went to scope back out it would bring you back to 5 remember never do that for you'd like sometimes not like soon because like I would scope into ten and then like maybe one in a hundred times that scope back out to go back I out of scope and it would bring me back to five what are you doing I didn't know if that was like something like I did or like if that was just weird you probably broke your thumb stick has weird I did find that MLG control you gave me a while ago though that when I was moving so ROG yeah the orange my freaking I think good job on that thing I forget what we made some trade I don't remember what you gave me like a game or something think so or think I think he gave me like heart gold or something like that or I'm gonna do I forgot what you gave me but like I gave you that and for like a game they were slinging drugs we were slinging custom controllers you know it's I think was sick I did a really good job on that I remembered like my my youtube channel to this day is I love MLG one because I contacted somebody who made those controllers and I asked some like what he used it's like make them so my youtube channel is I love Emma so bad wait one more question Holmes wasn't bad wait oh you have a question what PAC podcast wasn't bad this podcast cuz I was just about to wrap things up oh I was gonna say we maybe take one quick question is there like a shorter one we'll wrap it fire maybe a little rapid fire give me open-ended because I'm but yeah I get anxious and I panic and I'm okay this is a good one from a Jordan do you guys have a favorite thing to cook or wish you could make things that your parents made for you growing up I would say I don't need to wish that I could make it what my mom used to make me growing up because I can cuz it's not really super difficult but we just had all them Italian as my favorite dish it was penne pasta with like homemade tomato sauce and then some caprese and I mean it's all pretty easy to make that's it yeah but it was always my favorite meal growing up she made in Luke and when she started cooking it with all the garlic you always smelt like the aroma in the kitchen I was always great but I guess that uh I don't have to wish it either Mexican rice I've I could Leary snort that stuff for breakfast lunch and dinner can you make it like are you good at making it too it's not it's not particularly hard at all I mean see III make it all the time just uh I might tomatoes rice I might have to swap onion huh 2g Tierra's some cubed what uh meteors Chili Peppers bro what is what is that stuff what stuff the meteors it's like the cheese dip with the torture it was like a it was like caso with like chorizo or something yeah that but only if I could also make their tortillas the same way supersoft warm and with that stuff oof I could be that all done well pretty much every single Mexican restaurant and this in Texas so if I could like not every I mean there's definitely it's like like actually like great Mexican restaurants make their own tortillas like right there so it'd be like a Fame egg all the ones running here dude suck you don't know amazing restaurant you're like all the tortillas and they're always just just the lamest like store brand it's just like this is your disgrace no nothing and if they are homemade what do you do is that my mom's chili if I could if I was really good because then like you put on a chili dog I love chili Chili's IIIi know it's
