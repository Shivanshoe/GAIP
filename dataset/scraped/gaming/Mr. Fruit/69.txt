look at him trying to jump away [Music] and i'm just chasing him man they're like bro you ain't escaping me what in the leg oh yeah hi they hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the destiny 2 witch queen hype train tickets are still available i'm going to be honest i don't see a stop in sight because look at look what do you see behind me i i don't mean like the traveler or the city or the sky yeah i mean what what are you with the giant freaking grave on my back come on what else are you looking at i will an acceptable answer is my handsome face but aside from that it better be the enigma my freaking glaive so this is the one you get to you know forge at the very beginning of the campaign there are some exotic glitches i'm hoping to get soon i don't know if anybody has that yet but i've been leveling this thing up the glaive is so much fun granted in legendary campaign it was hard to see it really shine i don't know it you know it's still up for debate how effective they'll be or at least like legendary glaives or something in more in-game pbe but pvp is where i'm really interested to see how this works we have ballistic tuning so if you didn't already know the glaive is a hybrid weapon because it well it says it right here wow would you like that hybrid melee ranged pole arm but the frontal shield generates energy on dealing range damage so you can raise the shield if you have energy depletes over time otherwise you get to shoot it like you would well any gun or melee and it triggers a kinetic melee combo which is which is pretty fun pretty cool so yeah going back to this greatly increased range decreased shield duration frankly that's fine fast reloads with magazines empty blocking damage with your shield increases movement speed until you lower your shield which i guess is a little contradictory to this however with witch queen and the new forging system i can literally go back at any time and let me reshape the perks the way i want them super cool kill clip ruin after kill grants increased damage and psycho hack origin trait which almost every gun now has which is pretty cool and in this case psycho hack sustained damage from this weapon lowers the target's damage output for a short duration is that very helpful in pvp probably not but in pve is a really cool trait and i think you'll see a lot of applications but more importantly this thing takes shaders so well that's what it looks like normally right look at this got like the red laser beam lines that just looks like a lightsaber zebra i'll be honest i didn't even go through the whole list oh i'm gonna be honest that's actually i like that black and gold who could say no you know what screw it i'm going this it's a little it's a little out there so i like it now there are probably some pvp builds or certain exotics or something to combine with the glaive to help it shine a little bit i don't know any of that it's still brand new i haven't heard anyone use it in pvp yet i don't even know how it performs in pvp yet so instead we're just gonna hop into it see how it goes my downfall with these reviews is usually when i try to use a gun i don't even bother to touch anything else in my arsenal it's like hey i'm here to use this gun so i'm only gonna use this gun so in this case that'll be real interesting especially because we don't get much ammo but the good news is that's actually not a bad thing because we got our melee kinetic combo thing you know wash wash kebabs from people with a little sprinkle of salt because i i'd probably be pretty i don't know how good the melee thing is but if somebody just came up and whack whack whack kill me with a glaive which will probably happen here soon yeah i'd probably be pretty upset myself so you don't really need to know much more that's you you're good and i will say in the artifact there is this cool mod damaging combatants with your gloves suppresses them preventing them from using abilities for a short time i actually think that'll make them a lot useful i actually haven't been able to use it and i didn't like get these in the legendary campaign but i imagine this will make it a lot more viable actually and it can be unstoppable alter flame it's ironic because i technically just played this because if you didn't see it we had a video earlier of the new exotic submachine gun i don't even know how to say it just fun to say streega all right i'm nervous but who cares look at this thing oh so you see the little little semi-circle below the reticule that's actually the bar showing you if you have a guard ready we don't have any but if we did it would be there now check this out i'm going to freaking mentally melee oh i'm already upset if i'm them i could have kept shooting my glaive yeah i'm gonna be honest once i started clicking mail i was committed there was no alternating i shoot or i hit and i started hitting so i stay that way i'm burning with my knit that's an easy kill oh that's free that's so free this is all so free oh my god i hit him with it oh my god you reload i even have my shield i don't know how much this blocks but we're about to find out yep okay um oh wait i killed him oh wait he's he's just that man's dead i killed that man and i killed him give me your ammo this is going don't ask me what the fudge that was saw another dude with the glaze i panicked the melee combo didn't work maybe actually maybe they like changed it in in pvp i don't know they've never really done something like that so i'm had oh they most definitely did not yeah see the little one two three combo so it still takes three melees so it's not just an instant one and done but the nice part about the the glaive melee is you don't need ammo for that you just do that whenever you want might not be the most effective option but it's the most fun option in fact would you you might have a good fair point if you wanted to try and say hey wouldn't just a normal melee maybe even work better in a lot of these situations yeah i'm not going to say your own but what i will say is it doesn't look as cool and the one thing you do have going for you which you wouldn't otherwise is that you've got a little more lunge and wow cause the lunge is pretty generous uh we'll see if i can like try and max lunge at somebody okay oh we hit him we hit him ah that was about the range i wish i could have killed him i will say though this is just fine and if i can just have fun using anything in crystal regardless of the the outcome i'm gonna be pretty happy oh my god get boobs on was that a team shot there's no way i would have one i don't in what world could i possibly want to shine oh there's that kill yo firing this thing actually kind of nice way better at it in pvp than pve how's that possible don't ask me everything hurts and we traded all right i'll take it there was somebody i was like dude graves can't shoot i'm like bro we're freaking shooting spaceballs out of our out of our palms what do you mean you know what i should do what what in the leg guardian oh yeah you like that oh i know you do help me tom cruise yeah nice my glaive greater than your great good good grade points for trying right up up hey buddy you want it thank you yeah there is a bit of a interesting delay it almost seems in the melee here that i don't feel like i have in pve the only reason i'm skeptical as to why it would be different is i feel like they've always had a hard time differentiating between balancing something for pve and the other for pvp but you know maybe you know today's a new day what yeah yeah yeah okay some of that wasn't registering but that's okay yeah yeah yeah look at him trying to jump away and i'm just chasing him in there like bro you ain't escaping me once the glaive melee is locked on bro i'm locked in and you're locked out for playing the game nice great delivery there mister that was a good one one of my better ones oh nice kill too this ttv or dude is such a try hard man go figure he puts tpv in his name bro i'm just trying to glaive you're out here with your saluda bro like come on man let's just let's just vibe why we gotta be like this huh why are we gonna come on there he is you have advantage that's a kill nice which means i get a block oh nice buy some miracle oh he's one shot i don't know why my shot didn't didn't finish you i would have preferred that but i wish i could just show you the three-hit combo without having to hit somebody but that's really that's not how that works i don't know awesome cringe i'm so sorry i ah never mind i still got that glaive kill from it let's go what did i tell wow what the [ __ ] that seems like it did a lot a lot more damage than it probably should have frankly come on i'm not gonna fight it look at that thirty-two punish defeated mcgregor it's incredible just boot up another one you know how it is now when you get like a crucible weapon drop you have your perks there are new perks which is cool then you get the origin tray so in this case it came from pvp so it gives you a pvp origin trait which at least for this season whatever is one quiet moment grants increased reality speed went out of combat on top of the manufacturer origin trait the omalon fluid dynamics real cool so if i were to get this in pve it would come with this and the pbe trade if i got any gambit will come with this and the gambit train i'm all in man which queen so far has not let me down cauldron is this am i about to do it i'm finna do it to him i'm happy to see cauldron i said it i'm happy to see moon map because they're they're they're a little small in fact you could have well am i ready to i don't know if i'm ready to go that far you could have put me on the other map the moon map you know thou who shall not be named and i wouldn't have been mad i want tight corners you know i want i want people walking up to my face and i want to beat them down senseless before they realize what's going on kind of like the oh my god jesus christ and i still killed him and i'm alive oh my oh man that was such a cool freaking hero moment man shoe my darling human arlen gonna fish you in your face [Music] oh my god the the lunch is going crazy with it i'm here for it oh hey we gotta check out the new um heavy real quick didn't get a kill with it that's okay truth was in the chat okay well that's he's dead oh oh i wouldn't say it's the easiest thing to hit but i mean if you hit them they're dead i try to get a combo there with my glaive it just about works though you know i'm doing it i i'm do i'm are you friendly i hope you're friendly wait what no we already merged them ah come on come on they were having fun guys you're having fun right he got it come on oh you got to ruin the fun man the only time my team's doing well we always have to mercy real quick you know all right fine we go again i guess but check it out at why are you all invisible what's going on here you're getting not killed let me turn that in get a little serotonin release this right oh the little one shot to the melee yeah you like that buddy what are you doing huh what are you guys doing he yeah don't know what the fudge i'm gonna do by that i didn't okay well that that'll work that's yasir striga and i'm not dead somehow surprisingly oh come on guys that was well i'm going in check this out already oh oh oh oh no oh no oh no believe that we'll leave a lunge on that though oh i totally forgot to check this out shaped up those trials and grams paid off we got the brand new trial scout rifle pretty cool roll too you'll be seeing a video on that sometime soon also got a brand new iron banner gun from uh the bounties i'd saved ran right into that i don't really know what else i was supposed to do but who was that what was his name oh that's well speak of the devil that's it yeah that's that's staring brainer hand cannon i don't have iron reach oh my god that's pretty good frankly i mean not is you'll see not as cool as mine okay there's they definitely changed something in in pvp because it feels like there's a greater delay between shooting mainly excuse me i don't know what's going on okay so the melee i can't tell i need to go back in pve and judge for myself but there is a good bit of a delay in fact it almost seems like if i'm that close it's better just melee melee melee than shoot melee and i haven't crunched it yes see he did exactly what i did with my glaive except i still had about a second of being locked out in melee a little unfortunate you know oh my god bro sometimes it's just one-shotting and i don't know why it is but is it this was it like sun war what was that i don't know i i don't know what it was it's sick i'm telling you that okay well i can't keep it when you guys are okay still didn't get a chance to actually nice we got the kill and i'm healing can't kill this baby all right somebody's over here and i'm going to kill him with this last shot i don't know where that went frankly i'm burning okay they saw it coming they were privy they i just wait until glaive there's trials matter you heard it here first i'll go on the record for that because i'm gonna pioneer it i'm gonna will it into existence you're so dead you [ __ ] behind your shield how safe are you now ah what that one was like head on and i know you didn't kill him but sometimes like oops one shot i don't get it glaives are sick destiny 2 is sick witch queen is sick sleep is sick that's why i do see [Music] [Music] you
