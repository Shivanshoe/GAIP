hi ad Holdren moanings mr. fruit and welcome to smite this is no meme it is happening a lot of people have requested this for quite some time and well you guys know me I do like MOBAs but I've always I've been a league Legends guy and well if you haven't heard the news well here you go avatar the last airbender are getting characters put in to this game I saw the game plan I was like that alright that's it get some playing smite now they don't come out until July but before that I might as well start to accustom myself with the game and see if I can figure out what I'm doing so just to preface here if you if you've already played smite you know what you're doing don't bother commenting down below oh my god yeah what do we I have about three games that I played last night yeah I do have some MOBA experience though so I'm gonna hope that that that helps me out here so we're playing conquest their traditional MOBA map I believe you know it's like 5 b53 lanes coming from a league that's what I know it's my bread and butter my B&B I'm going to play as he mad at him dollar I don't know how to say his name here's what I know he's a Viking and I played him yesterday so I kind of know what I'm doing obviously this is made by high-res people who do paladin's so there definitely some similarities and a lot of the graphics UI loading screens all that kind of stuff but if you guys end up enjoying this I wouldn't mind doing some more videos on this maybe like a series of pleb - maybe not so much of a plot okay but I don't have auto buy on just so I can learn I kind of feel like that's a mistake ok we're just we're buying this thing ok I did that and then I'm buying this and I think people are fighting or something oh heavens I'm gonna go ahead and level an ability this one and I guess from going right lane now somebody in the comments feel free to let me know what the fudge is this thing there's like various things that show up there with depending on who I'm playing and I just I don't get it but anyway yet so this is a mobile but it's third-person it's kinda like Paragon well it's as good as who could get right now I know maybe I could convince him to start playing but he built it stiff red and to that I would not argue ok he's already attacking me sir I'm gonna have to ask you he's melee but the good news is I'm ranged so as you can see here i'ma just keep whacking him and I'm gonna coal down my blade and I have slain the leech strats and well clearly he doesn't know the elite strats am I right or am i right yeah so if he wants to stay in this Lane he'll have a he'll have a hard time considering I'm ranged he is not pretty simple we leveled up though you'll love to see that let me level up my um I think it's actually called yep the yeah lower horn oh my gosh yes to these everywhere yeah yeah hilarious guys now I do think my other ability is what is it Bifrost yeah the Bifrost I can like start it's above my pay grade I'll tell you that much I can like set up two little runic stones and I can teleport between them and stuff I'm at that that might be a little too big brain for me I'm gonna go ahead and level it up now though anyway so I can just you you you was slowly chip away at this tower I don't know where the guy I was laying against went I don't know if he just quit in fact I don't see any of the enemy on the mini-map so I don't actually know who what they're doing but I guess sure you know that's what they want so see here I'll place a runic stone here and then I place another one back towards my tower and then I just so I can like show up in the middle of the lane and they'll never know it's coming but yeah I don't okay so one of their guys already deseed whole mouth wait but one of our guys DC to me what the heck's going on here okay well that just means we're an evil evil even playing fields was hoping to have a little more action here in the laning phase but my dude has just evidently said nah screw this and he he's just gone apparently they're all going mid or something I'm not really sure but that just means I can take a nice quick early tower and then go assist my teammates elsewhere run away run away here comes the outrun already yeah you like that I know I do and then I'm not entirely sure what the first part of that sword thing does but I know I get a call it down and does damage and I know I'm supposed to level that first so that's what we're gonna do amid you I seem to have the most amount of fun slash progress an actual impact on the game when I play an arranged character because if I'm playing in melee I just I well I just got way too deep way too fast but anyway it also doesn't seem like it could be wrong feel free to again and like me that last hitting isn't a thing you just have to be near them like see I think I'm just always getting the same amount of gold no matter an XP regardless I think it just depends on if you have someone near you when you destroy it but that's a tower kill look at me and I got my ultimate I think I just eat them into like nifflheim or something it's pretty sick though I mean you use all right now I'll go help cuz yeah the guy I'm playing or was playing against is still level 1 and hasn't been seen which makes me think yeah Oh a mana camp sure why not okay yeah I'm an above something something's I'm I don't know I'll just grab it myself you can't tell me otherwise alright we're doing great here then you pop a health potion oh yeah that we love hold up I got a camp I'm just jungling for the fun of it cuz I got nothing else to do I do see oh just an XP camp yeah why not right there are enemies on the other side there's two on the Left line so I should probably go help out there but I just am too much fun and you know much how it is someone's on a killing spree Oh someone's in the jungle and know what up buddy and I took we came from him and the buff poor guy oh wait can I only have one buff at a time wait oh I didn't realize you're gonna leave one buff at a time well that's a bit of a bummer would have played that a little bit differently but don't show okay I should you know I'm just gonna back I probably have yeah I have a lot of gold so we're just getting a back and I'll buy something I know I want to buy transcendence can i buy that straight-up I can't and then do I have enough for a four boots I don't so I'm a little slow but that's okay now check this out use the Bifrost sit in this and leave that dude ah immediately back into what is this totem of grants 25 gold sure I'll just destroy this oh yeah we all got gold and magic above your something what can I say I'm a team player yeah this is strange there's um they're just kind of chilling which granted yet we also have an afk so it's actually even playing fields but we're just obviously far superior so it's not even like real competition I swear I'll go just oh yeah I should just go to the left line and that way I can just start eating some people well we have a damage I'm doing holy hackers that item by was clutch there's some buff spawning blue buffs back I kinda just want to find the guy again here in the jungle but maybe I should I should stop bullying him they're taking middle tower they're taking left tower and we actually lost it which is a bit of a bummer was this Oracle's gold fury damage camp none of that means anything to me if I'm being honest to you all still don't understand the jungle I'll figure that out later new gold fury I should probably have teammates to help me with that huh oh I was trying to cut him up but they're just okay I'm coming I'm coming they're only level 4 about to destroy wait wait what the fudge no dude stop wait I want a piece of this wait wait no-no-no let me in let me oh my god he's just come here I'm not letting him get away no I'm cutting him off he thinks he's free psych pop hey I'm on a killing spree I'm killing it it's kaboosh you know it's funny to those if the enemy I believe can take the BAI for us but like I can see them when they do and if they were to take my Bifrost they would just go right into my my base and pretty much die so that would be pretty funny I don't think they're gonna do that though unfortunately okay ready let me call this down watch how much damage that des oh okay that guy kind of took my kill you literally did like nothing but whatever bro okay okay I want to hold this guy so bad ready Boosh now watch this okay he's afk for a second but then he's going to fudge god yeah what happened to my friend ah the turret was targeting dodge yes right rod fudge that's my bad I uh I guess I kind of screwed the pooch ironically yeah oh wait oh so the sword will just stay there oh I I thought it went away after a little while oh my god my damage but I can't hit anything for the life of me and the minions are in the way now oh all right let me use your horn then oh come here oh gosh we were so close oh wait a second this is bad this is about all I'm and so deep and I'm silenced and I regret everything but wait a second somehow I almost killed him I guess I'll just buy some booties noise oh right tower under attack well this is great for me there's no enemies just minions but screw just show up real quick like yo a what up come here whack yeah the fact that no way I didn't even reactivate it why did it mmm-hmm I know I need to figure out how to use that ability better I guess cuz I can just I could have loved all my old what am i doing I can just have it straight up just like watch an area for a little while oh dude okay well let's just keep going here I guess I'll push the turrets I wanted to just frag out but yeah there's like not many people to frag out on and then when I do try and four I gotta go too deep so bit ironic isn't it I just go too deep dude it's always my problem but what do you know enemy's been slain great stuff out there I got my my alt ability up destroying this turret you guys are doing great you doing great guys oh the larger I get okay we ran out of minions though where my minions at were they at okay so call my sword down and then oh yeah okay interesting interesting just call down wherever I don't know how I stopped the targeting before but whatever alright well that's a turret well done me so just like the mobile you have to destroy the towers and then instead of like hamburgers and League they have Phoenix's to show the Phoenix and you can attack their Titan so on so forth someone is doing this ah ha ha you must have seen me coming but it doesn't matter now I get the speed buff thank you very much alright so now I'm a speedy boy and I'm just gonna come right behind this guy and punish punish punish you he's like where the fudge yeah you like that oh I'm just taking all these minions see if I care Bob Bob Bob spoilers I don't I should use mine I didn't use my eolr horn but I could have but I chose not to a little bit of disrespect I can easily destroy this turret and that's exactly what I'm gonna do okay clear some minions I hope somebody comes to challenge me I pray that they do okay in fact it looks like we got a taker oh my god he's gonna regret this he's Yeller horn knock him up and kill him the sounds of wall use my sword take that down clear like the whole wave of minions this dude he was trying to escape from my minions but little did he know I waited there for him although I don't really know what he I don't know if you thought I was blind he just straight up ran into me but whatever okay these guys are seemingly not alarmed at the fact that I'm taking their Phoenix but whatever I'm not gonna judge him oh my look at my damage dude I'm insane I can level up my alt again let me add a man on me okay now watch him to come back from the portal and he's dead oh my gosh that's so sick alright let's see if I can destroy this Phoenix though I just have to avoid the other guy because if it targets me that's all it like that obviously oh five health I'm leavin or I can just purchase that outright why not and okay well that's all I can buy but that's still pretty good my mother the upgrade vision shard and whatever I have no idea what I'm doing anyway so I'll just take my Bifrost back kill some minions fo some free XP except I'm gonna grab this gold thing for me or our team rather it's right at my team player you all welcome oh we have some increased attack speed though right now I don't know if that's the item I just got or something but I am a likin it what are some buffs here fire giant all allies gain weight oh he has a lot of ow okay he has a lot of health ooh and he hurts okay so that's probably like Baron equivalent from League I probably needed my team they're gonna what is this I'm at it but it's not working maybe it has to be like allied thing or something I don't know yo a pop one auto and then I called my swords onto him huh poor guy this guy's trying his best a jungle man but I'm bullying him all right I got my speed buff though i'ma show up never mind oh my meteors what the fudge is happening that's insane call my sword down Bob clear some minions let's go the Phoenix is already dead then what are you trying to do buddy I'm so sorry now it's time to advance on to their Titan oh my god oh wait I'm being targeted by a Titan okay leave us he's in the fountain but I might be able to do enough damage to kill him I can't because he's been afk all right call that down I'm trying to okay he's a little tanky all right so that's a double kill I'm going for a triple but the Titan is kind of hard melih oh my god harshed my vibe yeah that Titan hurts but should I upgrade this - oh sure this does like true damage or something I'm gonna hop into the jungle so that I can skrt skrt right behind this guy I do want to take this buff but I kind of want to kill this guy a little bit more I'm gonna call my sword down right onto his face before I even realizes it oh my art and then I'm gonna use yellow horn knock him up here Bob and your dad son oh my gosh dude it just makes it even better - that this you know we got Vikings bro Norse mythology and everything oh come here wait a second everybody just it completely ignored me and keeps going to the left lane like word I guess but I want in on it you know I'm saying let me call down my sword absolutely destroy you oh my and then I need a way for my minions but screw I'm not gonna wait I'm just gonna come behind him look at that disrespect just come behind him and kill him and that's the tower level 16 great yeah sure let me just level up all these abilities we're making fat stacks go for whoa what was that that was sick gonna whack this but more importantly how the Phoenix just respawned that's unfortunate okay so I'm gonna try and call my sword down boom oh my god the damage the damage I'm insane no I got knocked up though okay so then let me help you let me help you I by that I meant I wanted to just steal your kill but okay so he's gonna come back from the thing right here drop my sword someone stole that for me but that's okay I forgive you alright use oh wow okay he's hurting a little bit why didn't I knock him up I don't know but I still did so much damage it doesn't matter but I am all the weak so I should probably back I kind of want to use this thing though this is my little thing I just bought let me try it oh yeah cool oh wait why are you targeting me thank you bring leg okay let me just try and help Oh a lot of enemies this guy's one tanky son of a gun oh now the Titans struggling me Oh Oh No okay we're weak with oh wait oh fudge okay yeah I was sandwiched oh wait the Vigilant passive when I gain vision of an enemy god I gain physical power up to a maximum of five gods when an enemy God would disappear I continue to see them the critical strikes only deal seventy percent bonus damage physical oh that makes more sense so that's what that does okay so it's showing me how many people I can see with my passive so with those three stacks and doing six percent extra physical damage I figured it out guys all on my own are you proud dennah domino nama bonum yeah I know though I'm having fun I don't know I don't really know why I never tried smite because I was like well if I'm gonna play a mobile I might as well play League but I mean they certainly await damage camp oh yes please don't mind if I do what is this twenty percent increased damage yeah at least physical damage and you know what your boy is yeah boys physical damage I'm gonna I'm gonna get the tank so I'm just gonna kill this person real quick Bob okay drop my sword right on this dude he doesn't even realize him here I'm gonna Alton ready wait your move oh it's like a home run yeah he's dead he's so very dead well done me got my attacks being damaged whoa with these full items bruh they're almost full items but even still I am a crushing at are we follow are we fighting a Titan I was in pendant the Titans almost dead alright let me do this let me do a little bit of this huh hey I got you buddy watch this ah fudge I wanted to help man a rude dude okay here we go again alright to get rid of my crowd control though aha finally use that for the right thing destroy that guy and destroy that Titan Hey look at that okay it was a little little rough at some points and the beginning of a game I guess I bullied my dude out of the lane immediately so like that's my bad but we went let's see damage wise here I had the most kills and actually the least amount of deaths I earned the most gold I did the most player damage I did the most minion damage I did the most structure damage yeah boys out here so what the hell is doing and that was one game of smite again I'm sure I did a lot of stuff wrong if you play the game you probably cringed whatever again brand-new to the game feel free to give me some pointers and stuff below if you have any but yeah I'm having some fun and if you guys want to see some more videos then I shall do some more otherwise I'll just be playing off-camera I suppose wait that see I don't think all very much for watching episodes finished I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
