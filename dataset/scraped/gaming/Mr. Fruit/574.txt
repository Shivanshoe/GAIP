oh is that the ah not the triple i unofficial triple let me get another quick kill every third shot i throw out three cards and that appears to be the play because that's like omega damage it can like it can put someone in critical and then kill them okay it's the go-to or maybe i'm just slowly getting better at the game also a very real possibility is anyone seeing this i'm like i'm kind of killing it right now let me get another kill maybe yeah okay a little hard to hit but not hard enough for me is this a double i see oh wait no somebody else got it we'll play well you guys deserved it you know i'm not i'm not complaining pew pew pew pew pew pew pew oh my god let's go this is incredible throw a trip mine hit you knock you back keep up the aggression give me the treasure chest hey

grab the treasure chest i actually got it i'm nuts and you know what i'm just gonna go aggro with it run away hide nah not me baby we are in a little bit of trouble so just keep deflecting the shots deflecting the shots yeah not today on capitol not today keep deflecting them okay this is so good holding an objective i never thought of this for some reason oh my i'm still alive they haven't killed me this guy right off spawn huh you think you stand a chance i think it's stan against my magic throw bomb big old bomb bomb go boom boom don't hit anybody i will kill you yes or rather knock you out game's coming down to the coin round so i gotta show up right now if i can kill him big okay one less person collecting coins for them oh yes oh my gosh look at how much damage i did the kos most coins collected most treasure chest points i have got to use this guy i just i mean look at the scan i'm not really entirely sure what my abilities do but just look at how majestic i look does anything else really matter i mean let's be real here he's a rocket magnet so they can't hit me i find my little rocket torpedoes hey i'll text you go for the weaker person right now oh my god i'm just batting them around right now they're like oh please you're one shot but where are you ah there you are yeah like why don't you go after somebody else because they're not as fun because i go after you oh my okay easy peasy break that stun i'm still alive what you gonna do about it okay kill me that's what you're gonna do we'll okay let's just go right after this guy he wasn't even mega blasted he just flew too close to the side what you want what you want i need to get off the ground because that guy's rocket launcher so or grenade launches rather so staying on the ground is just a really nice way for him to destroy me oh my god okay this person is very nimble i'm having a bit of a hard time hitting them but i'll make it work oh and i think i'm doing just that well done me he's one he's one he's one i'm gonna snipe him i'm gonna mega rockets come here can't believe i managed that oh oh look at look at this he's like please stop it god it feels good when you just like hit after hit after hit i don't miss what are you doing ah that will only save you for so long throw my mind right down there you're no longer safe in your little hidey hole and you're dead oh look at that look look at this look at this look at this it's just it's just one after another oh let me add him spike mega blast i'm insane you know everybody's like miss fruit why you always like hype yourself up so much it's because positive self-affirmation is something not enough people do and it never hurts you know be proud of yourself love yourself kill other people wait no that's don't include that with the other things anecdotal you just got outplayed so hard okay yeah turns out i don't know who my main is going to be uh it appears i play everyone which is my problem in every game but they're all so much fun i'm finding my way to work with each each and every one oh my golly tree will contested how's it contested hey wait hey get off get off my the knockback on his hits are so insane let's go oh my look at this let's see if i can try this will fell out apparently i actually have like auto aim here oh my god yes super fast firing light damage but they'll just home in oh my gosh i'll leave it super chip damage but it's probably 15 hit but it's nearly impossible to miss yep just keep peppering him keep peppering him uh oh my what am i doing what am i what who hurt me help me up oh my god what a save i am not going to let you live hey finally got a kill all right and let me just finish you off hold i'm almost there it takes it takes a little bit there we go oh whoa skirt i have a teleport that's fine all right let me home in on you oh okay yeah sure gotta kill you want some of this i feel like i do just barely enough damage but enough knockback to be super annoying people like bro like just stop it bro like you want to get peppered too huh want to get sauteed do you watch this skirt oh and now i'm behind you and guess what boomerang toss the boomerang actually does good damage that's the good news you can't escape me my chip damage will forever live i am inevitable i am blink yes slowly but surely i kill all damage it adds up wow and boomerang boomerang is my real damage source oh the long shots can he do it i have i have to be really close oh okay well i guess they just couldn't recover that makes it easier throw him a boomerang all faithful oh wait the cooldown's actually way shorter than i thought i'm boomerang i need to use that way more and that's another kill wait a second i haven't even died suddenly plink's looking like the realest oh you're almost dead you're almost dead i'm going to finish you oh the little plink that could no one expects him oh my god look at my combo score look at my combo score 26 29 over 30. oh my man i saw people hating on plink man what you hating for this man is insane but everybody's embarrassed like like guys we're getting destroyed by plink right now really all right just gotta try and just hit him yeah just pepper him still seasoning it's all they need a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper all right you can leave me alone though you think it's smart to engage against plink well you might just be right skirt and i'm out of here i'm here my friends boomerang okay yeah boomerang for that consistent damage but that for the you know the little knock back the little interruption and most importantly for the irritation all right boomerang from downtown oh got him yeah i underestimated his power especially if you're up close and yeah it's just never ending the assault it's like surely there's not more of them but then there are one left one to rule them all i actually haven't uh died so i'm trying not to oh my god oh how did i just i nearly killed myself and then i saved myself the ultimate debate what up quick manes where you at ah ah no i might die no i'm a detriment the old boomerang play and this should do it ladies and gentlemen look at that a spree of 11. it's more crossbow time start with the charge shot wait to find boom nice thing too is the shot is pretty quick so that you don't have to lead too much oh my gosh and even if they i oh i'm going for the trip i'm going for the actual triple come here come here where you at you cannot escape me yeah ah somebody else got it okay we'll play i guess right you like this i slow your things but then when i shoot through my slowing field i'm actually faster so just get a quick little kill you know how i do finish that person off hold up is this the triple is this is this it fudge oh gosh dang it i choked throw the sling field down so their projectiles suck but mine are omega this is insane hello so nice to see you i'm gonna try and oh i tried to hit him with my hook let me try again oh oh i actually did oh wait a second hold on i'm just going to dodge everywhere get a kill get another kill where's the triple is it is it not there darn it can't believe i stayed alive need this right off spawn i don't care i take no prisoners they're like bro please please bro bop there's a kill and what do we do we destroy them all the same there oh wait what oh good dodge good dodge oh but not good enough let's go for another one and there you go god i can't tell who i want to play the most they're all too much fun oh that was a phantom i actually fell for it that's embarrassing oh and they were scoring the point that's even more embarrassing whoops well for that you will have to pay with your life you're oh somebody else got you skirt hit you with my crossbow no no you you wanna fight huh yeah yeah no let's let's tango oh wait let me just clean this kill up real quick you're welcome team i don't know what you're talking about i didn't steal that i i helped secure it yeah i
