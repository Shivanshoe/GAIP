heidi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to rogue company and in today's video i'm not sure if it's a mistake yet but we're going to play rogue company without shooting bullets that's right we're going melee only so we're going to be playing with lancer because with her ability you gain increased movement speed quieter movement and immunity reveals for duration or until firing your weapon you see what i'm getting at here we just go silent and wacky whack with our axe because here's the best part about the melee weapon you can throw a melee weapon and it does a lot of damage ooh welcome to italy motta benny what is that italian gourami all right so obviously we need to buy our axe and then i'm gonna buy a smoke grenade and i'm gonna upgrade my axe twice obviously to make it melee only we need to get our melee weapon i mean we can melee with our gun but i'm trying to avoid that but yeah with our ability being able to go a quietly i think it'll give us well not an advantage but maybe a fighting chance and we kind of have to play slow careful methodical and what i mean as you know i'm running all right now i need to pick up my throwing bop he's going for the rez watch this ready okay this is going well so far wait i didn't mean to grab that give me my give me my throwing axe technically already shot bullets but whatever you know what i mean i got him i got him i got him okay but i don't have my throwing axe ah fudge team team okay i'm running i'm running where's my throw knife huh that was the most incredible series of events oh that was rich hey don't lead them back our way the fudge man trying to be sneaky uh they know i'm here so check this oh no he sees me oh that didn't hit him shenanigans we're leading the team right now so i would say this is going wonderfully unfortunately they might catch on to the shenanigans we'll see how they try and combat it and they're out of reinforcements so i don't really see why i shouldn't just come up here and oh no oh no grab this okay grab the throwing knife no i clicked the wrong button there's some guy back in the spawn i'm gonna i'm gonna style on this kid give me a second don't kill him don't you son of a i mean well played but like come on man let me let me out of me see upgrading the melee was a good idea because it increases throw speed and throw damage although i think it like almost one shots always we're gonna get silence the sound of your footsteps when not sprinting and we'll upgrade our smoke twice that way we get two of them and i think it lasts longer or something so we're gonna pretend we're going this way you don't know the last second skirt go over here and same thing we're gonna we're gonna be wrapping around right side the cat hear me coming oh i see this little claymore the fudge is this thing all right but i expertly avoided it now i'm looking for the enemy i found him yo what up buddy yo just be quiet don't make it a bigger deal than it needs to be i'm going to play this a little careful because i know they're going to spawn around here uh-huh and here they come wait for it wait for it no i got oh my god somebody saved me and i picked it back up oh but now i'm down oh what a what a roller coaster of emotions such dang it i should have thrown my my axe earlier but i wasn't sure if he knew where i was and i should use my smoke grenades i guess destroying them all right that'll do it so if i just come up to here bop what get out of my way all right where they at oh i see him oh no yeah give me give me my thrown axe back which side is he on which side is he on i don't like i'm throwing a smoke oh wait oh god wait what oh i shot him wait what that's not my throne actually what happened to my throwing knife where's my axe oh no sir do you have my axe i'm looking for my have you seen my axe i don't know where it went oh wait i see it right there okay but hang on i'm punching with my gun ah it's not nearly as effective i know i've accidentally shot already a couple bullets and it's only the first game but bear with me and you know what i'm trying to do oh get destroyed oh no they're probably going to finish me and get the reds though oh look at this the mobile res yo give me my throne knife give me my throwing knife where where's or axe where's my there's the axe okay ready ready ready ready ready spaghetti get destroyed where they at oh my god i found him oh oh jesus there's so many of them oh wait we actually lost and as always we're going for the flank but this time i don't really have a choice like if i don't flank with my melee weapon what exactly am i hoping to achieve and i'm hoping i can find somebody back here bop oh i found somebody all right bop bop get the double melee need to be a little quiet here i see one of their guys way out there all right he saw me but i don't think this guy did yes give it to me give it to me oh there's another one no i missed oh oh i see someone going for the flank not quite the flank oh my god they're all right around here do i go for the long shot i do oh god while they're running catch this wait they're behind us what oh jesus i can't to get protected you to god got the kill though all right team gonna need you guys to start showing up here because i think i'm showing up let me finish this off for you oh you're fine okay well i'm gonna oh i think there's some guy behind me yep gotcha give me my throwing knife where'd my throwing knife go i don't know where it is i don't know where it is i don't have another life oh no oh i see it right there oh what literally none of these other perks do anything for me so i already hit my max build a while ago it's like literally just the throwing knife they're throwing axe i i keep saying throwing if you guys know what i mean you know at the end of the day hoopla hoopla whatever i'm going for the omega flank here oh i am omega flanking indeed no all right fine i'll kill him for you oh god now that was a mistake why why why all i did was put myself out there to be killed i ruined the omega flank and for what all right i'm walking my footsteps are silent while i do this oh i see that little claymore oh my god there's freaking claymores everywhere they didn't see that coming okay all right i threw the smoke they don't know where i am oh god but they're everywhere all right there's a smoke go go another smoke go oh my god is that rc4 i can only hope oh okay how do they see me what yeah i hate to see it eliminations first downs first damage dealt first all right we might have lost that battle but i think we're winning the war time to show some other poor souls the power of the combat axe all right i'm gonna go silent they're not gonna see this they're gonna expect us to all go up the middle now i don't know if i make noise while i do this i don't wait one okay i have the most omega flank one could ask for oh my god oh my god let me just pick it up thanks for that all right nobody saw anything oh my god i messed that up i had the perfect flank i'm going skirt oh my god somebody get me up get me up get me up someone get me up please oh thank you you're the best i love you so much i need to pick up my thing all right i got my axe yeah but i got him yeah oh we almost got two for the price of one now i don't really want to go out here because i'm pretty sure their sniper's just going to be watching uh-huh mm-hmm all right let me just oh my what the dickens here comes the fun i got silent footsteps take two my friends pretty sure i should be able to yep surprise some people oh my god from down god i wish i had my freaking i didn't i didn't grab the throwing knife come on i clicked the button and he was right [Applause] you get absolutely destroyed oh my god he's

careful i'm revealed all right that works for me i guess there's a kill oh what was that now imagine the possibilities if you combined throwing your melee weapons with shooting your guns i don't think i need to be the one to tell you that the possibilities are endless i'm going for that immediate and oh so crispy flank they're not gonna see this coming they didn't see it coming wow wow wow all right now i need to find somewhere to hide all right maybe they won't see me here this is a little dicey i don't know i hear him they see me what what i gotta throw my smoke i've been compromised i'm
