they're not zoned off completely oh he found one little corner where he can't get hit oh but he's still dying he's brothers try to play like hot lava like get me off of this thing made that oh my oh my Slayer guess what just happened hi ad hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and in today's video a new season a new exotic oh boy that's right we have a brand new kinetic exotic grenade launcher the wither horde doesn't it just look bird prime evils storm an projectiles fired by this weapon like the target or nearby area on impact the heck is blight mr. fruit patience my son or daughter patience weapon comes with can amass black powder it straight break the bank blighted targets take damage over time and blight the nearby area on death boom you've been struck by knowledge now you know what blight is it also has composite stock now this can't do a surprisingly large amount of damage but my god is the reload speed slow it might not look like it right there but trust me my friends it's slower than molasses so we shall head into the crucible otherwise referred to as the crew see black crackable Uncrustables and that one amazon game that recently came out alright look at this thing what what did I stir oh my god I have to special first off you're just gonna have to hear this thing oh wait okay I got some ammo okay before we get our anus pushed in let me show you watch this ready sound Stolp and then look at this if they sit in this big old damage over time or you can just direct hit them Oh see he tried to hit me with it but it's a lot harder than you think and I too missed I'll give them a kill because I have no ammo uh yes 400 IQ mr. fruit say you're just gonna give them the kill so that way if you die you look like a saint rather than the scrub ah I see what you did there me well I would hope so because we are one in the same okay I missed the guy not even play but boom okay you'll see right there look at how much damage that that goes it has 40 damage every tick which a lot Bob box give me that kill the respondent everywhere I missed that direct hit apparently fudge I don't know if I'm ever gonna direct hit somebody well that certainly didn't do the trick oh but he's burning he didn't die I mean I was using it in the new public event I like to dub it the gambit but it's not the gambit playlist where you just Bank a whole bunch of moats so anyway oh I thought I direct him but I didn't it was literally just like eight people just shooting this thing bro the DPS was pretty insane I got to see if I can get a whole squad to just run nothing but this and the crucible it's yeah that goes oh I hit him directly no I didn't I could have sworn old buddy ran into the pool the lid mabul you slowly died of dead means it's terrible a terrible fate I wouldn't wish upon anyone except my enemy like that guy oh oh that seemed like a direct hit cuz it ticked for like 80 or something it takes a second to get going oh oh I didn't tag him directly but I assisted okay Boosh yeah I figure enough of line up the target direct hit every time as surely right right Oh check this out goosh oh that kind I really thought that rip ah yo wither hold you guys will love it would you guys think yeah they all reveal yes boom from downtown funky stuff Malone mr. fruit with a direct hit and a kill that's funny I hit him in the face for ten damage but yeah if you stick them it does double the damage and literally there's nothing they can do if they get stuck with it that's yet they will die it's too much damage for that to not happen okay ah oh but that I stuck him yes yes probably a little too excited about that but look at this this is the perfect excuse me sir hold on I'm trying to do a thing like let's say you're getting chased boom run away like that leave that yeah they ain't chasing you and if they do well they're stupid and they're gonna die I am also stupid what am i shooting that I guess I'm killing somebody is he yeah sure way to go me the reveal extreme though the fall DLC and stuff got me pretty hyped but yeah yeah it seems pretty obvious as to why they chose to just like completely skate over this season of the arrivals or whatever they're dubbing it a Bo's skirt boos nice super super buddy whoa season the arrivals is more of the same at the previous seasons for the most part show nothing nothing really to write home about you know what I'm saying there is a new dungeon which is cool but aside from that it's another new public activity and bounties and it doesn't surprise me I mean they're already so far into the works they couldn't listen and change accordingly to feedback that fast which is why I was hoping they could with the fall DLC and we'll see if they'll manage apparently I killed someone that's a job will kill I think I don't really know I mean it said double kill but like I didn't get the final blows what are with all these participation Awards man kids these days are - sobs you know I'm saying I don't need you to tell me I eliminated them if I didn't get the final hit you know what I'm saying if I get their kill I want to kill and if I didn't get the kill then I don't want it I don't deserve it I don't need oh wow that kind of melted me what the fudge hey get your head in the game Sheldrick usually yeah what the fudge yeah sorry need us though it's so fun hey you know how are you how you doing as you can see here I don't know if I could in good conscience tell someone hey put this on in PvP did its soup for good it's like it's the way to go well then not just be a liar hey look at it this way you're right the first or your last so we're all last really so it doesn't matter where I am on the scoreboard like we sack I get it I get it I'm the only one brave enough to use the wither hold and PvP by the way check out this app salute unit of a bow I think I have to do a video on this I also got the Trinity Gould catalyst I should probably level that up because maybe it makes it like relevant you know hey hi how are you guys you know honestly I feel like not enough people greet their team at the beginning of the match how can you form camaraderie and Brotherhood without first simply saying hey hi how are you you know otherwise right Jesus guys called doesn't even say hi to his friends well to be fair neither did my teammates what just happened oh my that's incredible oh my god got my asthma going there for a second oh that's incredible I'm just doing damage left and right I got pools on pools on pools in there somehow I'm not kill anyone bounce it off the thing sick ricochet well thankfully for me I've got plenty of ammo and another kill it's kind of crazy oh look another killed and they look they want to take B oh you think you're safe behind your your shields well actually you might be I don't know how to work oh oh you want to take a no sit on a point for me make it super easy wait what they're not zoned off completely oh he he found one little corner where he can't get hit oh but he's still dying he's trying to play like hot lava like get me off of this thing Nate that Oh Mike Oh Mike [Music] what sway or I guess oh my god wait a second okay the first game was just a ruse now we're popping off this is why this is probably a better map to but yeah just stay inside which nice and comfy cozy little hot cocoa action completely myths wait wait what am i oh that's because I was hitting the barriers like why does sound so much damage and nobody's dying Lee this just pulls on pools breath they're like Jesus get us out of here I'll give me your ammo give me your ammo I ran out no don't you son of a yeah what are we just area of denial like no you're not allowed in here Rob okay because I said so fudge just thinking about that guy trying to like jump over my pool the hot lava huh classic oh and that one is the enemies oh my I got wait um broth what did he think he was doing there exactly I don't really know immune immune Oh what the heck look at all these gloom Haven things or whatever the fudge I can t remember what the games didn't the game the weapon is called I don't know what I'm talking about anymore but watch this ready we're going for some direct hit action I missed fudge ah I've been detected wither horde the fudge was I saying gloom Haven for if that's some random steam game isn't it I directed him let's get it let's someone stole my kill that's not cool I mean if you're like wow that's insanely Opie like if you just stick him it's a guarantee yeah yeah with like any other grenade launcher direct hit them and that's GG you know I'm saying so not much different there and that's another one look at me on the tippity-top of the team and I'm only halfway up let's go foosh aah if I could hold it though like something like the fighting lion and ricochet off and get blue ok GAD just gonna die there but he lands right in my pool and then I just slowly but surely kill him you what okay there's a kill skrt skrt I'm I'm trying over here Oh what is this the guy off spawn he said what the fudge Oh God let's get a direct hit oh that wasn't a direct hit oh but he all but he is so dead and I am getting lit up right now ready check this out boom big brain area of denial didn't work cuz he just didn't step in it okay wait wait oh I spoke too soon he just delayed it okay shoot that era of denial get a little bit of damage oh my god maybe this might just be my new favorite gun ever in in in in and you want that heavy buddy old pal you can have it why would I need that when I have the worm with her horde I almost messed it up again with her horde mr. fruit with her board oh I was trying to like line it up so I was above him where like there's no way I could mess up the direct hit but then I did oh oh you're so dead not quite a direct hit but a lot of damage not quite a direct hit again as soon as I master the arc you know oh it's done not the Arkenstone I've been watching The Hobbit recently well I binge the Lord of the Rings extended edition so then that's like well got a got a binge The Hobbit extended edition and you know The Hobbit gets like just everybody's always so upset about it I don't think it's that bad I don't get it top of the team though no doubt in part due to the insane plays at the beginning of this match Bob could we get an instant replay out doves from Bob doesn't exist so that just means I have to do it myself so thanks me oh he he found one little corner where he can't get hit oh but he's still dying he's brothers trying to play like hot lava like get me off of this thing Nate that Oh Mike oh my [Music] oh I was skeptical at first and for that I apologize again a lot of fun super competitive to be seen although I think you could make a case for like email playing in trials so much chasing you cut off an area you know area of denial like boom you can't go through that doorway now for like a couple seconds yeah maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about anyway I want to thank you all very much for watching happy shells a fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
