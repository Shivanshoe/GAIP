but I don't even know how many weeks we are into the quarantine you know like how am I supposed to remember what episode we're on I'm not really sure but we do know that episodes are now delayed for audio users until Thursday so to everyone confused like yo where's the thing it's our studio they're playing the Thursday's so either I don't know we we usually record the no but we usually record them like later on we like to record closer to it because then there's usually more to talk about or it's like oh if there's something topical yeah there's something more topical right we're talking about tons of topical stuff they did I will you have the less likely that topical topical super topical topical like this is the top podcasted so it makes sense it makes sense and it almost makes as much sense as this hard cast review it just started off hey thanks ah here's an ad read I've been conditioned to be a slave to the best podcast in the universe titled by rot badge this is the best podcast I had ever listened to it is the only podcast I can listen to without having to skip through parts every second of this podcast is interesting to listen to and fully worth your time 100 stars now we're just we're squaring our the amount of stars this is rated you know a big 10 squared would be hundred I was watching this video one of those days have you ever been like on YouTube and it's like 2:00 in the morning and you're watching like how we came up with the biggest number in the world and you're like how the hell did I get to this point on YouTube here at 2:00 in the morning just one of those days but I just figured out like the world's biggest number but thou no I just forgot about it so kind of sucks there's no dense arrow UPS arrow arrow up is like what the equation is thank you thanks for that you're welcome just put an infinity symbol no well it's like but a genies not like number it's a concept yeah infinity is a concept when the highest number technically be a concept since there's no actual know the highest number there is a highest number and it's so big that if you were able to comprehend it your brain would turn into a black hole yeah just a lot of concept so hey so just drop the Infinity so what's the difference between a concept and a number a a number is like a tangible thing I could say this number if I wanted to right now I could start but didn't you say if you were to comprehend it your mind returned new black hole so we're theoretically referring to the number but your brain is not a black hole right now so like you can't say about it do you know why because they just basically made like a exhaustive no yeah I think this is what happens some dude was like well I'm tired accountant we're stopping in here and that's just that one he's like probably give up like there's no point we're never gonna get there some the guy who made math is just like this is it he's like listening for the greater good he's like he's like working on he's like oh my god oh my god this never ends does it 16 year olds who are up at 7 a.m. I I think about that sometimes like how do I ever do that like no wonder I would but grudgingly get on the bus every morning at like 6:15 in the morning which is bizarre bro yeah and go to class but like on the way like sitting and the bus like what am i doing the worst part - in Colorado like you want to get you want to get the heater seat because there's only like two of those in the entire bus you got to get the row with the heater and if you don't gg oh but that like it was worth it you just kind of huddle over try to go to sleep on the heater that's the only solace you had well because the worst part too is for me and my bus stop I was like first stop so we were first to get picked us I don't think so did we I don't know I can't remember anymore we would I'm talking like high school oh I see I probably was riding because my stepmom worked at the school at that point no I just froze my ass off in her car but problem was if we wanted to go with her we had to leave earlier because and go to work no yeah all I know is you go there you get there early class starts eight hours grinding away and then you're back on a bus and then you're going back in the worst part too is sometimes a Colorado by the time you're going back here in these winter clothes but the sun's out now you're like sweating on the bus nothing you can do about it yeah mmm nothing you do about it then you come home it's like 4:15 you're like you're tired you got homework to do at this point it's like what even know what's the point that's the call no I'd sometimes I would go home get some Eggos pop them in the toaster but then you butter the egg oh and then you put cinnamon and sugar on it and it's like a super scuffed cinnamon sugar crepe and never very healthy but I would eat like pop three four five of those and after school and then what are all the other snacks I'd have makes himself a top ramen all the time just hungry my parents for never home I don't know how I ever did it shout out to all you out you're grinders out there grinding well that's true well can you imagine yeah but now you're like sitting on zoom' calls for like eight hours like I wouldn't go I would my teachers are idiots but then like the students are idiots I would just think the teachers like every time my teachers would try to use like remember they had that like fancy board where it was like not real Expo marker but they would do yeah light projectors use marker why I always asked I was like we're using a fake board on top of a real board I was like why don't we just use the X like what is the difference and this climate was next shut up Robert there's no place like questions here so I was cleaning out my room oh you found that and yeah I found our senior yearbook hey I found what you wrote do you remember what you wrote oh my god no idea it's pretty long isn't yeah it's probably not long enough you are you're next to Tom Ogrin and my big F DOS those are it's not tough not not the toughest competition though you know yeah you you caught me Robert though she's kind of weird and there's formal I don't remember Robert we've been deep in the friendship game exclamation mark hey through the thick and thin we made it all caps on the made it dot dot dot throughout school dot dot dot throughout Halo through it all and that is bold exclamation marks in all caps you're a great guy even if everybody doesn't see it oh they don't know you like I do I know you've got a bright future Rob but you're a good kid just try to stay out of trouble and I think when I read the good like you're good kid you're a good kid Rob I'm always there for you love Christian Miller aka dodgeball MVP aka a mr. Titan aka a a prom king aka a a a host of can you guess with you're the host of it's whatever the announcements recall I can't remember what the fudge did we call it I was like I can't remember it what is it it was called Real Talk oh that's right Real Talk I can't I remember though I put all those because all those things grinded Rob's gears because he he he hate I'd be like dodgeball in peace oh you didn't win like it was a pity think like you do it's like we boring yeah he hates that and then that I want prom king cuz I beat out Cody and then mr. Titan cuz he guys take it and it ain't natural just technically technically because I just got the same prizes first place cuz I hustled in school but that's not how that works yes but like I literally did it in hopes of getting 3rd 2nd or 1st just so I could hustle the school and guess what I got a second and I was like word we're hustling we out of it so like you Keefer first the first place you got like two tickets in a tux rental right and then for second place you got one ticket and a tux rental and third place you just got the tux rental so I got a tux rental and then I went to a freshman like lunch where they were like it was like freshman and they were selling the tickets and they're like hi and I was like hey I just want to like redeem it--and I did it when there was a bunch of people around like trying to put on my jacket so they put it all like my dates so I was like so I use my voucher so I went to the senior one like two weeks later like the day before it closed and it was list Jones was like doing it it was like hey Rob I was like hey I just wanted to use my ticket voucher for mr. tighten on Jackie McCray up my date okay and this shows Oh Jackie looks like she already bought a ticket and I was like oh like oh good she's good for me then and she's like yeah and then she like gave your thing I was like uh I don't know like I don't know where it is she's like oh you you're good so I literally got two free tickets in socks rental because I just hustled this way way to go prowl do you know it's a hustle that's a Hustler's mentality right I don't have that I don't have that kind of mentality you shouldn't feel bad don't play the system in yeah no you did and here we are and it's funny that in the the year but guys like you got a good future you you're gonna go well kid you're gonna do great things here we are you know do you think we made it through it all hey do you guys think you'd be upset if you were in high school right now and you didn't get like a prom or graduation I really feel like I wouldn't give a [ __ ] like I feel like a lot of you more sad what what do you mean what do you mean you guys do that die do not even go noncommercial know what I don't I mean I never wait I went to everyone to mine so what's your controversial taking says we have we have weekend's we have well I'm just look look I'm a Mexican kid and there's like 12 of us in my school so we never went to that stuff yeah there's like 12 it was like 12 like brown kids and like a school why kids it's like just didn't even go you know what I think we're just not gonna go I didn't go to my orientation thing uh like in college when you're like supposed to go and like to the CSU thing and like take picture with like all the students that spell out the school no no no no then no chance I was there almost you go every extracurricular activity in any school at any point I opted at him you didn't go to that the CSU like no of course I was playing league from college I actually got into extracurricular stuff because we actually much you have a much more significant amount of diversity of people hanging out with were you in a club I was in a in college there was like this anime club I was it was time hey let's get it there was there was a PC Building Club that I signed up for but I never went to there yeah it was uh there was a get-together for smash which was tying those I uh I went to a lot of things eventually I stopped going because I'm an accelerated program so I was like eventually your work gets ahead of you so it's unfortunate but I never did any extracurricular anything in high school was until college I was like oh look at all these cool things to do and people that are like me this is tight well play you spread your wings and flew I was trying to see like what clubs you're in Christian because like in your the senior one is I'm supposed to list all the clubs and all your like nothing probably and you're just as Christian really with that's about right yeah I know your liking likes tutor Honors Society you know that kind of stuff no no I would I was in like newspaper but I think that was the year before yeah you do literally get anything written down I'll mine I have kite-flying Society girls soccer manager and a homecoming court how did you not like how did you not like have your name up I just remember I was newspaper the year before and they wanted to make me editor-in-chief I already hated newspaper yeah look at that stud yeah what's good ID super short here would you recall where that picture was taken some random photography is like an Elizabeth or something Amy - oh yeah I was in I was in newspaper the year before and I didn't I already didn't want to take that class but I needed some like extra credit and then wanted to make me editor in chief and I dropped out I dropped that I was like I'm not doing this I forget what I did instead but like it was like a third the way into the semester is way too much work like this is what you have to do which is like everything it's a random credit class yeah like this is supposed to be like just some random credit class for no dip but that was the only time I had the Boston Globe but I think I did show up in junior year for newspaper and that's probably the only thing I've ever like been in but now I like extracurricular activity like Club know the bell rings dude I'm out of school hey I'm off campus I'm going home dude I don't care what it takes I'm going to a friend's house that was it for me it's like I spent like my whole life here like you want me to spend more time no miss me with that and so I did you know whatever was in a club ever I was gonna segue oh no it's gone I can't it was a bad segue anyway what was the segue to just any of the topics we'd written down oh oh dude I bet you you would have been in a Pokemon does luck play through club that's okay why don't you guys do I saw this thing with people do a Pokemon playthrough at the same tweet we we talked about this it's never done it what it what is that it's called like a solely yeah okay so the way the century works is so like blue and I like the BLET they'll play through I'm doing right now let's say right essentially blue and I doing the exact same thing at the exact same time but the way it works is like let's say we're playing pokemon red whatever and we're doing in that lock and in the first route we catch pokemon so those he plays on red and you play on red yeah or he could play blue wait as long as it's the same Jen all that stuff doesn't matter that much but then like we're like sharing our screen so we can see what each other's doing and then the big part of like a so link is in that route that encounter we have to link quote-unquote like link aren't our Pokemon we catch if we catch them so let's say I run into a Scyther and he runs into a Charmander whatever it because it's randomized encounters let's say we go to try and catch them sure yeah me too well hopefully not because then we'd never catch it but yeah let's write a topical so let's say blue goes gets the Charmander I go and catch my cypher there now there now a pair and what that means is like their souls are linked so what happens is let's say we're playing and in an unfortunate turn of events and a fight blues Charmander faints I I just lose my cypher now I consider my site there daddy yeah sure it's Charmeleon yeah but the thing is like yeah they're like that they're a pair so if one dies the other I lose them no matter what doesn't matter if mine actually died yeah so now my site they're gone I have to get rid of it and then you also move a lot of people will do like when you're trying to get encounters it has to be a type that us that a pairing already doesn't have to like if we already have like a water and a pair and he finds a water encounter he has to keep going to find an encounter that's not the same and then if he can't I don't I think we can't even do that route and then on top of that yeah you can't like cross and then on top of that if he does find that encounter and fails to catch it and I catch mine I can't use my account yeah yeah so makes it yeah makes it even more difficult and then you just try and go and both try and obviously like complete the lock because like you have to yeah and like you're roughly in the same spot yeah we've like you like you see each other's like games so like you're essentially you try and play at the same pace so someone's like super far ahead it doesn't have to be like directly spot-on but like only like a couple trainers or something right like you want to be at the same gym now how do you capture it's just through yeah well I have a modded 3ds and that was a nightmare yeah to get those things modded it was literally a small fortune yeah for that stupid office a fire thing I did in addition to having to wait super long to even be able to get one get the equipment for your it soft enough you have to Leary send a 3ds yeah it was a nightmare so I love doing the alpha sapphire but yeah like any other one if it can't be like an emulator I'm out switch now I'm like it's a lot easier why do they call it a Nuzlocke I don't know cuz the original person who made it was I think it was it's so I think it rigid from a comic cuz I remember being in that community oh yeah I think you're right dude his mascot was essentially Nuzlocke so he started they started calling him does lock runs the original concept of a Nuzlocke came from a Nuzlocke comic it was just it was this big thing that everyone I mean I made my own does a lot comic back in the day we talked about this a little bit and one of the I think the legacies maybe yeah somewhere it was it wasn't too long ago I wasn't too long ago we talked about maybe a comic about the anniversary Rob asked this exact question and I am giving him the exact yes sir maybe was the with Abbott the summit maybe yeah so the dude made this concept of if your Pokemon is knocked out then they're dead so he made this comic and his mascot was a Nuzlocke and it was this huge thing that people read like every single wing mascot is in does luck what the [ __ ] is a nose massive okay so what does lock is like a bird or like it's like a grass it's a grass pokémon that honestly you know like this yeah you know like the cons it's like it's like if hitmonchan had like a leaf on its head ah yeah it evolves from seedot and it was it was very it was a tight comic so this comic turns into an entire thing everyone starts doing nuzlockes because they want to do their own does lot cuz it sounds like a tight idea people make their own fan comics about their nuzlockes there's a whole forum about nuts locking and eventually just screw into something bigger than what it started as very prevalent well the interesting thing about nuzlockes is like cuz like how the comics portrayed it it's like the stories that are created even if you're just playing it yourself like one you're being forced to use Pokemon you probably wouldn't otherwise your Pokemon you typically wouldn't and then it's like seeing who can pull through or like what unfortunate events happen you kind of create your own storyline yeah and that's why I like doing it like all the all the unfortunate things like the meme of like Noah the Paras who I thought was in me too at first like he was disregarded and then he had his mo Mike all that kind of stuff like that just makes it way more interesting yeah that's that's why people love the comic back in the day because all these moments that happen he just made the comic off of events that happened in his game and I mean the events in game alone are so entertaining to dramatize them in comic form would make like genuinely super interesting stories with the comic book ones randomized or now like were those like normal probably the first thing I'd add it was randomized yeah randomized like moderate like modifications to those locks didn't come to later I know well like people ask me like what do you do like how do you record this the thing is like especially on the thing I don't think I can say like oh I do and emulate or something because that's like I guess technically like I mean emulators are technically like you know or like illegal I guess ranked just technically you're getting the game for free the way I see it those I borrowed all these games before but like I can but also it's not like it's you just generally speaking like staff members just come into your Chandler like hey you've got proof of purchase where's you show me the receipt well if they knew the steps to try and actually mod something like I did my office half I they'd be like okay yeah understandable have a nice day no there's there's huge emulators now and people have like everything literally built into the settings you can be like change this city can you do one where it's like oh the national poke thanks but you're just playing like on the latest handheld one or no well technically the typically the only game doesn't have a national pokedex sword shield so yeah and all the other games you could literally just spawn the Pokemon in doesn't matter why don't you do a Nuzlocke in that one well it's where Jordan field yeah I mean you could but it's harder to homebrew a switch then is to play through like it already ready to go emulator I guess which I have looked into it maybe one day I'll bother but like the yeah like the disappointing thing with like sword and shield for instance is like right now with my black and white to randomize game there's more Pokemon in that game to randomize than there would be sword and shield even though it's gen-5 too because they didn't quit no I have to admit the the as much as I don't like national dex not being a thing i could not imagine having any semblance of competitive balance with all the old mechanics and all the old pokemon because i've been playing a lot of the ranked battles and home i guy it's already getting pretty nutty on the switch yeah i want to get to master mold here we believe I was telling you I like to watch the competitive people play and then I spend so much time watching wolfy like so much time it's actually probably unhealthy I have a question what's up so like so like competitive pokemon I get the card aspect like like I put this I texted this into my deck can you like tech moves on to certain type of Pokemon like if you're like oh I want my dragon I but I wanted to have these move sets like these kind of moves yeah but banned well I mean you can create like texts I mean there's a limit though like for instance what is it mu or whatever is the only Pokemon I can learn any move so like some Pokemon just can't learn certain moves or be taught certain moves but yeah there's like there are certain Pokemon a lot there's a lot of tech to cut compared to Pokemon there's actually people like assume that it's like oh it's just Pokemon there's only four moves but there's like a J so I think there is a huge learning curve to competitive Pokemon like learning per year and those kind of attacks like I can guarantee you there's a lot of moves you wouldn't offenses boos yeah there's a lot of competitive moves that you wouldn't expect to be like meta are yeah cuz I mean like I'm like the little kid who's like when you're playing Pokemon is like this move doesn't attack me no learn trash yeah whereas like there's literally some Pokemon don't move yeah so it's way more complicated and the thing too though is like you'll see texts let's say like ICCA dragged a pole someone sends out of drag the pole you can assume it's a special attacker but it could be a physical attacker or it could be built with like focus sash surf - like weakness policy somebody like there's so many different ways you can build certain pokémon - so you don't immediately know what you're fighting or like did they tech protect on this person or do they have this or blah blah bar like what item are they using if they it's like a choice band and you can probably guess what moves they have yada yada like items into the mix like fruits have a choice band stuff you could have stuff for it's like Oh Tyranitar Oh this move is super effective against it of course I'm gonna use it it'll one-shot it and then the terrain is a sexy people to be high HP and it has a weakness policy and suddenly you just played another with the Terran Thor what'd you do if it is my trap card is there so much tax with like my team alone so I just built this team this I just finished building it like a week ago cuz I'm trying to get to master ball they're only switch like pokedex available right like this yeah sword shield yeah there's a limit right now to who you can have and yeah like legendaries you can't use yeah oh okay so so just to show how deep poco I can get right cuz I'm gonna start going over nerd [ __ ] and people gonna be like what the [ __ ] is he talking about but the real ones are gonna be like oh no blue plays VGC re-poll jerks so I play VGC as well so currently right there's like you have the current national pokedex available and sword and shield so there's so many things but the meta right now is like stuff like Toby kiss fairies in general follow me is a move that so I don't really play singles I play VGC which is doubles Soto kiss is like the big thing where it's got its got this move called follow me where you could direct all attacks toward it this that that's current turn people use that like for set of sweepers yes Rob so you take double battles does that still mean you have a total of six Pokemon so well now so in VGC the rule set is that you can only bring four into a battle oh but you have six total to pick from so it's kind of like a mind game like a picking encounter picking they think I'm gonna they're like oh they Hanabi drew like Beedrill counters me I hope they don't pick that Beedrill yeah but then they're like vase he might be drill and think that I'm gonna kind of be there so I'm not gonna beat bring bay drill but let's stand I'm gonna leave with it there's that kind of mind games so that yeah so that all leads up to what I want my team right cuz I don't want to give you like a no like no context of how it works so I had my team is based around Drago poll right my teams based around Drago poll with weakness policy so I want Drago poll and what weakness policy does is when he gets hit by a weak it's like it's attacked a super effective against him his attack and special attack are based around Drago Pulte setting up with either dragon dance or getting his weakness policy off is he shiny yeah so pretty tight you you know me Rob he's yellow he's Thai and we got a real quiet though Drago poll silver Lee whimsicott Rotom we make fan art will for me - and maybe Q so my team is like this based on this triple ghost team that has like super popular me do you see at one point and the whole gimmick of the team here we go in a nerd territory the whole gimmick of the team is I have Silva Li and whimsicott are based around being like the leads of the team so both of those are designs whimsicott this order a flower whimsicott it used to be actually like super on every single team really on me to see my team's base are up kind of a gimmick with with with like a tanky weakness palsy dragon bolt so i've whimsicott which is there to throw this thing called Southbury fling fling it's dark type move so you throw Southbury Drago pole it increases dragon boat speed and activates his weakness policy so that's one gimmick and that's design said just like counter teams who don't have like follow me or like trick room and stuff and then I have Silva Lee who is a normal type and he has this move called explosion so Jaco polt is a ghost type so explosion will not so explosion doesn't move that literally takes your Pokemon like you literally sack them on they blow up but the move does like yeah yeah like self-destruct yeah yeah so the catch is that Drago pol is goat so when I explode my soul II will damage everyone but my Drago pole so that turn my dragon pole will just dragon dance and then hopefully get hit by like something was weakness policy later on the match and that team is there to counter stuff like trick room and follow me teams which are so trick room is a is a is a strategy where you literally reverse speed so you have really like really slow Pokemon so either there debate those that doesn't always work right cuz sometimes people will do the same called full room well the lead with two trick room Pokemon to guarantee a trick room get set up so that's why I have mimicked you on the team with trick room so if they have a full room team mimic you will just trick room their trick room back and now we're back to square one Pokemon competitive gets really [ __ ] deep alright so there's good like typing and then aegislash is like there's a really good strong steel type that can but what is the best Pokemon no you can not just real best Pokemon because every team there is no such thing as a best Pokemon really yeah beauty of competitive Pokemon is the fact that no team will ever be able to fully prepare for everything there's so much in the game that you're never gonna be able to make a team that fully compensates for every single strategy in the game are there band Pokemon that are in the game just besides only legendary so like with smoking they'll like that's like kind of like a group like like a public community made tearless and those things get banned as what people theme like is unfair and stuff when it comes to VGC it's completely dictated by Nintendo so it depends on the rule set for the year so this year speedy C is you know there's no legendary as you can't use any Legendary's like box Legendary's and that's pretty much it some years there's not vaneless at all so you could use anything you want I think it's way more it without legend Ares yeah otherwise legend just like centralize it so much did they used to have legendaries at one point almost always yeah oh yeah I just the the 2019 VGC was like straight up it was the ultra series and it was like extreme use anything on them before that with like XY alpha sapphire was just primal Groudon primal Kyogre or mega Rayquaza just over and over and over yes with a mr. fruit right after this head break listen if you're still using one of the big wireless

may not be we're just gonna say espn2 and we have a couple stuff to talk about because like I said we're very topical people talking about nuzlockes which are super new that's a new thing like yeah exactly Beaumont jet like that's this new thing I'm if you guys worry about it kind of like it's really starting to pick up steam we have quite a few things I mean where to start we can start with you know I'll touch on this and then we'll have our expert you know join us here Guardian games in destiny - because it's exactly what I thought it would be and I'm still disappointed I don't know what you guys were expecting let's be real well I like I was expecting not much and it's still like I don't yeah so I was making something not nothing it is literally reskin faction rallies but I would argue not even as interesting less interesting faction allies from DT which mind you just like trials of Osiris they said they took away to retool and to figure out where its space lies and destiny like trousers of Osiris isn't right here well so we'll wait a couple years and would it'll give you the exact same thing and then yeah with Guardian games what they meant is we're gonna take this away so in one season we can say Guardian games and bring it back yeah I feel like this is them testing how they want a new faction realized to be but I mean yeesh I feel bad for all the suckers that are like dude Titans are ruling made like hunters drool it's like God's just turning in bounties I think there's no way of determining which is better than the I think that's the only thing that makes it interesting for people is that you can be like haha Titans won like get destroyed but but like the problem is though like like what 60% of the player race or hunter hunters you know so why do we like so fundamentally already they wouldn't know much of Atari games because you already know the Normie class is gonna be the highest-earning so they had to retool it down what they should have done in my opinion is had like like a thing where oh you have to go into the crucible and and beat the [ __ ] of other hunters and warlocks and you know whoever gets the most points you know appropriate to have like a special matchmaking thing or you know or which class gets the most kills and strikes or you know for the day Oh yesterday was warlocks so you guys get this cool Vanguard package or or anything cool stuff anything more than hate so who does the most bounties today Oh ty you know you guys did it so what is what is what do you do there's bounties I mean yeah except there's not much and then what does she do she goes okay do this and it's just a bounty watch manage and say I do the bounty now I go turn it in uh-huh i pound it and say yeah i turn this in oh and then I get gear from that right no okay no here yet why no you gear it's just not like actually meaningful yeah there's nothing the only exclusive stuff are like some go shells the even bigger kick in the dick is that the metals are literally just bounties that go in your quest yeah Tori like let me give you like hey we know you're like bounties what if we put bounties in your bounties someone someone had a good idea like they did in Halo 3 which by the way was one of my favorite playlist multi-team except this time you bring multi-team back so it's like 3b 3b 3 or 4 b4 b4 b4 and you just can only match with your class should be a game literally a game of titans versus hundred versus warlocks yeah but and then we have a new mode well no that's what I'm saying like you would only be able to matchmake if your team was either all Titans or like it would just be like a freelance queue so you just go and solo and they pair you with your team but then like literally that's you're competing against the others you could see who won the most games who want you got myself one point to the car or like three points second you get like two points and then 30 like one point to the cause someone keeps track so super easy you guys talk about all this competition and how tight it would be the worst part is the main [Music] the main reason for people even doing this Guardian games for that new LMG the heir apparent which is a tight LMG it's actually pretty fun that the exotic that came out yeah yeah yeah so it's specifically a Guardians reward the problem is the most efficient way to get it is to literally play cuz you need every class so you need triumphs you need medals into complete triumphs by getting medals or different whatever you have to do for Guardian games to to even get the triumph to get the heir-apparent the problem is the most efficient way to do that is to play on all three classes so you finish the tribes quicker it still likes you exactly you're not supposed to do in Guardian games yeah and then what I also don't understand is why are we getting what seems which doesn't even seem it's what are you like a Kailash is his gun a red Legion like a cabal's gun and guarding games you couldn't put this somewhere else there it makes sense yeah it's just kind of like out here like but at the very least it's saying it's a new exotic it's not like a new reprise it's a new exotic give to that and it's fun to use when you so you can only shoot it when it's fully spun up it's kind of like the sweet business except sweet business can automatically start shooting but uh and then once it's fully spun up you can shoot it whenever and when it's fully spun up if you're full shields you get an arc over shield and you run around shooting people but also what's interesting though is while you use it in PvP it counts as like a PvE cloth as a shield so if someone uses an arc shield against you while you have that shield it actually burns it really quick and it'll like burst and hurt your teammates around you like it would normally in PvE so it's like a giving them take like you could get that over shield you have that but if someone has an arc just like normally you'd be in trouble way to play around a gun yeah and then there's bounty simulator guess how you get it yeah on every class by the way like blue said in a thing that you're supposed in with her so that's destiny Muniz you know it has bunker well bunkers which yeah which just make you play the exact same thing so there's really no I'm hoping for more slits for more to do before the end of the season because he said these will have surprises hey but well Bungie says surprises they give us bash in like three weeks early you did get the Quidditch public event okay so it's that this is the Seraph bunk just that normal like sarah public event we just go around throwing the orbs at like the we're just a glorified public event hey we got a public event and Savannah nice and then they see my mate so people were like here's my biggest issue with the community okay I might go on a little off here but please forgive me go on the issue with the community is anytime Bungie gives us a small carrot of hope the entire community is like Oh Bungie god it's so delicious thank you and literally the table was literally just like hey we know there's cheating we're still not gonna do anti cheat but we're working on it and everyone's like oh yes yes they literally didn't say they're doing and Ichi cuz they're not gonna all they said was that they're gonna start banning people who play with cheaters yeah and I'm like wait you're applauding it for something they should have already been doing okay well that's a little weird and then they're just like oh yeah and also when trials were making some changes I'm like oh you mean changes that were in d1 oh so delicious so good look man this community is really nice but you guys have such low standards it gets really we actually have to like real changes to actually make a real difference so I'm bungees like yeah we're gonna think about anti-cheat your response shouldn't be spongy Wow really great communication the response should be why don't we already have that I'm just I'm upset I just they cheat on you they came back with like some flowers like oh yeah we love you yeah you're forgiven look communications good I like communication I think communicate communicated this table that's super tight but if they communicate with really bad answers I'm not gonna be like guy bungee you did an incredible job this week and I hope you realize you did great please invite me to the summit no please how do we actually get like changes in the game that mattered telling people that you're not gonna do anti-cheat and then people reacting with a nice that's like come on what are we doing why are we here also cheese cheese like the response I saw it on Twitter was just like come on we we should be asking for better than this is the reason why people keep like getting super hype over returning socks it's like you know my dad do you one what are you getting excited about makes me mad like I'm lion king that that grinds my gears is when people get excited about like oh dude the last word Yami I like ran with that d1 I loved you too I really do but but right when we're getting it takes so little for the community to go from yay - ah this really sucks and then immediately back to yay but they didn't but we don't get anything yet over nothing yeah we're not getting any there's no reason to say yay well it's like it's like when Chris Rock talks about like 10 carry kids he's like I take care of my kids like you're supposed to get dumb [ __ ] well zoo I don't know man I I'm not expecting a whole lot from next season am I gonna play the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of it absolutely because I'm too far deep on like we paid the rent the utility this week thanks but that's what that's what I don't understand like most of the time you're the one that chose to have a kid right that was your choice you should know when you were sign up for it and even if you didn't and you took the kid on you now know what you have to you have to like accept those responsibilities so like I'm saying like you're doing them a favor by feeding them by giving them somewhere to stay what do you mean like that's that's what you do there your kid that's bare minimum you're doing bare minimum there bungees doing bare minimum they left for Sagi's yeah they left their Sagi's but there's they're sending like child support a little bit I get every now and then I'm like Oh our payments will leave and whatever they're fine like that's what we got right now and then they show up one day like oh I forgot my lighter no oh oh dad oh my god like like no no I'm just headed back like oh my god I love you so much I love this game if anything the season needs to teach Bungie is the same thing they should have learned from the gambit season is you can't make an entire season based around a single mode and expect it to be like expect to just work out just fine because people like oh I love trials yeah like the people you have people on Twitter love trials but what about the people that like play your game every every day I'm gonna be honest I probably have one of the most unlikable d-2 opinions or like destiny future opinions I think PvP needs to just go entirely right if PvP was good they need to have it in some sort of way like if they have it like in a lost sector or something like that someplace where you can go and do that but like just as a mode as its I think it just needs to go like it's on what the game is I don't think that's unpopular I don't think it's necessary to take out PvP though as much as I think it's necessary to take it out I think they will just make them focus on make it easier for them to actually yeah it to like balance changes and have things you know I don't think PvP needs to get taken out to be successful and like properly do like the game could be as like a true like FPS MMO I'd only need to be taken out I do agree if we're taking out it would make a lot easier for them to do it but so many of the changes that need to be made in the game for to really become like a true RPG MMO shooter are things that wouldn't that don't like mutually effect pvp and PVE together it's just I don't know I I don't really think I feel like I'm always playing a game that I don't know what the direction is gonna be because I don't know if it's if they want the game to be like a true FPS MMO I don't know if they want the game to be as it is right now where it's basically just like an activity PvP PvE game I don't know if they want the game to be more competitive as like a viewer like a twitch like watchable game because they do all these things where it's like specifically for streamers and youtubers but then they bring back trials with like half the content like I don't I don't even think they really know what they want the game to be and I my main problem is that I it sucks when they don't know what they want it to be because now I don't know what I'm gonna get in the future from the game I don't think I ever have known exactly what I'm gonna get from it mis frutas with it going hit you with some better gaming news Oh or I can hit you with his play desi stuff I could talk about first off they need a good designing document because apparently they lack one which just tells everybody it's a gaming design dr. nog yeah we're just shows like pillars of a game right so like when you have a big studio let's say like even if you're working with like five plus people on it like a game let's say you make it like a design document it's essentially like a blueprint for the game and it has pillars saying like this game at its core is like for instance like like it FF FPS MMO light we want the game to feel like this because this is what we hope to achieve these like these are the things we like artistically this is the direction we like gameplay lives is what we're looking for player wise this is what we're hoping for them to feel and it just feels like they just don't know what they're doing but I mean like did it better like right now booze like I don't even know what the game is the thing is like like blue is saying PvP isn't the problem right now the problem is what am I even playing for there's no loot like and that's the game you want to get loot but there's not even a reason what I was asking what I was about to ask you guys it's like why do you guys like and it wasn't think I mean I even like a meme questions like why do you play destiny because it's fun to shoot things the world itself is so tight I know people me more than the ability it's really bad the abilities they're hard oh the story is terrible I wasn't talking about those stories awful yeah series awful but the lore behind is super tight the world they actually built is tight there's there's just something about the game where there's just enough sci-fi and abilities to where you feel like you're powerful but it's not quite it's not enough to where just totally takes away from the guns either and I don't know there's just no there's no other game that tries to bridge the gap between co-op FPS RPG MMO like there's no other game that truly does that so I guess the reason I play des days because I mean realistically there's no other game that does what d2 does you can't you can't tell me there's another game that and it's similar to d2 fundamentally like maybe it may be a d2 has a lot of similar things about it from other games but like in terms of a like a Loutre shooter kind of thing if I had to pick between playing those games I would pick d2 know Borderlands exists the borderlands is limited on what yeah I don't play that for so long before like beating the boss in two point two seconds is like the fun you get from it or like trying to build the perfect kind of build for a specific boss I don't know yeah just like a true social could be FPS RPG MMO but it's just never liked quite never quite bites like pulls the trigger on that and I mean the the problem we're seen with it is what are we what we've seen like the past decade with like mmo's because it's MMO life ish there's like literally we don't see new MMO is because of how expensive and risky it is to like do something like that and this new looter shooter FPS MMO light kind of genre that we have like with destiny is like almost equally yeah as difficult like like we're seeing Bungie we see how successful the game has been the money they've gotten the people they've worked with and they're still struggling to do it and realistically Bungie is the only studio that's tried it because they're the only studio that realistically had the money to pursue it at them at the point when they were at the point they were at because it cost so much money to just like him like this I don't think people realize how much it's even for just like normal guns like to play test them and to go through the process of making like new perks new exotics the amount of money it cost is astronomical and the fact that we get this stuff is still pretty crazy to me but simultaneously it's also like how do you [ __ ] most of the exotics are like useless the same time it's like it's crazy there haven't been updated yeah so much of the exotic armor just wasted if someone just straight up don't work I have a question for you guys what is the worst thing to happen to destiny this season me too it could have been that's where I think silver and like the that stores like the worst thing that happened to destiny I don't think so I don't think it's the worst I mean I think those were like put into strikes like a weekly rotation like hey this strike this week you'll have this thing and you can run it unlimited times it's like this has a 1 in 25 chance to drop this I was like one of 50 like can you get this Sparrow and then you can still have like the silver store or whatever but just make it a little bit like lighter and stuff like a player banner or something like that I hate that they have these freaking skins behind a pay $10 it's it's certainly a problem I don't think it's Destiny's main problem I think this bunch Oh for sure for sure that would help the lose I've I think the main problem is destiny has never honestly indeed when they were closer I don't think anyone's bearing into need to but a destiny has never like really decide on what it wants to be so it's always being pulled in different directions and what do you want like what do you want they don't know I think that's their primary problem continues happening but I mean there's no other game like d2 so I'm gonna keep playing it I mean there's truly no other game like deal when is the next C's is a season an expansion or no no no so severe seasons are they replaced what we used to know as like expansions right but yeah so these aren't these literally are I mean they literally said these are not expansions like in the last like previous year destiny where and the grand scheme of things we got crazy amount of content last season or last year like it was pretty ridiculous this year they just wanted to call em seasons I mean these seasons are very inexpensive you didn't pay very much to get these season regardless of the content that went into them so well the game is for you right the game is also for you I mean but I mean it's free stuff to buy like the expansions today and to get this season you still have to pay to get the stuff but yeah so these aren't true expansions so do we are we ever gonna get one again well we're gonna get like assuming there's been Leafs and stuff like we're gonna get a fall DLC but they mentioned the reason we have seasons now is because they couldn't keep up what they used to do like they set or at least what they said was they set themselves up for an impossible pace that they couldn't keep doing which was three Studios work yeah another and we we saw how big like I don't think we all fully appreciate it like how much like Vicarious Visions and stuff contributed they didn't appreciate how much we got last year Forsaken Condon cycle that was oh yeah for shaken and for shame was great so I'm saying then it just fall hit again nothing but love to Bungie I think a lot of people thought because Activision was leaving that we would get like a total like see ya I think everyone thought we were gonna finally see like what bungees identity was gonna be for the game but we have I think Bungie is still figuring things out as an independent studio so I'm not like gonna say I miss Activision because I feel like that's a little it's a little over the top say right now but I think it's obvious that Activision was definitely not a bad thing for Bungie because they got all these studios to work on their goals they we had so much content last year and they say Activision was like bring Bungie down I don't think we have any proof as far as like what we've gotten content wise to to see that yet so hopefully Bungie proves me wrong and speaking of publishers though helping out other people like Activision did to Bungie Riot Games and as for the first time they're helping publish hightail s you know that's the the new like minecraft s game that came from the people who made the like most popular infamous server hightail on minecraft it's like Minecraft but with like quests and RPG and all this kind of stuff and there's already looking dope and then Riot Games a couple days goes like yo by the way we're helping them usually get up there like it looks it's seriously like because literally hightail yeah modded and maid service and everything like the way they wanted minecraft to be which is like more in depth like RPG systems questioning stuff now that you're like you know why don't we just make a game so that's what they're doing and I'm doing a mr. fruit and I'm making a tab for age why I thought it was like oh no a hightail that's very promising especially with like someone like Riot Games behind them cuz right has never done anything like that it'll be interesting to see how they're able to help them there they literally have the biggest game like internationally and they are trying to make that's Ryan and epic are both trying to do like a similar thing and it's not like it's a bad business decision where they're basically trying to take all the most popular genres and say hey we've got one too these people did it pretty good but imagine if we had more money than them and remember what I'm here for desert remember used to be Bethesda that like Bethesda was like the the creme de la creme nice man yeah and then it was blizzard and then they fell and now it's riot I guess it's been riot in the terms of MOBA Ryan it's been a little more low-key us wise because riot is such an international presence I don't think here in the States we understand just how big their footprint is yeah which is yeah it's huge I mean riot is it's scary yeah as big not as big as Volvo I the International riot is more steamed like a steam client this team's not as big in like China and stuff yeah but I would still think the numbers are still higher than if you could count the league client like when you open that and in the Steam client I mean the most popular game like the most popular fps is what really I think crossfire something which has its own launcher in a some jenkki like mm like year or 2000 FPS that's like csgo is better than it but it's just what like China and Asia play like I think we are just here and we see the influence of like steam like everybody has it because it's such a yeah it's so ubiquitous in the Western that's not that's the American in you you you stupid America on the stupid you're on the wrong train undervalue just how gigantic League of Legends alone has has a as a footprint just in general on just the global gaming economy and man if Riot is successful with valor n't maybe maybe Valerie might not be the biggest game here in like over in the stage us which it's already seems like it's getting pretty high up there right as far as like 1.2 million on Twitch oh and then its first day right so for that I mean and that game clearly appeals to a more Asian market as well so we're not just gonna see if even if it's not successful here as long as they find success but which is their primary goal I think ultimately well I mean to find success in on an international scale not just uh not just here even just thinking about how you mentioning like they're trying to do games but better and stuff hightail would go under that right Microsoft has minecraft which is just a monster right riot though can now have a competitor especially if it takes off which you immediately have people having me interested but like now they can say well we house under this we also have hightail like I wouldn't be surprised soon if they just have their own launcher I'm surprised they don't yet yeah they have yeah but yeah they're like hitting all the stuff they're gonna have a fighting game they're gonna have it does not matter if bad the pure fact that it's going to be a huge riot back fighting game are the chance you think so yeah many people so many pros playing rights Vlada team set is gonna be on there well all we saw was in the like to second footage we saw way back when they announced a it was darius like Duncan on the Hartree and I was like Darius is in on it oh is he your main I plug there is I just have like a couple trams like somatically really like but but that's the thing too though is like what they're probably gonna do to which will immediately draw people especially the fighting game communities you're gonna have an online that isn't garbage because that's a problem with a whole bunch of fighting game yeah bar alike like I mean like bar like Tekken maybe if then but like we see what they're trying to do even just with like Valerie and servers tick rates all that kind of stuff now imagine they have some like because the problem is it's usually peer-to-peer not peer to peer I think that's actually when it's a problem but they're gonna have something that makes us that like fighting game with them most likely reduced latency yeah most reliable Network because that's that's the biggest problem in the ultimate ultimate would be such our [ __ ] online of a game if the online was not Nintendo offline oh my god spider launch even even Dragon Ball fighters which probably has one of the better net codes people still complain about that all the time I don't know Rob but I was gonna mention I don't know if you saw the tweet blue so where some guy was trying to say like how can people say MK leo is the best when he's not winning these Wi-Fi tournaments right now and it's like okay the hardy soul of fighting games one what's all they can do right no one because of the pure nature of networks you're never going to get the purest you know what's the word like real like Jesus I'm having a huge brain fart like the true integrity reaction time no integrity integrity I think the true integrity of a fighting game is in not having any like Network you know inconsistencies and that's just naturally how it's always gonna be so being able to react properly and knowing that if you click this button it's going to have like it's this is a frame to move it's gonna come out frame to yeah and yeah so someone was truly so bad it's really a different game if you from online tool and 100% was such a hot take I was like bruh you're a clown trying to say that Wi-Fi dictates if she could play or not like bro but if league of legends if Riot Games can make a fighting game that comes closely integrity of land that I mean could you have like you just people are gonna swarm to that if fighting game pros are gonna play the absolute [ __ ] you're already gonna get tons of them that goes right now I'm 140 something I think even if being at like 50 or 60 would be nuts I mean I can't imagine they're gonna go back crazy especially because at that point balanced integrity like how do you have 60 fighters that are all and they just keep making more robust or I mean the difference between MOBAs and fighting games as mobiles are simple you have each character has much more there's more nuance because like a fighting game straight up frame data can just determine whether or not like a character is good yeah fighting game is all straight up you have each character has dozens of moves and each of those moves depending on what fighting game you're playing will interact in different ways with other parts of their move set combos get taken into account people make their own combos some some moves are strictly for you know setting up other moves are they're just part of combos there's so much nuance to finding hymns whereas in league the nuance is not about how will you play your character all the time but more about how you play with your team how like your game sense where's fighting him it's like just beat the [ __ ] out of each other with your with your characters as long as they have set and kidded well I think the if they're smart the thing they'll do is very similar to what like Dragon Ball fighters he did where there's an easier combo system built in to make you feel like even if you like I don't know these bread butter combos if I if I mash square and I'm hitting it and they're now blocking like oh wow I did a combo I think that's going to be they need to have that thing where it's like low slow yeah like a low barrier of entry like Fighter Z where you can do this right yeah which I think Fighter Z does yeah accessible fighting caves oh it's actually someone against like a competitive guy they're gonna be but it has the illusion of accessibility because there's all the character you're familiar with and I think that's where oh my god now that I'm thinking about it holy [ __ ] bro Brian's gonna have the double leer the double feature they're gonna have characters people are familiar with so people are gonna want to play despite being that way like me in addition if they were to really like implement how easy like the the auto combo system the fighters oh my god you'll have skins on there probably for those teams let me sick I'm saying like give them a couple years in roll yeah well like look back and as long as they don't mess it up like both heads on which to be fair I think I'm actually gonna go back and try fallout 76 years soon I've seen I've heard good things about the deal positive yeah so I also it would be hypocritical of me to be like this game still sex when it's you know like a year and a half later we'll see where it is the game did suck and they messed up but we can see I mean go do that to [ __ ] Skyrim okay don't do that to fallout alright well I'm hoping this new Elder Scrolls is just gonna be a banger bro anger and the fact like we'll have it on PC - it's my PC you're probably still not be able to run it but speaking of right it's a dream yeah well I wish they're certainly not sponsoring husband hit me this is a different ad from an even cooler company and welcome back the best podcast on either side of the Mississippi I do agree it doesn't matter which side we're on that shy it's the best valor entrench coming next week finally with the new update blue isn't as excited but Rob and I certainly aren't dude there's nothing else to play okay yeah okay let me go play d2 bounty sim I mean I am but if you don't play it you think it's bad but he knows but I've seen you postlets and you love it I haven't seen hyped about it in a long time yeah because I suck and I was like wow I actually did something tight but I'm probably not going to play I'm pretty bad I mean we talked about it like for me like I play most competitive or multi like multiplayer games cuz it's like I want to hit a ranked mode and I want to see where I stack even if it's not as the best but I love always having something to shoot for and I think it'll help right now - with valor in cuz like right now wins and losses aren't that important to me as long as like oh I did well alright but then once it's like no like the thing that matters right now is we need this dub like that helps a lot I think I know pros and every like now I can go to I can keep doing my share if only rounds in casual the reason I don't want to I don't care for valor rank is because lil Sally's favorite son all eight of them are all gonna be like Valor it is out it's a riot game shoot err it's time for me to go pro so everyone's gonna be there's gonna be straight-up every single person in the entire history of eSports is gonna be like [ __ ] valor it's that [ __ ] time ago approach [ __ ] [ __ ] I think we're gonna see that once they announce whatever week they're gonna have I think that's when people are gonna be like oh alright especially like a lot of pros like if writes like alright we're starting this league we're franchising here's the money I think you're gonna be like oh okay like third party yeah they're starting it with the yeah I like grassroots first yeah yeah which i think is a good call people also doing the work for you so you let let us start out like that and then I think once they're ready I assume would have that game has to be officially released yeah then you go from there but that's fighting game I mean I'm sure I'm sure rides fighting game will be it even when one comes out [Laughter] oh my god like 0.3 what do you have Jack Jack Johnson and Tom O'Leary do you guys want me to ask patreon questions or is there anything else you guys fruit is there anything else on the top of this would go over um YouTube ad revenue please get better that would be nice so like the video go watch the second channel surprised you don't do that what have you ever thought about doing that being like if this video gets like 10k likes I do with my Nuzlocke okay if each video gets like each fitting used to get hit a 5000 threshold and then Friday I do an hour to power episode so take double the link but well why not I get to just cuz it makes everyone like that and then comment down below to have your chance to be a Pokemon named after you I like that just because suddenly like it's so much more interactive and people even if they don't care or normally comment that I got to make a comment on get more comments and likes on my Pokemon then they get my main channel no mean that's that's interaction that's what do you think you need to like push like liking into that into your new I don't know people just be like oh my god good comments do more yeah comments like have shown like somehow help with algorithm or like searches or something likes I don't think there's this concrete of evidence for me I just I always use it as like literally as like a like button like if this video gets like let's say a video Norma gets like 4500 likes like oh yes but this one is like 9,000 like okay people really like that or or like people liked it enough to bother to like it when they normally wouldn't which is what a lot of people do but if that could stop sucking that'd be great watch a second channel the Nuzlocke go watch thank you also watch the Minecraft video on the main channel because if it doesn't do well then well go watch it on the second channel I'm over it dude yeah we did it cuz when we did our like realm whatever a year and a half go to user people like oh my gosh ugly icky and I was like oh your area I'm just gonna go back to class with anyone now you're not playing as like did this is sick you don't like it screw you like whatever I'm the one playing it and so I think that's the important thing and if you don't wanna watch it don't watch it whatever but I think cuz I heard RTX is enabled like you can just do r-tx oh well cuz I was gonna do our tix but it's like a beta and I guess off to look cuz I was reading like yeah it's a beta you have to download and then I didn't do it because they said in this like beta branch you can't take the world anywhere else they won't work on a new beta it won't work in a different passion while working like the retail game so like alright I'm not gonna commit to like a world if I can't like no matter why it's gone yeah like cuz like the fun of like hardcore is like this could be permanent if I don't suck but it was like on the beta it's like okay no matter what this is a hundred percent gone I'd rather the stakes it's gone because my bad I died I can't do hardcores cuz I would literally break something yeah well we will see it when it yeah when it probably inevitably comes it's coming oh I it's just a matter of what is gonna be I'm predicting it's probably me falling somehow no I think you're gonna be walking you turn a corner you're gonna turn a corner and it's just gonna be sitting there like hey hey then you're dead possibly not but - abs tight it's quite the test trying to learn the game yeah I've heard that I wanted to play it beta came out but it's like really close it's alpha beta but heard good things so that eventually which also reminds me leaks gonna have their own a RPG um oh man a RPG holy they're gonna they're taking over everything dude they're like all right what's every genre video game alright we're hitting each one like we're making one for that and one for epic mobile work for an even bigger company well they have TFT on mobile legend Zimmer and Tara is going on mobile in five days and then they're making a league of legends on mobile that is literally made for mobile so champs the way it handles everything will be specifically designed for mobile so it's even easier and more intuitive down from back to gold yeah I keep hovering that's like I hovered one day and goes oh my god rocked gold - so I was triggered I didn't think that could happen so I was at zero - yeah plat for and I got like seven and then it was like gold 175 okay and I was like excuse me I'm back to like gold 145 okay so bro one Mecca full trader game away I'm literally plat one I go to like 45 LP I'm like this is it I'm one then I'm plat 275 LP and I'm not kidding you every time I fall into plat two I go right back to plat one and then I go and then it's back to plat two and then it's black the black one like I can't I'm stuck I'm hard stuff dude yeah I'm where I belong I guess I just want to hit diamond dude and I'm free I'm free I'm just too close to not yeah what's like yeah at this point I think white one yeah at this point plat one is like think top like 1.7% 1.2% of players in TMT but like diamond for it's like 0.7% like I can see I'm I'm in the top 1% at a game that doesn't just require me to pew pew you know so if someone says you're your small-brained I go no I'm medium brained there's a little brain in there a little more of a little brain to limit but yeah so anyway aside from that there's questions yeah I think we just go ahead and answer what dead hot questions seems a pretty appropriate question for what we talked about today Chris cavil cat Cavanaugh's cat Cavanaugh okay ca va z/os the Z's what throws me off Cavanaugh's no sure for the Pokemon fans have you considered playing through the fan-made games like Phoenix Rising the hell is that people have made their own either modded versions or completely custom games I've never done one I don't know it just doesn't quite have the same I mean maybe one day like if there's one where people are like this is the best I'll try that but some of them just get to custom so yeah for me a lot of them get I like some of the custom of a lot of them the problem is for me I get taken out so quickly of those like fan made Pokemon games because the dialogue is so bad like it's cringe it's so bad and some games like don't even have like proper like punctuation just general grammar awful dude it looks pretty good though what's it called I'll put it in the discord it looks really good I think there's a there's a couple that are really high quality that I wanted this scored a guy make a thing when I do that those okay we get it Oh a bro please sorry yeah I mean now see like that one looks pretty solid I might guess what it is it looks dope like they're just some that are like well for me to unofficial unofficial phoenix rising wiki phoenix rising is a non-profit fan made game creative used in the RPG Maker XP and pokemon essentials it takes place in the beautiful Hawthorne region the game follows a non-traditional storyline introducing RPG mechanics a multiple choices storyline moral ambiguous gameplay rich characters and new mega evolutions of Riley Pokemon and much more that sounds [ __ ] dope well yes he like my problem is what what sometimes happens which takes Matt is one they try custom sprites and it's just yeah yeah like right now like overworld like I'm looking like that straight up that kind of looks like to me that's like gin four or five so I like the way it looks because some games like when you're not in a battle like when you're just walking around - it looks like Pokemon follow you so you know I'm down but yeah when it's some custom sprites or when they try to add custom Pokemon yeah and then some of them are it's just like brah and I know it's not like every pokemons a hit but it just take it makes it a lot harder for me to believe because it's not an official Canon what's worse is when people really try the thing that will immediately eyes when people like actually make like design modifications to Pokemon there's not a lot of games that have done that but there's so much there's some hot there's some pretty prolific ones that have legit tried to like modify a Pokemon design and I'm just like I think you want me to not play this game which is what I'm gonna do I mean Damian you got it I kind of wanna make eventually but I might make a less play on this I'm about to mess around you know oh yeah this is cool okay okay so maybe I just need to look I just need to find good ones like the one I was most interested playing was Pokemon uranium that one seemed the most interesting to me Pokemon rainy of all the custom one it sounds like a Pokemon creepypasta it's definitely like a little more edgy of a game it's just um why don't you play it it's just um they did the same thing that other games do what's that decided they could make their own designs oh you know just like hmm oh wait no I'm already looking oh this is like a completely custom yeah like every single one oh not every there's a couple in here but most of them interesting I mean there's a couple of decent ones but like also the same time was just like I'm not here for you yeah there is like new Pokemon that's weird there's like or rich NYX metal NYX I mean all these I'm torch yeah she'll say they're interesting I like the tight make system chin chin monk one's kind of cute o Ekans is in this Auerbach two they made the cut guys nice they survived the : okay this is a good one Dillon Jimenez it says hello love you all my question is if you guys would be interested in watching the 2008 star wars the clone wars show and do a small review on it or anything it's my favorite show ever and I think you guys would enjoy it no reason I say this is because I think that an episode came out recently that was lit I have not watched it it's like a one Star Wars thing I haven't watched I'm a clone war Stan so no spoilers no spoilers oh yeah I've watched most of the have you been watching the Disney Plus like I've been watching it every week it's so tight man this is this currency isn't easy best one that's good to hear it's gonna end on a high note that's good easily best one for me personally I know people will probably say different ones but this is just like kind of like it's uh it's between two and three although in no spoilers I mean fruit you already know the setting of yeah well I know the setting of stuff yes so it's it was between 2:00 and 3:00 and it's going between now it's preaching in two three in this new season so yeah I've never watched it how many seasons is it it's like seven or sitting a lot of seasons I always just thought it was a kiddie show so I was and I never really thought you would be [Music] season eight all right I could tell know what season 77 wait okay is then this is the final season right or no dude I remember how many yeah its season seven yeah okay yeah is this the final season - this is the last season how many years has it been since it picked up so it started in 2008 and then they stopped in 2013 ish oh damn it's been a while but then they brought it back in 2014 no no oh yeah 2014 it was it was 2008 2014 and then they finally made the last season here in 2020 so okay yeah man ice it's it's a really tight show people thought it was like a really kiddie show but it actually gets mm-hmm pretty pretty damn dark it's so ironic how every single time people think a show is animated it's kitty it is a total opposite it looked pretty kitty but I guess it's super sick I need to pee a bit I only watched the first few seasons um I never caught back up but what I saw I know I guy watch it want to air it originally like the first two or three years and I really liked it I just need to well one I'll need to re-watch it's been so long enough to rewatch the originals and then catch up but ya know it's a dope show the setting of the show isn't like particularly interesting for me cuz the Clone Wars are kind of residentsleeper personally but they have so many like the characters that they introduced I'm like flesh Old Republic oh I wish man the kitties they flesh out and this maybe that's why I like this new season so much just cuz we're really getting into what my favorite time periods think of like episode three came a Thrones scale TV show but Old Republic dude like I'd be so down I guess could I handle like a political star wars like that though I couldn't like Star Wars isn't already political yeah yeah but it's kind of a joke political like every time they try to do political it's like kind of like this is kind of stupid so if see what I think like in the movies like 1 & 2 episode 3 was all politics yeah it's pretty trashed the third one is nothing the third movies not that here if you're here to burn him not this good because I think people compared to 1 & 2 1 & 2 are terrible so like when 3 came out they're like this is so great really I know very ok ok 3 is enough to make it sit 3 is one of the best the Star Wars Episode three is like when it's on TNT and it's like kind of on your like is it on the last fight and if it's not like No dude no no no no it's not one of those ones you stop and go I got I was already on board season with episode three being tight and then after watching all the new Star Wars I was like okay episode three was definitely way more time okay so they're on the same level they're all the same well this size I'm not gonna sit here and say episode three is like as good as it like the original trilogy because even rise even even return to the Jedi was probably just but I would say three is equal to the rise of Skywalker I think the three in Rises got one same score I could see you saying force awakens is better right I can see that but wouldn't agree would was rated easily I wouldn't agree with that but you can't honestly tell me last Jedi fries Skywalker better than three the last Jedi is not better than three and I didn't say I would literally say they are like here I don't hate him by know maybe a little bit at least she like has a coherent Street like the story goes from point A to point B at least there's some try actual drama and tension and you know the characters and you care about the characters Brian Skywalker is like Oh looks like Gracie at universe didn't expect that there's a lot of dummy [ __ ] though in Episode three like like nah like dude there's actually such good right lottery you cannot come on man a lot of good riding in three only that only sounds bad because it's gotten super memed on the internet okay it's like it's like Batman in Dark Knight like it's like it's kind of bad but that's only because the memes know that ah maybe it maybe next now I'll make a PowerPoint you know why you need to re-watch three and it's not as bad as you think it is in fact it's a really good Star Wars movie one of my guys gripes with three is why is when anakin decides to be darth vader and like all the sudden he's like no life we gotta take him to trial and he's like he's too dangerous and he's like i'm evil now oh yeah like but the entire point of that was how anakin gets indoctrinated into following the Jedi Code and he basically gets radicalized which is kind of the point the politics of of the original trilogy is showing how the Jedi and Sith are radicalized versions of different views and it puts everyone in the crossfire so Anakin has become so radicalized one point of view when that radicalization gets shifted and he's like wait a minute the people I've been idolizing are actually [ __ ] he just switch to the other side which is a it's totally so up to the other radical point of view it is so tight I hate you well I disagree with you michael cera down there yeah you're on the right side do your closing mmm do we have time for one more question hit us with it um Wow this one is actually kind of weird because I did not see this hey this one's from AJ Kelly hey longtime Watchers last mister first-time writer I was wondering if fruit has ever considered doing a Nuzlocke soul link or co-op with someone hey I know he was a fan of shady penguin from seeing a comment he left a long time ago on one of Shady's LPS while leaving comments aww I little mr. fruit stand hey I mean hey I did notice him leave comments on YouTube videos very rarely very very very like that's probably one of 20 in like the lifetime of YouTube yeah maybe very rarely no I would never do that I might have a check mark what did you call me on shady things like love the vid man keep it up or like what I don't remember all right I wouldn't have done something like that big that up I'm interested to see but yet he what yeah we're gonna like play league or something sometime right like we're shading that we're like best friends dude it's he says oh yes Lou I am not sure if you play ygo I don't know what that is still but hit me up if you if you do I would love a chance to duel you I'm guessing so yeah unfortunately [Music] they're tired there's so much the power creep has gotten to the point where I know if I've been gone a couple years I would literally have to invest like hundreds of dollars all over again to play like a deck that I probably don't even like just like there's no free you yeah I mean everyone know there's plenty of emulators and then like fan like really high-quality fan yugioh clients that let you play with the cards and stuff there's really ridiculously high quality ones but um uh a long legal off me man they're just so it's just I always thought they really need they're really need to rotate cards out because it's just gotten to the point where [Music] God man the game is just so broken on every level I I just couldn't go back I couldn't do it I always thought you you had the dopest like battle mechanic in the sense that like you put a car down and like in front of you is like the battlefield and it like the monster spawned like it was like attack the other monster that they had spawned with their car with we are with VR getting the way it is no doubt no doubt we're gonna start getting stuff like I cannot wait to play you yo our VR that me ty yeah I'm here for it I've no doubt we're eventually gonna get a proper vr u yo game wise white dragon like yeah but it's it took me out man the the only time it brought me back in was when dual links came out and that's because it was using all the old cards and slowly introducing them but I mean dual links is eventually gonna go to all the new cards which kind of killed the game from anywhere I don't know it's like it's like if you were to have Pokemon and I which Pokemon is kind of starting to do where like o GX o g XX o mega evolution GX o V mega TX mega evolution does right now it's just that you they never rotate it out and the cards kept on getting more and more ridiculous it's just a lot man it's just you it's too much the part of the reason I like to you here well Pokemon gets pokemons getting a lot like they're starting to really like push the territory of knock this card and you knock out three prize cards cuz this card is so busted like they're getting pretty in but at least they wrote eight cards out so it's not like an keep on it's like I have to keep on power creeping it they just choose to cuz Pokemon but with you it's like man power creep power creep our power creep power creep suddenly I have a novel on my chaos Emperor dragon link a synergy synchronization [ __ ] XY I hate it I can't do it I may have hot take here oh the yugioh show hit harder than pokemon [ __ ] Oh easy Oh show me like new year's show is hitting it was cooler than PO easy not even close and I had to hide that fact because if I told my friends that I would be outcasted all your outcasted now well I can't actually say I'd never really watch much you you you it was dark man okay you know it was tight yo was tight no it was cool I really liked it a lot like when they started introducing like my favorite is the Egyptian god cards when they that kind of Arc all that hits oh and then he gets like a sky Scyther what is that called this guy dragon thing that is yeah that you see the sad thing about you you and why I don't go back is cuz back then the Egyptian god cards like they had all these ridiculous effects and you're like whoa like damn like these guys are crazy look at all these effects and now like you look at your today and it's like oh yeah I mean different gods really don't have that many effects well don't you have to like sacrifice like a bunch of monsters to to even get the Egyptian god cards out there yeah for gods you needed three tributes and and you can't like get in their kuriboh yeah you can't like Chee kit you can special them them I cheese them into the game like you had to straight-up like check boys three monsters so 3 kuribohs yep throw them in there well I think that does it for this episode the ESPN 2 episode everyone's much-awaited highly-anticipated yep next day next week will be
