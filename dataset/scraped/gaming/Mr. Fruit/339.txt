hey do you have everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to today's video or well you haven't been to today's video so it's not a welcome back unless you've already watched it you're rewatching in which case welcome back what i meant to say was welcome back to paladins we're doing another video on paladins there's there's a new hero uh octavian or something like that uh so i always mess these up let's get to the video okay what do we got here we've got brand new champion octavia the indomitable octavia that is her name distortion feel create an opaque dome that hides allies and disorients enemies while inside of it very interesting and her ultimate rain down a laser barrage upon your enemies that deals damage per beam what's it sound like this is our battlefield this is our battlefield this is our battlefield guys guess whose battlefield is this is our battle it's our battlefield is it your battlefield this is our best no it's ours is it theirs this is our battle no no sorry okay well here we go how's this thing look oh yeah oh yeah apparently it's auto purchasing here i go never mind oh my god big damage big damage i'm jumping into the air oh look at me slow fall wow that's cool very fun oh he fell off the map not fun holy um wow he did a lot of damage and then i watched him kill me i guess i should stay at a distance what the fudge yeah oh yeah see this is what it's about baby hide me wait they can see me i'm not very wet why i thought i was supposed to be hidden oh but i was gonna totally secure that kill i just i'm gonna fall off the mountain what am i what look first time on the character i had no idea what i was doing holy aim batman okay nailed that okay watch this they don't know i'm here they they know fire's coming from here but they don't know where i am skirt don't mind if i do wow you are tanky but we gotcha okay see now this is what i live for um i didn't kill anyone oh look at that okay how do i use my hole that's not even my old button okay i'm gonna assume it's just oh wow that did not go okay did i even hurt her i don't know but it turns out it just goes in a big line so really not too much to to know about that but man i really don't do much damage if i'm being honest with you he's just holding down left click i respect it oh so i can shoot way more inaccurate but i can shoot a little faster and hip fire okay it's really inaccurate but there we go oh you like that damage yeah you like that damage you like that damage oh you're afk what a shame what a shame okay all of a sudden we're popping off holy all it takes is an afk to get my ego booster let's get it okay what i want to get a good old but they're all so split up sir sir here we go get him i'm dead and it's gone okay it doesn't even continue after i'm dead what the they they lose their morale after seeing their captain dead and you know we're not even gonna try and avenge her we're just gonna have her death be in complete vain oh heavens oh heavens okay that's right because remember this is our battlefield oh what you want what you want girl i'm the better marksman confirmed god i'm so good oh you want to do this again huh you wanna do this again do you where am i i'm concealed i actually don't know how this works because i haven't been on the receiving end so i don't actually know how effective it is but that's a kill and that's that's another one there we go easiest game of my life you know but hey octavia maine you know what i'm saying i'll take that 15 kill strength don't mind if i do this is how you know she unlocks your shoe power she takes off her hat this is our hat auto purchase is enabled since when what the fudge i probably could have kept on so i don't really care but here we go all right so i'm i'm not gonna do anything fancy here we're gonna set up by that i mean am i gonna flank with a character that's not meant to flank you bet your cute little butt i am oh flanking the sniper get destroyed [Music] oh my god what a flank on this guy what a flank on me how are you going to hit me in the air pleb hold on ready oh my they didn't stand it i'm hiding i'm hiding they can't see me because i'm hidden oh the objective was captured you know why because i got him off of it with my intense marksman flank sometimes the stupidest strategy is the okay okay turns out turns out she's a much better marksman because her weapon can like one shot what ah she was so weak okay okay too many enemies wow what a team shot okay but i do have my ult now and this is where all my damage is front loaded all my abilities you know what i'm saying let me show you after i kill this guy here we go get up go why does it feel like it didn't do anything put all my chips into my old and well sucks or at least i suck with my old which one is it find out later today okay i got a kill it's all about getting oh those head shots there we go there we go there we go baby show me that little head of yours that pretty little noggin oh you're weak you're a weak one oh she's not gonna see this coming yeah okay and then alt maybe that'll do something oh my god okay i did go in but then there was my team oh my oh okay well all right yeah i don't really know what i'm supposed to do about the sniper aside from get angles on her she won't expect because um yeah she kind of just beats me out when it comes to long-range marksman stuff huh yeah i'm trying a new approach where i actually play the game and help my team and not just flank with every character oh okay never mind never mind never mind never mind never mind a little scrutiny team screaming team that's what i thought run away you coward i'm just shooting everything i can and apparently it's working now check this out ready my old go unleash how does it not hit the duke oh my god that's fine it's fine wait oh i killed the sniper in the back with my old apparel killings give it to me give it to me oh no i almost had the pen to i see over there friend and i got you and i can't quite jump over that that's unfortunate kill him kill him yo somebody don't let the ruckus lift did you really let the ruckus of holy jesus oh you wanted to play the game oh you oh you wanted to play the game did you how about this you guys want to play the game i don't think so ah no nope i don't think mel hit anyone there we go i'm the catalyst let's go octavia main by the way here it comes here it comes this is gonna be huge this is oh wait actually massive wait a second oh my but no one takes care of this girl now i have to flank this sniper because no one else is yep ever going to take care of her so i'll do it know what else oh never mind i don't have to take care of her because we got a boy playing the obj what is this some alternate reality well i'm living for it i'll go around with you brother i'll follow you into the light okay that was a mistake and my friend just left me okay i'm gonna throw you all distortion field damage you while healing me although it doesn't matter because one before you'll lose those holy aim batman wait what why are there do i just not have a team like what is going on here right now all right maybe i'm the problem what the here i go okay it's a good start screw you jenno's got him this guy doesn't even know wall i know there's somebody behind me just trying to somehow find my way out of here yeah cause this is our battlefield it's waiting for the ultimate pop off i'll show you the ultimate pop-off ready it's right here okay okay she went straight through it and then i also thought more people come uh that was embarrassing quite frankly slow them destroy their healer destroy the other person and destroy the other person outgunned that person oh my screw you jenos no healing for you overtime lex is dead i'm the best that's it including you [Laughter] what is hitting me you know what screw you guys take that how does that not hit anyone you see that like what the what no slower damager i i lose these close quarter battles except when i have teammates through the power of friendship all will win what are you doing girl what is you doing right now you're dying that's the answer okay check yourself bop bop screw your healing oh come here girl okay okay what the fudge is her ah she holds it oh and she just executes me but we got the point look at that we can do this team together forever no matter how long back until the end of time determine what the fudge what in the there's two of you and you got okay whatever whatever i am playing with real people yes these are indeed people nobody knows here oh get pooped down pooped on i'm attempting to help but it's not going well wow okay no it's going extremely well well that'll do that that was a quick dub survey says most damage except for vora but screw you i got more kills than you so get destroyed am i am i a real person are you real are any of us real people [Music] you
