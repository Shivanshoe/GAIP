heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us it's happened here and using like a sunday morning without anything on these little beans just look so small you know the cake is just like so tiny such a tiny little bean when do i want to go kill somebody i'm going to do wires over here and that's all there is to it there's so many freaking people here i don't like it i don't like it one bit let's go do lights caccus woohoo all right i wanted to take the shot but i i just didn't have it see now i want to say that oh geez wait this is awkward all right so i'm going to go this way holy crap all right but i went off of it just before he died has been acting sus this whole freaking time he literally watched me and mr fruit do the objective without him he wasn't even helping he keeps going keep changing directions i watch him he's like so many times rick you are either one of two things right now you're either very i just i just wanted to get that out of the way now super not brainy hey mr fruit can i ask you a question oh yes um you came from fan cams or can i say where the body is by the way the body is included in the living room we know where the body is in the office claire was afk at the beginning so i think maybe they got to kill three people maybe she was afk the whole no claire is not afk the whole round i promise you claire that's what i was just about to ask christian i saw christian last with claire and now i saw claire forever ago when we did electric with fallout and rick cackas forever ago that is false i remember going up and i saw claire in the bottom o2 room near the water and all that kind of stuff and the tree i didn't come down that hallway when i saw you that was when we fixed electric then i went down went to communications but claire wasn't fixing electric she was down there at 02. she ran past all of us not correct me fruit and rick were right outside the electric box i'm watching them both to make sure that fruit don't gank rick or vice versa let's get started we open the door claire is right there as the door is open yeah actually that is yeah and then fallout was going with them and then change directions 180 to after me and i hightailed it out of there but that does that does mean that you were away from at least claire i don't know whenever skip skip i think we just caught him i don't know why rob's on my butt about this i've got my eye on a sir robert v i don't like it hmm i think it's fruit i think it's fruit and fallout yeah fruit didn't check on me when i was trying to get his attention on med bay what dressing in the world am i supposed to know he's trying to get my attention how do they know that kind of weird man i'm just gonna say it but what do i know i'm gonna go electric again it's my move it just it's the best way to go about doing it if you ask me you know what i'm saying you got to make sure i'm out of field of view fall out do you want to explain yourself rob dude you're not fooling anybody bro anybody no okay so literally before the break say i'm suspicious of rob no okay listen to this no let's hear it let's hear it okay i am doing the fire thing and as i'm like gonna do the thermostat i run past vitals and om is on vitals or somebody is like near vitals i know two people are in that kind of vicinity and as i'm doing thermostat lights goes off so i go i'm going to make sure that the two people who i went in there with are still alive as i'm walking past into like the office from the thermostat so i'm walking past like the the heartbeat sensor or whatever you want to call it and who do i run past fallout what do i run past also a thing that says report the body it's not but you will notice that that's all i need that's all i need let them fight what fallout what is your defense okay dude look we leave the office room right go to the right a bunch of people off to the right i'm doing the one i got three jobs in right side office okay do one do two lights go off looking around om runs by me first in the dark checking around to make sure everyone else is there i go over you know when you see like the report body and you're like oh [ __ ] there's a body here like you're trying to find it right there rob had ran like he was right there to the left right in front of me i'm telling you dude the same story just yes so he's literally just saying so what is it i killed him is that what you're saying fallout i'm saying one of two things is going on right now either you and i are close okay well i'm telling you one thing fallout killed adorable bro how about you let me talk cut me off jackass you and i are clearing each other right now and we're both innocent and we're pointing at the wrong person are you revolting where are we voting we gotta vote someone robbed this adam and he's in voting fallout i hope you lose if it's not him that makes it worth it oh that's so funny well our job here is almost done that could not have gone more perfectly they managed to just perfectly point and fight with each other i couldn't plan that better myself even if i tried i was like i wonder what and then immediately rob just like fall out paul's like rob and i'm like yes yes really good really good all right i'ma stab my man right here again i'm trying to look around and see who's there it could not have gone more perfect how did you get that next to us okay so when the round started we all went we were all like vital stuff or whatever right so i went right of the office and then i looped all the way back around to the left of the office because i was like no one will think i'm coming through here i go through the left ohm's coming my way i see rob and fallout in the distance i just stab him run down and immediately they report the body go fall out he's like rob all right yeah that was beautiful because i went out the right side as well they had no clue about either of us at that point i oh no i had a clue i was talking about fruit in my carbs i like i thought it was fruit because fruit you are normally a really good crew mate you'll do courtesy check to make sure somebody's alive you didn't do it with me when i went over to that med section you were gone home came out here with that you didn't check in on me mr fruit because he normally does he's normally very observant i care about you what rob was saying and fall you were saying like technically like that's exactly what it looked like like i can't blame you guys fruit was i targeted or was it convenience oh absolutely it was i was like i'm killing the first person i see and it was you okay i wasn't sure i said ah don't let me get stabbed right here don't let me do my do my test real quick okay what do we have we've short clear caccus fallout or d i'm watching we're not letting anybody die here ohm's doing the keys serdi fallout okay all right nobody's dead as far as i can though uh did lag behind insert he was the last person i see but also um all right i think we're fine somebody's already going with the meltdown play huh what oh my god i didn't see the color in time but who in here has a puppy following them i have a puppy but it's not me bryce has a puppy and fruit has a puppy fruit i am in this bag somebody just ran by me right right it's a puppy owner man i didn't see the color because i was like but was there a color or not it was either black or is it it was colored i don't think all the puppies are blue yeah what is it the puppy is only blue mm-hmm did you see a blue puppy but the thing is skip here you can just my god man bless i'm sorry dude i just saw a puppy run away and i just like bro i know better now i know better now than to kill no i there we know who has puppies right you said you were in gasoline that's correct okay and like what took you so long to do it then i just walked to the antenna so i i didn't see you the key task right at the beginning waited over with mr fruit to see what was going on and make sure nobody died at the beginning then i went down to the gasoline you can see me go right to the next gasoline task because i have filled it now just didn't happen where's the body exactly exactly where it is so you can follow me if you like oh what about fruit who's saying it wasn't fruits i'm in med bay with certain sabotage happened too fruit was moving so can you sabotage while you're yeah yeah yeah what if this is a long time not even what if this is a long con it could be shark but the way he's he's like trying to help bless i don't think it is maybe shark hates puppies no okay again who has puppies me ohm rice yeah but whoever has a puppy is suss keep your eyes peeled i'm totally okay with that can we all just follow that i'm changing off my puppy who has put it's own it's literally just it has to be on the way bryce was describing what he did like it sold me i was like yeah sure sounds about right meanwhile um i don't know a little weird man bryce is right on top of me doesn't he have a puppy is he not wait what what just oh what the heck it's gotta be a home yeah 100 thing in this home i mean unless sharks just omega kong in us i mean that's pretty smart right just like point out it's somebody with this pet and there's you know there's only x amount of people i'm sure i'm standing in the back wondering why you weren't i think someone did i was wondering why you weren't running the button i tried the va i wasn't sure yeah it was dc it wasn't like dead but like yeah puppies yeah okay and we got to kill them all then what the hell i think that's the best approach yeah calculate the math if we kill all puppy owners there's a zero percent chance of the killer surviving well no no no no that's if shark was getting out yeah but we're gonna or that's if sharks is wrong yeah foreign because he's not he's not trusting me are you are you dude wait has anyone seen did anyone see fallout or where he went dude bryce you saw me nearing nobody i went to i went the electricity to to help to do the lights we were all there as puppy owners i went to go do the gas and someone tried to lock me in but they did it a second early did anyone see fallout you're saying oh musam where and who's i saw claire claire was over there too the the aforementioned puppy murderer could very well be an imposter it's just they didn't get this kill they have another i'm telling you i like i i it's the fact that shark is throwing votes like that that's sussing me out it's not me murder or something right now with a puppy or someone who's not trying to literally accusing me and it says when on that screen it says dead it means someone was like dead okay yeah disconnect it was like dc uh just that means like the round before puppies i'm still convinced especially if rice was right about the gas the fact that he went to fill up then you have to go back to the gas to get the other guests without like i'm buying it i'm buying it i think it's home i really think it is but it's just a hunch i would have been fine voting him off though but what are you gonna do what are you gonna do what a guy what a pal get away from me babe wait the fact that she voted for me though maybe she's angry and she's like i'm gonna stab you in the butt there are so many people here can't see a darn thing right um okay all the puppy owners do be over here now obviously there's still some other imposter and claire is still falling oh god no please babe just don't although i don't think she would make that vote though if she was an imposter just make her look a little weird then if i die it's kind of like well where did she go is she in the water wheels what disappeared without opening the door unless she's doing the air canisters i guess i don't know if i checked that one he's like right on top of me good lord squeaky squeaky squeaky squeaky okay and it's rob well yeah what are you gonna do huh i hate to see it it was bad we obviously had uh no information no one said anything about rob [Music] ah that's it you just oh home help me wait no he won't report it okay this will tell me if he is um he's thinking about it literally showed up water wheels and there's a body [Applause] down there earlier yeah bryce has a puppy bryce what were you doing uh i just did the lights can you wear it with the lights while someone's on them can you what can you screw with the lights while somebody is yeah um but yeah trying to do it okay okay were you on lights clear yeah and what was that okay i'm right now i think we need to 50 50 a puppy vote either bryce it's you no i completely completely think we need to do a puppy vote there's two imposters in the game right now the math says we have to vote someone um claire they said they said they saw a puppy claire i could have killed you in the lights i'm gonna throw my vote for all yeah but okay claire claire and rob i think is the other one if we're doing a puppy vote i have to vote you bryce but claire okay so can you vouch that bryce was there and if so was was he there the whole time i didn't even see ohm like at the bottom left where the bottom is and i saw bryce and claire both down there he came up from the bottom one thousand percent i'm telling you the body is that's the water wheel together and then the door is locked you've got to trust me on this sir d you're not it's thank you well we got one of the puppies off well we got to get the next one guys if the game's not over you'll know that we got the right one that's impressive i really didn't think they'd make the right call well done can i ask the question it only registered like one puppy i own was the only person i saw with a puppy oh really well yeah me bryce and him have one rob is now being like all right well we know we to vote the other puppy off yeah i mean he wants a free kill on bryce rob's acting mad so he's going to kill queen oh oh right there right there right there he's just killed right in front of me on claire i killed him sergey where are you right now no i'm saying bryce killed him sir d bryce killed claire bryce killed claire i'm on board with that we don't we don't like it really quickly really quickly sergey you gotta listen to me man you gotta listen tonight you've given me no reason to trust you for as long as i've known you that's okay but i did lead the charge against ohm and the fact that he got voted out means that there was an impostor who got voted out which means we didn't lose the game why would i force a vote on either the impossible he's just or he's not lost that makes zero sense if i voted anyone other than um then we would have won if we were both imposters he literally said 50 50 on the docks lawyer the math does not lie here you gotta vote rob i gotta vote rob nobody tells me what to do we're voting please vote rob why why oh my god oh all right thank you so much cindy i am dying inside what the hell i'm so mad that you saw my puppy never talk to me or my puppy again what was that oh my god what was that i knew i had to kill claire and leave the other dog oh my god was the only guy with a puppy that i could see like no one else's puppies were even coming up on my screen and i was like wait why is everyone talking about these multiple puppies there's one puppy guy there's three though what about what rice literally explained mathematically picked the right person and certainly was like you don't tell me what to do [Music] foreign
