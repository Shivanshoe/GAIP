hi my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny too and in today's video the iron banana is back and with it some quote unquote new weapons I happen to get one of those the fool's remedy of course we have to start by dissecting the aesthetics not shabby it's a cirrhosis rapid fire which means fall out of be brain reserves library of magazines an alloy magazine or flared magwell we're going with format while feeding frenzy but here is the kicker iron grip massively and bald let me tell you it is massive improves lap instability at the cost of reload speed I have to show you all this because this thing quite literally becomes a laser beam I was pleasantly surprised by the sidearm and so I decided I needed to show you all your beautiful eyes yes I see yours the beautiful deep brown or gracious green audacious blue at whatever your eye colors are needed this see this and what better place to do it than in the iron banner itself you can actually pretty easily get the auto rifle and hand cannon for yourself it's a quest from Lourdes salad just get 25 kills of the sidearm and an auto rifle precision kills counters - so look if I can do it you can do it the dead glyphs unlike the content you're currently watching which is thriving hey nice a mr. fruit now okay let's just let's just show you this you know before we're shooting something ready watch this i won't i won't even control it those without me touching it alright now if i try and control it leave that I mean the thing it doesn't move you know it's it's set in place it's it holds steadfast now the range isn't incredible but look at this now of course the magazine whatever but you you know at first I was really hesitant with it it was like super reduced real oh does hey look great I'm just gonna shoot it and then never be able to shoot more well between the flared magwell and everything it's got going for like honestly real it's not bad not bad at all you really not missing out on much now obviously the best way to go by out shooting somebody with this is to shoot them in their face but I don't have to tell you that but what you should know is that it's easiest if they run at you with their head facing towards you I think we're also fighting some sort of a stack the holy sword Batman doesn't matter though we got it yeah Iron Man has been a little rough some games super cool a tractor cannon rammer most games have been pretty close but then occasionally they're just blowouts unfortunately my team hasn't been the one blowing up the competition the range like I said you know leaves a little bit to be desired but it's understandable given well everything else this thing does maybe not the best match to showcase it because we're what are we just getting farmed but aside from that oh yeah we are we are locked out that is a thing that happened and that's totally okay because that just means we'll get mercied and you know we move on sooner take my life take my life you who guys are billing us and I don't you know I've done some better covers in my life apologies for that I I can do better I can be better I will be better oh mercy didn't see that one coming let's take this one from the top because I don't know how this could go any worse the distance Shaw just like the last game will be a distant memory I've no idea why I'm trying so hard to integrate the map names into this video but here we are now of course as with ever review I do I can't really advise that you run around with these weapons exclusively like I'm doing wait a second my sus alarms going off what does that mean obviously that can't be real but look at that thing like I'm seeing get them straight on within your your what is going on right now just get them within your optimal damage range and just hold the trigger as long as you're remotely on their body the gun will stay on their body and then the rest is history although multitasking running through different people don't suggest it and yeah like I mentioned all things are good in a moderation let's say so while this gun might be good that doesn't mean exclusively use the sidearm run around like an absolute ape which is what I'm currently doing I feel like I shouldn't have to make that disclaimer but at the same time I almost feel legally obligated to like some sort of sex enhancement drug or something you know and I spend the first five seconds like buy this it'll help you so much and then the next 55 seconds are filled with taking this will include death down out the tenth you're gonna die you're gonna die this way you could die that way you pretty much you're gonna die but if since we might as well go out on top okay guys hear me out here this thing is insane with this perk I swear it by the old gods and the new and you all know I don't just willy-nilly swear on the old gods and the new sometimes the old gods sometimes the new gods but never both at the same time I hate you and everything you stand for Fred Sheeran you're a cheap knockoff unlike this sidearm nice one mr. fruit you're just full of it today aren't you oh that is a that's a machine gun but do you notice how we outgunned it that's what I'm saying get in that prop up that right proper damage range and you'll be surprised the potentials the possibilities look at that okay there's like a little bit of lag going on here okay so just like take this with a grain of salt get your go-to gun nonsense out of here now please approach if at if me he actually did I didn't anticipate that are you kidding me what is my team doing alright screw this it's time for the patented rumble test a little scared because I don't know who's bothering the queue up Rumble right now but it don't matter because I got the fool's remedy bruh you the fool and it don't pity you not a big fan of this map but alright it's it's one of the bigger ones I guess you could have gotten for a rumble but what do I know one thing that should stand though as long as I don't go outside which is prep school about to do is that you are what's wrong with everything you know that right yet when I said I don't know who's queuing up Ron bull well I just figured it out only the sweatiest the sweaty so the sweats I can't hope to compete but I can't hope to at least use my sidearm oh my god I could kill them dude I'm not all that matters is that I have a sidearm and that I'm going to oh my god he was one shot I tickled him and I stole all the kills LEM ow he killed me I might if I want to try and win this might have to like use my whole arsenal that same time it would be pretty funny if I can do pretty well with just this side I'm currently having a bit of an issue finding people don't trust me from no lack of trying you have a sword he's it's not that deep man it's it's d2 crucible like calm however - at his disposal though it makes sense he's using it wait how did that grenade night it's that guy if that's the Oh who stole it god dude he has like some macro or somewhere he's just like like how is that fun he might it must be like a macro clip because there's no way he can like do that and at that point it's like what do you even what are you accomplishing I just well I know what you're like physically a combo same but like I must feel like you're not even doing anything you're just hoping that your your Crouch spam can win you gunfights it's stupid but whatever it works so I guess that's the stupidest thing fudge I'm not letting you you guys traded why why oh I got okay oh there we go alright I'm sure I'm just trying to get some kills man everybody's like cleaning there's no come on bro let me let me in on some of this action man you know what I'm saying you know I'm saying when I say we trade it what can I say it's the fool's remedy it's foolproof it's idiot-proof and it's fruit proof that's the Ulta Jesus yes he just not gonna win that gunfight I'll just try and nade that guy is he weak rip yep rip yeah did I just spawn looking at that dude oh no he's he's way out yonder maybe try and get this heavy no someone else is gonna get that heavy okay maybe I'll kill the person with heavy wouldn't really advise that one but you know hey there we go give me the heavy ok I'm burning people oh Jesus everyone and their mom is after me right now I'm running I'm running I am cowering no shame in my game yeah all right we got the heavy we got the heavy baby oh my god and I'm missing all my shots there's a kill there's another kill all this is going well oh who knew heavies oh you've got really oh well I mean I drew it out I guess if a my melee just connected wait how's my super looking oh I do have my super okay I should probably use this then huh Oh chaos reach why would I pop it on a kamehameha I don't know but I did he's gonna try and snipe me a Mike God if he hits me it's gonna be terrible okay there's the kill we're moving we're groovin we're moving we're groovin dude okay he should have seen me coming so I don't really know what he thought was gonna happen almost Oh toss a coin to your whitter why did I miss so many of course he's gonna take that kill too son I got I got a change ah fudge just it's just you know you had a certain range cap at a certain point it just it's just really it kind of becomes potatoey in in nature quite quite honestly stupid Crouch spammer dekat I couldn't really tell you why it rigs me but it just dies like really like that's that's what you got to do oh so close this map does allow you to kind of get in range for sidearm like a range like that wouldn't really be advantageous but for the most part these these corners however Yap lend themselves to shotguns as well oh my god I'm weak I'm gonna try and run but then you skrt skrt back oh dude none of my mail laser hitting man feels bad oh Jesus hey one of them hit and that's a heavy games coming down to the wire sucks mr. fruit might just submit himself with the fool's remedy is the best combo duo in the game and it's looking pretty darn good bop Oh buddy Hetal reload yeah layup they thought they could best me they all made fun of my sidearm but where are they now how there are nine feet under we take that W yeah you like what you see I bet you do I don't need some macro spam I just need the fools remedy and the iron grip Oh certainly helps it at first I was like beside our man this again and then I used it and now you can see it hopefully you lasted through through the first couple mercy games and saw that one because the secrets and the sauce so with that said I want to take off much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day and I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
