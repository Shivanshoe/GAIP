heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video i'm making a great mistake i'm hopping into competitive pvp i'm a little late to the party but the means to an inquest this week demands that's why they do heroic adventures menagerie trials of osiris which leaves crucible survival crucible elimination so needless to say this is more out of necessity than anything really wish there was pvp pinnacle rewards to chase again but what are you gonna do and not only are we doing that we're entering with the sun shot i don't know if this is relevant pretty sure it's not because i couldn't tell you the last time i saw this they really need to make a mark all a scene button or something drives me crazy a little flashing icons i can't do it widow's cord huh well i guess it's a good thing i have with me a sniper rifle never mind i don't i don't even what yo peek out i got you buddy come on brothers dude don't miss okay so far he's killed everyone with a precision shot let's uh let's keep an eye on this guy what the fudge maybe they're all just gods i'm not entirely he he doesn't miss he doesn't miss head shots hold up yeah see his sus alarm's going off too oh there he goes another head shot wow this dude's just a crack shot how does he do it good god head shot cool cool all right first competitive game and we're up against the cheater love it yeah no everything here is in order bro you're nuts dude you're cracked it's a hacker it's a plane no it's a video sponsored by rage shadow legends tired from cartoonish-looking games not every rpg

them with a whole bunch of different gear and by the time you're watching this video the brand new tag team arena should be live in-game tag team arena is the next level of competition pvp battles

a new place good luck and i'll see you out there the thing too about widow's court is like you can't play the game without sniping like this you either snipe or you just die but when the enemy sniper just doesn't miss headshots it's like well gg yeah burn baby but i don't get it headshot headshot headshot what i don't get is you think people would make their cheating a little more discreet but the thing is they they still don't get banned so i guess you know why bother hiding it then they're just asserting their dominance okay all right yeah that was that's great let's let's do another gonna be honest with you all i'm kind of scared to click the launch button hold on detective fruit's on the case they're diamond two and survival that's incredible they're the top point four percent all right so he has 1157 kills with a sniper rifle oh and a thousand fifty nine wow ninety one sniper rifle headshot accuracy you've got to be like the best in the game dude that's nuts can we talk about how i am zero glory and getting matched with 5500 glory what in the world is that bungie hey haven't played pvp at all this season well boy do i have a surprise for you only the sweatiest for you my friend skirt ah fudge jesus mountaintop mountaintop i'm sure 5500 glory whose idea was this who's like hey let's put this in the quest yo i'm about to go play menagerie and get completely irrelevant rewards rather do that what he just okay i mean i got the kill last oh wait we won yo great stuff guys great stuff that's ridiculous though i was like well the good news is i'm zero glory so you know should be a little easy at the beginning nope gotta kill though there's gonna be a lack of sunshot here my apologies not by choice though the game is forcing me to do this oh we got a kill though all right we're popping off baby oh he's got friends in all the right places oh and i got a kill wait never mind maybe the sunshot meta is back or maybe i'm just being hyperbolic because that's what i have to do to make a video interesting and unless i can click bait this video no one's going to watch it holy hackers did this get real alright i'm moving in oh they got shotties they got shotties for days ooh we tried the drag scope oh and we just missed the quickscope heil one minute left oh jesus i'm last guardian standing easy baby let me show you how it's done wow that worked okay great oh i'm doing something currently not dying which is clutch they can't win if they don't kill you you know what i'm saying just think about that never run out of lives that way oh i hear a mountaintop out in the distance careful friend careful traveler there is i hate my life still experiment here mountaintop mountaintop oh not mountaintop okay so they're only two for three wow we didn't even get a kill this round it's rough i guess they turned on their hacks too i'm just kidding i'm not accusing these guys they're not using anything that could use hacks that at least that i'm aware of hey put the barrier away okay you're just gonna get yourself hurt ah fudge i'm here to help what the whoa well they turned on something their gameplay at the very least because it went from us doing well to us sucking i think they've just realized wait a minute guys if we all just team up and move as a group there's no way we can lose i can't believe i'm still alive i'm nuts i am not a bop okay i bodied him i got him all the week i'm coming to help i'm coming to help don't you die atta boy all right i've got a super and they won't see a cup scooters that's right that's all right i baited out the power the power ammo guys oh geez okay i think i found a problem though the guy at the bottom is three and ten that's rough buddy and to be fair i'm not really thinking that the sunshot is doing us any favors but then again i also don't think it's really hurting us you know i think i'm just not giving it enough credit what the jesus god holy god wait a minute i think i completed the quest team team team team team team yes yes come to my aid thank you together forever oh wait a minute what if we just gave a gun shotgun damage at infinite range incredible all right check this out check this out balls oh god let's go buddy you're huge you're nuts oh okay sunshine i see you yo i i actually got heavy this is huge this also how do i keep getting knocked out that's that's my first death our

little bit more i mean obviously i'm the one consciously pulling out my sniper rifle but again it's because i don't know i have a choice i check this out i'm nuts nuts i'm insane there's some guy trying to chase me skirt there we go and the linear actuator snug oh my god oh my god the two i'm going for the trip i'm going for that trip give it to me oh mountain top is that all anyone runs it's funny you either have hackers with a revoker or mountaintop doesn't seem to be an in-between really yo okay sun shot kind of nice with it i mean yeah that was a team shot so of course anything's gonna be nice with that but look at these explosions yeah explosion no either we are we do be kind of popping though come on try me i'm not even going to ads i'm not even going to 80s i think the explosive round from the it hit the wall and just you know aoe baby we got 70 limbs that round wait a second that's all the lives they had wow i was in every kill let's go i got the kill i guess does your mother know you're using the mountain top holy sniper batman nice nade me come back to me talk to me like lovers do woo oh nice division skills mr fruit i'm coming i'm coming i'm chugging skirt you

knows us look i've said this before in elimination games you can't get kills it's not the end of the world team shot but more importantly just don't die play passive sit in the back oh my where'd you come from life is the most important resource oh my god that was a headshot and we both know it okay well that one was let's go had to pull out the sniper had to do it to him sorry about it there we

to win a game you know wouldn't that be nice so sometimes that means you just got to pull the sniper out you just you got to do it to him like that you want me he did he did it to me like that oh but you got the super out let's go and that and then and then and then and then val we're overflowing hey i can reset my rank i know i'm in the middle of the game but i just gotta reset my value okay give
