my friend died up that hmm you know now I mean I'm technically on defense so I shouldn't be pushing in but I can't help it oh and there's a guy sitting in this corner come here do it he doesn't know there's also a guy over here the Sun but I'm trying to be little careful about it being a bada-boom oh wait a second oh I was gonna go knife them oh wait how's that c4 oh I'm on it defusing watch me watch what I give you're playing the objective Australian they are averse they are at that interesting maybe I'll uh sauce it up here with a little knife action ya know ya know I should oh I forgot yeah first duh nice kill me way to stay on target ah must approach very slowly let's go oh I'm just out you're freakin I'm so weak though you have a better gun than me I don't think so yeah love it love it guys yeah that's right we're in defense push up my kind of guys we hold forward and only forward oh this guy oh shoot yeah this thing oh don't give me this I'm gonna choke but I'll do it anyway oh I have the bomb oh shoot does it just rain we give people the bomb alright well I guess I'm going Aven Oh what ask oh there's another one uh an a K I uh I think we'll go with that leave this baby who she do beeper and OH remember aim for the head it's a much faster kill that's for sure I'll try and wrap around for you guys make sure your flanks good too bad I'm stomping McGee over here it's good thing I'm not trying to get a jump on anybody oh there's a guy right here bring him out bring him out bring him out I was gonna push but I should just save my money right run with the bomb okay the mom doesn't detonate as far as in fact boom okay I kept my gun that's all that matters never gone this way oh the recoil in this sucker it's real I'm trying ok I gave you covering fire suppressing fire whatever I'm gonna flank the flanker give me a second come on now any second what what oh no I totally didn't think that guy walking past me was the enemy I was like there's no way he just walks right past me right oh we got a Winchester look at this thing there's a shotgun the play here probably not now but as long as I push up with it can't be that bad right now I have a chance here as long as I can get close enough to actually use my shotgun but that's the trick isn't it can I get close enough oh I'm doing it I'm doing it I have to do it or the god gent come here come here yes oh oh let's go did you get him oh I think you got him let's go hurry okay I got the most expensive assault rifle I could be ugh Oh what's you doing what you doing all the spray though the AAG is Park oh my God look at I'm like one shot away and I don't even care that's right we push the issue I should probably help out my team there's two more of them they could be fortified any there's one up here actually answer my own question okay go a little quieter a little slower got him bada bing about a Boomer one left protect the bomb are we playing over there what but we're all over okay okay I'm headed over there I'm going I'm going all we see and we see him he doesn't make make it out of this alive no way let's go all right I don't think we need to buy anything I'm uh I'm liking the aughh I respect the enemy team there are defense and just like I they push will they push the exact same way is the question and evidently the answer is no should i knife again I'm certainly thinking about it okay there is somebody to my left but I think I have a flank on somebody oh fudge did he die Oh going we're going all right now he knows where I enough I three would know what is strafe what is strafe oh we almost go oh the bag I'm blowing all my money on this thing it's evidently a one shot anywhere including the body you pay for what you get you get power if yeah that'll do it I probably shouldn't push with the sniper but then again I also probably shouldn't be on offense getting the sniper so here we are and he's behind me 1 b2 oh my god I love it the shotgun play I love this let's go they actually push the shotgun we word well I have the c4 well shoot well what's going on here I don't know this map show this can only go poorly or it can go really really well all
