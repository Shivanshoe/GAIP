in today's dream team the dream team is back in destiny 2 which is the thing i haven't said in a very long time but we're here officially together because return of the king but don't call it a comeback well no i mean hey the reason why we did a dream team video is i thought it would be pretty poetic because we were on the destiny subreddit so you know let's bring ourselves back out into the way we're not dead even though all of you seem to think so did you read any of those comments blue oh i read a lot of them and they were actually pretty positive it's just they were like i did not remember us positive or blue yeah they were great but then there was like a couple stands in there who were like actually really nice and they were like what are you worried they still make great content and then love you stands yeah we love those guys those guys are cool we appreciate you which is why we hope you appreciate the return of iron banner bets that's not really what i was the dream team appearance fee was all we could afford for this so it's what we're working with if you guys don't know and because frankly some of you probably what the [ __ ] is going on it has been a little while back in the day whoa which one of y'all wants to join every time iron banner came around we did a thing called iron banner bats where we all fight against each other we used to we used to be somebody queen blue shotgun you know some of you guys may recall that you know if you're an og so what happens is we randomly invite three people to join the team and then each of us chooses a teammate and then we fight each other obviously we're on the same match but at the end of the two matches each one we take our score we add those at the end and then whoever has the lowest score because the way we do it lowest point wins it's golf you know how it is all right if you lose we're uh we're each going to be dismantling something we don't want to dismantle if you if you win you don't have to dismantle it and and i'll and i will i'll i'll add a little bit to the stakes here right i will uh do a reese's challenge part two at fruit summit hey or maybe we'll maybe we'll do a candy choice of said comment section yeah maybe they'll get a vote so if i lose i will dismantle really good and uh if you want to look at it mr fruit this is yeah let's see so what's rob putting up on this okay for barons you can see if this qualifies as worthy enough to risk and actually have some balls too i'll put up the ios luna i have equipped what though okay so rob throwing up the forbearance blue throwing up eos luna and i but rabbit hit adrenaline junkie pulse rifle okay which had been wanting to rock in pvp and i haven't been able to rock it yet so that's what i'm putting okay clap them cheeks so that's what we're putting up so now we're gonna let three random people into the fire team we're gonna stop it after three will lift with me oh the same time oh no okay yeah he knows too okay oh gee ah jesus literally oh god okay dude can they type in the chat no they're both on they're both on oh they're about console so just know whoever we kick we're upsetting somebody in the console race there's got to be a way we can decide oh drip or drop how about a dripper okay well we'll all have to agree it's a great way actually okay like i don't hate it all right let's just get on [Music] um i've already made mine am i allowed to say cameron i'm sorry oh pulsey hey at least you made an uh an impression and you'll be like hey you're the guy that got kicked from you know but like can i be honest with you though triple l is not doing anything for me either uh but it's not pulsey but at least pulsey is standing for something you know what i mean but i just don't like what it's standing for something it almost feels like it feels like i'm looking at slenderman the guardian all right i don't know it makes me uncomfortable i don't know i'm with the camel toe build that pulls down wow blue who would you uh vote drip or drop okay listen as far as dripper drop i'm gonna be totally honest with you they're both like of all these i think the most sustainable is probably dev i don't know if i could say drip tape does look pretty sick though dev does look hot okay listen pulsey i gotta give it to lilith because i mean it looks like it looks like pulsing i gotta give it to louis like it's lilith is mine but yep guess what's mine it doesn't work that's not he didn't read the phone do i have to pick between pulsing triple look all i'm saying what are the other it looks like pulsey is in tony hawks but he put on the big head so that's what pulsey looks like i don't think either should stay but if i had to pick i would say triple is the trip of the two all right pulsing it i'm sorry pulsey you just look like this is gonna be rough i've not played pvp l says i connected a keyboard hell yeah nicely that console but not not that we have anything oh it's been so long since i've played a game this is so bad it never leaves you you're a gamer all right quite often it's gone actually more often than you think if you guys could not cap this with me i'm trying to get solo points here you know i'm going to be i'm going to be a hero on b by myself don't try and help me wait i was kidding where you guys going wait oh i gotta kill oh my gosh guys none of you help me is there someone invisible what are you doing back there oh my lord do you need help mr fruit no no it's just some dude sitting there i'm actually kind of pooping on these people all these guys hey attaboy if i don't get any kills during the hunt is on though i'm screwed i was it seems a little laggy if i'm being honest with you all it's i think it's very laggy of course okay it's a good good thing we all didn't get they shoot my grenade out of the air yeah if we're all bad thanks guys keanu he literally shot my nade out of this guy like what oh get absolutely annihilated they have a sniper looking at me at b guys rocket launcher and then that rocket would have killed me but it hit our team hey wait who's my partner okay good job dev never mind i take it back triple is not mine i don't believe okay travel it [ __ ] well let this third this is great this is let's go you ain't playing devs first though what the [ __ ] i'm not going to help you blue because frankly that doesn't sound like a bad thing i think rob just had a hernia depending on yeah i mean you know for some for many that's get the back of you off such strong ways we're looking embarrassing we're letting the uh the new kids on the block have their time i'm like i'm cool with not having the hunt on i feel like i'm fragging but i don't hunt at the same time so it doesn't matter how am i still at the bottom it's cause i don't get these kills during the hunt man i swear i i feel you i don't have any hunt kills hunt kills who he's invisible how how did you one of those yeah right clean it up good job i'm where are we we're getting like we're getting mr fruits at the top we have to take him down rob what the fudge you don't mean that we have to take his ass down nice i only got two kills for my super though it's not exactly life-changing oh boys here it is we're on the house this is where we go crazy now go crazy go stupid ah what you gotta be kidding me wasted my soup oh yo i killed a dude in a super that must be embarrassing of course she goes for me with the super what a bonus where are they nice second here i only got one hunt kill but that's like one more than i've gotten oh my god i got the 112 bucks two it's gone 118. the howls are quiet nothing lasts oh my god why hey rob you know what something's never changed and that's okay that's okay i'm doing it i'm right there with him okay so you i can't be that shady you you punching [ __ ] meat sandwich you you were literally just like yo cause you know you would have stolen that and yeah i got some [ __ ] meat all right that's what i it's why i am what i am what do you mean i would never shame somebody there are two minutes what's wrong with you oh yeah actually well everyone's paired up right now that's cute this is not good i think we're you know what i think i'm gonna take this out already whatever yeah what can i say yeah me and deborah at the bottom so you know what boys it was an honor oh yeah me and louis at the top what's going on i've accepted defeat already you know that's okay the next iron banner bets you know good luck to you there's one more game okay so seven oh so it's 3 7 12. yeah you don't have to count mine or 11. okay so blue is at 11. i'm at seven and mr fruit is at three thank you thank you you know i think statistically whoever's bottom at the first half is just not it's not gonna you know so it's okay well i would love you i mean if you okay but if you get like first second and rob gets fifth sixth i think there is literally no way for me you're doing copium for me right now and you don't need to do the copium for me blue yeah blue and dev would have to get first second i'd have to get fifth six and we'd tie yeah so as i was saying uh you know good luck next iron banner bad spoiler yeah it was a good run see in a month you know well i i i actually really like this grenade launcher it's really good so i'm glad i don't have this man how is how is taking down your friend lightening the mood is that what you get no it was that's what you get off on making fun of your friends you sick you do it too not like you we we are of the same cloth that's definitely not true we are cut from the same what's the first cut from like a really like top for the same linen slow quality linen and you're like from a bed bath and beyond we are not the same i honestly i don't know why but i feel uncomfortable in bed bath why is that i don't know wait i just i feel like let's go let's have a little dialogue listen let's unpack your toxic masculinity preventing you from having fun and feminine it's not bad i just feel i don't know honestly i kind of have the movie click to blame it it's just an eerie feeling i think that's part of it i don't know um what do you know what i don't like about bed bath and beyonce they just stack everything to the ceiling oh yeah unsafe okay can't be very unsafe can someone tell me how titan shoulder shoulders just one shot me though mine doesn't do that i know oh look at my explosion void 3.0 baby why is it ford 3.0 what was void 2.0 what oh 2.0 was destiny 2. oh i thought they meant like indeed which honestly was more like a void and yeah it kind of went backwards they're like oh what hit me player autonomy uh nope we made the choice to [ __ ] you over everything you thought was fun with games at first is now no longer going to be oh good times what in the magnetic grenade yeah nice teamwork triple ah there's a barricade there oh good shot blue uh him time give him time young padawan the double no he doesn't have a lot of time homie i mean neither of you guys have a lot of time maybe you need joey you know maybe it's about time i mean joey is technically eligible he doesn't have a card you know he doesn't have that vip access what the fudge there is he was just like floating yeah he was he's a sneaky little guy let's do man like why are you using a shotgun maybe because it's effective [ __ ] except hey hey guys speaking of shut up fruit okay getting mixed get in here i was gonna say you you know speaking of bringing the dream team back this is the first map we did dream team on ever so this is that is yeah so i'll use that one because it certainly feels like i'm no that was like the very very first one yeah that's when i was like rob blue blue rob yeah shut the record one two three one homework two three one two three or wasn't it one two triple wreck one yeah it's so good seeing you back streaming destiny two see you in three months what the what is going on right now i'm middle what i mean i'll take middle i'm like not gonna get higher it feels like a fever dream right now yeah same you know playing this game a couple a couple days after which queen and unfortunately you know what's really showing right now oh wow wait yeah are we gonna lose wait i hope so i i feel like that's never even like really an equity it's just a matter of like where are we on the oh i'm invisible how do you see me dude do you want me to answer that uh yeah sure well i mean you're not you know boom boom this dude in his shoulder charge i mean i respect his incessant charging but you know maybe dial it down a little bit here buddy pump uh what the f is tony doing bro tony shoot tony in the face and tony just says no yeah tony's a little softer sopranos again well tony's hey tony's got to go meet up at the pizza parlor well tony's gonna be sleeping with the fishes if you guess what i'm doing why is dev still at the bottom dude if you are doing worse than me it's because he hears you and he's like oh he's getting nervous he's throwing up he's got stage fright all right you need to encourage him ah how about he encourages himself to do his job uh do i hate tony tony tony's like me like seven years ago when i didn't have internet oh well you just said he was effing you and i thought you didn't it's not looking good for us it's not really i'm i mean really it's not looking good for me hey tony hey tony it's me tony hey i got you rob zone advantage is yours that is one of my favorite cereals is that tony no that's hundo wait wait we're on the hunt we can win this we can win this yo you'll focus up boys this is us right now not the tv show they're just camping in the back why why oh why because we're on the hunt i need help nice we're in the lead boys we're in the league go cap something off off uh lock down you know get comfortable wow everyone has shotguns do you have do you have i was playing this game wrong i can't keep forgetting i have to play not to have fun in pvp

something that is indeed a good jolly horn what's that all about how sway tony guys stop dying guys guys what do you think we're trying to do what do you think we're trying to do bro i don't know i thought we was like this is guaranteed winning now it's kind of looking like it's a little sassy and i don't know i'm not really it's tied i went massive i got a kill is that it kill tony yeah nice uh tony was the nail in the coffin and of course is still second to last he was last the last time right oh so he just went well so i mean we both went up plus one but that's not what we needed me and willit maybe we're the dream team all right triple l that's what i'm talking about all right what hey we'll take one last like whatever wait did you wait did me and robert do you guys time yeah i think me and rob seven no we had seven to start let's just get that out of the way seven and then that right there was nine oh no yeah yeah i think you would have had to have three for him yeah yeah i think yeah there's no chance at the time oh no it's not a tie because dev is second to last let's go uh yeah so uh with the final score of uh six congratulations thank you wow and with a final score of uh i'm doing it in my head real quick as i think about it 16 rob and triple l yeah yeah final score of yes 20. i think yeah you know i should have never trusted a guy who wasn't in house fruit quite honestly all right but then again it also wasn't my choice all right uh i think okay yeah i'll get rid of it it's a good thing i have another of the exact same thing what uh that doesn't even mean it i hate it you always have so you always have no wonder no wonder listen dude it's very easy for me to put anything up on the line in these bets because i have a surplus of things okay well i don't you wanker okay well hey dude what do you want me to put up nothing everything i have have you seen my dado vault cleaning video all my roles are the same okay have you seen mine because that's not true you have like archaic things that shouldn't exist yeah but they speak ancient tongue somebody unearthed this like i thought this was only legends why do you still have it and i mean yeah that's exactly why well congrats to meanwhile house fruit representing congratulations mr trump win your first one thank you what are you gonna do tonight uh i don't have any big plans he's gonna he's
