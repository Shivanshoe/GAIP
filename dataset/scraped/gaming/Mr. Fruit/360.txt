heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to today's surprise little video because if you know me i love cuphead it's a fantastic game i played through myself then i played through co-op on the hardest difficulty with my friend rob in fact i did a whole let's play over it on my second channel more mr fruit link in the description what a plug i'm nailing it today anyway there's this free-to-play game that came out on steam very recently called tadpole tales and it's in the same vein as cuphead it has all the hand-drawn art and it's like a shoot em up bullet hell kind of thing uh obviously it's a lot shorter because it's free to play but it's fun and frustrating that's what makes it a beautiful experience this is how tadpole tails went for me enjoy the video now before we get into today's video i want to thank nordvpn for sponsoring this video now most of you probably heard this thing thrown around in the past couple years this vpn what is it i'm glad you asked it's a virtual private network it is quite literally life-changing i don't know about you but i prefer my life to be a little bit more private look into that as much as you will and that means a vpn is perfect for me and i wouldn't choose anyone except for nordvpn the primary reason i got a vpn was for security six there's a lot of things out there a lot of people watching a lot of eyeballs i don't like it so i said got a vpn it ensures no data logging nordvpn specifically comes with a cybersex suite which acts as an ad blocker you get double data encryption for increased anonymity this way you can be doing whatever you want nobody knows who it is you can protect your data while traveling in public places hot spots wi-fi's all that sort of thing and best of all you can try this with a 30-day money-back guarantee but that's not the best part uh security is an important thing but more importantly is entertainment me and the wife like to watch netflix that's no secret and what bums us out is when your region's library doesn't include some of the content you wish you'd have so let's say i'm living in america in the uk's got something cool on netflix i'm like dude what the heck that's not cool oh wait turn the vpn on suddenly they think i'm in the uk and i can access their library and watch whatever i want like for instance currently they have semi-pro one of my favorite will ferrell movies just rewatched it if you haven't seen it you're missing out once you use a vpn specifically nor vpn you're never going to want to go back i can guarantee that and because i partnered with them

benefits you gain are going to be endless you won't regret it oh a myth from the past said that there was a beautiful river inhabited by frogs its water was crystal pure and all the animals were living peacefully [Music] with king froggo on the throne the river was always carefree and blessed with flowers and sunshine but one day three monsters with great corruption seeing the untouched beauty of the river wanted to claim it as their own [Music] intoxicating everything around it [Music] and when all hope was lost a tiny brave temple breaks its shell wiggling its tiny tail it attempts to defeat the great evil that now plagues the river the tadpole tries to wash the toxins away and save the precious river they call home i'm a little tad pull short and small oh you lashed in space see because it has the hand-drawn things and although i guess with the camera move it might be a little more like um bullet bullet hell shooter which i guess cuphead kinda is it's kind of like gal gallagher too i'm assuming i don't want to get touched by that yo quit i see i'm purifying him he's like thank you you'll get get the bug oh that's that's probably extra pointers oh that's got to be
