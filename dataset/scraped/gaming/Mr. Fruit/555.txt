hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty modern warfare season five a brand new season means a brand new battle pass and the new battle pass means new weapons we have the iso smg and the an-94 assault rifle which we'll be taking a look at today as well as the tier 100 legendary blueprint the company's mind the an-94 is cutting edge five point four five eight since the third movement unique hyper burst featuring the energy of drug abuses and then we have the blueprint now this loadout definitely seems more catered for something like warzone or ground war now there's actually a secret to making this gun even better that i didn't realize until later into this video so be sure to stick around to figure out what that secret sauce is because i even surprised myself with the discovery i'm going to play on some of the brand new maps oil rig and harbor 24 7. welcome ladies and gentlemen to the getaway destination petrov oil rig having a problem with your significant other want to throw your life away then come on down to the oil rig what up i didn't even mention this it only took the time from conception to the birth of a newborn baby but look at this there is finally an inspect weapon button so it's all blacked out you got some skulls and then best of all with the blueprint are the tracer bullets why is this oh what the fudge oh my god get absolutely destroyed but it shoots she's almost like like anti-matter kind of stuff like you see like that effect like the particle it's like [Music] the ads speed and sprint fire speed is jesus freaking bird scared the poop out of me round and round we go where they are nobody knows except what is this dude in this corner really buddy honestly the thing i'm most excited about this season is the inspect weapon button why did why couldn't we have it earlier man god this map is this is it's a maze quite frankly i know some just feels like it feels like it takes like one more bullet than usual for like an assault rifle to kill maybe that's just me i don't know maybe it's because it may be like damage falloff is like maybe non-existent oh this is gonna be sick surprise i it wasn't clean but and all their kill streaks good lord okay all right yeah get me out of that game chief so like i said blueprint is good for longer range engagements and i love the bold effects but this barrel ain't it based off livestock what is this oh it's a three on three i see so i took off a couple attachments let's see just how that affects it but we're still gonna get the bold effects and that's all that really matters get up here looks like the bar is gonna be the centerpiece of the map here oh here they come what i don't know how that guy killed me it was complete luck that's the oh my this dude is just laying prone everywhere he's driving me crazy what just killed me oh he was right above me did not oh my god that spawn though oh and that spawn though oh geez trying to see for me not on my watch this is definitely a map for an smg not so much the an-94 you see i don't know it feels like it just doesn't it doesn't quite have the stopping power you know it's it's damage output leaves a little to be desired maybe i have no idea what i'm talking about i mean it's not bad yeah just stay on target mr fruit how about that really i refuse to believe what exactly just transfer are you kidding me my life is just god's long-running joke you know it's like all right we get it buddy can you uh just really you're gonna make me assist you rude bro check that ego at the door look i'll be this guy just light prone in random areas they'll never know wait for it wait for it oh my god i wait yeah not today give me another one give me another one let me add them oh they can be above me oh that's a new development this man in his shotgun ah i hate you wait a sec wait a second you know what i'm gonna kill you with your own god okay that's your friend i think you're actually dead oh yeah you like that huh yeah sucks when it comes around because you know what goes around okay this pleb really be do using a smoke though okay but anyway back to the a and 90 what are you doing hiding behind that tractor hop off john green's wiener and face me like a real man god dude i'm i'm bad with it maybe it's something about that like initial double burst or whatever that's like throwing me off but something just like i feel like with another like i would have killed by then i don't know oh my god i don't i think i'm just i just can't aim honestly i think that's just the problem i think i've been quick scoping and using dmrs for a little too long i'm used to just having to hit one and then be like all right job done like what with an ar that didn't kill that just befuddles me quite frankly oh a ship wait nanny all right well i'm headed in here let's just uh this is my new home little housewarming party because i don't have a choice jesus christ get inside this little map dude like what oh how did he shoot me through the freaking did the what apparently the barnes roof is made out of paper i mean i can't really blame it what can a roof really withstand you know a gunship you know fair enough i guess i mean if it did withstand it then and tell me the material because you know that's a great ad our roots are so tough it'll withstand an ac 130 and if it can withstand an ac 130 i think you can handle some hail like oh yeah just shoot dude sign me up lifetime do it i don't know what i'm i'm just assuming there's somewhere around here bro this dude has three kills or you've been in here the whole game how are you gonna tell me you got three kills you know what i'm saying like come on man like hopefully that dude isn't advertising like a carry service you know well actually he could argue i'll carry you to the bottom of the sbmm ranks that's on my wish list for cod 2020 no spmm but i know that's just that's just not going to happen it would be nice though but with this card doing so well i'm sure they're gonna be like well that's the secret sauce dude sbmm layer it on real thick like they're at they're at chipotle and instead of like hey could i get uh double protein can you like double chicken or like steak and chicken they're like hey can i get some spm but make it a double scoop why stop their triple scoop how about you just give me all the protein i'll take all of it oh my god get embarrassed full get embarrassed oh my god i'm going for the triple i'm going for the the extermination and i don't know where it is oh but this is gonna be a nice flank oh my god do it do it do it do it what really yeah i got you off spawn this time how does it feel huh tonto or tomto or whatever your real name is coward is more like it i ran out bolts no i ran out of c4 that was rough i'm on your six oh jesus i need you on my six oh i was on your six oh my god he's riddle that was terrifying all he had was a knife but i could barely take it you know what i'm taking the book out of his page wait i'm taking a book out of his page you know what i think i'm stupid but this knife ain't buddy you got a knife guy i couldn't say it i couldn't he died on my watch and he didn't have to prediction failed it all right i'm just hitting nothing someone's flanking us watcher six i knew it and i wasn't gonna allow it where is sign enemy can't find him bro if this isn't a sweet flank though i don't know what will be boom there we go there's another one it was a flank and it was so sweet oh my gosh the whole team i got some uavs and personally so there is some intel support what the i can't kill a darn thing bro i swear this gun it takes like an extra bullet more like really an ar like you mean that bro bro i feel like it just doesn't kill when it should kill and you're like well what are you using to measure that like every other ar i feel like maybe i just got a hip fire maybe that's the play okay okay see that one felt like it killed in time i don't know maybe i'm just crazy feels like an extra bullet every tim you know i'm going i'm going single shot screw it with every first shot being a double shot you know it's it's practically burst mode even though it says single and maybe it'll help with recoil or something i don't know i'm spitballing here but i'm willing to try to make anything work i can't see a darn thing okay that just worked for some reason so i'm on board and i'm capping the point i'm nuts oh god oh no i'm not not again not okay okay i won this time though wait a second this might i think i might be onto something here single shot no meme might be the play and there's like no gun i can ever think of outside a war zone that i like actually changed the the rate of fire on ironically or accidentally nine times out of ten attacks then it's like oh actually click that button what's the button to change it again because i don't i don't even know what it is because i never use it you know i can't see it stupid smoke i should violating my line of sight this is the play dude a single fire is the play it's it's not even a joke believe that i feel like it it kills faster dude i'm being serious you single fire it's so much better this is insane i mean i i just i was so desperate i was like well might as well swab it a single fire you know further means but now i'm like wait a second it's not i mean yeah we're about to get knifed bro or not oh god i guess we'll just get flanked dude this is quite a revelation hold on cruise missile and bound let's just approximately kill the entire team here all right they're like all in buildings okay we got no one sick in other words it's uh it's about on par with all my other cruise missiles that could not have gone worse never thought i would see the day where i would want to change the fire rate on a gun but the the proof is in the sauce man i want to say that the reason one is because you're reducing the recoil we actually thermited each other you're reducing the recoil you have to control it right but the other thing is because you're releasing after every hit you're getting that double shot initial double shot so i think it's like a burst of more damage you know and it actually makes it feel like it kills when it should this is incredible and then think if if single fire like pseudo single fire because it's kind of like a two burst is good up close imagine it at distance as well god i freaking smoke though i feel just like so big brain figuring this out look at that the double if i was using full auto i wouldn't have even got one of those oh wait what what the [ __ ] is that what what in the is that dude just like bugging out or is that just me [Music] that's a little step bro what a revelation single shot over full auto confirmed
