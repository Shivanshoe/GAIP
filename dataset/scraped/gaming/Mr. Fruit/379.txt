[Music] oh ho ho i've been expecting heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to today's video sponsored by epic games thanks epic today we're going to be checking out auto chess we've done a video on this previously if you hadn't seen that check that one out as well because you can never get enough of this game i certainly can't if you're unsure what autochess is you don't actually it's not it's it's a figure speech it's not actually chess you know in fact autochess is a fun competitive online multiplayer strategy game from the creators of the original dota auto chess it takes the strategic elements of an online battle arena and implements it into a strategic board game with unique characters best of all it's free and available on the epic game store use my link down below to get the game for yourself and hey if you make any purchases in the game or else when they have a game store feel free to use code mr fruit best of all since our last foray into auto chess they've had some updates some new characters and stuff so we're gonna be checking those out specifically there are these pandas and i have to try and make a panda build i mean who wouldn't want to do that so let's get into the video ladies and gentlemen it's time to get into a game now okay that was quick i didn't even have time to monologue all right never mind okay we're just getting right into it oh i don't know what to choose this guy looks new they've added some new units of course wait a second i'm not gonna about to lose the pve am i come on there winter kyra to run he's probably offended that i can't even say his name what do we want here mana restoration uh um mana restoration seems pretty good right oh we already got a panda oh this is so exciting perfect and we're just gonna i can't put items on right now but that's okay so here we go heaven brew new trade panda man i know pretty self-explanatory he's a panda and he's a man the trades panda man anyway i'll tell you in a second what does this do sure why not right okay it says we need this too so let's do this let's apply some items um let me go ahead and combine said okay we combine those that's big so anyway like i was saying oh we also have martialist activated oh when an allied martial is attacked [Music] yes of course so anyway panda man at the beginning of the round there is a chance to invite a panda man or to recruit from from the chess pool the recruited chess piece is of the same race as any deployed chess piece so essentially we get free stocks what's not the like uh lifesteal evasion attack speed let's go attack speed okay we don't want anybody here so screw us yeah so free stocks you know what i'm saying to the moon baby for free at the beginning of the match she's like oh you want panda man boom we'll give them to you for free we'll see when it activates because currently it's a low chance you know most likely than not every round we won't be activating it yet but once we receive more panda mountain free notes because the other there's three pandaman the other two are all rare units blue units so i want to level do i have a best chance to start hitting those and honestly i don't see how we could how we could fault or have i tried to build no but i'm sure it works great what uh what are we activating you know we'll activate this we'll activate the demon trait we'll have him carry us see he's even got our little item one of our old items uh yeah we'll just have him carry but um what's this guy got here huh he's got five units wait a second who is this fella and i like him am i winning no i don't think so let's see he is currently rocking this spirit okay you might have spirit but i have hearts and spirit wins today well played okay okay like i said we're uh we're gonna scale okay early game world week and that's okay so i know i i we already have one of these i know not part of our build okay all right let's get ahead of ourselves here if i win oh but i guess oh i already have i have room for five people don't i okay well screw me i guess i could have done this exact same thing i'm just a boner all right name i can't pronounce do battle i will fight ye and i will smite ye i don't know what you're rocking and quite frankly i don't care because your boomerangs are not enough look at this what is this little thing ghost kid do i feel that wait a second your ghost gets kind of cracked never mind never mind you said no chance look at our ghost hell rider hell night excuse me popping up you can see them doing the damage over here if you guys haven't seen my video on auto chest before first off these guys i need them that's fantastic but it's an auto battler it's word named auto chess this is what started it all the best thing about it is it's super friendly for new players because just like this you're like i don't know how to position my people boom it'll position it for you i don't know where to put my items i already have it in the best possible thing but it'll do it just have a click of a button and in the store you can choose what you want to build so that way when they pop up in the store like that they go check mark they're like hey you dummy don't miss this it's great it makes it really easy so the barrier entry is low but the skill ceiling is still high you still have to figure out the right builds right items and then on top of that just because the game always says hey you could put them here or you could put the items here doesn't always mean it's the best or perhaps your lobby has certain builds and so you can position or itemize to counter them that's pretty that's like that's like 800 iq and i'm not that so i am gonna buy a strange egg because he lets us get an extra piece of anybody uh aside from that we're chilling is anyone else going panda man no no of course not is that a bad thing to be decided maybe there's a reason no one's using it oh he's just summoning all the trance trance trains i never actually knew how to pronounce that okay we're getting pooped on but that's okay i'm in last aren't i oh okay like hey hey give me a sec oh we're already start we're starting up the guy that isn't even a part of our build but let's get it now unfortunately like i said i'm not hitting some of the pieces so we have redundant pieces on the board which don't help us but yeah we're going for these traits they make you super powerful you want items you want to combine them and then they just duke it out and honestly it's i think this is like the future strategy games in my opinion i'm all about them they're so much fun they're so easy i i don't think we've activated the panda treat yet but that's okay statistically we we should be we're pretty due for the thing so okay we got a lucky coin that's great what um we can get extra lifesteal we can get was this uh uh extra attack okay still looking for those pandas little rascals they're hard to find they're being a little shy you know they're new to the game oh yeah i don't know hey i don't know what i'm doing over here all right take it easy on me but look we're starting to get traits and our first w you had 89 health you've been winning not anymore what'd you even have human mages get get beat by mac goblins oh here it is heart of mech i got an item so what does this do immediately refreshes the store once i get a free reroll i get a free reroll on the store it's insane i'm gonna buy some more you why not so we're kind of stabilizing and you can look over here at gold this guy's double cheeked up he's in first place 97 health 41 gold he's the most gold now i have second most and things are looking great bad good bad good they're looking good oh my god what is this kite doing launches three rockets to strike oh just freaking boosh okay we got a ripper that's a good start oh wait a second wait oh did we activate the panda man tree and i didn't even notice because we randomly got thunder trace another panda i didn't even know oh i would have put him in the field oh but we didn't lose horribly i should have probably bought more from the store okay so i'll just get some xp and what happened to our thunder choice guy because it kind of seems like he he died real fast okay but thankfully we have heaven bomber who's just been loki carrying us but he's just he gets so close and yet so far so often that's okay i'm not mad about it whoa we gotta start up the heaven bomber that's big so i was just talking about how good he is so i'm gonna level up level up this is good oh my god i get a strange a level two strange egg you found me i don't even know what that means but i think that's real good if you need one piece to rank up your two star piece drag the stranger and it will be whatever you want it to be what happens when it's a level two strange egg though and we're still winning occasionally it's back and forth folks we got a close one here probabilities of rare are still 30 rookie numbers i gotta pump those up are we close to any new traits oh we almost have six goblins i think we're popping off but they're they're pretty rare to get they're they're like five star things so now he's part of the build and he's like a really expensive one to get so i think that's pretty good pretty sure that's good i mean it seems to be going rather well i i think oh way oh yeah okay well to be fair this guy he's like in seventh place we pooped on him oh and he's gonna give us some of the item because he died so he drops items and it all gets randomly split we're gonna three-star now he's got giant locks and braids okay three star soul breaker with most of my items we gotta hope this man can carry us and you're actually getting outdone by this panda okay it was a mistake i should have used it on him but that's okay you're still second you're doing your best and we dumpstered this guy not even your doggos can save you get out of here what are the probabilities right now of rares it actually went down that's unfortunate oh wait a second oh i didn't even see it panda man popped off we got the other panda but who do i slot in feels like everyone's pretty pivotal you know what i might knock out whoever is the least helpful although that buff is mighty fine we like that okay so ability damage sure sure sure okay here we go combine those bop distribute okay now you need to go in but for whom okay i'm gonna put you in here all right we got the three panda man stats here i think we just got another thunder trace two like i said stonks are up we didn't get one that time it seems like every time i'm paying attention to the panda man it we don't get it and then when i'm not we do so i'm just gonna stop paying attention to it and this guy is a little frightening he's a lot of health and yet somehow some way we do be pooping on them yeah you like that that's the power of the panda bruh still not the guy in first place okay they're really dragging the south they want to make this as suspenseful as possible i'm just worried that it will only be me and him and if he beats me then i have to keep fighting him over and over and over and i don't know if i can pop off fast enough but i did get an item oh no i got two items from him thank you very much i apparently can't combine this into something don't mind if i do it's gonna be the clash of titans dare i say the clash of pandas and i'm hoping to come out on top okay we're gonna get this because it lets us get something crazy watch this i have way too many items so if i do this i can either get owners on it flash it to the target grid or that's great yeah sure and then this can combine into this and then this combines into this and then this combines into this and distribute that i have eight million items and i still have not gotten another panda wow my luck is so unfortunate this is him uh wow he he hurts oh but wait but wait my pain demands popping off let's go okay come on do it again do it again oh okay we lost okay okay i gotta start hitting here what's so what are we looking like here you're already on the board what are okay i don't need let's be honest okay level ups or anything oh we're one away from a three-star panda i shouldn't be rerolling my goal at this point it's useless come on panda man activate look at all the we could start this we could restart this we could almost restore that i'm very nervous because now it's just me and him forever and ever but venomancer is popping off with that item we gave him as you can see over here he is killing it in the dps department that's another win that's another win i'm gonna go with heaven bomber i feel like he's been popping off the most for us okay we've we've distributed some items i'm still just the unluckiest player in the world uh a stranger that's helpful okay we need to pop off again see get ready for this big aoe whatever that was holy cow it all happened so fast in the blink of an eye wait all it took was one fat l what happened nah we were so close to greatness panda man that's right clearly i deserve props because unlike him apparently nobody goes nobody wanted pandas but i wanted them and they carried me to second i was just a little unlucky and okay his his build just seemed pretty good i'm gonna be honest well ladies and gentlemen that was auto chess again thank you very much to them for sponsoring
