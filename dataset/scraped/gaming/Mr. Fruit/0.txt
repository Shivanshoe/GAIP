all right dado mr fruit we have 15 minutes to loot a loadout and then we 1v1 we can only use what we lose all right three two one go so you're going straight into leviathan i'm going straight to containment for me right now it is literally tier three chester bust okay i'm going to more populated lost sector that i like to run on the dreaming city and i'm hoping that just pure killing is going to feed me enough blues the only problem is that it takes me a while to get over there so this is like precious time that i could be this isn't a good load-in it's not started and everyone's leaving from the previous one maybe reload yeah is it's like i could try that i'm just doing it because i've i've tried to do that before is like keep reloading and then i i felt like the game was like no yeah it's like here's the one that you get and then you you finish that first and then we'll give you more there's a lot of good there's a lot of good seasonal weapons i could get here yeah oh yeah that like last time i did it the only purples i got were armor that didn't really help yeah i was most of this is going to be handled by by gun battles so i'm not really i'm not really the most concerned oh there's a purple whoa oh it's enhanced before nevermind oh i was like already granted i was asking that about imtas when he popped open a contact that's true i remember that although he ended up switching off of it if i remember correctly well yeah he ironically he didn't like the rangefinder so he was throwing well so far we're three minutes and i have nothing i haven't gotten a single thing to draw uh shame so i'm gonna try one more law sector yeah for me it was like edz was just i can open the chest okay we got a blue all right never mind spawning already i can't believe i got the greatest blue in the game that's oh i got a blue okay wait what i mean you thought your blue was good let me tell you about legion bane oh sheesh well it's like the old shane you know it's like a rising tide uh brings all ships up well in this case uh a low tide brings all ships down all right two lost sectors and i've got nothing so i think i'm also going to to the nightmare world i have had to run a nightmare containment by my no one ever showed up and i did it took me like 20 minutes okay like how do you how do you what's the best way to make sure you get a weapon is gamba i know i might yeah see i'm i'm also in one where there's absolutely nobody literally just nothing all right hang on all right nine minutes to go blue set of arms hey that's moddable because the white won't be i don't think so hey what if oh man what if i went to the lost sector and i got a lower laser that is like an exotic no matter what it could i mean a laura lays specifically yeah i'm gonna quit right now let me tell you okay i just reloaded into one with the tier two wait you already got tier two i just loaded into a tier two maybe i should have realized you're happy halfway through tier two or tier one tier two i was still on tier one i've i've already given up i'm gonna go just trying to kill everything i can as fast as possible much like my teammates usually end up doing whenever i'm trying to do stuff oh you want a blue uh i see like a resource like no yeah no main stay focused on track stay alive i'm actually gonna pick up the side all right we just hit the halfway point we're gonna be fighting in all white gear this is just gonna be starter 1v1 oh i got a weapon okay okay i have a weapon am i excited about it well i'm not gonna say i mean it's probably better than just a default white weapon maybe [Music] but me oh that's a purple bunk bonk bonk now there is a prime engram that's always a chance i don't actually know do you need to do anything specific for umbrellas or are those also just random uh those are basically random yeah it's like i've never actually paid attention yeah my favorite part when people watch the videos like it's been like seven years since i've seen someone excited about a blue drop yeah right or like even the purple so often when i'm doing things it's just drops everywhere and now it's like it's annoying it's so annoying oh there's a blue we'll get it okay okay it's a gun i'll take a gun so we each have a wine and we just have a gun at least tier two done give me my ammo let's go wow this is taking longer than i thought we need to turbo this tier three i feel like i feel like this is the one time where people are going so slowly no one's dunking the cores of dread either just like everyone's over it they already did their triumphs and they're like probably yeah i've seen the side of them i'm good like dude i'm just like chilling and grinding dude okay well now's enough the time here we go here we go here we go like i dumped all my dollar horns first damage we got six of us we have a raid team here i'm out dpsing these guys with a stick my sticklebunk oh my god there we go last one good where what where are these people there you go there's the g horn there's the spam all right i'm just super i'm gonna save the scythe for the last okay i'm i'm sort of relying on my haven't played destiny in a while cooldown for the game to give me some stuff oh true because that's usually what ends up happening is you don't play for a week welcome back here's a bunch of stuff yeah here's plenty of primes and it happens almost without fail yeah so where where is mine bungee oh last dps oh okay this is this is optimal opulent key here would be nuts oh but wait wait i forget we also get two chests open that's two good blues this might actually benefit okay it's dead oh the moment of truth moment of truth okay let me open this up give me something good how do we do it we gotta we gotta keep a huge blade barrage by the teammate with the boss right at a health marker right at a health gate and i think every purple i got was a weapon oh but wait wait wait i'll watch how much time yeah we have three minutes left where the or where are the chests i don't have a sniper in my ah fudge man 15 minutes is goes much faster than you think okay this is good this is awesome where are the dudes i need some i need something big here how do we do okay that is not big that's actually how about this this is oh my god well i don't like the sound of that oh my goodness that could be so good it could be oh my goodness okay i'm a little nervous now this is we have one minute left there's no chance how did tash get something in every slot i know i know wait i might actually i think i just got everything it's not great stuff in every slot but give me something oh cool give me something just somebody dropped something my last piece of loot that i'm able to get right here goody good job reload and time oh geez that timer gives me a heart attack oh okay i gotta be very interesting okay can i pick up a blue that was already on the ground before the timer yes ended okay cool cool it was completely worthless let me double check i don't yeah i don't have any engrams to pop okay let me just double check as well yep nothing first literal first time ever destiny session with no umbral engrams can we get that for literally forever that's incredible okay so i got every slot except arms i got every slot except half the things except most of them four five six i got seven purples you got seven purples yeah and somehow it ain't oh boy that's troll that might be my best chance so the first arms that i got were legion bane my first drop was arms purple arms right my next two drops two more purple arms so the only weapon i have is a fusion the other two slots just let me know what to break out oh my god nothing nothing dropped all right we got 15 minutes score limits 20. if we don't hit 20 it's just whoever has more kills of you okay good luck out there daddo made the scuffiest loadout win yeah you like that you're gonna get oh you're gonna get closer oh i guess i was too low i'm fine i'm alive me holding w uh and i had like hand cannon battles we have auto rifle battles yeah we're just like never we're gonna well uh ow dom yoink all right we've done the same thing to each other will this result in anything different we're just gonna keep on shaking handshaking flame strike kills oh i got one that's for the people at home they can stop yelling at me i don't feel nuts with it though oh yup see it's like oh no oh no [Music] going to do you know what i'm going to do what is that huh you would oh wait what oh my god i oh i heard the wind up i was like i've made that mistake this thing just takes so long to shoot stop it oh my goodness come here you're saucy not as not as uh as much range as i was hoping for wowie clap dude wait i guess i hit the body i didn't think i did i'm not gonna i'm not gonna question it oh no oh no i need you to think about what you're doing challenge me wait you do have a fusion oh you're right there hello i need this to fall [Laughter] see it's like i think i'm throwing using the sniper i'm so bad it's not a throw it literally even if you hit a body shot it just like you can just rush me i see you i don't know oh i don't see where did you come from oh no i love root i you i'll have that rocket oh well oh my that was some hesitation i think that was hesitation it was a lot of things oh my no oh oh sure very impatient i am impatient rude i invented that trick okay oh no you get there first of course you oh look i just i didn't want to delay that one i just wanted to let's just do it let's just get it over with let's just get the rocket out and get back to dancing oh my god where are you and i am so sorry i cannot sleep you sashimix wait what how did all right i you know what i don't know why my hands are gonna hammer strike me i've never i don't think he had enough sprint i guess not it's just so risky going for a fusion shot that takes a full second to shoot oh there's one thing i've learned how to do in this game let's run away nope nope come here don't need it don't hit it get away no that way no shot oh my god hello i've come to take it to recovery without your time something else okay and uh yeah i'm just gonna run away yeah it's just such a commit on the super long you either kill you don't oh yeah it's it's just an honorary shotgun at this point is there shame in my game absolutely not oh let's oh let's run [Music] oh all right to commit or not thanks buddy oh come on all right you got to be out of oh ammo at some point right [Music] there we go pop your own super i almost want to i almost want to hold it if i'm at 19 just so i don't choke i'm not going to do it again and oh you gotta be kidding mr fruit please my career is over feeling it now you're out okay oh you swap you little swapper that was probably the worst the the secret fusion swap dead the super no okay well and that's how the cookie crumbles folks watch you wrapped it up okay i'm actually thrown with a fusion see now that i know you're on the fusion i can play things a little differently with the sniper i'm at i'm at a disadvantage a massive disadvantage we can talk about this we can have an oh we can have a dialogue communication is key in a relationship danielle has said that quite a lot come here wow that was not nearly as accurate as i thought it was going to be oh i did not see you oh we're coming out on time too that's going to be a close one folks oh my god i feel like i get a head start and then you just hit like six crits in a row the the one everyone ever want everyone wanted barebone auto rifles all right i gotta make up a lot of lost ground here just don't throw it away one job one job and load one minute oh my god i didn't think you're gonna charge in i saw you go ah upstairs oh you charge it first all right that was a whiff mr fruit no i keep thinking they're gonna spawn you to the opposite side of where i am oh okay it took me the that like i didn't think you're gonna commit but you got it ggs yeah tough gg's good sir i kept it a little close relatively close hey i would auto rifle battle you any day good sir appreciate it bud it was an honor love you i love you more [Music] [Music] oh
