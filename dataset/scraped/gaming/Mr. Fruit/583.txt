in today's dream team the dream team is back in iron banner paths just in time for it not to be a year in between them ironically we're doing the iron banner bats during the most popular D to iron banner event as you can tell it is a real account because that's his light level we did our best to tell Rob you know maybe it's not the best idea but he assured us this is what he wants it's time to get real as JFK once said ask what you can do for your your destiny not what the city can do for you well if you remember which you probably don't cuz it's been a while in the last iron banner bats Rob got last oh it was like super-dead last it wasn't even close I got second and blue one also oh wait we didn't this is the all-star on your banner beds how are we not gonna mention the people right there we have here the holiest of taco men bless the optimal the one the only dad oh and the professional eSport player Danielle she just kept so with these all-star is the way it works is depending on where we placed and the last one which means Rob's gonna pick first I pick second blue gets whoever isn't picked we pick a teammate here we play to iron banner matches and depending on where we were on the scoreboards both the player and their teammate after two games add them all together whichever is the lowest score they're gonna win which means are a hobby V first-round draft pick first of all I'm gonna be rocking with a sniper I don't know like what the meta really looks like but I heard auto rifles are tight so the reckless Oracle you get that rain like the most recent that's a
