heidi hope you won my name's mr fruit and welcome to call of duty black ops cold war and well you guys know me i'm a cod famed so let's check it out they have prepared a couple of multiplayer game modes for us today and the best part is unlike the modern warfare beta everything and the alpha is unlocked this part well like at least a decent bit and for my loadout we're going to be using the xm4 now the gunsmiths makes a return and check this out eight attachments now that is thanks to cold war's unique wild cards i'm using gunfighter which allows me to unlock three additional attachment slots for my primary weapon and then with that we're headed into just some regular 6v6 the multiplayer reveal focused a lot on the combined arms which is 12v12 i believe and i'll be checking that out but to me call of duty's all about that sweet six on six action isn't that right buddy welcome to miami look at those neon lights brings me back to a time when i wasn't alive now before we hop into this i think it's important to note that this is my first fps game on console in a very very long time so bear with me gotta gotta get my bearings back here i've never played this map before and i'm curious did they bring back shooting shows up on the mini map or not because honestly i'm not sure but i'd love to see the little medals pop up there treyarch does okay mr sniper holy heckers there was a rootin tootin cowboy i could barely barely keep a hold of it look at this isn't this nice we can take a little break at the copacabana i just haven't played call of duty with this wall of an f of vienna in a very long oh wait he's got friends and all the right places i don't know if i just hear myself running louder than the enemy but this is me with ninja apparently and i'm just stompy mcgee right now so hard to say oh god oh the rust is showing oh get turned on hey maybe i still got it after all this time skirt yeah you like that little slide i know you do wait what's going on here why is there like a counter uav thing what is this ow that was c4 oh jesus give me up whoa the fastest mantle i've ever seen oh destroy jammer yeah screw your jammer bruh will you hear that field mic available put that right there where should i do oh gives me like a mini uav well it just so really really having fun down there buddy well he's right where he belongs laying on the ground with all the trash the garbage this is for you buddy and it's not good hello i'd like to make an order are you guys open that is not the melee button oh god what is the melee button all right i'm on tactical and i just want to be frank i just that is my friend that's that's my bad and that is not i just got quick scoped wow they've got a spy plane do they not just so it happens i don't have ghosts so they can see me i thought all right don't ask me why but i thought that was a friendly over there spoilers it was not we have a spy plane up in there though too and i think the guy that was over there had ghosts so i just kind of got debated well played i don't even know you could go up there a little vantage point huh i'm curious what do you guys think of cold war i know the game obviously like the alphas you can see here has just been out but i mean since the reveal and everything does this seem like a cod you're gonna play enjoy is it like a big no from you this seems to be more of a spiritual success from black ops one which was my favorite call of duty so i am certainly interested however i will say so far it's playing a lot like modern warfare it feels like modern warfare 0.5 so oh i got a spy plane oh that's right because it's point streaks i totally forgot about that so for those unaware no longer is it kill streaks as far as a more maybe you can make them kill streaks or something but it goes back to the score streak system to where doing anything you know playing the objective and stuff is going to count towards that kill streak and if you die that's not the end of it you can continue to earn the kill streak the difference though is once you earn it it goes on cooldown so let's say spy plane has like a three minute cooldown or something i don't know just making stuff up but let's say it has like a three minute cooldown well then once i use it i can't even begin to re-earn it until three minutes later does that make sense okay but i got some artillery ready i'm assuming this is just like some sort of mortar strike or something and like what we just why why why are you like this who hurt you airspace full my anus hey clear the airspace oh thanks okay friggin go right there right there right there yep doubt that's gonna kill anyone but let's see [Music] that's incredible i didn't kill anyone so as far as the score streaks go i don't know how i feel you know it it does mean that you know the casual i can't see through all this shenanigans doesn't mean that the casuals and stuff or people who can't usually get streaks do get to get their streaks it's just that i liked in other games you could choose to make it a score streak or whatever like i'd totally be fine opting out to kill streaks where it's a little bit cheaper but obviously you lose progress on death i just like to have the option i don't know if i would do it i'm chasing somebody oh i'm the little bk that could come back here i will say i have been trying to double time and uh i can't do that anymore it's it's strange oh okay oh i hear you i hear you you a little rascal got him and i don't have a helicopter oh you're friendly sorry i am close though that is a nice stun i think it was a little unnecessary right behind me huh well screw me for thinking that my teammate behind me could protect me silly me you know if i just pick up a couple more tanks though i should be able to just get my element i feel like my awareness right now is just at an absolute all-time low it just feels like i have tunnel vision right now once upon a time i was used to this fob but i'm used to cranking my fav up until like a skateboarder lens you know what i'm saying like those old 90s skateboard films and stuff where they use that lens and it's just like like makes you want to throw up yeah that's that's what i'm used to where are these guys no that's not a oh that is a dude that's a dude yes how do i still not have my helicopter wait if i get this i might oh i i actually don't know if that playing the obj has got to count towards the score streaks right like that just that would just make the most amount of sense how do i still not have it getting a little upset spaghetti right now okay wait wait what i gotta you i got a spy plane before i got my helicopter how does that work oh i got it i got it attack helicopter in bat oh my god we won as soon as i called it now i didn't have the highest score actually that's strange because i have the most amount of elims i have the most amount of objectives what we're also playing um somewhere in russia let's give this mp5 a whole why don't we the folks back home i've always been a sucker for smg's in every call of duty they've always been my favorite they're the ones that lend themselves to running and gunning the most now i do say i haven't the slightest clue where i am or what i'm doing however i know this this is a quick triple kill look at this little guy trying to jump jump and turn on me little 180 not on my watch plebs only jesus there's a lot of them got him there's a lot of them i can't see a darn thing c4 didn't get anything wait this is supposed to be a flank why why am i behind my team now what is this i'll take a whiskey neat on the rocks hold the whiskey you know what you just hold the rocks too i'll just take some some club soda oh that's it that's it oh wait that smoke it's not like a stun or anything i'm hiding i'm hiding and say do not know i am here can i mantel up this oh my god i can't oh i'm so athletic and more importantly i am so dead i will say though this is pretty uh am i that bad maybe maybe i am spart playing inbound i'll call that in though and pretty sure this loadout comes with a rocket launcher so i'm gonna shoot down everybody else is fun that screw you guys proximity boy hold on hold on hold on watch this watch this buddy ready oh one kill really thought it'd be a little bit more but we'll take it kind of seemed like i'd get maybe a duble muerte but whatever whatever man i'm not upset i'm just disappointed oh my this thing kicks but i will say compared to other treyarch games though very meaty like the sound design so far especially like like ready hold on let me kill this a little bit ready listen oh yeah i know you're like wait a minute why'd you just play the sound effect over again that was actually me i know i know you can barely tell the difference that's just how good i am yo where's your stuff throw your stuff up in the air like you just don't care yet ah now what's going on here what's going on here i don't think i can eat that very far but i tried oh enemy spy plane this is my moment where is it show yourself there it is that should do the trick worked so hard for that just for me to shoot it down in quarter of a second that is a killjoy if i've ever seen one ooh was that a shot i haven't the slightest clue oh come around though crouching didn't see that one coming i'm sure i'm not alone though there's more there's all there are plenty more yes about to say this is call of duty where you find one you'll find nine i don't care that there's only six enemies it'll feel like there's nine ready watch this big brain big brain brain fudge me oh god if i just if i just saved it i could have put it right there and gotten a kill suck oh my god look at that mantle though my man with all this stuff on him by the way that ain't life he just up and over that thing in a second an olympic hurdler and if not might die might i point you into a near career path just saying oh you know what i wonder if they still have melee animations i did enjoy that in modern warfare let's let's see if i can't find out myself ow that didn't do nearly as much as i thought oh hey we won a win for america does this play the game oh they didn't even show me shooting down the spar playing dude why is this player the game okay oh i guess i did get another kill okay i mean sure yeah yeah i mean hey i'm not gonna say no to being spotlighted ma i'm famous ladies and gentlemen call of duty black ops cold war let me know if you guys want to see something specific in this alpha i think i'll do some combined arms in another video either way it was just cool to get some hands on early it'll be hard for me to tell how it stacks up until i actually get to play it on pc but hey man another call of duty i'm down although i'm a little upset spaghetti pretty sure they're still not bringing back prestiges that was what motivated me so penis anyway with that said i don't think all much for watching have yourself fantastic dan i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
