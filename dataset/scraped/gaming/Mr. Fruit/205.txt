hi eddie ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to split gate and the crazy sons of guns they made the game even better season zero is here with a whole battle pass but that's not that's not what we're here for they added infection i don't actually remember what they called it in in the game but it's halo infection i love me some zombies so that's what we're gonna do let's get into it and best of all look at this assault rifle skin this is a real thing contamination survive the infected onslaught or eliminate all survivors to win yes please round starts in three two one [Music] oh shut up i had to go to the bathroom watch oh i think i'm i'm assuming i'm infected what's on my shoulder oh like am i the only zombie is that what's going on here go check this out bob they don't see it coming then we're going to come over here freaking oh my god he bagged me he bagged me the audacity this guy's dead check this out i'm gonna go here and then i'm gonna do this yeah wait where is he i thought he'd be here oh man okay look if we can infect one person we're going to get the ball rolling here but yeah there's our problem duh this not exactly going well now is it god damn fudge jesus ow get off of me why do you have carbines what the fudge all right here i go oh my god move oh he's not gonna see this coming yeah oh you kidding me i hate it the only problem is this isn't like the sword in halo it's not nearly as generous with a lunge so all right here i go we're trying it again come here come here yes we did it i've done it i know he's on the rooftop here i'm just waiting oh did he see me is there a way i can portal behind him i'm able to portal behind him apparently i can't fudge me what oh the portal oh wait my friend got one oh okay now we have the number advantage i got the ball rolling that's all we need to do yo mob up where is he where is he let him know yo give me a portal wait those are all friendly portals you boners somebody somebody get me up there put me coach that's a window coach i'm so confused put me in where the fudge is he you guys will ask them how'd you lose them is he below what are we doing god guys how do we not know where he is what oh he was above me the little boner we got him all right we won now i just have to pray i don't start zombie because that was also the thing in halo infected it was never fun to start as the zombie because of what you just you just kind of saw you just kind of get spanked around oh but we're not allowed to use portals oh i didn't know that oh i mean that i guess god jesus changes the game a little bit had i known that might have played a little bit differently but okay bro how are you already dying man can we use okay we can at least use our jet pack no making me look at the game in a whole new way escape skate and what you want it's the bag okay the shotgun has limited ammo did not know that should probably take it a little bit easier he's gonna he's trying to use momentum god he's literally 10 help there's a dude right below me and i'm terrified i was gonna say apparently i can't hit a shot oh geez i only have one more shotgun shot this is not good i repeat not good he's a maniac okay see that's that's pretty good okay hold those how many of these oh god it's only me and one other guy oh no wonder wow that was something else great shooting there mr fruit ah wait up i was literally just looking for that dude oh fudge me all right i don't even know where my friend was i guess i should have figured that out huh oh oh he's over here you've awoken us he's he's about is he doing this thing again yeah he is come here okay but i got him out of hiding we we zombies won i mean okay i mean i've started zombies twice so does that mean like oh jesus christ oh yeah i made that pretty obvious okay don't appreciate the bag but whatever god the lunch never works like i think it will it's always just a little bit shorter oh what the fudge oh whoa bro what what have you done to me okay wait i see somebody up there ow no stop it ah just freaking couldn't find anything to portal to yeah i still can't what the [ __ ] trying to figure out oh there there okay ready i'm just gonna come what who destroyed my portal ah okay here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go through this thing ah fudge wait this isn't what i wanted to do okay we're building momentum i guess oh god i'm getting nauseous fudge me real okay there we go okay they probably see my portal right there they're like he's surely gonna go into it and they are right i can't where are you god i feel useless as a zombie oh oh oh my god oh my god if my guy wasn't so pepe god he just like running it forget his head to just jump down and whack him i'm sorry i'm getting really worked up about this and it's it's not that deep okay i know it must be done wait but there isn't a way to fly to him all right we're just gonna have to make it up ourselves here we go ah god it just doesn't doesn't work no matter how i think about it god freaking you son of a i hate it i hate i can't oh my god i took the wrong portal i don't even know where he is now where am i who am i what am i god what am i hearing oh jesus there he is i didn't even get to have as much fun as a survivor man you got it i remember zombies not getting getting boned this map's just not good for zombies okay because otherwise i don't have a good excuse not that i would really say that excuse is good in the first place but [Music] where'd he just go oh there he is yo yo go go go they can't stop us all will you just launch at where am i okay all right we can work this out fellas oh my god wait how you're gonna tell me i didn't lunge at that like like what that's the only difference between halo zombies and this i could actually freaking lunge oh my god big brain yo final kill cam wait are have they added that to everything i hope they do because final kill camps are awesome anyway suck my okay new map run it again that was the problem new map okay what i swear to god i just know i'm gonna be zombie and none of these maps are good for zombies okay here we go i'm already off to a good start no leave me alone yes a good start indeed no i was just about to kill your friends dude get alive god who camaraderie well okay yeah that's the thing too it wasn't even camaraderie he's just a dude i know he's around here okay he's in the middle actually oh what are you gonna do leave that strafe really forced me to try and think and i don't like it ah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we got him all right it's all of us on one now yeah i infected two that's huge already doing exponentially okay what is this dude okay i don't know great job zombies maybe they're just worse i don't know okay i'm not a zombie i'm not a zombie three two okay there's a zombie though i know what you was trying to do with that portal come on come on come on come on i skirt i says i ain't scared bob now come on this is the only way they're ever gonna get at me until they get a little bit more creative so i'm just gonna farm the kills while i can but i have to have my head on a swivel he's trying to figure out where to portal oh i see the guy oh he's so weak uh as long as nobody else dies i think i can just go up here that's how you make that portal silly oh and he's gonna make the point he's gonna jump here ready saved you you're welcome no thanks i'm oh wait what i didn't even know that was i didn't know it's possible well played sir gotta watch out for that oh you're actually a daddy dude what the fudge okay suddenly we don't have the numbers anymore suddenly i'm pooping my pants yes right rowan be afraid i'm saving my shotgun shots too haven't even used them oh god kind of spooky when i'm hearing boosting everywhere ah i didn't even think i was so calm and i was like haha there's a portland is the only way they'll get to me so how that went yo if we don't just like all go in one by one we have an exponentially better chance but yeah no it's okay go get em boys one by one apparently no see if you guys wait there's literally nothing he can do serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine jump there we go just just go on it boys what are you guys doing i'm waiting i'm waiting see he's scared i forgot i can use portals what the [ __ ] don't ask me why yo baited i'm gonna come behind him oh i was just about to finally get him okay uh last dude's last two tithing i i don't know where he is i'm gonna be honest maybe he's me um where oh where could he be hello is he down here what the f what the [ __ ] he's gonna win

destroyed oh where's the kill cam i wanted to see what he did see i know how to use portals but i'm not there yet with momentum okay you know i'm chilling back up here but this time head on a swivel even more so are you kidding me where did my friend go oh my god [Music] what what happened to my okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait here we go here i go all right build

do with anything perfect just in time where am i okay oh geez well i see them all oh check this out i'm gonna be right above them and they don't know because nobody knows the map what the fudge man and it looks like they're sticking together like what is this you know come on okay i got it there's got to be something down below that i can build momentum with right there is but over there that's not great all right i'm gonna e here i go wait i put it back in the room ah fudge i'm not thinking i repeat i'm not thinking with portals okay height advantage we like that oh come back here you boner did he see me on radar for a second or something are you kidding me what do we do about this there's nothing to portal up oh god this what this map wasn't made for zombies all right i gotta get behind them but real careful like close the portals hold on just jumping show up on the radar god i already hate this dude like all four of them are up there aren't they oh two it doesn't even matter three yeah and uh god only knows where the fourth one is let's be honest he's probably up there this is stupid i hate it here cool map not for zombies like wha okay you infected somebody i mean maybe that gives us a fighting chance okay i don't know why he left his his his home but whatever that's on him 4v2 come on boys we have to all storm the fort together we got it good board all right here we go we gotta get sneaky with it where the fudge am i get sneaky get sneaky with there i just have to wait for my friends to distract that it's not working all right friends oh god if only i had gotten up come on boys pack them all at once god i don't know and and these guys just keep blindly running at them like might as well have what led just me as a zombie you know like well maybe if we just keep running right at him god oh oh i don't know what you did buddy but let's go oh my god will you jump are you kidding jesus christ would you it's okay i'm not gonna be a zombie this time so not my problem now look i'm gonna learn from what they did and i'm not gonna do that so the zombies can have fun you know i'm considerate like that all right so let's find somewhere else to go why don't we do they have little they have little portals right there okay i think he's like right above me oh jesus oh jesus he's right behind me got him how do i get out of here i'm not i don't have portals

play the game now let's go who am i kidding i'm a degenerate baby yeah feel my wrath nerds your boner's got him okay just double checking for posterity's sake this dead body like goes through the oh right there there he was come on you pull things there's still one more though watch for the sneaky sneaky snake you never know where they're gonna be good try good try i only have so many shotgun shots left i should probably be a little more sparing with that thanks thank you i just keep getting freaking wait what i'm tired of getting some assists you know what i'm saying now i know this guy is just waiting for the perfect opportunity below us to surprise us but will you guys give me one kill that's all i'm asking thank you thank you appreciate you all come on you cowards yeah how's it feel huh do i feel like a terrible person yeah but you know what i had to endure around to this and now you have to endure a round of this yeah i know where you're coming from uh huh i just wanted glory for myself i know you're down there you better watch out you better not cry i was reloading but i still got the kill collection agency i'm a degenerate okay yeah i know you're in there come on he's just waiting for me to look away [Music] clever girl yeah look at that fragtastic i won do i feel good no god just hopes i'm not infected suck and they put me in the boner place okay i have to get to them before they're able to set up it's the only way see this is perfect we got one okay but they're just setting up over there now little boners man there's only one of them but that's all it takes all right yeah 3v3 let's go boys we gotta storm him at once here we go anybody with me god you gotta be boys they just they just don't god they would make terrible zombies they actually have no ideas they don't realize hey guys what if we swarm them where's part two is there there's two other people somewhere oh and i just happen to know where that somewhere is i think he saw me [Music] pretty sure he saw him okay he's literally the last one he's what he's here i go here i go oh this is gonna be sick guys go i have him distract you guys make me sick you you guys aren't even attacking oh get get out of my life there's there's five of us thank god you know maybe this this mode isn't it's not the best it's just it raises my blood pressure man god his thing launches i swear to god mine doesn't launch mine's broken they gave me a faulty baseball bat i don't know how that works okay i think that game would be a lot more fun in a custom game with like rules set up for instance if we played that map it would be like you can play that map but you can't go to that cheese spot you know because i think it would work best you know like constantly on the run or whatever still fun though oh and also if you uh download the game and then that bugs referral code we jtpc thanks [Music] [Music] you
