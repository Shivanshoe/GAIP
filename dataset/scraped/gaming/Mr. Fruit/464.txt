[Music] yo go get go look he doesn't miss he doesn't miss oh my god okay i got it i got it find the enemy oh my god i just pooped on those kids and i don't know how to feel about this gum but it's new heidi hope everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 beyond light now i know what you're thinking ah what is that well this my friends is a mr fruit in his grinding natural habitat most importantly though you're probably like what are those well i just got some i got some uggs bro some space uggs what do you got against it huh don't make it weird that's right ladies and gentlemen destiny tube young light has released so that means it's time for some new content because that means new exotics and more to follow we're going to be starting out today's video with the brand new no time to explain exotic pulse rifle currently i also have the exotic duality shotgun but we'll be looking at that in the next video so stay tuned that's right the no time to explain which just looks like the stranger rifle we all knew and loved but was also supposed to be the fate of all fools in d1 it's it's confusing but here it is an old score if you're curious the way you get this is by completing the story mission and i think the stranger just gives it to you so let's check out what we're working with here we've got well actually let's no take it back rewind it because the the the intrinsic trait is rewind again [Applause] precision shots and shot against combatants slowed or frozen by stasis will return to the magazine we also have footed barrel for increased handling speed and stability accurized rounds for increased range it's trade time slip at 10 stacks of rewind again a small portal will open shooting bullets from an alternate timeline version of this weapon precision hits extend the portal's duration that's right we got two guns one from a parallel universe that sounds freaking sick and best of all it probably has better aim than i do and fill out a trigger system holding down the trigger we'll fight this weapon to fall out so you guys know us we're going to be taking it into pvp activating this perk in pve is actually pretty easy and helps a lot with single person dps you know which is great but now that's a question of can we can we recreate that in pvp in fear not i'll uh i guess i'll throw on my usual shindig you know what i'm saying oh yeah much better much better that also means of course we have the brand new darkness subclass behemoth i haven't unlocked any of the aspects or anything yet hoping to do that soon but we're still going to use it guitar well i wanted to go to orbit so joke's on you bunji it has been a minute so let's see what do we want to go with here i'm thinking we hit up control first yeah welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lovely earth destination i don't know yeah bannerfall of course of course all right let me sit up for this it's like that gamer meme where he's in the seat reclining back and that's like oh gamer timing sits forward that's me right now i'm sitting forward i need to get precision shots i need to try not to get head shotted by sniper oh i'm stuck in stasis what the fudge i can't really so this is gonna be a thing now huh how did they even hit me what okay okay looks like they want to make this a little difficult on me but if i was able to grenade one of them that would help stack up my perk here even faster but that's fine it's you know i didn't want to do that uh he's one shot oh don't know why you came back but thank you very much now you'll see there bottom left rewind again times two good news those stacks don't disappear unless you die so don't die oh i just need two more head shots stay alive stay alive and then i'm gonna have double primaries baby literally i got no you know what i'm saying i got another gat with me oh okay did like 12 damage or something hold on hold on okay it's doing like 11 so it's like 33 damage a shot oh okay little dude my little guy out here rocking it uh i'll have to like put it in slow mo or something i think it does a three burst just like i do except it's about a third of the damage as far as i could tell which means it would do 33 which is one precision shot for me if i do the math uh does that reduce time to kill if i were to hit headshots every time i'm so glad you asked because i don't know the answer oh my god he's got one too awkward because i was trying to throw a grenade to slow him and then i didn't have one and then i was just you know out there holding the wiener looking like a buffoon with my pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground turns oh my god i'm nuts i got five stacks i'm trying to live do not grenade me please no granada no granada we do not appreciate the granadas here um i think this dude's rolling up on me he is you'll get stasis it it it that did not go according to plan and unfortunately all my stacks are gone hey hi how are you buddy good to see you oh my god wait what why is he behind me oh but i got a gap with me yo go get go look he doesn't miss he doesn't miss bro you're nuts but he's gone short-lived but fun nonetheless now check this out that really that doesn't okay the melee is pretty hard to use i would say it takes a while to wind up um has a pretty long cooldown granted i guess i should just get better strength and the tracking is actually poor if we want to compare it to literally every other titan melee ever uh it's like it doesn't exist practically so very hard and if you miss with it it's not refunded that's it that's all you get but we got rewind again times eight two more and your boy's good to go well i gotta i got a second guy i got a second guess oh my god my second oh shoot though super charged all right we get to see how this performs i genuinely don't know how this is gonna go i'm a little afraid i'm gonna be honest yeah you like that i'm using oh my god wait he's me but i'm him bringing bob oh he's frozen get destroyed wait what why do we trade i froze him what just happened honestly don't really think it's gonna be a great pvp super if i'm being honest because it's like kind of just a scuff striker now i do believe there's an aspect i can get which is what i'm trying to do where you can consume it and get an overshield or like a super overshield or something instead now that i could see that coming in quite handy for pvp but otherwise you know i'm not i ain't writing home about it okay times five times five i'm hurting i'm hurting no thank you sir keep keep shooting what what why'd you spawn behind me why are they behind me what this is a new development why who hurt you why are you like this my anus dude what happened to sniper flinch well you know the good old halo days where you know if i hit you in sniper it it takes you out of scope those are the good days you know good old days back in my day all right you know what we're ate it's time skirt booze okay that could not have gone worse i think it's time i played the objective though i know hold on i'm checking my temperature oh no no i don't have a fever i know surprising you would think i would okay stasis oh did he come down from below no he didn't the heck oh my get me out of here oh let it stasis let it stasis oh my god he's coming for me your super so much cooler than mine but i'm not mad about it anyway except that kind of em did they get this little like little like wizard staff go around shooting stasis magic and then mine's just like haha i'm striker but i'm not saying what why why why because i rap about oh i'm doing my darn just out here kind of sort of and i've only been using the no time to explain except for one time i equipped the shotgun in mind you did zero damage so for all intents purposes you know all i've been using is this thing okay did i get my gun buddy i'm one off i'm one off i just need one more precision chop there we go go gum buddy yes he doesn't miss hit or miss my dude will all [Music] my death teammate is quite literally on your hands because your hands are what killed me bro punched him he was pissed oh i got this again though where am i going boom freaking boom okay friggin oh missed hold on freaking bow okay bob get frozen nope freaking bow oh you're dead okay okay maybe you know it's i'm i'm as cold as ice i'm willing to track her oh my god nothing hits fudge i mean i mean i'll say this as long as i don't use the right click honestly it seems kind of decent wait a minute we're like omega coming back wait a second home there's no way right no way we come back from this right guys no way boom oh my god i didn't kill yo nobody died nobody died nobody die oh wow we were like actually kind of doing something there um saying something all right so as long as i don't right click in my super it freezes people but it doesn't it doesn't seem to do much damage so while that's like cool and dandy and you know maybe in a large group that's a good idea but otherwise just left click it uses less energy and then it's essentially just cold striker titan you know like burr i'm cold well i think it's time for our patented rumble test i'm just gonna do clash because it's the night of the release so you know i gotta ask myself who's playing rumble right now if anybody nothing ventured nothing gained as i've always said the dead glyphs i was gonna make a a joke about dead cliffs and my content but i think i already did that i don't have to i don't have to make that joke let's let's be real you guys do it for me appreciate you guys now we got to go to the sniper lane but we're not sniping we're using no time to explain and i could explain to you why we're doing that but you guessed it i don't have time to explain why i don't have time to explain and that's a kill um shots are kind of all over the place right now i'm going to be honest with you stasis missed i'm nuts and somehow oh my god after all this i only have three stacks get destroyed okay i don't know why i used my melee though not bad not bad not bad we gotta kill we gotta kill you know what i'm saying so realistically you gotta kind of already be doing positive on life you know you're probably looking at least two kills more or less unless you can get some stasis slow but the only way you're gonna do that is if your opponent does the swelling or stasis scene or your grenade just pops off what the fudge i thought i had a team silly me i should have known better a team help me don't oh my god don't make me laugh hold up that's a quick dub that's a quick time get out of my way sorry compose yourself mr fruit my bad my bad okay i'm about to have a mini me come on i just need i just need three headshots oh my god oh why are they spawning here why why why must preserve my time seven i must preserve my time serving oh my god okay all right all right and there's a guy over here i'm gonna get it here i'm gonna i'm going to oh my god okay i got it i got it find the enemy let my mini me do many me think oh my god he's almost dead come on auto aim baby ottawa him computer's way better than i am ah yeah got a little ahead of myself there what are you gonna do it does auto aim but it has a slower rate of fire and i don't do that much damage it doesn't let you 1v4 it lets you ape like a man myself normally likes to do just not just not verbal just not quite as much as i would normally like to okay he's flowed which doesn't mean anything because i'm done maybe the other stasis grenades haven't unlocked me but if i were to get there you know maybe those are uh oh you want a glacial quake me boom why did that do like no damage what the i think he did negative damage that boy come here yeah screw you and your fun we don't allow any of that around here you kidding me got my fists nice damage there he's got a little rift and guess what you're giving me free stacks my boy i'm about to rewind time on you i'm going into that hyperbolic time chamber boy with this and you know what i'm doing i'm training so hard i get another gun look at this gun gun that's right double well the problem is it's even more scuff striker because the initial as far as i can tell pull or like activation doesn't even do damage you know like it's oh my god i just pooped on those kids it doesn't do any damage so like i can't slam immediately like i have to plan it but then also it's almost all long range it's just like what i'm out of here bro what is like the whole squad up there i don't know i'm out um okay i mean i don't know what that was but sure what's this guy got oh my god oh my god imagine hitting shots couldn't be me he's invisible somewhere oh he's got a little friend ah come on say hello to my little friend huh he's still sitting there invisible yeah with his little sword that is so embarrassing oh my god get gobbled on bro it's one of those perks where it's like win harder and you're just gonna lose the same amount you know like it doesn't help you start winning it's just if you're already winning you can just kind of push that otherwise it's not doing much are you kidding me oh i got a mini me though wait but not for long how did i have a mini-me this whole time the heck i don't know but it was gone just like that and yeah boy's dead again and i don't know how to feel about this gun but it's new i mean i had a bad super but at least mine wasn't that bad am i right i'm right time six here we go many me about to turn online let me spread my wings and fly oop somebody just oh uh oh uh oh oh oh back it on up back it on up we got a glacial dude over here whoa whoa sure see santa assist yeah this is the content you can't go oh my god i don't know i'm just throwing names at this point i don't know great barriers fly backwards oh my god here he comes you kidding me just like budget striker my mom's like no honey we have stryker at home and that's what it is you know it's like you you tried to duct tape striker together and then to preserve it you put it in the freezer voila behemoth but again you know i'll try and reserve judgment i almost got a mini-me i got a mini me here we go y'all say hello to my mini me why do i bother you know wait no no but i just yeah yeah see that like i don't think that does like any damage really so i just got to do this but well it's not that i perform poorly at any moment just you know my team couldn't quite keep up if you've been waiting for the census you know what do i think of this pulse rifle overall well in pvp in pve i actually really like it in pvp at least you can activate the perk sometimes which is fun but overall yeah it's nothing crazy i mean it's a good pulse rifle but the trait alone isn't what sets it apart i mean sometimes you get it and sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't it's marginal but it's fun to use and well that's really all that matters so that's mr fruit's official review of no time to explain go ahead and use it you can hit headshots occasionally i mean you're gonna have fun but with that said i wanna thank you all very much for watching like i said we're gonna be doing a video on the exotic shotgun new to be online in our next video so be sure to stay tuned for that and with that said i wanna thank you all very much for watching have yourself fantastic and i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
