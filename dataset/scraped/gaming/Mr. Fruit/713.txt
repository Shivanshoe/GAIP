well we have an interesting listen we're a right just like my channels variety hi oh this podcast is variety with some tangents which no longer become tangents because that's just part of the podcast and so we start with a pretty long tangent I go on quite a bit the problem is if you get me started I wanted my brain I like to learn about how you like to sleep and stuff like that was really interesting cuz we learned of a lot about well one how I died practically but also how we sleep your sleep a lot about sleep memory all that kind of stuff very interesting stuff same stuff I like that combination be sure to look more of that up when you're looking or listening and we're watching the podcast if that interests you we talk about the YouTube algorithm and how it's poo poo poo lately we uh we relish on the glory days that was a lot of fun and we interested in patreon questions and then we talked about how Titans are the worst thing that's needs you now as always there's some deci news we didn't update on the da da dun da da dun coronavirus rod we love you all stay safe but first listen to this podcast we're here we're here that's the intro it's good way to start the podcast yeah I'm getting freaking everybody out that you're sick hey well I am I'm sweet but you're but not that kind of yeah yeah actually well okay I guess we'll stir this off quickly by documenting my medical I feel like that's been like a really well yeah cuz I mean it's funny last episode you mentioned you're like do get sick lot like maybe maybe I'm not that bad like maybe I'm healthy and it's true trade your immune systems but I don't I don't think I was sick at all no you were not sick that's why oh wait no I was just getting over the regular cold I Lake your migraines which mic off one uh that was before my I had I just get lost I had a sore throat but then at the time I had like a stuffy nose and what else did my throat it was right off it was like a common cold but the thing is my congestion from that coal which is two weeks ago I still have I still have to blow my nose in cough that's just annoying it's just like just go like leave it's over dude like I've won all right you just die I want again yeah you're trying to get like a couple stabs in there at the angle jabs do you think you've been over sick over a hundred times in your entire life oh absolutely really easy times just from not even doesn't if you're 25 that's four times a year you're than a dozen it blues like okay wait since I have no other four times a year I think we all know I'm very interested well last year I feel like at some point like I was having a good run uh-huh like the longest period I have it's like seven months nothing yes and then yeah it was towards the end of the year and then sputtered out yeah and so anyway have that cold and I still I just have that like remnants that's the cough I still have it's just it's just enough there that it's just it's just annoying mm-hmm like bro go I still have someone like that sick asthma to left which is really annoying mm-hmm because I've been getting back in the gym but I'm like just like this isn't this difficult like I shouldn't be struggling this much yeah but then this past weekend so I didn't put it in the video for those that watched the video side of the podcast we didn't have three camera setup and I was gonna put at the beginning like yo sorry no three camera setup we literally forgot yeah this one isn't like oh well something something happened with the foot is or like it's just straight up like we didn't have time to edit it was just we would really set this entire thing up as we usually do like literally the tripods the cameras the the frame everything was wood early setup we just didn't press the red button yeah we didn't press record like cleaning the room up is that the crew she goes Rob and I go and that's not it then like like I said Mike that's the video it was not a good rod so I knew something was wrong so I went what and he goes we hit press the record buttons you know why cuz I was bad to say like okay stop recording owes me wit but there's nothing to stop I was like oh my god so that they cast are off and so the reason that wasn't in the video either was because Saturday night I just had an episode and a half is like 6:30 and it's in the morning at night 6:30 at night but the day's going fine we did Jamie everything and about like six hurt and I can just start getting this headache and just like kind of hard to focus we were like watching something in the theatre whatever I can't I think we were starting to try to watch like altered carbon season - and I said that so you're talking about yeah and so my head can't hurt I just like a cane I can't shake this I'm just gonna go to bed even though it's like at that time I was like 7:30 oh geez so I'm gonna go lie in bed see I feel and maybe just try and sleep this off whatever it where do you get your headaches like is it here it was like a little to the left of the front of my brain or that's what it felt like the cerebellum you know I have no idea yeah no that's the only reason why no cerebellum is from power with frontal cortex it was a near that I think that's I mean it says front toll I just pushed my glasses really he's not wearing glasses so what uh freaking ham sammich alright so I was in bed and trying to just look at my phone or something I'm just gonna get to bed couldn't let's try to leave my phone's like it I can't do it it's gonna make my like lights and yeah just now I'm just going to pin it's like 8 o'clock Leslie I can't do anything else I just wake up at 5:00 so I go to sleep but then I also kind of give I told Claire I was like hey just a fair warning I might wake up nauseous or something at some point during the night cuz I felt this feeling before uh-huh and the last time I felt this I woke up with projectile vomit and diarrhea so I was like I was just praying ability it's a good quirk hey that's a sick quark right really had a lot role on that one so I was like she's like please don't like let me just sleep through this I'm just go to bed and so I get my fan on I'm in my bed it's nice cool I'm comfy my head hurts a little bit I pull up on YouTube fly me to the moon by Frank Sinatra but it's in another room and it's raining that's what early the title the video it's great are you serious have you heard of this trend no blue have you heard of it well raining well like this like this hole it's like this X song but it's in the next room or it's like in a concert hall next to you okay what the rating thing has been a thing since Rainey moved I feel like that yeah but it's just a combination so but like it's not the song playing with rainy but it's a song playing in another room on top of rain yeah so it sounds like oh and then like so the reason I do it too is it's like a nice yeah we found that is different than like well like it's like it sounds like we're right here and someone's like there's a party over there like Frank is playing in that room see like I've heard I've heard of that but like but mean like like Frank Sinatra playing in the other room while your parents fight in the other room and are fighting over a divorce like that's like I've seen those but this one was relaxed oh yeah I know that's like actually think yeah so it's playing it and it just sounds like and it just sounds like so the thing I do is I have this I don't know how I would say it this space in my head that I go to when I try and sleep it's like this very interesting person well this is like a thing people do uh-huh because I've read a whole bunch like there are people who would early can like like when they hit the bed 6 seconds they're all asleep yeah that's weird and so a lot of it is like mental training some of it like a good practice I've tried and it kind of helps if when you're laying in bed just think about you're falling like you're sinking into your bed and you'll notice you're next a little tense you like loosen your neck and then like your arms kind of go limp and then you like fully let go your muscles and then you just kind of kind of just imagine you're like ah in the end well see I can't do that because if I'm like okay linking in my birthday present I'm like thinking I'm trying to sleep but now my brain is like thinking thinking exactly like Rob Rob said just you you it's like what you call it it's a like you spin something up it doesn't stop it keeps going and I'm with that and it works for me now I'm thinking about ah now I need to sleep how am i breathing now am I not relaxing oh yeah now I'm just like [ __ ] it and you gotta work you gotta work on that's my ADHD or just that just fix your depression just fix it I don't do that you have to read up on about it's really interesting oh that's why I like a sleep deprivation chamber like you were talking about is super interesting Liam and it terrifies me like I sound sick no scared that no it's terrifying to me because we'll go over later but I I go off the rails when I'm low on sleep and accidentally imagine how far I could go more off the rails yeah I know that's why what we'll talk about okay I know that's why some people are like there's like two spectrums like me where my best sounds awesome and some people like please no yeah anything but so anyway it's like kind of so like have you heard of the people like the mental it's like the memory Olympics or whatever they would have like tournaments and competitions for memory I've heard about this no have you heard about it blue recite PI and stuff like that it'll be stuff like that where it'll have like stages and stuff and it'll be like it won't be recite PI they'll give you like five sheets and on each sheet there's a hundred unique numbers and so that's 500 unique numbers whether it's like 832 it might be it might be like 832 107 8 6 14 just so like 500 separate numbers right we'll give that to you give you like 5 minutes take it back but ok recite it from start to finish and people will just be like 8 1406 and they'll go through it or like somebody will take a card deck and shuffle it shuffle it and like show it to you once for like 30 seconds or something put it away and then they can tell you they can flip it over like the two of diamonds Jack of Hearts seven of spades and they'll go through this entire deck and that's when the mob boss Wow we seen you then oh they do these crazy mental gymnastics for this memory stuff and so the way people do this they talk like the the people at these tournaments huh it's like they're training the other training and they've I forget the exact word they say but it's visualizing memory and so the way they do it is they associate every memory with some event person thing whatever they literally create a story in their mind visually that they walk through so like number eight would be like my mom and then like one oh that's the thing you have to disassociate it and make it strange something like so much would ever happen a is lying and then 106 is a car hits the lion or something like yeah it would be like 8 8 of spades spades Kevin Spacey poker southern belle poker blackjack I'm playing blackjack 106 or whatever it like and and then to what they'll also do is they already have numbers like what are like 1 to them is like Kim Kardashian so they think okay I see Kim Kardashian where is she next number she's in Egypt Kim Kardashian is in Egypt flip the next one and then now they're like doing a thing okay number 17 things Kim Kardashian is in Egypt drinking blood next one naked next one like with and then while a key and but the thing too is they build it like a maze almost in their mind and so when then we go to recite it they would have visualized themselves okay I'm in Egypt there's Kim Kardashian she's drinking her blood you walk you walk past her and you go through this whole memory thing you've dated and so that's how they're like Katy Perry okay so that's 17 she's drinking blood and just ghosts this whole thing and they can just create these spaces that they think of go right in and that's how to remember everything well I would do that with like like memorizing dates and like like a test or something like 1776 was the day we gained our Declaration of Independence or whatever then 1776 there are 76 people signing the Declaration of Independence that's not truly what happened but that's a way I would try and remember it yeah so I forget the exact reason why this works so well but the one thing to talk about is you have to disassociate it from reality otherwise like it'll really mess with you if your memories are normal so you're like that's my mom why should it ask my mom like because apparently it just messes with you so it needs to be stuff that's just wild like Nevers gonna happen or just really strange or like a series of events together that just make no sense because the more bizarre - the more likely you are to remember it it's like that's my mom watching TV or it's Kim Kardashian Tunisia drinking blood yeah something like that so which one is easier to remember immediately especially if you just need to resize it that mmm I could recite it just now and you yeah exactly so because like for me right now I can picture it I can picture Kim Kardashian in Egypt drinking blood naked naked but like that's immediate I could already like you know see that and for them that's half of it and the other half is remembering what you assign but it's literally just like assigning one the number one to red the color red something like that something and then you just do this in their sleep or like no they just train and that's crazy they're able to do some crazy stuff like it's crazy what we're actually capable of when we do something like that cuz we think like me my memory sucks but I guess if I were to go through something like this like training because there was a guy who did a whole story I forget where it is he might have written a book about it but he did that and he like came to this competition was like I don't get it how do you do this and I think for a year he was like tutelage and in a year he placed like fifth in the competition so he went and then had someone trained him and he did this visual memory that's cool and it doesn't like your form it's because when you think of that it's like a photographic memory you're like no you're not born with it's just you can train yeah so anyway the reason I that up is because it's very similar to what some people do with like sleeping or certain spaces so for me I have this place in my mind that I go to when I listen to this song when I go to sleep like when you go to this place do you physically like see yourself and like you're in a place yeah like my eyes are closed and I imagine myself it's on a porch and looking at at the porch it's dark I can see the ring but there's nothing else because the details don't matter it's like black beyond the porch but it's not scary but there's a ring near the rain I see the rain behind me there's a door there's two windows shutters it's like a white like a southern kind of yeah plantation I'm on the porch I'm leaning on the porch are you rocking in a chair nope I'm just out there Ellen I mean I think I'm actually out there smoking a cigarette really yeah which Wow I've never done that yeah but for some reason like just this mood that he's like I just think it's a war but I think of like the noir like like 40 20 yes like so I mean I don't do that I don't suggest inner does ability in this thing I'm sitting there like smoking mmm the door behind me is creaked open just a little bit light speaking out and then the windows the orange light is like like being like coming out yeah and I can vaguely see shapes and people moving in the house in the house if I look back like a triangle walks by the mirror and then I hear like faint people just kind of talking but then I hear the Frank music as if it's plain in that room and everyone's in that room uh-huh okay see now you're going so far deep and you just lost me two minutes ago because I'm already thinking about wow you were that one time in high school and I look stupid yeah I was on the anyway I'm in the porch and I hear the Frank Sinatra song and that's just serene and then exhale mostly but do so do you go from that to a dream like what how does fall sleep so you don't dream well I mean dreams everyone dreams so I'm degree I do you it just depends on when you wake up and your sleep cycle usually if you remember your dreams so but like what I'm at so like you're in that place right and once you fall asleep I'm not dreaming lose that place now I don't know but I I can't remember dreaming that specifically that's it I mean this sounds incredible but it also sounds like it doesn't exactly is exactly suited for every single brain not sure I would I would love for that but my mind is pretty much always constantly racing so if I were to think about that situation as soon as I'm done with that whole simulation I'd be like why did I just think about that and like yeah exactly it's like not falling asleep and now I'm just fixated on lay eyes well for me the trick is it's an hour loop so the song just could loops over and over it's like chill hop it's like so if I start to lose it okay yeah so if I start to lose it a little bit blimey it'll start over and then I can repay to myself I can like refocus it's fly me to the moon like the specifics so on youtube if you look up you want really to the moon brainy but but it's in another room and it's raining I think that's like literally the title that's an hour we need to go to the comment section and be like mr. fruit I'm here mr. food I mean it might not work forever but I'm saying like you should look into this whole menu like even now my mind is like oh this reminds me of Jessica only child illinois-chicago classmate kim jinwoo he's your cousin now like well now I'm not asleep and now I'm seeing in a song my face well anyway this but so that's why when we brought up to sleep deprecated what is it wait a minute what oh wait yeah the whole point is I'm talking about my young [ __ ] you're sick so anyway this is why this works for you but doesn't work for me wrong because this is the podcast like what else do you expect at this point but anyway so I'm sick I'm listening to this I fall asleep I'm like okay we got this mm-hmm cue 50 minutes later I wake up sweats and I just like go like babe I'm here because I thought it was late I'd only been asleep like 40 minutes and I'm like yeah you're trash she's like on her phone I'm here yeah you gotta get a trash can so she goes he a trash can like I am bless her heart I'm about to puke like same thing I feel like I got the bathroom he's a saint mm-hmm and puts you over the toilet she pulls your ponytail back yeah like she's like stroking my bad like it's fine she brings that stuff and I'm just sitting there I have like the chills shakes but I'm like a hot flash like I'm just going through it all I'm nauseous and so it's a long night and at one point it was so bad we urge incur wasn't open so the only other option was to go to the ER and they almost went but I just got through it enough to finally get back to sleep mm-hmm wake up next morning feeling better I'm like thank God okay I think it's gone what time is it like I slept in a lot like 10:00 a.m. I slept something normal sleeper all right well I mean I went to bed at 8:00 yeah I think so even with some of the stuff is somewhere around 12 hours or something yeah so wake up and we all right I'm feeling okay get out of bed I was like I gotta get the podcast out Sunday morning mm-hmm I got to get the video together because I was gonna do it the night before but obviously hole then so I I started compiling it sitting at my desk and sure enough like all the symptoms just start like pop out like the nausea dizziness the headache that's all coming back something oh Jesus so I'm like literally like in premiere like just just come like we render in and out like every every cave dude yeah it's like you press Kane's like so needless to say I barely got it out but I did that's why I forgot to put like hey this is why this and then there was something else I didn't put in all this stuff is just like it's a miracle got up I did that went right back in the bed they got like yeah well so I was like I'm just gonna lie down like this is it's got a pass and it's getting right back to how was the night before so I was like I'm over this like let's go to Urgent Care so you can figure out what the fudge is goes like right over there right yeah I've urged can really close do we go there planned on it by the way um yeah and they do a whole bunch of tests it's not the flu or anything because the symptoms kind of looked like the flu or food poisoning did they did they ask you if you've been to whoo-hah anything like that no I mean none of the symptoms I was even presenting are like the coronavirus you would even look at yeah so they did those tests the big thing was like as nauseous as I was I never puked and I wish to God I did there's like that point of Naja where you just like get it over with yes unless it's like you don't have anything in your stomach and that's your let you throw it bile like that's the worst part but when you're just nauseous I think it's to the point where it's like I know I'll probably feel better if I just throw up so just just do it you can get it over with but it never happens and then I felt like I had to go to the bathroom really bad and have like diarrhea yeah hot snakes nothing and those are like the two big things that we're missing from either food poisoning or flu yeah and then they tested all that stuff it wasn't that apparently they thought it was too because it's rare to get migraine episodes back-to-back but think god it was thought it was just two migraine episodes back-to-back and people present symptoms differently I guess they gave me a butt shot never gotten a butt shot before okay her why in the but there was specifically that one it was supposedly you put it into muscle and I guess like the button that's the best part to do it if you want to get straighten in the muscle I mean I do have a lot of muscle on my butt cuz then there was another drug I could have taken but you have to do like fat and there's like you either do like the bottom of your stomach I guess or like the like something on your arm I don't know why yeah but so I did the butt shot and I the thing is a gimme shot I don't care I'll take it needle I just don't look at it that's the key you just like but the little pinch I know that that sucks but especially at that time I was like I'll take anything if it means I'm gonna feel better mm-hmm but apparently where was watching and the dude was like he put it in as okay but then he was having trouble getting it all in or something and so then I was like aha oh it was like 20 seconds is this like a thick needle or like I don't know I didn't look that's my thing I just don't look and I do whatever you gotta do I'm just not gonna look I just don't and then he comes out and he's like he likes makes me hold this thing my butt is bleeding right now and he puts a band-aid on sorry you can go and sit and I go to sit just like sir just like sharp pain in my butt I don't have everyone a shot but it went away in like a minute and then I never felt anything after that hmm what was that what was it they injected you with toradol I think torrid something like that it's apparently like a dial Omega anti-inflammatory like motrin or motrin or motrin or motrin omelette I supposed to make your brain like you like not swell or like it don't ask me exactly what but it's supposed to help with pretty much every sentiment at me and it worked yeah I mean you haven't had an episode okay I'm not gonna ask you hey have you an episode because every time I ask you hey happens it has this happen let it happen yes thanks dude I'm gonna wake up tonight just and the thing - the worst part about it is just the anxiety cuz like that night even after getting the shot mm-hmm kind of feeling like twinges and I was like I go to sleep I know I'm just gonna wake up in an hour and it's gonna be horrible so there's that anxiety like I don't want it like do you know you're like me and blue every night we're like ah yeah no way we're gonna be able to sleep welcome to our natural state but then I turn on Frank that's cool that's super quick like I turned on Dave Chappelle last night I need like background noise I like to have a good time I be on I like the white noise on my fan OC but that's another like if I really good take well you know I mean I have like us i but yeah it's a ceiling fan but then I have the other plug-in paint interesting for me is personally just white noise in general focusing on white noise usually helps a little bit yeah but but it has to be only white noise cuz if I hear anything like in on the process for going to sleep I'm awake again like what like what soon as I hit sleep as soon as I hit sleep I'm out eight hours ten hours easy but it's getting on the way like it's like you're at like a hundred like you're like it's like downloading like a [ __ ] 10 gigabyte game and you write 9.8 and it's like oh there's a oh I just heard a door open well zero percent no it's like a youtube processing of video just sticks at 95% you like I'm almost there I'm almost there and then uploader yeah all right let's start again yeah okay yeah I know what you're talking about I'm the same way like if I can get to sleep that's that's pretty much it I'm normally that's it I'll wake up eight hours SIA yeah I need like what's like white noise to me I always thought white noise was like remember that scary movie that came out called white noise and it was like they were trying to contact goes through like static oh that's static okay so that's not white noise I was always like so white noise is literally like sounds that you don't even notice it's like the fan when you're playing video game something like your fan on your room or like the sound of like cards on the freeway outside of your house like if you're like kind of close to a freeway and they just kind of like that drone that you already like but you don't notice until like you're actually like oh yeah here until you like fixated on that noise yeah so like hearing my fan is just and I mean I know it's my fan but it's like I always hear it so it's not like a sound that's like intrusive I don't know if you can hear this but this is this is like the default white noise you're thinking about which is just like that I love that really yeah that helps you sleep well that's music to my ears oh my god see okay but maybe like I only like TV white noise then or something cuz like when Sydney and I like slept my roommate had a clock and like on the room and if we were and everything was off yeah but that's why I get that might be crazy yeah I can't do no noise so that's not white noise no but if you know if you're like that is white noise if I'm like but you notice it yeah I'm fixated on yeah like so that's not white noise so white noise is something you want in the background but you don't fixate on it look okay I mean for a lot of people like white noise can be having a TV on and just white noise like maybe it's ideally - it's something you've already seen so just like reruns of office or something yeah so just like exactly it's an seitan but it's not something you naturally are just like oh my god it's taking all my attention away yeah like the like that clock that would do it from well and then I never ever slept with sounds or anything until Guardian con that one year when we share a room together and I would literally go in the room and there was a monsoon going on like there was a sea that's the worst if I'm in a room if I'm and I'm in a house with somebody who snores I won't sleep I will not sleep and like I ain't got some white noise but it got so bad at twitchcon with shark because shark needed a place to stay and I was like shark I got a room dude I was like you're in and like we like shared a bed together and I go to bed and he falls asleep before me and it's just literally like oh like just the loudest snoring I've ever heard I had to go sleep in the bathtub because I was like I am NOT girl'd up like I am not gonna be able to sleep because all I will [ __ ] think about the whole time is how I want to punch shark in the face and then like sometimes like I would get so over I'm not kidding I I'm sorry shark if you're listening but I'm like I'd be sleeping that I push it really hard wake up you kind of like wake up stabbed I got three minutes I got three minutes here but now because I'm like alright you got three minutes right I've gotta fall asleep here we can see it's checked as a policy and they're like [ __ ] fine ah so like would snoring in like nah I can't like that's the one thing that if there's going on I can't sleep at all I can't sleep until we could do this ad break either okay guys look

live in which you've gotten that add all of you what is this world that we live in it's like some youtube thing like it's one of those like because I like to watch YouTube videos when I sleep - and it's like one of those ads that's like five minutes long but it's like some dude talking very calmly to you so you end up just listening to an ad for five minutes here's an idea with some of the sleeping problems you guys have there's a lot you can do to combat it like one of them is like no screen time an hour before you go to sleep and then another one is like if you can but like the other things like if you can separate like the only thing you do in your bed is sleep like you don't stay there well okay I mean - exactly but like I've tried yeah I'm sure you have but I the the what probably the thing that has helped the most is separating where I sleep from our work yeah I was gonna say like separate that said that has helped me sleep longer through like when I fall asleep I try everything I've got like melatonin I've uh I've put my I put my phone in a different room so like I just go to sleep when I my room was only my sleep room yes he blues done them all I he knows all about my computers are right there now for me like that's why i hated the Doorn because it was like time to go to bed all right climb up three feet and I'm there yeah I just Katie the same like I'm right there so I just never feel cooled out fro by screwed yeah and so it never feels like a flip of a switch it's not like okay it's bedtime mm-hm like when I go into my bedroom now it's against bedtime yeah I sleep here I also did an experiment High School where when I went to bed I play jazz no vocals just like jazz yeah smooth jazz and stuff and you'll just play that when I go to sleep I would never listen to jazz otherwise and soon enough quicker and quicker I would I started to hear jazz nice smooth jazz and I'd go to sleep but then it became a problem that I like jazz so then I would hear jazz and I would kind of start to get like sleepy like in the middle of day cuz I like started using myself yeah that's called conditioning that's it but I was like I like Janis too much see work see and everyone's like it please like really call music but then like if I like a song I'm like oh this is a banger because I'm like into the song you like jam and that's like okay now we're gonna bring it to the dipper deprivation tank that's why those things really scare me because I'm in a one complete darkness like what we should say but the whole reason this got brought up is because well I just messaged Robin nowhere but I want us to do and we'll talk about on the podcast maybe we'll film it or something and then Bluth wants to he can do it his as well down in San Antonio made me wait for Corona a little bit it's um but do this if you want and then we talked about our experience I wanted one do the deprivation tank and then I also want to do cryotherapy that sweet I'm about a crybaby I'm really about that and the reason is I've just heard so many different things from people who are like it's either love or hate and it's like all in like it's the greatest I've ever done or like I wouldn't do it again deprivation tank for those that don't know playing it you go into a century like a little capsule like a pollen looks like it's helm agachi like a giant Tamagotchi that like opens it's like it's like rat it's just landed on earth yeah except his drop pod is full of them looks like at least high water containing a lot of salt so it's very buoyant the whole point is you go in it's filled pretty high with this really salty water and there might be some other stuff in it everybody knows but you go in there and then they close it and there's no light in there it's just black dark and then you lie there in the water and you float and you just float and because of the buoyancy you don't have to do anything you just lie like you're floating on top so you can't see you can't technically done it really any orientation you can't touch anything you can't see loading you forget which ways up down yes you're just feels like you're just floating in space no sense of like yeah I think it's technically called the sensory deprivation tank yeah and so you go there and it's usually like it there's probably times like thirty minutes but I know like typically it's like an hour use either for an hour and that's your sense so much fun even though that sounds terrifying to me because then it's like I'm in a dark place and then you're not supposed to sleep right like they don't I don't know they don't well I've heard they don't want you to sleep while you do sleep like the tank cuz then like you lose like what the experience of it well I mean same like a massage try not to be yeah so like I just imagine I just be sitting in a dark room with my thoughts I don't like that like that freaks me out because I'm like I can I like they say you can hear like your own like heartbeat you can hear like blood flow and they can hear all this well I don't know about that that's I know that happens when you're in complete soundproof room like there's some rooms for that like are nearly soundproof I don't know if there's any more here but I know there's like a college for instance that goes and that's the quietest place on earth that you go in there and it's so quiet you hear your heartbeat you hear blog you have your heart yeah you'll start to hear your blood like it's just that freaky yeah that one might drive me crazy but like just say I just it freaks me out but like I can see how you think it's cool because of your whole Frank like that I [ __ ] those only drives you crazy if you're unaware of what's happening and you're because there's some places that people I can only say for like 15 minutes and it's like a sound chamber where like you it's you literally like there's literally no there's not even why you noise and you can hear everything you could hear your blood moving here like and people are like oh I can't do this but like people who stay in they're up for a long time are always people who are aware like oh that's my blood moving yeah maybe it's ELPS to just know but I think the cryotherapy one is super sick like I would love to try that so that I would love to do the deprivation tank heyyyyyy but that's why I would hate to the cryotherapy was that cuz everyone's like oh yeah I gets mad cold and I hate being see I like the cold but once it gets to a certain degree then I am extremely uncomfortable see I hate the cold unless I'm like having my body recovered like one of my favorite things I used to do when I was playing soccer was icy ice baths I loved I spats I hate it I spaz the second I got into them but like two or three minutes in and all that kinda like I love how it makes me feel well that's like when I tried cold showers that's different dirty rough you're free I I could i only last about a month even then I was impressed I tried one time because you told me to try that well the thing is you got one shower you got a commit you get cuz like the moment to you go back to another one because the thing is you kind of forget what a normal shower is like this is just my life now yeah but the moment you get it you're like what am i doing like I can't I can't go back well I didn't like the problem is two is when you do a cold shower you're not supposed to just we're supposed to like take a shower you're supposed to be nice with it and no I can't do that as well see so the thing that I did that helped was what you have to do is you have to sit there and then be mindful like the well the thing I like about a cold shower is you can't think about anything except I am cold like you get in there and it's just like Jesus Christ get me out of here I am freezing so then all I have to do is what you do is you try and quickly do the shower part you know wash yourself but then the other part is okay now control your breathing and you control your breathing when you're doing it and if you're able to do that it helps you can almost like warm yourself up and away and then honestly it just feels really good but cryotherapy I'm kind of with blue like honestly it kind of sounds terrible because apparently just gets like super I don't know it's like negative like 50 degrees yes and I don't know how long it lasts but at the same time [ __ ] yeah but at the same time it's kind of like me with a shot like okay I am I'm trading off this momentary like comfort yeah uncomfortable Ness whatever non to help me yeah to have this payoff later mm-hmm and I could do that yes that's how I go about the gym so I know if okay this is balls cold and I got to be here for a bit but then afterward it might be that whole like oh my god that was the most that was the greatest thing I've ever done well do you do the steam room ever or like the sauna well my gym doesn't have one okay I've done them though see I love steam rooms like like a steam room I try and last like 15 minutes I really try and like push myself is like man this sucks like cuz like I song is great for like the first like seven minutes but then like when you start like sweating a lot dude it sucks but I also like just love the feeling afterwards as I come out to go like while I like going in the steam room and just in through the nose and just control your breathing I've seen Wizards in the steam room bro all people love the sauna when I go into it like a steam room I make it a competition I try and walk in with somebody whose word you're gonna say like KKK wizard no I like trying master a Grand Master I try and like walk in with somebody so I can like all right we got a 1v1 let's go there to King Lionel Angus I'm not kidding you one time I walked in with some of their look like a Gandalf bro and I was like oh man let's go and we got to like 15 minutes dude and I'm dying and he hasn't move and he's just like this like nice close to Zen out just breathing in fully nude Matt may I add he was where he was when I got to do a towel I'm not all the time I wish he did I'm not like over there like just looking at him though but like it's like come on I just don't know I'll never understand that about locker rooms about boomers just cool about walking around locker rooms naked like I'd wish I was just that caught free no it's just easier to put like from the towel like and then I put on my boxers like and the Tallis salon and then I take the towel off you know how it made my boxers I just don't want to like them sorry I just don't want to make the Dyke locker room jealous but am i slightly above a three-meter like my bad but I just never understand that the confidence those old men have I mean they seem to World Wars so I mean [ __ ] well we'll try and figure this out though and at the very least I would love for us to do it yeah we'll try and do some of those we'll get we'll get you their blue well at least get try and get blue we'll find something for you to do at least the deprivation you have to do it yeah you don't have to cry if you don't want but you're doing sebacean well the thing the cry one like that one is gonna be some sort of physical discomfort mm-hmm there's a deprivation tank like there's no it's more so mental yeah there's no real like you don't have to hype yourself up for something so how long can you normally go in a cryo like I don't know I don't that's the one I know less about I know a lot more about the sensory deprivation tank but I've just heard a lot of good things about cryotherapy so I'm like have you have you looked into like tanks around here like others no no I need to okay I'm in yeah if we do it you'll like you guys will know where that'll be don't but you know what else is dope if we actually read are you said ad review again but thank God you stopped me but you didn't I didn't and I'm proud of you thank you and I'm proud of this review from Hedrick Jim de you tried well I mean you leave that dude don't leave any right at the top head remember my thumb Oh head yeah the bottom one is definitely something - yep it's me yeah no head Hedrick and I don't know anyway thanks a Draconis idled much content very spice rated 5 storms because apple podcast isn't ready for us yet much love to these guys and it took me twenty seven episodes to write a review so here it is memes nine okay salt seven damn not very salty on here Ida star wars episode those premenstrual that's probably the entire set up that's five seven funny ten stars nine hey tangents 3738 now after I say it's probably well boys gotta be more than that thanks for making my Sunday just they have much better you're welcome Thank You Hedrick thank you for making our lives that much for listening and rating and to all of those who do rate the podcast we appreciate you to all of our audio listener stands thank you our video watch or stands thank you will have three kam now I have been deciding we might have to move this to my second channel we're gonna see okay that's okay I feel like I might it might start to be yeah pain the other time YouTube just knows now it's like we may be moving Sunday it's like oh god here we go again like prepare [ __ ] here we go again it's like let's see if thieves mean Oh dumb but Oh dump dump don't know though I'm done it's like captain he's like yeah yeah blindsides that's kind of how it is and then that's the YouTube algorithm yeah yeah god that is it so catches on the other side chat or comment section I don't know what really YouTube is it chat or comments I don't know if you say chat I feel like people just think we're alive yeah when we're not maybe one day yeah maybe maybe one day but then but then they're gonna like they're gonna hear all the parts that we always have to end it out you know we're like when we Adam and then when you sit yeah oh my god I can't believe you said well and then like when people like are like oh they cut something out no it's normally Christians computer [ __ ] froze and we had to figure that out like how do we ever mention that on the podcast I don't think so I do my best to like mask it during audio or video I try to but I usually clean up yours too yeah because I'm like screw it like we're just taking this chunk out cuz my computer for whatever reason about every hour and a half it just freezes for like 10 seconds so sometimes we'll just be having a conversation and then just in the recording side I see just nothing for 10 seconds Mike yeah all right well now I got to make this makes it because then it goes from like yeah well and I was thing that Frank show and then it's just like because because then blue can't hear anything because then we're frozen and then blues like with what that was going on yeah or you just and I just really hope that it doesn't happen an important time yeah blues nice too and sometimes he'll just be like yeah whatever well and then like we know where it is because in the audio there's just a big gap it's all there is I like to think we're a little bit better at keeping a conversation going than just 10 seconds of speaking about keeping something go I was gonna let that go for ten seconds speaking about keeping something going I'm really gonna dun-da-da-dun is that what I think oh no I was actually giving up something that we can do very very shortly Oh cuz I'm interested in what you guys think of it and it's kind of like gaming related so pals are we use iris are you in the gaming part weekend are we gonna trials like I mean I mean the question is up to you guys I mean I I mean I've gotta get content but I'm not gonna like play you know what I mean blue are you gonna play trials or just content I'm gonna I'm not gonna play Charles you're not gonna play trials so much before and this is just the same thing just with look I can use their actions now and also get DDoS like I'm or else but I'm not gonna be like I love trials I've played Charles a million times it's the same in same song and dance every single week hey nothing will ever live up though to that triple collateral you know that was sick that was time I was in that game that I feel like that's on stream to I feel like that's just trials are you looking for that one moment mm-hmm that was part of one game and that's sick but that wasn't even my favorite trials my fair trials on was when you did your first ever dream on twitch oh I thought you were gonna make fun of me with my okay - yeah that's my favorite oh yeah well that's number two that was super hype wasn't it yeah your final card yeah where you at your very first stream and then like your I think we lost like on the 7th because we've heard her booth we lost like on the fifth one and we lost our boon and you were like ah was it free stream that's three yeah yeah I just don't remember this and and it free was like oh dude we're gonna lose my very first stream I have 10,000 people watching they're gonna to you they're gonna I wish I do they're gonna they're getting anything I suck and then me and then me and robbers like so positive and we managed to pull it out you guys were we went on we took that pic on Mercury I'll have to find that picture I did somewhere it's somewhere on Twitter someone do some digging but you guys were good friends you're picking me up like no I do like we got this I'm surprised I was like that yeah I feel like this now I got a guy come on Rob but now I prop it's okay those are the moments that remind me when I need to I could be really good at shooters but 99.9% of the time I just don't care enough to actually be good so I just never missed room I think you sell yourself short it's that thing it's just like you you're gonna let you want to be yeah Rob - no I don't sell myself short it's just hard for me to care sometimes I mean I I can't pretend like I care like I I think it dimmer tone I was like this fruits first stream we got we got a [ __ ] pop - [ __ ] off did so and I entered aimbot mode I was fun did I wait I totally forgot about that 1000 you realize for thon as a third or fourth on like total viewers and then but like in like believe has I got something going on so unique was like oh man I woulda got a full time stream wishes kept those numbers yeah so that was a lot of fun yeah we'll make a video right this is yes Wow well that's fun at the very least one we're gonna get first weekend but if you guys get us a million views that we'll do another one like do it okay so yeah that's a if you want another 1 million views okay it's not that hard that works I have 1.7 yeah so everybody just needs to watch once yet not even a tenth of that is even gonna hear this yeah in fact about a 20th but I had someone in my stream last week when I was playing d2 and for some reason that day like DT director was poppin as new comes in he was like wait a minute I think I remember you and I was like and I had this happen all the time when I played DT it's not even like a one or two time thing wait a minute blue Wes look you're on that guy mr. fruity on right and like yeah yeah we videos I used to love you guys trials but I still love you guys you got on d1 and I was like yeah we see us go the other day and I had like somebody type into the thing like oh I used to love your destiny one videos I was like oh we're still making videos he's like sweet look I didn't ask all right like please just [ __ ] smack this out of you did and I was like perfect I mean that's true that that's the tough part about knowing like of my 1.7 like who subbed who who are the people who cept for what game and are literally there can you see that like metric at all no oh that's like impossible it really does it would be nice though cuz like one to like I don't want be fine phase purge them just purge them like complete like everyone that is only ever gonna watch what do you want video guess what demons gone so just yeah just get them out here oh I see where you saying like the people who subscribed during the d1 phase yeah it was only there for that phase okay this was a unique time period though for d1 like for nobody it was like I liked it yeah it was it was like yeah fortnight level explosion for people and well not quite not fortnight level but fortnight ask yes for overwatch it was like overwatch like they were both yeah like yeah yeah that's a bit closer mmm-hmm I would say probably like overwatch and it's just crazy to think about it because the you look at like what we had back then I mean and we still have it it's just like the level of reach back then just because it was destiny was ridiculous like I remember like when we were uploaded Dream Team video and then like the next day would come about 250,000 views it's like a little slow no shade like current destiny content queries but it's like someone's like oh this video this d1 view this d2 video hit 2,000 views all do this feat was going viral but like for us back then was like that's numbers it would be like alright we're not doing a sequel of that like we gotta think of something else would you go well if you go back and tell destiny one fruit youtuber anything what would you say I don't really change anything you alright I if I were you I wouldn't change anything you wouldn't you did the absolute correct thing cuz the only the only thing would be like doom or destiny but then I'm gonna get stuck in it and then I'll be here right now with d2 being like help me see but you're beyond just estimate you know damn right you are damn [ __ ] right and I'm probably anything Modern Warfare has been if anything Call of Duty stuff has has been infinitely more popular than destiny stuff on your channel over the past couple years well I also like that you are able to upload like check box or funemployed like those kind of videos are the ones that I enjoy the most and I think I even as like I normally don't watch your videos especially if like I'm in it because I [ __ ] hate my boys I hate it I hate it I hate it it's beautiful don't worry know I really hate it like I'm just um but when we do a fun game like funemployed or any of those dude I watch those all-time like the Pokemon game we did I watched that video probably all the time oh the Pokemon match that all the time I was like I just like when we get to that point where it's like us just throw in the digest movie and then at one I mean would it I cut out like 40 minutes of that too because there was one point where yeah we just like stop talking okay I just I still I still really want to play that game IRL back to grind and so much fun we should get the sequel plate IRL like yeah like like a board game night like cuz not dados like trying to find things to do outside of destiny to or something like that so just like a board game night or something like those are so much fun and like the fact that we can like upload those and like have fun is sake I'm glad I'm able to do that like that's that's the biggest like I think I tweeted about this morning you did I'm just happy that like literally from this point on I could never post another destiny video but my career would be over yeah might not see as much growth and stuff but but your sanity and like your mental health is way more important than a view at the end of the day so it's tough though like well like February I mentioned in a video recently and I told you like February is my worst month VY's in like four or five years mm-hmm which is weird because two months ago it was one of your best and it's just like algorithm like 100% and the thing is like the worst months of YouTube as well like I mean these are always the worst lols it's getting more saturated too and at this point the algorithm it's so hard to keep up with like as soon as I think like okay I think I got it I think I know it's different though it's like you can better feel like top of it I feel like that even applies to gaming like I feel like gaming like the algorithm is just far less fruitful toward it just just genre wide at certain points of the year well I mean I don't even know forty nine videos are doing well anymore like I don't even know I just don't keep up I know they were having a wall recently right before chapter two or season two whatever they called it I know most creators were complaining especially since they implemented skill based matchmaking because a lot of creators we're also like like well the big problem for a lot of creators - who did fortnight stuff a lot of them like to do goofy stuff mm-hmm and try and do well but then when the skill based matchmaking you can no longer travel fortnight yeah you know in control build or like set traps model and it's just so I know for a lot of people that would turned a lot of people off but well it's still doing waken up but we hope like Balor in how do you say it that Valerie I am like I'm just let's go with the eggs yeah please like is really I getting look sweet like blue mentioned called duties been pretty good but aside from that before that would be overwatch and then before that I would say destiny butter like rust maybe well no actually if you look that she was a wise press really didn't do that well first season yeah but then second which was fantastic second is my face second was the some of the best content - yeah I think that's the best content on YouTube I would agree all done in seven hours yeah - it was scripted it was well it was it was more like it was all like I what's the word it was all improv yeah like it was just nothing well like we happen to Road orchid would lead so fine and like improv it but it was never there was never like oh you have to say this oh you have to say the only thing that was playing in that whole thing was Christian going stand on that rock and I'm gonna do the Pride Rock House event yeah thing that was yes permission well that and when we got teleported on top of the shipment container only like killed you is like the final episode those are the only two plan thing that was that was that was a zone rails adventure a guy but even then that was all that was so we just wanted a little stories like how do we like final fight I got a like a venture off shirt any brought the die yeah okay and that was pretty much I was like sure like watch this and then I had like an angle of like forty people running down Abbey's to like go tight you start seeing the bullets come in and it's like oh [ __ ] this is war holy [ __ ] I don't know if I've ever laughed harder like three watching a video because I had to rewatch that series when when fruit is in the last room and pops out yeah pulls out a rocket launcher and then I'm like no and then we're like going through somatic thing and then dork respawns is walking like oh [ __ ] all done in like six or seven hours I wish we could recreate that magic and then like we were dumb ik alright guys a long day well I'll get that even but you know I just don't think so anyway be wise there's like different games that I wish because the problem is FPS is will do pretty well shooters normally yeah and or like one offs can usually do pretty well but then other genre games usually have a hard time I do have like a I have a consistent fanbase they're like no matter what I upload at least like 50,000 we love you stand yeah we love these like 50,000 people that no matter what we'll show yeah and it's weird to think that that's not a lot but when I say 50,000 II think about that that's like half of Invesco Field model I yeah about like 60 to 65 percent of that stadium full that's crazy things that's why I have to like put it in perspective yeah but when we're talking about dream team it's so hard because back then it was like this video only has 200,000 yeah it's like we got it and to think that would be like 24 hours see now if I hit something for 200,000 like that word that what it like Battlefront we're battlefront Joe or like battle the the modern warfare like 2v2 that we did all that tournament which we still haven't done sequin unveil I'll pull the curtain back we what we we haven't had time to try sense we couldn't capture that lightning in a bottle place we had we had like an hour one night to do the tournament on stream to like I was streaming that night yeah and so we tried group well that was the first one so then tournament came out again in that first one we're like all right let's just do tournament first go just sweep everybody yeah I was like easy so it comes back again cuz it been away for months in that video at this point has like 1.4 million views or something and I was in December so for me like no matter who that that's viral yeah for sure so I was like we need a sequel huh and unfortunately they took it away though for a couple months those bastards yeah alright well we got it do nothing so it came back a couple weeks you like two weeks ago some Rob and I had like an hour and a half yeah what we were doing [ __ ] like alright let's try to knock this out and it's really late and like edit the podcast or something afterwards ya know but it was going well first like four games sweeping one of them straight up like 600 getting delayed plays like we're feeling it yeah and cuz everyone's like oh my god these guys actually think they're good [ __ ] like SH and then we get the I think the finals or something knows like semi so Sammy's yeah it was rough yeah they just pooped on it was like six to two think I was also lagging a lot dog too but it was like six to two just and and we're like demoralizing because then it's like [ __ ] we gotta go all the way back and the thing to is like all that good stuff we just caught yeah this is never gonna be seen gone so it's like will retry and we want and extra sleep and then we're like [ __ ] it yeah we haven't tried again there we'll try again at some point but just know if we win that was our first game yeah perfect you know what is still it was surprising to me and I'm pretty sure it's still your most like viral video of all time is how much people were into overwatch gun games yeah oh my god dude yeah I am still so sure I was still back because you're jealous you're like oh my god this this videos got like a million views and we're like wait what yeah we're making more gun where did that happen did you come up with gun game or did somebody else come up with gun game I don't even remember yeah I don't either I just kind of I think I might know I don't even I'd only remember I know like some variations I think it was like comments yeah like hey do this but go in alphabetical order yeah or blah blah blah I don't remember the original I want to say I kind of brought it kinda sense like to deal with their gunplay yeah I feel like that was always a suggestion that was floating around regular gun game before after pokey watch that's very much yeah I think it was all just kind of going on at the same time I was right we were just like really overwatch yeah well overwatch was way more fun too because not only that like we could just do custom games mm-hmm which is way more fun than let's go sweat and comp I mean I'm down to do that right now and then but like it's way more French but that's dick around in cuffs now you can do that like times a million now and we don't play it well that's the thing overwatch was just so popular and I talked about it and then just like one month if just it fizzled out very very quickly and it wasn't even just like for one channel oh just too wide overwatch just really took a deep dive yeah I was like I all right II was like it's coming back though I'd see a lot of people playing like overwatch and stuff or then people I said I say people playing I say going back probably I mean I'll come back with overwatch too for a little bit but I don't see myself overrunning quote overwatch - yeah they if it is what they showed it Blizzcon I'm gonna be pissed hopefully they saw that and we're like okay yeah we should yeah as soon as there as soon as they were like yeah you could play with overwatch one players and I was like oh it's not evil - why we even white that's whole other just it's just used to be like League like at that point like if you're just gonna just make it yeah a standalone game that's not a game it's a sequel no well you need a big overhaul tell you that much but I think it was more so to say faced with the whole China thing so make people forget about it and I have no idea but if yeah as long as overwatch - custom game videos get a lot of views that would be dope cuz just messing around with friends and custom elements so fun that's like that's in-game yeah I really like overwatch custom games are a lot of fun cuz then we got dork and shark and everybody like really kind of enjoyed areas like everybody really enjoyed playing overwatch like um does not calm like coca watch took over that was crazy that fizzled out like oh like wait a couple months though it took I wouldn't say it fizzled out because it just stopped getting like so many views I think like there's only so many time you can read that fringe at that point and like make it just beating a dead horse like realistically the idea is stupid it's one of the never and we carry it very hard with I think yes I think but it was still fun it's still fun format yeah I think it was a mixture of us it was like 90 percent offs yeah like improving and carrying it and then 10 percent like editing it was like piecing it together to help it flow a little bit better or like help the audience understand that well onion my god the overlays yeah one thing I hate about poker watch I'm not kidding you like eight hours just making every individual image for this overlay I'm talking there's like hundreds of photos I would need to make for just one that works that or the smash tourney I don't know I smashed twenty suck what's your hardest what's the worst not worse I guess but the hardest video you edited or like you've like I'm not doing this again that might be Spanish turn it man edit smash for you next year I mean it sounded like it went up down but simultaneously like Scott there's so much footage said over drop oh my god it would be forever the prop like well how do you say now we'll have to find a way to tell a stream on it cuz I'm talking like five different camera perspectives two different two or three different mics and cats then same play which isn't none of this is synced together because it's in different rooms and then the people are stopping it when I didn't want them to like blue and data understand it we were like why does he want such large files because when I had like ten little files my Jesus so I have to piece every single Almighty we have eight hours we should we have to find out exactly how they handle it like it yeah I feel like we'll have to do yes like pre make the layout try and run everything into one P it's gonna be like what we need to have is like one of those al gato things and then like have one be the camera upstairs and then you press that and it goes the one upstairs we're gonna have to like link that it's just like that you know production team maybe so we might have to like ask like a tournament organizer I like smash something like spear hey how do you guys set up as if we did that on the fly that was way easier yeah and we'd be able to get him out quicker and by we I mean we would but we would have to have someone dedicated to changing like yeah in OBS essentially okay going into this camera go to this camera we should have go to go to go to the when someone's not calming like that's what we should do we should have someone who's like the production guy that time and then like tries yeah but we're still gonna have to have a production guy the whole time regardless and someone who okay this person's up one okay it's blue versus this guy yeah so then I think I'm sure someone who doesn't wanna play smash would be like okay [ __ ] yeah I think the smash tourney or the polka watch might be the worst um or like the most I've spent and it's just like it's over it and the thing about polka watch to why there's only so many episodes is because like that I didn't want to beat a dead horse every time we did it I wanted to be something new yeah it was either it really is that we could there's so many times we can remix polka watch yeah but that had I think that and then gun game were our most popular custom games yeah easily fun to make we've done in general yeah as like a series mm-hmm overwatch was just a man overwatch was hot so Ballard I'm hoping Valerie it won't be able to do the same kind of thing as overwatch just because of the nature in the custom games and stuff but hopefully people just like well it's like messing around and like learning the game and stuff like that I mean I'm gonna play the [ __ ] out of it we'll see I'm worried that that's how it'll be in and then the month now anyone cares you should have to be a guy yeah cuz that's kind of like what like fortnight it was either you had to be a god or after like a month you had to be a god or this is ridiculous stuff like all right please blindfolded with deep yeah and it's like with my feet you'd only get that stuff if you just played fortnight a lot yeah which I just couldn't do yeah I say FX mmm-hmm I feel like games like this that are specifically made to be eSports you've got like a couple month period where it's like oh you could be a little silly but then eventually yeah the medes people only want people only watch because they want to see players who are better than that how to get better at Valerie FC two months later so I guess you have to do is mess around for a few months while simultaneously becoming eSport players why you think I'm playing csgo right now and then practicing we might just mess with impacts the terrible bullet drop in that game is training me I shot my shot this is like Byron Yvonne it's the closest thing to see us that I'll actually play [Music] I'm just I don't know CS also was just so it's so nice oh yeah bet and it's like it's been out for 20 years like all that kind of stuff I don't know oh I'm late to the party and I suck I would I do too you know it

ride home brought to you by IGN writer Kyle welcome back I think blue was about to say something if you remember your thought play apex apex of POG I bet you're like an apex again blue I can't play with you guys though why is that because I love Pathfinder oh I mean I don't have to play Pathfinder and I have to have pathfinders heirloom before you do now oh dude ah no well it just sucks I just need heirloom shards I've opened so many apex packs I got to be a [ __ ] package open up dude it's probably somewhere around 200 I would guess like it's gotta be somewhere around there I should I haven't really bought that many maybe I've bought maybe around 60 so like through leveling and stuff so I would say probably around 200 I don't I mean see I also can't play because if I'm in your team we won't win and that's not contest no that's not that's not true is it not true well you're not on path fighters so I'm sure mein Pathfinder that you would play better I think the biggest problem is we just have to figure out how we work best as a team cuz like you'll learn in blue when you play with a Rob he's just like I'm fighting and it's not a matter of like oh let's just you just have to blindly rush in and help him it's like we can't well let's but it's like oh jeez God all right like this is it it's a fiesta and then I go I'm down I'm down I'm down I have a small penis I have a small penis and I'm down and Rob misses like every shot and you've got clutch oh and then you hear oh yeah my Rob what where is he and you screw in the back legs alright thanks for the mix for that info okay well I'll six play with my bridge friends no you're gonna play less soon alright so we have our patreon questions want to thank our patreon stands for supporting the cause we love you guys thanks stands so this question he always gets it on here what's good is because it's a good question I want to talk about a little okay na Barry asks the new my hero movie thoughts you seen a blue for great things but I haven't seen it yet so we can't tie spoilers so we won't III plan on not talking spoilers anyways yeah very [ __ ] cool go see it yeah the first cuz oh yes not even like the first I like the first for the first is kind of lame no this verse is very slow in this part where there let me go let me put this in perspective but I hear it like the first movie you're standing on earth but then this movie you've launched out of the stratosphere yeah you are you are just you're zooming they really give it up for the fanservice in this one there's a lot of fanservice and I'm all about it like it was sick well so I don't know if he knew this either of you but this movies adapted off of the original way he wanted the series to mm it's like a rough adaptation we don't know exactly like even after watching the movie I was like I don't know what part was like what he thought would be the end or like what they because the people did the movie like took it and then just kind of took some liberties and changed it up mm-hmm but so it's interesting to see and then you can kind of be like oh yeah I could have seen how maybe like this but the lead up and then hey off oh yeah just the just like that that 15 minutes of just [ __ ] is I would I would equate it blue to like Dragon Ball super Brawley the movie oh yeah like I would compare that's a great like you got build-up stuffs happening but then the last 15 minutes is just like nice just like this is what I want all we go yeah probably god is so sick that's that's the best way I would describe it's like build-up okay this isn't but then those last 15 minutes are enough that like you would boot it back up and you better a squeegee to roof you like you're fast forward even though the other stuffs good you're very high praise I mean yeah I'm even Dragonball it was like the last 30 minutes I'm be honest well true straight not quite as long as dragon battle yeah it's definitely not as long as I'm so good but by Heroes all about the build-up so what they do is so and then like like you said in the first one blue it's kind of slow when they're like going up and they're fighting robots and stuff and like you only get like the last 10 minutes of the first one I there's not that much downtime in this one it's so cool yeah because Rob was supposed to see it with us the first night he couldn't because I let me know what you think and also because I was worried about spoilers yeah because there was a lot of talk about like spoilers going on and they're like there's stuff so I was like if you see this movie and wish you didn't see it let me know and I managed tweet or immediately I'm a statue I just like bro just go see like you got to see yeah you're gonna get another tattoo is literally the text I got also you yeah so I would definitely highly suggest if you're interested or even just even coming go see it yeah and if you're worried about spoilers - I would say unless you specifically know what you're looking for and even then I would also hate really hot up with the current seasons you can see I like see it and I think she's fine yeah I think so too especially because it's a close on quote canon movie but it's like most of the canon movies where like yeah that happened but we're probably never even gonna hear about it again like it might not carry over at all I don't know no all right this next question is actually from me what I mean that I'm cuz I have a question these questions like I'm telling you do these patreon questions like you guys guys ask the same [ __ ] every [ __ ] week and like they're not good really think about it and really ask a really like an informative question you know like come on like well the dream team take on halo campaigns and if so on legendary I know maybe there's no conversation added with that alright so my question is the salty just he bumped it up to eight all right this question is from Rob he asks who's your guys's hero in life oh wow I just thought I I thought that question Rob well I thought of that because I I had two heroes and well three Oakland no hero so they're gonna kind of switch around and for different kind of reasons like my main here will probably be my dad cuz like I've saw him like work and he's like taught me a lot of stuff and all that kind of stuff and the number to be Alex Trebek with like all the stuff he's kind of like gone through with like his whole cancer thing and how he's like helped a lot of people and he just did like his year update on his health and he's like still killing it and like still really doing well and always has a smile on his face and like is like willing to like be open about it so helps other people that's super awesome and he I love him because he's so smart and I love jeopardy cuz it makes me that's how I got my learning in back in the day it was jeopardy if I was doing not going to school I was watching jeopardy because it made me feel smart and then number three everyone's got any kid I get let let's say Christian guys can you guys who hero number three is um well I guess there's four No some guests I'm not gonna reveal who four is because that I will reveal four idolater three would be Tom Brady because it makes love love him so much and he's the greatest quarterback ever and he just shows you that if you're the best at something don't get comfortable just keep getting better let's go Tom please resign for us Tom Brady please if I see you in another uniform next year I would literally be the saddest person on the face of the earth I will be so sad I will cry I will cry Tom we know her you're listening I will cry Tom look at me Tom I'm looking at you and Gisele you guys are beautiful by the way also it's not weird to kiss your kids on the lips all right I hate people I hate people getting at Tom Brady for kissing these kids on the lips I kiss my dad on the lips all right for turn 10 ah all right well I know about you well how about blue blue who would your hero me I really don't know you need an answer because I don't know you don't you guys all have heroes I don't know if I've ever had a hero like somebody who like really look up to and somebody who's like wow like they know a lot about myself and a lot about like where I want to go and [ __ ] I guess I'm just way more in touch with my feelings than you to know I've thought about it but I think about it a lot but I never have an answer okay there's people like that like I'm like oh that's cool like and I take like example for them but there's no one who like I know I've idolized or like somebody who I don't know if there's ever been someone I idolize to that level okay in like fourth grade it was Ken Sugimori how's that he's the original Pokemon our director oh that's cool I loved his art was I wish I could drag that like that so when you do draw like no I can't what me if I stuck to it I could have but you're a good artist man you are I can do it all and that's who I Hey I'm not gonna live it fruit does great but simultaneously there's difference between us and an artist who can make a multi-billion dollar franchise [ __ ] you guys can make the art and vectors okay that's really just illustrating no you guys you guys are artists you know he's know how to work in venue cuz where do we take their sensual out there and they don't know how to work in vectors who are artists all right what just Dana fact I guess like I've never yeah I would blue I've never like specifically picked out somebody I mean like that is how I want to live that's who I want to be like I never had that I would say I mean I've learned a lot from a lot of people specifically like like work ethic and stuff would be my parents or like providing and stuff would be my parents learned a lot about education hobbies pretty much a lot of stuff outside of school growing up from my older brother because my parents were working a lot mm-hmm so ironically I got work ethic from them but then my older brother had to take care of a slot so and from him seeing what a like a loving relationship looked like um and then yeah I don't know I guess I've just taken a lot from different people and yeah I don't really know if I've ever like been like that person mm-hmm is it I hate to say I've never been there's very few instances in my life where I could say like a person has inspired me very very like I don't even think I can count on my hands which is probably kind of sad but simultaneously that's just like how it is yeah I don't think so um lets me find this last question dude there's a bunch that I can totally choose from nathan fillion however i sure i'm gonna pick this one to show how like great these questions are from Winky dinky we all know dr. pepper is okay but what about barks wait what Oh the fungus locks that's a rupiah it's not in the same yes why that's why please question shocked my chat monitor whites somehow my chat semi makes it into these oh is this an inside joke okay so wait we explain this inside you know like this every single time we talk about dr. trip for my chat eventually turns into but what do you think about root beer root beer is really good too I'm just like [ __ ] root beer I hate Ruth it's just not good and also mr. pip still [ __ ] sucks all right you have a terrible you have a terrible terrible low Twitter page hold on I need to say this what there's this is a great comment I think it's on the YouTube video there's somebody out there that's hopefully doing God's work for us that is keeping track of everything we said we're gonna do next summit uh-huh on this podcast because I can't remember them all but somebody's like I'm keeping track so that when it comes they can remind us thank you because I know one of them was like we're gonna do the blind dr. Pat dr. pepper mr. Pibb test see but for me that's gonna be the same for you oh my god shut up Lucy so I'm gonna say dr. peppers mutated dr. pepper okay whatever not important we're gonna have control groups whatever you're gonna find out we said that we got the nugget challenge we got some other stuff that we gotta somebody somebody out there hopefully even if somebody did say in conversation I was like you're a real one all right Laurel easy at least I said at my head I don't know if I actually replied that it's actually the reason I'm a horrible messenger mmm-hmm like see how many messages I have right now oh I don't talk to many people but I have 65 text messages do i how do people do that I get excited if I'm I I get a system notification that says Red Dog you should update your phone right now buddy like is it about it do you not like I just want to know cuz like when I get a text message I look at it why don't you look at it something usually I miss it okay so then just at least open it no then okay this is gonna sound really weird I get anxiety about it if I open it then I feel obligated to reply to it and if I'm not ready to reply to it then I won't know do you have receipts on you don't have business it's on batteries no matter I still opened it so I don't so I feel obligated reply to it so then I'm not I don't wanna do this right now so that I don't so then three weeks pass by and I haven't replied to someone oh yeah and then at that point I'm like well it's been three weeks so yeah it's awkward and I can't do it anyway so like who cares plus I'd rather get messages on like Twitter and discord anyway that means you have 65 messages from 65 unique people in your inbox that you have not replied to maybe that is insane to me I have my the only person who wants to talk to me is my double Authenticator then it's like hey you sure you want to double off that decay I'm like yeah yes like yeah I can't explain it but stuff like that emails give me super anxious emails is different email but messages sometimes DMS from usually from certain people you're good about D enzymes I'm better at but that's also because I'm usually my computer and I can see DMS on my computer like Twitter is usually open somewhere or I'll go and I'll see users kind of I'll just see it over there but like text message if I miss it odds are that's it it'll be I two days and I'll be like oh someone's so texted me I don't even bother just bill looking in there yeah yeah and then kind of the same thing with blue if it's been a couple days you might wanna it's been a couple and then this comes off and then at that point it's past it and then it's not next thing oh it's too much like that but then I'm it's always in the back of my head like but I never show those people and then I need to reach out to them but but I never responded that it's like uhm but and then two months go by and you're like oh my god I never so then I have to decide right then in there if I'm gonna respond to it or not and usually it's not so blue what is your message counter at right now what like on your phone like on your phone like what is your message counter I'll tell you what mine's at - out 18 oh but it's because my fantasy-football text was popping off and like I haven't read those yet I see my email 20,000 whoa 20,000 yeah I don't even have my phone so that's uh yeah I don't I don't attach my email to my phone specifically because I don't want to see like a 5,000 plus number because that will give me anxiety that I said that but the Apple watch has actually made me a little bit better about I was at least now if I miss it or like an email cuz on this emails really easily - but oh but most of the time I I never feel that buzz - so if I miss that buzz Oh Oh see I feel the buzz like what like okay somebody just remember to breathe stand up like okay no I'm like no yeah I just like saw it and I was like I don't think I know anybody who just lets they're like inbox get like that and then you show me 80 people what is it 80 or 60 65 what's the highest it's ever been oh I don't know Claire will make me go in and like clear that or like I have like 15 voicemails and that's only because now my voice box voice mailbox is like but that's low key to play I can't leave you boys me I hate voicemails so I have free up your voicemail now I'm good yeah I had somebody like a man free provokes me I was like oh no because if the somebody's leaving you a voice mail it's bad news there's no such thing as a voicemail that's good news not true this sounds morbid but I like to like keep like my mom's voice mails in case she ever like randomly passed oh I never thought about that yeah but then I'd have like that like hi honey sorry I missed you so and so like love you uh-huh and I just think that was so nice and then like I never want to like my voicemails are my first one in here is from 2014 and then my latest one is from 2016 what's my inbox got balls I don't nobody ever call me again see unfortunately clear me me oh no I never clear my voicemail don't leave me voicemails it's 2025 set up my voicemail I don't I don't eat it you reach its mailbox of three doctors from 303 that is the Colorado yeah so good luck guessing the other seven good nice man thank you quick laps really quick before we close out this podcast though since I wear a gaming podcast right guys know we're [ __ ] a podcast and that's we're just a [ __ ] wheat that's what sweet but I did want to bring this up and it is more destiny too but they show this ever versus armor and blue don't say anything Rob just look at these and let me know like which do you like any of them if so like what are we thinking okay I think that I don't what is the hunter wearing it's like a skort I don't hate the helmets I absolutely hate everything else well I think the warlock looks the coolest okay and then probably Titan and then of course you put a [ __ ] wig on that hunter and a but the Red Nosed he looks like a clown okay so let me blow your mind real quick oh he's gonna he's that -
