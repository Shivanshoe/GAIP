hi ad hope you won my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to our minecraft hardcore survival let's play in today's episode obviously the last video was not much of a high point it's all the times we died but I am happy to say that in this hardcore world art forth hardcore world we've made it past day 100 and I'm gonna show you the world and the progress that we've made on our journey get him here so my ladies and Lords welcome to house fruit you're gonna see here I have made a small Kingdom dilly dilly now remember yes this is hardcore this was all done painstakingly by hand of course it's been it's been an adventure the title says and it's true I've survived over 100 days in hardcore without ever building a house wood early ever it's because our original spawn was the bubba butts and so i'm not kidding i spent about seven eight days in-game just finding where we eventually settled we're going on an adventure operation find anywhere that's more interesting than here is a go just it's just trees bro and trees day three nothing of interest yet perhaps sunday these will change come after me devil wow we're out of those two biomes wait a second okay if i can orient myself then we could be on the edge still in Forrest City endure but also with the proposition of hopefully living things let's see this is what we needed an amalgamation of biome see we got big stuff over here we got mountains over there we got forests over there we got a big plain area over here a perseverance has paid off look at the motherland oh she holds everything we could ever want I'm still in my regular hard core world here by the way so really hope I don't die giving off my might or we are on day 113 this is what our estate started out as we had a whole bunch of chests furnaces and then this is our strip mine and that was all in order to work towards what you see here the kingdom this was all hilly we had to excavate out a whole bunch of stuff and now that we did that the first order of business was obviously to erect the walls that you see here today double thick walls by the way ain't no creeper getting in ideally now there is gonna be a moat why wouldn't there be however that's kind of on the end of the list because we got a lot of stuff that needs to be done but it's gonna be sick we're gonna have like water coming out of the walls here too occasionally I'm thinking three wide apparently it's gonna be a mistake but who really knows we're gonna make it we're gonna make it lower too so that comes under this makes this kind of look like a bridge because for now this is the entrance I think we're gonna make this whole thing bigger I think this will be the inner wall and we'll have an outer wall later but for now this is all that we have like I said moats gonna be coming in here soon we got some lanterns over there this alone the excavating took alright ten days or something I was affectionately referred to as mr. dirt man so we have the entrance to our humble abode for now we'll see where we go from this eventually I want to kind of work in some redstone and stuff but I'm not very knowledgeable on that yet so we have our entrance two doors of course pressure plates to get and and then you're gonna notice like wait a minute you said no home for like you don't have a home well I don't and in fact this was only built in the past two days this temporary construction that you see and it was actually most of these blocks are temporary I was running out of stuff and I was just using whatever I had in my chests just to kind of I wanted to draw this up but I actually think I'm going to be scrapping this entire thing and building something else as you'll see but like like as you can see it's it's not a house so there gonna be some buildings over here there's gonna be an arch overhanging connecting them and then I I wanted the tree I wanted to make like a little courtyard but I think I'm actually might change it to a fountain but anyway not borden there'll be some buildings here here we have our horse he's new I haven't named him yet but he has diamond armor as any horse should my stallion we have our farms over here we have our cow farm hey guys how you doing over there we got a chicken farm well a little more recent of an addition so there's not as many and we recently cold a lot of these cows we've got sugar cane and wheat up the butt because I really wanted to get going on bookshelves is eensy over here to start doing some enchanting which is wrong her and I temporarily placed it here this isn't obviously where it's gonna be but I need to get some enchanting so I need leather and I need sugar cane for paper so that's exactly what we did hey give me a wegg's thank you very much let's see if we can add some new members for these guys huh we're out there the eggs all right and yeah all right one four six not great one thing I think I'm going to keep regardless of what we end up doing here I like you this little alcove we have here so originally it was kind of like a little basement tunnel into the courtyard and under here of course I wanted to like make like some pillars and stuff some support pillars and over here I'm not sure what kind of storage room this was gonna be but over here we have a wine cellar not quite done with it yet oh no but at the very least we have our our wine barrels so yet not sure what exactly we use that for it might just honestly mirror them over there but I like that and at the very least even if I don't keep this part I'll probably wall this off and just have this whole wall I know I like this full side path thing we got going on here right we have our walls of Ba Sing se obviously I need to make a couple more ways to get up here but first order of business was literally this wall it was build a wall to make a camp so I can be safe because I was tired if pillagers come in and whatnot and well ironically enough was building this we didn't we couldn't get enough torches and stuff and so pillagers were starting to spawn inside my city that wasn't very fun well should I just have oh hey how are they inside how well yeah I guess it's their Kingdom now alright enjoy all my heart dude what the fudge literally the point was so that no one could come in eventually I kind of want to make the corners like little watchtowers I think that'd be pretty mean or at least on the outer walls like I said I haven't I have a vision for this being the inner wall then we have an outer wall where we actually move all the farms out and it'll be like the the agriculture wall you know what I'm saying and then here we'll just make more like shops or a tavern or something I'm not entirely sure and then of course at the front a little better view what we got going on around here this has been nice because if I want to do stuff at night I can do it in peace and also pillagers come we destroy them I have sense vanquish the pillagers for the first time they showed up yeah to say I was terrified would be putting it lightly over here on this side this is a one of the most recent additions we have our sheep farm we have a pig farm and I know pig farms aren't really like necessary everyone's like why are you doing that just to make it symmetrical I got four farm so I'm gonna fill with the new-new mob and so we got we got some pigs over there we've got some was that pumpkins growing melons growing carrots and potatoes I think one of the most recent additions though and one of the more grandiose additions to the village was our gates to hell this is the nether portal room we made this and chattin had the great idea of saying hey let's make the floor out of lava and I'll have you know I only fell into the lava three times [Applause] oh my god but we survived because think the Greybeards I have fire protection and that's been huge we will see we have full diamond armor shet we have an enchanted diamond pickaxe diamond sword we have an iron pickaxe with efficiency in fortune for when we find diamonds and I think I actually have like 13 diamonds or something somewhere just chillin I have two more things at Diamond the horse armor because most recently we vanquished another fortress which I've never done before was terrified but we managed I think the room really came together and the lava was a nice touch albeit extremely dangerous and I only questioned what I was doing with my life about every second I was doing it and I could understand how somebody wait it took you 100 days to do all this yeah first off this is all stone so it means smelting a whole bunch of cobblestone let me tell you that that ain't exactly easy then I'll show you the strip-mine we've been busy at work on top of that we went in we we vanquished like two or three different nether fortresses okay and you haven't even seen the best part of the village now this one is hidden but this was originally gonna be the centerpiece of the village but for some reason I decided nay we're doing it underground and we're doing it first before doing anything and that my friends is the Royal bathhouse wait for the reveal wait for the reveal wait for the reveal oh it's my I'm so proud of it is it this gorgeous look at the Royal bathhouse here look at the fine architecture the craftsmanship incredible we have more lanterns here but well they're expensive this will probably turn into glowstone or something or like some redstone or glow red stone lanterns or whatever the heck their blocks and then on top of that you're gonna see like the smoke coming out that's some campfires we placed under which i think is a really nice touch but it adds some steam sonna effect here got some water coming in this took it was about until day 50 or 60 that we ended up finishing this because we had to excavate the entire ground obviously get enough materials and then make this so none of that was easy and then on top of that we had a bit of a bit of an issue with I don't oh here it is where we just happened to build straight over a whole bunch of caves so the problem was you'll see here I went in all this dirt and stuff is what I filled I had to go through and in fact I was running out and I gave up so for the most part you started lighting it all up but mobs kept spawning here so every time you're in the royal bath house trying to enjoy yourself here I was a tilted so we spent about two hours going through and making sure all of this was covered up because as you'll see down here if I okay I don't know why I'm using a hoe for this but you'll see ya had a whole giant cave I completely blocked off all that cave goes way out there there were some cave systems up there we went through lit it all up and the ceiling where you see all the dirt that was actually more of the cave so up this way we also went ahead and trying to remember yay I know what I'm doing look at me so we went through completely blocked off this upper part of the cave made it like a separate layer let this sucker up nobody's spawning here dude nobody's ruin my royal bath so that was nice but obviously took a little while was a little frivolous but it needed to be done and I'm thinking possibly what's gonna happen is this is gonna extend into a Royal armory over there but that is to be decided so as you saw here we have the Royal Bath entrance there but whatever this changes to we'll need an entrance there and then if we come over here we have the Royal strip mine I just put royal in front of everything and it makes it seem much more regal this was a new tunnel we originally made because as you saw used to be that was the entrance but we have since changed it I'll probably just completely remove that from the above ground as well down here you will meet our parent I like to call him penis pump the parrot because he a penis and all he does is make mob noises and I got so sick of him that he is now stuck down here he's so cute oh my god I'm gonna kill him okay hey hey sit stay there I don't need you making noises while I'm mining alright we're gonna see here here's our strip mine I know the most optimal is technically just like tunneling like this but I don't like doing that I think what I'll do is one by three like this but I like three high more than two and it feels like I'm missing that unless even if that may or may not completely be true we did not take any chances with the lighting there's a couple rules on the server or interest in my world it is no mineshaft 2020 lied out 2020 or torchlight 2020 and no sunken ships 2020 we keep this lit up because I thought originally I had it lit up pretty well but after a couple creeper incidents where they kept spawning down here knew what we were throwing torches down like it was it's our job and quite frankly it was I can collect five gas I'm putting a torch every two things like what are you kidding bro we're no over this way I've closed this off because that ends in a mineshaft that ends in a mineshaft that ends in a mineshaft and then of course that one connects to that mine shaft and you guessed it this is a mineshaft II it's different mine chef's there's like two or three different mine shafts just somewhere all around my castle and it drives me insane we most famously right here had a stack of I think six diamonds and that was the first stack of diamonds I was able to use fortune on which was very exciting we had a whole bunch of diamonds from that farewell penis pump enjoy your times down here in the caves he keep he keeps it under watch is what he's a he's a glorified tell him to make him feel about it ya know he's stuck down there so hopefully we make it to like day 200 on the server and then I'll do an update but ideally you're the like first order business when I resume is just getting rid of this and starting I want to build a tower like a castle tower in the middle and then maybe some like shops or stables on the side or something I'm not really sure I've been kind of envisioning it we'll see where it goes from there but it would be nice to finally have somewhere to put all this like I said I haven't like I haven't had a house so everything just gets thrown around everywhere and I do whatever this is our POG pedal it got us um this bow with mending unfortunately not infinity but it's still fine all the same but then also got us our pav Grande where is that by the way I have to sort through all this it's it's a nightmare our fishing rod it has curse of vanishing which might seem unlucky but from what I understand that curse is if you die the item disappears well guess what I'm in hardcore so if I die everything disappears so actually it doesn't matter at all it has mending and luck of the ce3 though hopefully I get worse soon and I'm able to anvil those together and I should also note if we come over here you will see that we are located right next to a village there is a farming trader over there I haven't made use of that stuff yet though still a bit new to that jungle biome over there there is indoor looking biome that way we have the plains here got like a snowy mountain range over there and then some other biome I kind of went where there's just a whole bunch of different bottoms there's a swamp nearby as well so with all of that I'll finish it off by showing you where we are in the nether another spawn and hopefully nothing did I do I have my bow on me oh jeez surrounded it in cobblestone like I said slowly learning don't really want ghasts destroy my portal well duh or any chests I have and all that tracks we don't see any guests so we're good but you're gonna see this is our spawn and obviously right in front of our face was the fortress we plundered that entire fortress we plundered this entire fortress and then there's like a whole other fortress you can't see on the other side that I plundered but that my friends is house fruit for now so these two plots of land like I said are gonna come to some sort of buildings ideally right now I'm thinking some sort of a cast below the castle is gonna be some sort of a storage or an armory something like that all in all though I'm having tons of fun with this week I've been sinking so much time to this and we'll keep doing the updates as long as I keep staying alive but if you do want to fall I've livestream this entire world so in a link down below will be my twitch every time I go live in this world I go live on Twitch you guys can watch long with that onna thank you all very much for watching and supporting let me know what you guys think or if you guys have ideas for me to put in the village or around the walls or what you'd like to see made have yourselves a fantastic I'll talk to you you and the next one farewell
