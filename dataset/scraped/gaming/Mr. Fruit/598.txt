melting like it always did it's accurate it's deadly and he's face walking face shifting i'm coming buddy i gotcha unfortunately it was a moment too soon oh you almost done got me killed my friend that's right because i got me a stem and i'm just going to i'm not doing a very good job of self-preservation here i'm just kind of sitting in the middle of a rooftop it's like please don't kill me but you did anyway because i'm terrible and he had the smg up close what do you want to do oh oh oh oh but that recoil still kind of nasty with it though you wouldn't expect it but it's there uh
