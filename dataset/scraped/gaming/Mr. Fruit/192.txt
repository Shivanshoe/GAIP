[Music] oh i'm here friend what the fudge am i aiming at wow i do no damage hi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video i am going to put myself through the gauntlet i'm going to punish myself because i i guess okay is there no way to like turn off the i don't care if you found a rigged shell sorry breaking my immersion i'm a master kissed i guess i don't know so you already know what uh what i'm finna say we hopping into iron banana i don't know why don't ask me never said it was a good idea more importantly we're rocking into it with the sorrows verse yeah i like auto rifles and it looks like a fun auto rifle and for the iron banner thing it says i need energy weapon kills and and like some of this is energy weapon stuff so like why not i'm gonna be honest i don't know what's better at all in pvp right now but ah we got outlaw precision kills greatly decreased reload time obviously i'm gonna be hitting head shots i'm gonna be getting so much head out there multi-kill clip reloading grains increase damage based on number of rapid kills made beforehand now now i think about it probably only going to get like one kill multi-kill clip might not but whatever man i don't know uh range range range range yeah that's it i look like pepe the frog you know the drill hey yo okay what super do titans use right now in pvp because in another video i use top tree hammers and everyone's like you know he hasn't played the game when he's using top tree hammer so solar abilities kill oh that's great we'll do that and i don't want to use striker titan because i uh i never use it well anyway uh we're going it we're going into the iron banana something tells me rookie number right there we gotta pump those up but i don't think that's gonna happen so pray for me lean on me when you're not strong just kidding i can't because i queued freelance now before we get in everybody remember hydration is key agua is for the soul and i've been putting all the electrolytes in my water you know because apparently drinking too much water is a bad thing go figure right see i don't know man it doesn't make any sense what is that in your face sir because i love it what's everybody rocking here oh we got the la wrong strawberry okay okay i'm ready for paint this auto rifle looking kind of saucy in the best way paul i'm finna act up okay love the design very sleek opponent claimed zone scene they rounded no one went for b huh good give me this because i think for the quest oh no you don't oh don't mind if i uh bob give me that kill oh should we playing we playing that kind of game okay gotcha i will say though this thing is so buttery smooth when it shoots ow make it stop i now realize what i have to do to create an advantageous position for this auto rifle uh no team shots find someone solo ideally not looking at me shoot them in the back and just hit head shots if i can manage to do all of that okay people don't think i understand what act up means but i do so if that makes it even weirder for you good that's my friend i'm so sorry multi-kill clip is not activating multi-kill clip is finn to activate though nose oh i'm here friend running with the pass um yeah so have yet to get a precision kill have yet to activate multi-kill clip all in all it seems like all the perks i have on this thing are actually useless but they sounded so good yo yo yo yo yo don't uh freaking don't mind if i do i need i need some free easy kills to pad these stats here don't i i ain't ashamed where are they at i'm
