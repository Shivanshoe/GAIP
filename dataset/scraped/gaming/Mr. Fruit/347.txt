wallet became a lot unhappier with me when every game and their mom that i like decided to start doing micro transactions you know games are free to play these days most of them but somehow they're not you somebody has to keep them free to play you're welcome so essentially what i did was there was the new apex event came with the bangor heirloom do i play bangalore no did i purchase my way to the bangor heirloom yes so i felt i had to get a win with them otherwise i can't justify the purchase so let's see if i can get a win are you ready because i think we're too late you know what i didn't want to land there anyway i wanted to land um right here right actually no one came here cool actually i think there's a person although oh my god there is oh my god oh my god oh my god come here get him like my heirloom club pay to win stupid don't mind if i do the cold steel melee that's right look at how i pay to win my friends and if you're saying anything rob you've been muted yeah i just got back okay we already got a kill yeah come on ladies pick it up way too much of about everything i still like nothing both here both here both here up where above or below down here broke don't let him go i broke him i'm pushing his friend oh my god i have no ammo i have no ammo left oh i need help because i'm prepared though now we're in trouble oh he can res he can rest i'm different dude just better honestly well i meant to craft can i do it in time yeah probably on me on me come here come here i gave you a zip line i can't reach just keep going keep going they're right behind me oh we're so boned watch for the circle where are they cracked one knocked one watch your friend he's pushing close no shield i'm needing the res where do you go where'd this guy go he might have gone in the zone in the round i'm pushing this i down another person he's healing oh my god he's he's down here now or something oh i see him how'd you lose him i i don't know he was running towards me then he wasn't just run just run this run you almost have top five whatever what you gonna do what you're gonna do and come for you i just want to win a game with bangor so i can move on with my life ward why are we we're just trying to tank our rp uh we have at least one team they're gonna be dropping around here too so julie chef you got a mozambique yeah i hit him once i'm coming i'm so weak he's weak somewhere on me i'm phoenixing just buy me some time are they coming out move fast folks i don't know i can't afford to lose i don't have any nades all i have is re-45 and the mozambique still oh you got an r301 it's nice no shield no shield on the bloodhound i torched one chasing i am taking fire friends i download i'm coming i'm coming oh my lord i'm choking i'm out of ammo and everything that was like the most papa fight you've ever seen hey but you know what we came out came out on top no i'm talking about me and that like bloodhound it was like we both had shotguns and we just like just like whiff with with and i'm proud of you guys we're already up 21 points feels even better see and you thought this was gonna be minus rp i know i have no faith forgive me father right here right in here wait there's fighting to our left to don't engage if we don't have to because there's two teams here they're okay they know i'm here well yeah cracked one yeah there's a watson inside yeah they're literally this is my old they're just turtle yeah uh they're behind this little door i can't just push oh he's so weak it's a rampart the watson's pushing i'll shield off shield what how much help does she have man somebody took the jump throw over on you yep i'm jumping to them broke his white shields i got multiple people on me our friend is dead somehow i down to gibraltar oh i mean what find you rob he has no shields okay there's another team there's another team what happened to our friend what's he doing dude teamed another dude built different i got a gold backpack and a gold knockdown [ __ ] just not looted oh this is supposed to be hot drop so then there's somewhere i hear shooting what nothing excluded maybe this wasn't the hot drop i think they're at map room though level four oh [Music] uh i don't have anything i guess we can go find out who was shooting oh that's not gonna say there has to be someone here oh he might just be of one team you need to go in on the other side yeah right there just the lifeline just thought i know i'm weak too much i heard her get him sweet he has the rez token detected i altered it oh he's chasing chase he jumped he's oh my god i need to know what this 30 30 repeater does because like if you hold it line up without shooting it charges i just don't know what that does yeah i think it does a little bit more damage i wonder if it's that or less drop or both oh enemy over there oh they might be coming up what are you using that's a 30 30. i hit him again hit him i hit one coming here oh we gotta go go under go under go under shielded oh sh super mess though [Music] can i get you a zipline no i can zip my back up this way just know the more we do stuff too the more likely we're gonna get third party although they have to come to us right here let's check out this area oh there you go you're making it bro they're making it broke oh they're going they're falling right into another team [Applause] yeah i can't hit them hit 52 do those for you for hitting these things dude jesus on the ship all right i think everyone went to the left right here then they have to come in over here then might be something good well that's a lifeline package so i would explain that right here oh hit for 43. that's enough for the shield they have they have a watson boner they're fighting yeah teams are coming in they're going to be fighting a whole bunch i almost have old but that's not all of them so we shouldn't get too excited maybe we maybe that is all of them i can zipline my old well let's go let's just try and keep high ground or something again lifeline week lifeline week on this room with she's me weak i'm hitting some shields right below you right boy lifeline on me still rob right behind you watching one i'm i'm kicking this [ __ ] got her another one back up back up while she's charged he's cracked yup yup yup i hit it for 15. they're gonna rest i need help i need help i got a phoenix i need [ __ ] oh there it is okay they're dead she had a gold knockdown there's more people around here though because there were more in two teams here so some might have gotten out with only like a couple of them but i think there was one squad not here so there might be a full squad of three and then i don't know if the last one's full [Applause] careful we gotta hurry just do it it doesn't matter if she gets hurt somebody can take that zipline oh my god damn i just killed us oh this is not good jesus all right let's get in this house or something just assume someone's here dude look where this circle is what the [ __ ] oh there's the team way over there this way one minute i can just i can get us over there no no no no well i'm just saying like oh they're in the zone oh [ __ ] hit one for 66 i'm finishing shielding hold on yeah i'm gonna get close to throwing out and then we'll push oh right next to that oh jesus that's another team there's literally two teams yeah we can stay right here we're in the zone it's not a good part yeah they're trying super this sucks they're throwing nades hey where's the team to the left they're like on the very edge of like literally like the edge of that he's making a push for him yeah i'm gonna hold him ready i altered behind me behind me i got him that's the last squad now octane wait what am i getting shot classic super weak i have to heal after you oh no one second one saying what's happening if you can make it go broke on me that'd be great is it just bloodhound i don't know let's go baby oh that was the champions too easy i'm the am champion no more you're the champion for camping we had such a bad play on that circle when we beat them seriously they had like literally everything going for them 1400
