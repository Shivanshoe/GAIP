a very big swamp a vast swamp i think they rise out of the water that's what i'm hearing what okay what is that in the water that's not a drug that's all each now you know mac oh oh what are you it's a blob aptly named i don't want anything to do with you sir oh it's an ancient tree what if they give special wood come here nailed it what'd we get who's ooze bomb let me see if we get special things from this oh lord just wood looks like oh ancient bark oh we can make a bonfire what do we have here all right well place is pretty flat so you think it'd be pretty easy oh what is that it's a tree house but what do you got up there wait what i can't even can't even parkour up there if i wanted to oh i blocked the house because i know my shield okay new plan just take it down oh wait it probably counts this tree doesn't it wait can i not even i don't think i can oh jesus i'll make my own stairs up or you know what i'll just build on yours that makes a lot more sense i guess i could have just done this from the start but whatever wow really i was hoping for something and where's the dungeon i fear nothing [Music] what's that sounds like a flyer a mosquito oh what's that over there oh another blob great death to the blobs you're dead son we got some more oohs well there's bjorn what the [ __ ] fudge is that thing the dickens the wraith yo back up ah at the power and got an enemy on

but i don't baby come on everybody's rooting for me to die feels bad are you that's the end of the swamp what the fudge not one dungeon oh land ahoy oh and it looks like a swamp to the left please tell me it's a swamp i think that's a swamp that's a swap we found a new one all right um we're off to become a legend viking can't see a darn thing oh hello nice one ab let him know there we go swear to god if we're getting not gonna get another dungeon i wasn't looking run from the blob [Music] now i'm blocking these moment all right i took the aggro don't worry what it was just three times in a row my shield wasn't shielding i mean it was just glitched then i died boy yeah as as one does hopefully uh get this portal up and this would make our life a lot easier yeah otherwise we have to go sailing back trust me it ain't a short ride on a raft not even not even a nice like mid-level boat like a freaking raft back in business boys oh the hammer that's right let's go ab big oh we got a dungeon all right it's about time i can't even is this a joke i was telling those look like they're responding from the body thingies the body uh piles what about them those body piles you saw me hitting that's the spawner for the draugrs it looks like oh shoot sunken crips oh boy i already hate it here oh and it's water too oh it looks sick though i'm gonna make muddy scrap oh my god i'm already on fire oh warm well that did a lot of damage to me yep i'm gonna die yeah i gotcha i got you easy there's spawning right there there's a i think there's a body pile yep there's a body pile down there i got a heal it takes a lot of help got it oh you filled it nice uh little two i think oh it's upgrade mine all right we got ancient bark and poison arrows so the ancient bark i believe we need that oh withered bone that's a new item where'd you get that on the ground it was like a giant like long bone called the withered bone that's hot all the muddy by hold on this there's this pile i guess we'll when we get back but the pile supposedly is where we can iron copy them we have to swim and i hate it thanks ah fudge why does it always oh it's because i was swimming sweating on my shield oh oh you killed the light oh that's a lie [Music] guys there's so much damage what do we got we got scrap iron no pog 190 pounds how much it's 19 of them drop me i didn't pick it up i didn't pick it up yet oh come on you could pick up the arrows we need something with to hold all the weight yeah that's pretty heavy we can we can carry a bunch of crap between us we just once we find it you bring it to the portal we go through it empty all of our inventory and then just sail back does the um whatchamacallit does the boat slow down once we start putting stuff in it like the carriage um i don't know i don't think so though but don't call me i guess we'll find out oh this connects to another room i'm just putting some of the new items in in a ram chest in here until we make a dedicated one for him yeah we need some dedicated wham for the sub try me think our our new swamp two base should be invincible now so oh we can also make chats at the swamp base and and just make that like our dedicated like potion base like that's where the chests are for the potions and stuff what the fudge is going on here oh my god did you like the new backyard yeah it's way better it's not all hilly saved flop nearly the swamps are so cool but they're so scary very spooky i almost died as soon as i logged in and check out the first swamp i got poisoned and um oh yeah yeah i was left with like two hp and then chad was telling me that i got lucky that but it wasn't like a set for that it hurts i think the poison hurts more than the shaman's poison oh my god yeah kill me the shamans usually do like 1.2 per tick these ones do like 3.6 yeah it's a lot it sucks buddy apparently the merchant like when you're close enough shows up on your mini map automatically yeah he looks it's like a little bag or something like that well when we find him we gotta make like a house just right next to him or on top of him i'm starting to think he doesn't exist he's a leprechaun all right blob's dead all right dragger time you know come here though like the whole beginning of the game is like all right it's just dwarves and trolls and then you come here it's like they introduce you like five six new enemy types and i've heard uh the wolves in the mountain terrain are pretty rough oh they're chasing there's one chasing me and rob you can tame them i had full health and one hit took me down to 14. rob unfortunately took the l there but he didn't get a little tail i've seen some videos on how to tame them they're pretty they're pretty cool i'm assuming it's gonna be more of like a later on thing though because they don't really follow you around to do anything whenever i see the fire though i just think of uh big trouble little china green flame so are we going back on the boat we'll have to we have to yeah with the iron yeah we can also see if there's any more um dungeons in this swamp and then we need a we need a hundred iron nails to make the next level of boat the actual long ship yeah supposedly 10 iron gives us a hundred nails or some something like that yeah 10 iron bars it's one bar for 10 nails i think oh i want the long bow and i want it yesterday oh shoot we got a we got a giant mountain biome here too oh shoot i found the planes oh that's not good yeah we have plains and mountain right next to the swamp where is fruit i can't see him oh um i found plains next to this oh and mountains oh the planes are newer i haven't been there yeah apparently this is the last biomes oh god oh crap mosquito just bit me for half my house oh no oh my god y'all but if we kill it he's dead oh you can't even escape in water yeah they fly that's that's kind of a thing this they went right into the water and just yeah let's see if let's see if we can see if we can kill this thing well planes lasted about three seconds i mean if we all try and kill it maybe we can see what it drops well ahead of the game you know yeah my assumption is it's on the other oh hold on let's i got we got a little name death skeeter oh [ __ ] and can't confirm it hurt we're going to go raid this mosquito and be a boss that one single mosquito we're over here like prepping our stats we must be clearly desperate we gotta make sure we get the right buffs why are we doing it two by two we just could be a lot quicker oh my ocd what is this don't worry oh we need pillars oh yeah i was gonna say we need to support this or it's gonna fall yo what up dude look at him swimming like hey what you guys building over there would you guys get closer what about the form hey is it cool if i come up there with y'all yeah oh god all right we all gotta go over there and fight it together you ready wait where is it over here i know it just kind of showed up and ganked me out of nowhere i was literally right here and i just heard i got my bow out the bow is out yeah me too the plane is the last biome we're supposed to be in up there i like that we're doing this in in the absolute darkness do you see it what's right there's goblins wait wait there's what yeah just go for the mosquito where's the scoop crap where is it ready oh i see it oh my god oh he killed it we got it i got it i got another one yeah we can make needle arrows oh my gosh goblins come here wait where are they yeah [ __ ] get your stamina back and then we'll try and do a sneak attack everybody thinks they can handle freaking out and then all right where are they goblins are scared of the shore yo i got one a quarter oh we can't swim across with no stamina oh oh my god he just lit me on fire i'm outtie i'm out they're swimming they're coming they're following us yeah oh wait wait wait wait while they're in the water yeah we're in the water we're on the water bait in the water maybe use a different arrows have a fire one yeah well once he gets out of the water he won't be able to put himself out we can kill him we can kill him we can kill him we can kill him we got this one we got this one we got this one boom got him all right what did he drop what did you drop what do you think give me give me black black metal scrap oh [Music] we got a dwarf shaman helping us out all their beef in the stamina i would help hold on it's okay he's he's at like one touch there we go got him let me see what he got i got black metal scrap pogba that's a one star behind you yeah oh i know oh he called all right oh wait no he's going in the water yeah in the water baby yeah yeah yeah yeah i already swam across oh okay here oh he swims fast he swims fast he swims fast i'm baiting him he don't know i didn't make the here for nothing let's go get away from my brother a little oh god yeah i hit him in the water oh there we go all right dude he's above that's a bubble but now we got a schwann and an oh watch the brute ready yeah the feeling just absolutely styled on them yeah oh wait now he's coming for ab no no boys i'm out of stamina all right we got him yeah yeah probably just more black yep black black metal scrap yeah stack it with mine here you go oh you want to put in the boat yeah you only had three i mean how many do you have i got two from that uh i've only got one oh and you can't teleport it no i think this is even more late game than oh i'm sure oh yeah i don't know like a nice black helmet or something this is gonna be like the cool like world of warcraft dragon bang shield i mean there are more of them if we want to go gank them pray for us all right grab it you don't got a top grab got it all right i'm grabbing literally everything i have literally 1027 weight on me oh oh god so what is this i'm hearing about murdering all my friends oh [ __ ] boys can we get a refund on the ship [Music] you
