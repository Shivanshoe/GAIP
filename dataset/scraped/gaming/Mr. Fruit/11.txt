in today's dream team the dream team is here for the greatest event next to or right behind of course the super bowl the dr okay third thing the dream team summer games of course is super bowl world cup four fifth sixth okay well it's an important event i'm not gonna rank it because shadow opens his only fancy dad no no no no that's that's the number one we were talking about now here's what you're probably expecting like sick iron banner dream team iron banner bats except doesn't really work because the way the scoreboard is in this game mode is literally essentially have you dunked if so you're at the top if not you're at the bottom and there's only one spark and there's only so many chances to score so it would inevitably i don't know maybe you would have rather seen it devolve into rob picks up the spark we all run away and say rob i hope you die kind of situation but also it's a little counter-intuitive so instead we're gonna build each other up instead of breaking each other down we're playing as a unit as a team our goal is the same all i know is i'm praying to god no we were supposed to all say the goal at the same time oh what's the goal to put the goal is to make money yeah cause friends along the way here we go rob i don't understand this this is time it's really tough figure out and self-diagnose us and just think worse case scenario which i've been doing give me the flash cards but okay well on w and webmd and just say i have every sort of rob doesn't assume i have hemorrhoids for everything my stomach hurts it's probably cancer seriously i was like that i was like i'm dying like that's it and they were like like okay so i went to the doctor and i peed in a cup i'm surprised my pee didn't burn through the hole or through the cup you know like that was like i cup i see you pee i see you pee have you ever pee in the cup yeah that was like my third or fourth time like okay because i got like drug tests no dude like no well i was super dehydrated this like he was like can you pee in a cup and i was like i'll try uh out comes like like i just found like a gold mine it was like dude it was like a brown gold like i was so dehydrated i didn't even want him to test that urine because i knew they were gonna say something about it and it was gonna be bad i don't know how me and fruit like take so go to such lengths to take care of ourselves mine it just ends up congratulations you're just fat uh fruits is congratulations uh you have severe depression and also you have physical ailments uh that are never gonna go away and rob's is like yeah actually my body like for 26 years now it's finally catching up to me yeah it seriously is like it really did and i was like all right well i guess i have to change my lifestyle what the hell is that the bare minimum what is that helmet the don chorus bro that is freaky i don't know it's kind of sick hey i've been waiting for an orange for like eight years dude we're like we're not going to get ornaments for those stupid the d1 gauntlets oh that's right oh what it's an eight-second respawn yeah oh my god it's supposed to be a team-based game mode you can you can rest oh um yeah we're gonna have a member folks up a little bit here the spark runners in coming and uh jesus christ we're kind of in trouble over here my entire team my entire fire team's dead here captain captain i don't know he's on me captain watch out clutch it out okay i'm on i'm running i got him oh this one's in the middle of the map okay hold on help the pain a little bit actually i just killed the guy what is this why do i have a black screen did i disconnect no no we transmit so it's a it's a soft reset so that way momentum or something yeah oh let me then let me just stop the momentum of the [ __ ] game like what it has been a little yeah a little hey sports bar i see you and i appreciate you if you could suck me softly it's something i don't love you swords for it's just that i'm also trying to win i was afraid i don't know that because this is the last day you're grabbing the thing that people would be kind of no are we even fighting it is a six stack okay if we had two of our stacks it would be a six stack i think i bodied them you go rob i would like to point out though that you're like why doesn't my bow one shot that would be miserable frankly if that were the case i'm gonna collect the thing i'm gonna go okay i'm watching you my side i'm watching you i'm collecting it on the wither horde bold okay i like it okay and the another guy tried the exact same thing okay okay you gotta try so hard panic don't panic we you see this is the tough part about when i'm usually solo queuing in this game mode if you're down one it's like a 50 50 one person jfk yo we're going to be we're going to be the first team to come back from 2-0 deficit no one's ever done it i think that's probably i think people are probably no no i don't think so i think rob's right this will be world's first genuine questions genuine questions this dude killed me he already has the iron lord title what are you doing is he still playing what are you doing do you hate yourself you know the kids are gone like he's looking for he's looking for a reason to have social interaction over the thing he's like sorry babe i gotta i can't even kill the iron lord yet but i'm preparing this has to be honestly the stupidest thing i've ever seen you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna play i'm gonna play iron banner and show all those arm banner kids tyler i can get meanwhile like no one's looking at it his kids are like dad why don't you send us any like why don't you talk to us anymore the wife is like this is what this is why i went to go play that dude who plays final fantasy he kicks me down way better and then like those final fantasy players know how to do it pink parses and you like like you can't even see your dps numbers and destiny just the fact that now you've already gotten the title so then why are you here six-stacking you know what i'm saying like it actually killed you you're actually so dark oh my god here we go okay wait wait wait wait this is it this yo let's go we got them to push push push kill kill push kill kill people okay i i'm supposed to carve a path for me i think i think go all right they're on response let's go let's go this is the momentum this is the momentum i'm going for the duck oh my god this is it this is it we actually did okay we're coming back from three one deficit there's a three zero let's make it let's embarrass them oh we got six minutes to do it my parents embarrassed me when i was a kid i heard the way my parents say i embarrass them that's also valid i you know either or we don't need to quantify whose embarrassment is better jesus dude my destiny two timing man if i kill someone in this game mode like they should know that you're bad so how come like you just kill us once and because you're so close to scoring like you don't we don't even get a chance to kind of rebuttal uh the rift is on us well that's that's the part of it you have to raise and i mean that's why we scored last time though i'm raising my teammate nice spark baby oh my god oh my god wait i'm getting a rez are you getting a rest i'm a t that they are they have a sniper i keep getting these friend invites can't we be friends i'm the fake rabbit yeah these are fan accounts from behind me what that's a good job all right oh my god you guys are gonna love this no don't tell me they're just farming us no you're gonna love this um yeah the gamemode glitched out wait what there's no there's no more spark yeah it's now four minutes of deathmatch enjoy this is for are you serious the rips can you glitch out yeah yeah they hey they had to take a couple seasons to rework this rob all right big pvp renewal focus here okay rob listen uh this is i want you to understand something okay bud and this has been gnawing in me for a while and i really want to talk to you about okay because like this is unacceptable not just from you from the community um if you could please stop being mean to the multi-million multi-billion dollar corporation um that would be appreciated yeah so this it can happen and unfortunately literally makes it so we can't make the comeback although to be fair it was like that optimistic no wait we are free to do this again you know what a what a way to do what do you know it's like it's like i'm getting it's like i'm at the dentist's office they're like hey rob like you have a scheduled root canal today and it's like oh that's great and it's like yeah but you're gonna have uh the debt uh not a dentist do it like yeah hey rob um yeah like you're beautiful it's just gonna last for three hours yeah you have teeth coming out of your ass oh wow really what we're gonna do yeah we're gonna sit here and watch you die like oh no you're gonna help me right like no like that's out of my wheelhouse but i think the community was a little nicer like maybe um i agree the multi-million dollar corporation has feelings too dude cut this [ __ ] out of the game like what are we doing this guy's emotion nice with him like let's just like let's cut to the chase where's the cheese and how do i cut to it well you can try farting isn't that cutting the cheese okay you know i thought i had uh but i've learned if you have appendicitis you can't fart really yeah they saved me from trying they say like uh they say because any kind of stomach pain any any symptom that says stomach pain i just go oh i have that you know you know what you know it must be the best thing to have is like anal parts like i i always imagine what's anal warts you want to know what anal warts is there is one tryhard amongst them careful he's a saucy box look how you've had wait so how often does this this is him this is the try hard my brother in christ you are kring you are so cringe my dude yeah i'm giving him the bag she here in trihard like that so wait after this four minute after this 40 seconds do we go to the next round no it's so no it's just it's it's 10 minutes and highest score wins he's oh i was gonna say it's different person or first to five oh my god i love how the first game we get into this is what happens bro this is so dumb you can't ride this stuff you can't i feel like this is exactly how it should have gone this hurts my appendicitis hey you know what this is what it's about we're all here we're all vibing we're all playing this is what i like to see i'm gonna go to the hospital and be like hey like why do you have appendicitis and i was like i played iron banner once and i'm like oh oh the spark glitched out yeah so that was iron banner it was yes if you have got the iron lord title god damn it good for you like you need to go do like a marathon i'm not saying good for you holy [ __ ] that is crazy just wait if you've done it freelance i i applaud you okay so we just gotta bum rush to spark look we gotta play as a team where's the the communication with her hordes everywhere everything hurts it's just it's it's it's honestly iron banner wither horde featuring rift oh they just shoot the wither horde on the rift so you can't sit there and pick it up oh my god i love this game because noticeably there has there's a lot okay there's a lack of game mode so like for instance in this one like banner shield is actually a really good super to run because you can like literally shield your runner to run in there's some cool things to do i don't like the wither horde but it does give some things the ability to shine because otherwise literally every other pvp game mode is team death match but we call it something else yeah we got it like yeah there's got it there's got to be a better there's got to be a better game than this like like there has to be a better capture of the flags there's got to be a better objective playlist than this like like there's got to be something like this can't be the easiest well actually giggs had an interesting tweet that i shot where he was talking about like the spire stars raider whatever you have like these these like orbs you throw and dunk and he said it would make for a perfect uplink game i don't know if you ever played that call dude like a basketball yeah that would be fun or just capture the flag or just like normal ass games or hear you out not have a rift that while it was like a comp playlist uh style i feel like destiny is as best when like it doesn't take itself seriously and like even trials does not take us all that seriously and this is trying too hard okay all right we got a couple kills go left i think so yes sometimes this game tries so hard to be something that it knows it's not i am so weak i have to i'm here there's a guy coming behind me yeah you got plagued oh my god okay oh i like the play yo yo get robbed rob can get me the chain ah i rise i realized i was rezzing instead of grabbing the thing but i don't think it was okay well you were trying to be a homie and i appreciate that well if you stay alive i'm almost here brother watch out there brother i'm here brother backup's here brother and then backup's about to die brother i gotta kill brother i got people kills brother people that play wither horde seem very fun at parties like i feel like it's the meme and it's like she's with her horde yeah and then they're like hey who wants to play jeopardy the twist on the meme is he's in the corner alone because he's like they do know that i use wither horde and they're all just turned against him well see now we can just kind of win if defense right for five minutes or just score again and it makes life a little easier see the crowd would this is the part the crowd goes to the defense except the crowd is all sleeping and doing something else and watching other things sickness go robert okay that's a kill i got a kill they're flanking us that's another kill wait what god's gonna pop mr fruit i'm grabbing it wait yellow key though you'll run with me i'm dead oh okay i'm alone i don't know if i can make this with response i can't i wanted to but i can't i'm coming back don't give up that's the team play this reminds me when i played soccer once i actually i i threw the ball back to the goalie because he had a better chance to clear it and like i was like nine-year-old i was nine and it like blew everyone's mind yeah they wouldn't let me play goalie anymore because i was so bad at it like they tried and they were just like let's maybe not let this do play goalie you know i think they lied because it's just i don't i i refuse to believe that no one's better at [ __ ] i mean that's true but you're not in the sense of soccer okay that's a nova bomb which means your boys in your boobs zero we're actually is this a six stack they all have irons in their names and stuff like weirdos um it is a five stack ah i have super boys you know what that means get the riff push that gin push them sorry is this the first time rift has been back in a while since destiny won yeah yeah let's put it a while like uh let's put it back that's like the who sings that yeah let's let's put that back into it let's keep it that way like sure i guess the guns are fun uh let's knock it off okay okay we got it it's super time although we might not need it but it would be cooler if we had it oh there you go okay there we go blue keep it going i'm with them i'm with them i'm pushing i'm pushing oh my god dude it's actually so free yeah that's kind of stupid if you win like your first fight you just pick up the spark run and dunk and then it's like like now let's wait 20 seconds that's why i don't like this map is because it's the like it's this is the snowball is like that like you win the first fight they don't even have time at least the other match is so small that you can make it to the rift yeah but like if someone's smashing your [ __ ] face in what are the chances right well that's what i'm saying the solo queue experience they've given up on my teammates do i grab the spark by the way yo mr obj over here shoes mister worldwide i was going for the face it's so [Music] a moderate amount of things and none of them good inspiration like even when we win i'm like okay because you know what like you know what sounds better than this and you guys are gonna think i'm crazy i think sparrow racing league iron banner makes more sense see i still love sparrow racing yeah but that's never gonna how have i not killed anyone what the [ __ ] was my what was my super doing get him rob let him know i okay wait wait i have a minute until the spark will kill me that leaves a minute and a half left this is what i call tactical you want to see something real tactical rob we're gonna hold it here and in 35 seconds it's gonna kill me except i'm gonna play ball i'm gonna jump off the map that's halo three stretch can't we just score and end the game so wait if you hold that for too long you die yeah i have 15 seconds probably oh i have until now oh my god he got it oh oh you didn't play it sweet thanks mister i thought it was really bad he killed me midair yeah they're going to dunk that that's a version like your i like your idea of throwing i'm making it more unfortunately i think you i think you actually threw is the first okay to be fair though if they can score three more times a minute and a half we deserve to lose i'm giving them i'm giving them the spark of a hope you like you can't spell rift without terrible so you can't spell rift without i have anal hemorrhoids blue if you say that i'm going to start looking on webmd for some symptoms and if i have those because like i have at the moment i have appendicitis i think i have acute liver disease i think i have uh maybe you just haven't been forgotten let's go we're carving this game 45 seconds runway through a trip mine and a throwing knife we're going around the globe there's a guy in front of me go go rob two of them you got this you got this rob i defended you nice let's go i did some weird flippy thing you did a nice little bag see that's a little bit more fun but still pretty bad like that's a little bit more like stomach see that one was we won so that one was better in my eyes on a scale of one to palatable that was carl's jr ah i mean that's a good way to put it except how do you say that palatable yeah i would have said palatable is it palatable pal palatable palatable english major dude i just say yeah brain cells are like boom right now like like in order for me to do this right now cindy was like what are you going to go do i was like work so [Music] tweeze hair out of my ball suck like i mean i'd rather do this than that what blue said so i mean if that is something that the bungie people want to take and be like hey like somebody said that they'd rather play ib rift and have their balls tweezed like yeah well see that's see that's productive because like you ever had some nice clean balls like that changes it man that's true see i just farted dude that means i don't have a pencil let's go i've never been happier to hear you fart dude that's good i will say it was not cool what they did to our boy kevin that crossed the line what'd they do to kev i know if you remember our boy kev like the developer cav oh that's right yeah he like somebody like mentioned something about like or titan's ever gonna get twilight garrison back he's like no don't get your hopes up we believe that that's like the warlock's identity now and then he got harassed so bad he had to like completely delete his twitter oh toecom yeah that's what oh i thought you're talking about kev here's the thing right it's like titans haven't had the air dodge for like six years like i think you can let it go guys wait can you wait bring that back what did he say because i saw people like man well he was just saying that like they won't get it back they believe that's the warlocks identity now and i even i was upset i was like man i want twilight garrison but there's a difference between man that sucks and then sending him death threats and everything to the point where he has to just like erase everything and disappear people yeah that's why like i don't want to be having any kind of destiny opinions except that this banner riff sucks so if you guys have any death threats uh twitch.tv you know where to start make sure you twitch prime and then say [ __ ] and your twitter yeah it'll be in sub only um but don't worry there's a way to get around it you sub i'm gonna die this map is huge yeah oh this is the map this is like the new map right that your channel is like it's based off of the disciple yeah i was watching uh i was watching piercing play this map and he was like he's like let's hop in guys this is the newest map that we've had in three years and he goes all right i like like how it looks he's like whoa you can go underneath here like it was just so funny it was like jesus well the sad thing is we've been it's two and a half years man for one new map something yeah so like anything like oh thank you thank the lords yeah and he was like whoa there's like an underneath section here like that's cool like there's worms oh god i see him he's down he stands down keep pushing i choked because i couldn't see past orbs there was a lot of visual clutter oh my god rob i'm going huge i'm going here i just went huge dude that's the csgo right there shout out to get you that's my cs go uh mvp song so i feel like that i see that csgo lineups man they're helping look at that hey hey every 30 minutes in the morning streams dude what do i practice cs smokes uh cs smokes i was about to see us smokes that's the tweet also speaking of smoke i'm done we're uh we're uh retiring i'm going oh wait wrong yeah we did see them no no rob oh no what am i supposed to do dude i got you i got you you're back here what do you mean um i think that's good even if you bring it back you know take some time make it recreational yeah take time to realize that do we have eyes on the spark it says they're near um take them out okay we got them oh it's so free honestly can i tell you it's not free it's not it's can i tell you something in my urgent care that i said and the doctor didn't think it was very funny oh we're dead so he goes uh do you smoke any tobacco and i went no but i do smoke crack and like he like he like looked at me like like very like oh right and i started writing i was like oh no i'm like totally joking i was like i'm sorry i just normally say that because i think it's funny i was like maybe now is not the time at an urgent care with a doctor who's asking me if i smoke tobacco yeah i appreciate your honesty yeah i love craig i love lean i love lean crack leading crack morbid time kill me now yo can we talk about though the fact that whatever reason they're like dude people love morbius now let's re-release it and then it bombed even worse there's nothing like like an operation trying to get in on the joke in there and it's saying blow their butt well my favorite was this as soon as jared leto made that tweet everyone's like yep it's over now like that's yeah that's it joke's over guys like back up knock it off jared's like yes dude this is someone's like more like pure cringe than jared leto like he's just have you read about he's a he's like he was destined to be cringe he's got something weird too right by the way he's got like this weird religion thing or something he's got a cold he's also been accused in stories a lot of underage weird stuff i don't know well i do like him in 30 seconds to mars if that's anything like can we stick to that chair sure killed in that room oh my god get out go i'm better dude oh how's that not a hedgehog dude i'm so much that's an old okay really man i'm so close to picking it up and you tethered the spark like that just shows how out of touch boomers are with like meme culture that they're like wait everybody's talking about mortgages like that means they probably like want to see it right they love us [Music] oh my god dude rob you're so big and hot raw it i mean so good but i am quite a failure if you are talking about my liver oh that was never a question yeah we know that i'm gonna be honest guys i constantly am fear-mongering myself that i'm dying so this is my way of working through that well good news rob nothing like gaslighting you are but we all are just slowly you know i saw this like uh this like um high thought and it was like what if oxygen is poisonous but it just takes a long time to kill us that is like oxygen is inherently well too much or too little is yeah i was actually reading the whole post like past like 23 or whatever it's like the ozone layer that's like 20.8 blah blah blah this guy's literally standing still and i miss every [ __ ] shot it's like dude his strength is insane yeah you expect him to do something no i think the hardest shot to make is my appendicitis you just farted though you're fine that is true you can't fart with appendicitis dude this you're cringe i feel like yeah like once they get the first cap it's like the other team is just like wow like we still get participation points yeah we tried they said oh so i'll have to wait three hours to play it certainly hope not i mean i certainly hope not sorry i mean i certainly hope not hey i'll never forget that game but dude i popped off we're um we're very we're all kind of dead we're all trying to no scope this guy for the phase five clip ah we're dead whenever cindy goes robert it takes time and i always go okay wait this is combackable i know it looks i know it looks bad i know but i have super i have super i have super i have super i have one pop oh i got a riptide and i got an actually yeah we joined in progress that was i look like sheik oh yeah i was just trying to cool you're the only one who managed to carry the spark and for that you're the chosen one well you know me and mark rutsu me and mark rutson no i don't think i have appendicitis i hope i don't uh yeah my ass is pooping uh i have to go so if there's any doctors in the chat um if you know what i have i have nausea that's me smile vomiting um and some diarrhea so whatever those symptoms fall under i had we're sorry to tell you your cancer has cancer yeah like honestly like it oh pregnant uh someone in my chest pregnant ah that was my second if we eliminated uh ultra cancer it was yeah it was pregnancy yeah it was cancer eight what if i was pregnant oh my god rob you're expecting oh my god congratulations are you guys happy for me i did see this tick tock it was pretty funny well i saw it on reddit which is hilarious that dr michael morbius i hate you but this guy was like honey i baked your cake and she's like oh wow where'd you buy it what do you mean i baked it because what we don't have an oven he goes yeah mary like now how ridiculous does that sound huh and it was a whole joke about her being pregnant with jesus and saying that i don't read i haven't read the bible uh it's uh that that is a blue ride i don't read see so well i don't i just i don't so and like the bible's long dude like it will be long though i don't read that when people are like oh dude like 5 17. it's like how do you remember that like good god like they're like disjunction 517 yeah well austin three one second which reminds me because that reminds me of like job 314 or something because i just watched i've never seen the mission impossibles were you guys the mission impossible yeah literally all of them yeah i've never seen one of them oh i i actually this is probably like my boomer take i actually think the mission possibles movies are actually okay i challenge you to re-watch the second one because i just watched it it i don't i haven't watched the second one since i was like a kid i it didn't age well i don't know if it was even well to begin it was rough and so the newer one well like it's a miracle they made more after this the new ones are amazing like i do like two are just a massive 80s cringe quest but that's kind of the lure well the the first one was interesting i wasn't expecting because it was more of like like a slow thriller there wasn't really any action and then the second one was jump kick the movie they're like because i realized it was like uh jonathan wu or ever directed it he's like how many jump kicks can we fit into every action sequence they're like yes how many jump kicks it's insane dude like i would point it out and he would do eight more in one fight my favorite mission impossible is when henry cavill reloads his fists oh my god i haven't seen that i'm looking forward to that though yeah that has got to be like my most like that was an ovary burster you know what i'm saying yeah that was sick like he just like well it's just so funny because yeah they they edited the trailer two like reload sounds like it was funny but so yeah i've seen the first and second first was okay second was a big yikes to be honest so tonight i watched the third which is the new one is the third one that one no then i think the one you're it's probably like five or something yeah because like i saw the trailer for the newest mission possible when i saw a top gun and it like i think that's supposed to be seven and eight i think oh yeah because it's part one yeah but yeah i'm just sitting there watching too and i'm like it's a miracle they they green lit a third like clearly recovered but you gotta remember the standards for films but but then i was like okay well rotten tomatoes score just not the same but the rotten tomatoes score back then was it was like below 50 for both and then i looked at all the rest of the mission impossibles and they were okay it's like everyone was in agreement like yeah we just like we don't talk about the second apparently enemies like just the the bastard child it's it's mission impossible snow it's so weird impossible is one of those series that like progressively got better yeah rarity oh progressively it was like wow these movies are made and then suddenly oh wow the mission impossible movies are actually really good it's it's that's the thing too is this whole mask thing it's it's it's a meme at this point yeah it's like oh it's tom cruise wait no it wasn't tom cruise wait but it still was tom cruise and they i feel like they're just like dude this is i i just hope i look like him when i'm about 60 years old bro well and that's the other thing too his hair cut in the second one was like this weird shaggy long hair he looked older in that than he did this new top gun because of that like weird hairstyle he had going on didn't do him favorite i might join scientology i said i've been knocked up hey dude eternal life you know elrond hubbard was really onto things when he said souls were dropped into a volcano and aliens pick him up besides what south park said but like south park explains like what scientology is and but then like under it puts like this is actually what scientology believes in so like this isn't satire well it's like xenu has these souls and xenu put the souls from different aliens into a volcano that was earth but then the souls didn't die they just found the humans to go into and that is scientology she like i don't know man if i was like someone's like what do you want to believe in that would be a little more fun you know like some weird cyclops thing rather than you know this this dude just was just like yo i'm this dude and everyone's like that's sick and he's like you guys want some wine right dude that's that's time i'm just saying you know maybe there's something that flying spaghetti that dude is wicked have you guys been watching the boys the new season i have i hate it which means i love it that's the best way i i explain the boys it's like i hate it and that's why i love it because that's like claire won't watch it because she's like there are no redeeming characters yeah like everybody on that show yeah they're all like chaotic neutral chaotic evil and then she was like how was a few episodes like yeah they were great you would have hated them and it's true we were so close and yet oh no no we weren't anyways i just realized there's they need to find a better way like maybe if they dunk it like when they dunk everybody on like the enemy team who's near it dies so and then like the riff spawns on your sides type of thing or like so you're the only one that can take it out well it's just funny because your reaction the first time it happened was
