today's video is sponsored by omaze which you'll hear more about here shortly any fisters no no mercy oh my god i just need to be ahead of bless no you don't no you don't no no hey hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to overwatch 2 and today is a very special day because it's the return of overwatch gun game might not seem like a big deal if you haven't been on the channel for a little while but it's what put a lot of the overwatch content on the map back in the day i'm also just a feigned for gun game and also so you're like ah whatever i played that in a workshop well here's the thing whenever watch first released we didn't have workshop for a long time so we had to we had to do gun game ourselves scuffed gun game and with the pvp beta they have a lot of things disabled and there's no workshop so we're throwing it back oh gee gun game in overwatch but with all the changes in overwatch 2 and sojourn so on and so forth and the rules are simple well for me for my friends you'd think it's like solve cancer or world hunger i don't know get a kill with a hero move to the next uh in this specific gun game we're going according to rose so you start top left and then you go through the row ending at like lucio and then you come back bottom left to the bottom row of tanks move on and then end on zenyatta in order to move on you have to be the final kill cam but whatever your name has to show up in the kill feed for the kill and once you do you go and jump off the map and switch to the next hero if somebody kills you while you are trying to kill yourself that counts for them caveats are if you get killed by the same hero you have to go back one or if you get killed by an ultimate but caveat to the caveat if you get killed by the same hero but after you've gotten a kill and you're trying to jump off the map it counts as a kill for them but it doesn't count as you having to go back that makes sense and that's just about it and yeah the first one to get the kill on zenyatta then wins so these are always really fun let's get in today's video is sponsored by amaze and i'm excited to be able to work with omaze again to offer you the chance to win
