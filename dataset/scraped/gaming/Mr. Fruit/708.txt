hi ad Holdren my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 season of the worthy a new season means new content and new exotics that's right I'm talking about Tommy's matchbook a brand new and you're gonna hear me right here auto-rifle you guys know me i have i have a weird thing for auto rifles say I look to my little friend intrinsic trait ignition trigger sustain fire with the weapon overheats it increasing damage but burning the user it also has hammer forged rifling extended Mack it straight heatsink overheat damage is reduced while not aiming-down-sights stone aim goal and hand-laid stock increases stability and that's right it has a hundred in the mag so I'm excited to show it to you I'm also just a happy camper because they buffed out our rifles in general so we gonna be seeing plenty of Auto rifle videos in the future while I test everything out more like the season of auto rifles am i right oh by the way look at what they've done to my boy when they put out the table I was like ok nice meme yeah it turns out no meme it's so bad I'm not even I'm not even gonna buy it for a bit and that says something I have actually got my grind on now I'll have you all know I've gotten Rasputin heed easy to level one it's pretty painful but I did it and I can get to like 966 light right now which isn't fantastic but I need to start grinding for trials this weekend I'm also gonna be using the doom archers this was purely just a recommendation from Sonic I guess they increased the chaining of this by like 8 meters or something so we're gonna combine this with human missile and see how it goes oh shoot it's the anomaly oh the PTSD is coming back oh oh new hunters look so sick they look like a Titan more than the freaking Titan Stu it's not important look at this is Tommy's matchbook so let me show you just how painful this can be okay so let's 80s once you hit this threshold you can't hurt yourself anymore but it happens a pretty quick increased damage well I'm not sure just how dramatic it is but I'm good yeah I was gonna tell you this this anomaly ain't it chief didn't like it in d1 probably won't like it now but at least I know it it's familiar actually it's not that I don't like is just the only thing that people ever use was friggin shotguns so what do you expect out get me out of here uh okay I'm gonna use the cover and used to cover but wait a second build up my mail I'm just dead there's nowhere for me to gain an advantageous just get it get it going screw it I'm gonna totally just spin it up oh wow okay that did decent damage 31 to a dome but this faster fire rate if you're spun up you're gonna you're gonna melt in but problem is you're pretty much always in one shot territory so that is the issue there and if I choose to hipfire that's how that goes the hipfiring perk seems much better in PvE pretty much absolutely useless in PvP okay see that wasn't bad we barely started to get spun up I'm just I'm letting him okay yeah I don't know what I'm doing everybody and mama who develop jug on the double you know I'm damned but I will do this search and I hit literally literally no one anomaly is also terrible for Thunder strike will do I know where I can even get to freedom shoot him I can't I can't I'm seeing red everywhere Kim red on the screen right on the radar red everywhere ah okay I'll cyst wait wait why are we dying who's dying what's happening oh I'm overwhelmed what I'm just gonna hold the trigger down baby I'm holding the trigger down come on now I'm burning I'm burning wait a minute this is 800 IQ too bad I'm not a warlock is this it is a healing rift I could just keep damaging myself loss don't challenge that sniper you know what's the best part I hurt myself so much I would just put any sniper and body shot range so I'm sure they're pretty happy with me for that this feels like the sweet business where I just have to start pre firing around every corner except then I just I weakened myself every time it's probably pretty decent in PB though god I wish I was a warlock though it this oh another Auto rifle my man see he didn't have to spin up though and he just destroyed me he just deleted my Cheetos no no no no no no no no no no oh my gosh the king in the north whoever he is he is creating friggin where are you King in the north oh there's a there's an older light as you say give me give me all that skirt just throw that over there oh I hit something not for much okay I'm out skirt oh my god okay whatever we're just gonna spin her up bring a spinner up and we're gonna just get absolutely destroy I bring anomaly bag said nobody as far as I'm aware okay okay we won though I'm about to thunder crash somebody but um well this reminds me of this does remind me you're screwed yeah I'll take two kills why not it reminds me of d1 all over again we're playing on anomaly and I have a Supra that I have to pretty much I'm only ever gonna get like one or two kills from it's not a roaming super but I chose this fight I'm just gonna hit five I'm just gonna hit higher okay maybe if they stay within the coffee you know what I'm saying I I can't say it because well it D monetize the podcast not I wanted to do monetize this episode wait a second wait a second maybe I'm a liar I've lied about a lot of things in my life and maybe this is just the next thing but a hip-firing ain't that bad chief well well well give me heavy ammo I know it's not a video on heavy ammo but I mean if I can who want that Nova bomb though yeesh you know I'm saying we've all been there brother we've all been there Oh God and prepare the spin-up why me why'd he go after me I wasn't even the one shooting bro it's like all those obviously staged Chinese prank videos whatever we're like they're like sitting in class whatever and somebody like hits him on the back of a head and then like pretends not know so he turns around and looks at his friends like what the heck dude okay why did I walk into that but then he like beats up his friend for no reason there's what a subreddit for that too if you have no idea what it's called I think it's called like staged Asian gifts or something it's a thing there's tons of them anyway not the point Paul Micah let get me out here melting with an auto rifle though where was the last time you saw it huh when was the last time now just imagine if they bring my baby my boy the doctrine of passing back oh is this see I don't know what the meta is i like autos and autos are fun but i don't know if it's gonna be good enough that this is what if she use trials these clash games do go the distance though my goodness oh you weak I didn't have to spin up ok yeah shoot ok but I will spin up here ok screw you and you're feeling yeah hold on hold on hold on with new auto rifles of the seminar that is that the doctrine I mean it kind of looks like it that would be amazing easily probably top three weapon for me and destiny at least do you want you don't agree with me you're wrong I need to sit in this healing rift so I can burn up yeah yeah I was gonna say where is where my bullets going are they just evaporating cuz I swear I'm I'm hating my target my aim shouldn't be the issue oh jesus a spectral blades should we start panicking I'll help you friend yo ok ok yeah the hip is actually really tight on this I don't know why I was so against it I think that's just the play otherwise you just kill yourself so fast it wouldn't even let me exit the match hello ah cheese the student looking like a Crayola box over here and they hit exodus blue oh shoot throw back to nasty light if you're at oh gee you know what I'm talking about uh I'll check it out here I go no I need to I need to will you will you jump Titan okay ready suppose I shouldn't be allowed to use that melee it's just it never goes well mmm I just spawned sure this is a Wendy's weight is hiding behind this pillar actually spin her up baby spin her up yeah okay feels like it's been forever sand you've been go harden good to see you again buddy it's over yeah oh wait have you helped my match book is good enough ain't it you're the real one Oh what are you doing hiding I feel like you over overheat or whatever yourself a little too quick interests me because that feels cuz it feels kind of like how it is I would have oh my god they're all over there wow this isn't even a fight team how's it going have we gotten like two to kill up three kills now [ __ ] those down very very Burdett Burdett the word that went up by roberto bird and we're also down a player likely you don't want to fill the game for us breath okay we still have 14 points I really must be the only people getting killed here oh yeah bro hey this hipfire is it was surprising mmm Oh somebody joined the match hello he's gonna see how horribly it's going then to be like a farewell dude March is at it again you you know do marches ain't paying off yet that's because I've like never uses melee and I've literally eat connected with is Shiro people so far so yeah of course they're not doing anything one must hit with them in oh really it's just shotguns are so fun I love shotguns when I think of like pinnacle Destiny and like fun in crucible I'm like yes shotguns I've seen we really got mercy huh it really did be like that oh I got the kill of hope you missed what GG's I guess perhaps it's time we throw it back to El Clasico but oh well back on exodus blue I see you yeah good good we gonna run it back you know last game was just rough I don't have to worry about teammates not appearing for playing okay I got 80s for this guy but then I just I die so fast where's this guy hiding you sad about okay here we go please don't that can well else would he just be actually challenging me and running up to me oh that's right beat the newer maps they released to Walt the new bolt maps they released just feel like they're even more more made for shotguns well I mean anomaly of course I mean that like was the shotgun app about as close quarters as it gets no breathing room ever now check this out [Music] did I didn't get going in going in you're gonna have a shocker don't you would you look at that ah ha but you missed your one chat for the first time in forever so I actually gonna kill you I'm noticing a trend if I don't get one actually let's count how many times I've pretty much just died without having any counterplay well except for that but the cirrhosis is better than my auto it can do like just as much damage if not more without hurting yourself again I like the gun and I think in PvE it's cool and it has a has a cool style but I think the the damage to yourself is just too intense to make it anywhere useful in PvP and you have to like free start pre firing like this I'll plead noop you lost to an auto rifle ver if an auto rifle oh oh nice pistol who stole my kill you're sure about wow how does it that was that was quick huh well I think in closing Tommy's matchbook cool exotic but not necessarily the go to pick in PvP at least it's like the sweet business where you need to start pre firing before you turn corners but then you start hurting yourself so then you're like one shot as you turn a corner against who knows what they have and then you probably done but it's a new exotic Idol rival and any love that the auto rifles get I'll take so with that said I want to thank you all very much for watching heavies is a fantastic i'll talk to you and the next one very well [Music] [Music]
