check it look at that thing though i'm gonna reload i don't need to i'm true like all you're talking about is you're just down he lacks critical information heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video i've got a cool little weapon to show you the new reclusco burr i don't know if i'm supposed to roll my arse yeah whatever it's the recluse but it's not it's it's the fun web submachine gun but everybody's been touting this thing as the brand new recluse and why is that well it's a submachine gun i know crazy right it's void 900 rounds per minute oh okay so those three things are all similar and then um mastered arms whatever perks still missing and now we're gonna bring that back because it was ridiculously broken but i do have a pretty nice roll and there's a reason it's kind of recluse like i've gotten some increased uh controlling the recoil and handling speed uh increased building reload speed now i've got a pretty mean pve roll we're gonna be rocking pvp of course but this thing is real nasty in pv i i gotta tell you because we got subsistence defeating targets party reels the magazine from serfs which now synergizes with the brand new origin trait for veist damage enemy with this weapon has a small chance to reel the magazine increase movements people aim me down sights so vice might be procking then i get a kill that reel is a magazine which gives me more chances to prague feist so on so forth and all the while i'm in combat with frenzy being in combat for an extended time increases damage handling and reload for this weapon until you're out of combat and it takes a baby a while to be out of combat so this thing's up time is practically all the time also before i hop into crucible and i'll probably throw it on camera also range mash to work you gotta love it i like that nope what yes that very clean very clean so yeah everybody's been treat as far as i'm worked to i swear everybody i've seen talk about this has their own different god role for pve i'm loving this i can't say i've taken it on many test drives in the crucible but we're uh we're gonna start today right now so look here's the thing if you love gambit that's awesome i'm happy for you i am but that's not me i can't really say the same even with its changes so maybe one day we'll figure something out but in the meantime i'll just keep melting my brain with the grind up to level 67 in the season pass not 69 so not nice i've gotten campaign done on my warlock i need to do it on my hunter but do some powerful and pinnacles on them because you can't see it here but as you can kind of tell my base light level is 1551. i believe so i'm already past the powerful into the pinnacle cap also i don't is this new i don't know or maybe i've just never paid attention but it's very fun it's a pew pew pew pew per cent oh my god the eyebrows what you doing i can't believe someone unironically bought that and is using it that's incredible now i i do have a bit of a well build so if i am able to pick up some void wells i will have extra damage here on the recluse because it is a void weapon but a lot of things got to go right for that nope nope just don't have the range you know no point my shotgun frank would probably better jesus christ okay what the fudge dune marchers looking all right all i know is i'm alive come on come on hit me with your best shot we're here we got one kill what the [ __ ] we got two kills i'm dying i am currently working on another smg to level and get a god roll on it's one of the ones you can actually just forge or craft whether it's the forensic something or other oh my so by get the god raw i mean literally just like level it enough and get enough of the material so that i can then make whatever role i deem worthy and why do you have friends dude they're so overrated this is only a three stack feels like a 16. ours is a no stack and no cap look at that thing though vice stinger is proc i'm gonna reload i don't need to i don't know how i didn't damage okay i got you buddy oh my god it is buttery smooth all right and okay that wow we actually did i'm dead now see obviously for pvp something like kill clip inter-second perk we're probably best bet you know maybe even like perpetual motion kill clip or something i don't know what the kids like these days okay real talks how are you not dead okay perfect i get out of my way dude you killed me learn some manners dude manners make it men and you're over here just get in my way like i was on the right side that's at least here in america right side of the road what you know you know using the shotgun too i just kind of put it here because it's there but uh i kind of lack range with this sure i mean this is not at all a uh pb pvp sniper but then again i'm using a pv world submachine gun so hey bring it on take on me take on me blair this isn't even a match like just call it refs like please put us out of our misery man i'm begging begging you suppressed him no i didn't maybe i don't know hey that's all i feel this game is pain be repeat so unbalanced sometimes that feels like i have a chance and i don't i'm holding on without a team should have queued up with mclaren okay i don't actually know how he did not die oh that's totally me that's totally all me that's crazy i didn't do that much damn okay i swear i'm tickling these dudes i feel like like at some point okay check this out bank shot that's that's a super okay okay so we got to be real up close and personal there don't we you know what i'm thinking we might have to pull out a gambit match i know i know i know it's true like all you talking about is you're down okay i just i don't i really don't know how that didn't kill frankly i know what you're thinking mr if that was the recluse he would have been dead in two shots and you would have been right time to kill the recluse and mastered arms practice that was like point zero zero seven seconds that ain't this i'll get suppressed we're kind of ish making a comeback i mean it was uh okay stop it stop it be mature [Laughter] somebody help me help me help me help me do these things not die good ward if you guys could grab b that would be the most optimal plane oh my god what here we go this is the pve vp actually just pve but i'm using it in pvp build class hold up well i know what i'm doing there i'm very good at me job you could not dab i don't actually know what it takes to proc frenzy and crucible but um i hate it here why are you all like this who hurt you guys suppressed melee yeah i'm gonna be i'm gonna oh my god oh wait he's kind of weak yo i got i got the i got the volatile rounds on this dude what the [ __ ] is that song i could be blue i could be green i could be violet blue sky i don't know this match went on way too long thank the lord you eat monsters for breakfast we got here it ain't not good but thanks the 112 combat efficiency though all right forgive me father for i have sent i know i know but it is to be done yeah there we go yeah i know why i never took my selling it down to destiny 2 companion app it's italy that it's so handy uh you know yeah let's go freelance i think yeah that's a safe bet speaking of which uh the meta here is um where is it just throw on galley you invade get kills with gal you don't invade your dps the galley galley does everything we love galley if you're like who's gally look at your jaw horn all right we uh defeated four opponents with the photo blast game nice oh yeah i've been very optimized on that bounty grind so let's see uh who uh defeat high value avoid volatility moat's banked brother challenging combatants submachine gun stasis i'm there baby well at this rate if i keep up that kind of performance and crucible we're gonna have to go gambit because yikes well just remember okay i'm your slightly above average joe that that brings you the real lowdown real skinny on stuff you know but it's like oh my god there's a god world you're going to go 87 and 0 and crucible let's be honest they're just freaks at the game anyway you know they could they could use a they could wield a literal potato not even a whole potato it could be like a halved boiled potato and they would go 87 and 0. okay so what i'm trying to say is uh um um i'm on the ground reporting trying to debunk this fake news yo also read some lore in the drifter that was like kind of crazy he even like his fire team or something or like some frozen planet that wasn't europa but there was like this crazy darkness we've never seen that was so powerful it just started to like shut off people's light or something but and so during the sleep or during night they would fall asleep and then freeze to death and they would be rest in the morning like they were literally dying overnight from freezing and then yeah at some point like their light got turned off or something and then it became like survival of the finish or something and he like started shooting the others before they could shoot him or something and then his ghost is like yo graft their stuff onto me let's get the fudge out of here i'm paraphrasing i'm probably butchered a whole bunch but it's pretty cool that's a pretty cool war if you go looking for it yeah that's my ted talk oh right hey funnel web pvp baby check it out see overload well okay that's just oh champion thing but the point is frenzies up would weapon boost with my well so we're doing extra damage uh frenzy's gone though because i'm out of combat i also gotta bank some notes i don't know if i have to really send over blockers or attackers so that might not really do much but here we go okay well it doesn't help when he has a giant shield and he blocks all my shots okay because i'm over here trying to show off some distance with with the vice origin poor per pork oh god i'm so ah jesus i was like oh man i'm gonna share everybody just freaking new recluse dude it's gonna be and now it's like they're like mr fruit kind of seems like you're lying and i can see how it looks like that but you gotta believe me that's not entirely true okay i have used it of my own accord in my own games while not recording and naturally frag so of course i click recording and then it just all goes down the pooper you know what i'm saying my life essentially the pooper i do have some nasty bowel movements from time to time this is true okay i'm kind of scared i'm going to die here and frankly i don't want to die here elite executioner hey great i don't know what you guys come here get out my weight quit draining those moats brother freaking give me that heavy nice but you died you died you lost 15 minutes you died it's okay oh it's it's gamer time gamers let me let me on let me let me let me i got two golly shots baby and boosh what my second shot didn't go off okay i don't know what we're doing differently than the other team holy cow we're ahead bank and uh we're uh we're winning it says we're supposed to have a an invade oh would you leave that all right i'm going to go take a fat elegant and i know mr you've we haven't seen the funnel web at all yeah yeah okay that's all i got to say about that yeah where is this dude hey you know i take you down you take me down we go down together the recruits 2.0 scuffed recluse of course because anything else is ever as powerful as their cousin we're gonna have a bit of a problem so leave this ready boom the vice thing procking freaking uh frenzy why hasn't frenzy product actually that's strange what do you see okay well frenzy's now prompt that's doesn't really make any sense to me okay we got an invader brother i'm scared brother brother why did he spawn there everybody gives me a controller [ __ ] welcome to gambit home of the tower horn how may i take your order come on you sucky okay yeah i these changes it's like hey now you damage for like two seconds and there's eight immune phases enjoy i don't get it oh yeah but i feel like i'm doing not much damage but then again i am using my smg to dps but that's because i gotta show it off dude it's cracked oh my god this is this everything i saw this painting out much differently in my head in my defense oh nice killing that invader brother oh yeah i'll say this little nightfall slug shotgun is fun but that's that's not what the video is about yeah i got you i'm a t okay yo friends guess what apparently they buffed banner shield shoot through it no shoot through it shoot oh jesus christ where is he yolo he's somewhere over there he's somewhere nice i scared him away with the funnel webb he's like oh my god is that the cracked pve roll yeah i think that's oh my god oh let's go guys we did have eight eight stacks of prime evil slayer the herod's seat what is that that sounds fun okay a trash roll what is this you fight to this damn sh damaging the invader with this weapon marks and for allies oh that's nice okay i do like auto rifles but yeah what a poopy roll i do say so myself i don't think i've ever seen a better showcase in in a gambit match before you know what we're gonna do uh momentum control yeah look uh am i buying into the hype yeah maybe everyone's like dude this is the clues here's a good roll and then i got a good roll and i'm like this is pretty this is a submachine gun yeah so i think i'm trying to sell us both on this whole recluse 2.0 thing it does work good bbe i swear to god you gotta believe me and it's good to just void because since they nerfed the whole protective light thing blah blah they're pushing people towards elemental well builds and so with ford 3.0 it's real good that it's also void okay so there is synergy oh i got an unlock give me that i do like to that they did they didn't lock anymore like i'll soon just be able to unlock them all you know i have to like reset them pretty pretty nifty also can we are we gonna buff sentinel shield bash damage or something because this thing literally does negative damage i only think it does half of somebody's health in momentum control mind you yeah that's right moment okay does this shoot invisible it really feels like outside of 10 at least in pvp outside at 10 feet i ain't doing nothing man i got to avoid these long lines of sight which is exactly why i'm serpentine avoid or dodge same thing they're synonyms look it up ah okay i'm very afraid and suddenly i'm not skirt okay they're gonna be coming this way they're spawning here and they don't expect they don't expect the recluse 2.0 baby what was that what'd you put on the door oh here hey buddy up here up there buddy yep good luck oh jesus you're not friendly how is he not what are you doing i do negative damages this range i swear to god they don't check these corners why would they i don't check this corner what i tell you nobody checks this corner they make it too easy like taking candy from a baby and i regret nothing i'm jumping over him okay i'm hiding here i'm gonna be asked i didn't know this was a thing they're gonna run right past me dude am i a mine reader yeah yeah i'm starting i'm using the synaptic web i ain't jumping into the minds of scions i'm jumping into the minds of these hunters dude these guardians guardian check it burn bright i don't know what okay wow that did oh my god skirt check it out okay wow this is am i going to get a kill i i didn't get a kill oh but there were clothes did that's all i was using it merely as a tool for movement so that i could get closer to them in a quicker fashion because that's what movement's about so i could kill them with requests it worked flawlessly what are with all these assists though i mean i guess i don't have kill clips so that's fine that a 10 kill screamish fruit yeah yeah it is you like you like okay you won't know he lacks critical information here's a triple okay you saw bro i literally turned because i was like i literally shot like five extra bullets he's dead no damage i'm not making this up dude they disappear into the ether i don't know and then the primeval meatballs butthole i don't know whatever that disappeared to telling you something sums up here man something real saucy they're trying to cover it up but i'm not gonna let him all right come here with the cold hard facts there's an enemy amongst you moon please don't kill him oh my god the triple with an autumn who is this hero i wanna shake his i won't wait what we were just like 10 points ahead now we're 20 behind what happened guys uh oh i forgot it is first to 200 though uh and when you turn a corner i'm gonna be honest with you it's it's who can click melee the fastest come here which one he's in there somewhere nope guess not i don't know what i don't know what i'm talking about i don't know what i'm doing with my life okay i've been grinding this game three minutes for like over 250 hours the past two and a half weeks so i'm losing my mind right nobody nobody's supposed to play that much of any game frankly not just destiny any game nobody helped me okay there's probably 200 if we want to be specific but it's it's a lot what it sure jesus christ is what i'm trying to get at okay you have a nice day in your bubble sir i hope it's nice warm safe i hope they got okay i hope they got insurance in there dude what a swing i don't know we're losing we're winning we're losing we're winning we won you know what is this crucible hey hey second most kills in the lobby all right all all 24 of those came from the recluse 2.0 nonetheless pretty crazy i know because as you'll see here that it's kill tracker must must be broken that's you know i need to get banshee to look at that yeah something's broken i guess the recluse 2.0 baby get it now while you can stonks are on the rise bye bye die [Music] [Music] you
