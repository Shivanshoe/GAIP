hey everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to halo infinite and in today's video a little bit of a different video mainly for me for you the experience it might differ maybe a little bit for the worse because i am using controller uh what a novelty and you're like okay what's the big deal here if you don't know i grew up on the sticks okay if you if you don't know my war is literally the reason i'm here today doing what i'm doing it's what made me fall in love with video games outside of just norman games i'd been playing my first first person shooter grinded that and that's when i first started using controller for first person shooters all the way until destiny won we're having all the wars oh this is fun like gather around the campfire kind of thing you know what i'm saying so fast forward until the end of the first destiny and i switched to pc pretty much exclusively it all started when overwatch came out started playing on the pc and i was like well i got to get used to keyboard and mouse and then destiny 2 released on the pc and it's been history from there so pretty much i haven't used the controller since destiny 1. the only caveat was some titanfall 2 on the ps4 but that was it so ironically at this point in my life i've almost been using keyboard and mouse as much as i have controller and the difference is i haven't used control in years so like okay great what a wonderful story i didn't come here for story time mr fruit my apologies you got it anyway but that's because i'm gonna hop into halo infinite on the pc with a controller having not used a controller and god knows how long and we're gonna see how it goes because notably within the community there's been some whispers some murmur okay it's not even whispers people have been chatting at each other console players are like don't match us against keyboard mouse it's not even fair you're right for the keyboard mouse players what like come on it's it's not even there was a whole reddit thread too showing accuracy and how on average controller players hit like 10 to 15 more shots on average i'm not here to complain halo has been a console game and it always will so it should cater to controllers more it's just you guys with your controllers get aim assist and bullet magnetism which help now i'm not going to say keyboard mouse don't have some advantages you know we have faster flicks and turning around and able to have spatial awareness because but you guys usually have a better shot so i'm going to see how well i can or cannot do on the controller compared to my keyboard and mouse 4a rambled on a bit there i don't know you know just look tldr because you know with with millennials and there's in the zoomers and there's ex attention spans see i even have a problem you know within five seconds they're like blah blah no gameplay he's just talking next video which is fair but if you've made it this far i'm sorry for going on song we're just gonna okay well this is not a good start controller's not even working every man has performance issues from time to time okay like this completely [Music] it's freaking go what the fudge i don't know it's plugged in the lights on like but nobody's home hello and i'm afraid to disconnect it because like people talk about how there's like a pc bug where unless you start the game with the controller and stuff like you don't get the aim assist so i'm not really sure how this will come coming to play here hello oh it's working okay i did have to disconnect the controller so if my aim's bad i'm gonna blame it on not getting aim assist because of the pc bug which may or may not actually exist i'm just using it as john's yes you know what ah screw this we're going solo duo controller now let it be known i just solo through some keyboard mouse diamond one and then the open i'm diamond four i haven't grinded since like day one i need to i need to hit onyx i don't even know if you get anything for it but that's not the point let's let's just try some controller you know this way i also know that i'm up against other controllers but i will say this doing the solo duo with only keyboard or mouse it was incredible how many times i did not get perfected to the bad time to mention too that i'm cold like my whole body including my hands and i also haven't played halo in a couple days much less with a controller strong if you're curious yes i'm pulling out all the jawns and excuses trying to see if i have any left there's got to be got to be something i'm sure i'll think of something else we're starting with strongholds i'm sorry i just i just don't like strongholds me me and me and her don't really get along you know it was a bad breakup and she got custody so okay here we go a little ogre twitch okay it's like i never laughed does this already technically oh look at that look at that oh yeah we were one shot but that was like that was finn to be a triple i i can already tell my br shot actually exists when i use controller when i'm on a mouse and keyboard it's like yay okay yeah see he perfected me oh that's did he just stack me too shadow from the ground i only really wish i was using keyboard and mouse or no controller when i'm using the br like any competitor what the what the dickens where the fudge they're at elbow oh i actually oh jesus actually don't know what my mark button is uh oh it's up on the d-pad all right that's good to know i don't need aim assist i have teammates get beat down you pathetic fiend ow yeah take those maybe that's why it always feels like their names do more you know maybe with controller i'd add some track i swear there's a little bit of magnetism there all right i'm just i'm joking i'm joking i don't mean for this video to be keyboard masks versus controller like wow he's just uh he's just mad because bad you know like i'm gonna just do that because content you know uh ex semi pro halo player now turn keyboard mouse player tries to go back to controller is not the title of this video because that's far too long uh and i don't need to know the algorithm to tell you that ain't it chief even okay all right all right all right all right enough of the nukes enough for the nukes oh nice full all right you guys can stop stop it friendly man jesus oh ready for this ah well he just didn't chase oh it's time to spank what you even took the kill you tried to take all the okay i could you're like oh my god how did he track this target that's incredible i didn't i didn't move my stick i felt the magnet system there i'll tell you what ooh maybe i'll actually be decent with the stalker right for him on uh controller because i am not good on it on pc let me tell you it is an enigma i don't know how it works frankly oh oh my god well this thing actually is ridiculou i don't think one of those shots i was really on his head all right that's the one thing about control though like why didn't it oh jesus why didn't it mantle the world may never know uh where's my br thank you how did i not oh i just there was so much visual and audio noise going on yeah i couldn't really hear there is a bit of a nice strafe around the pillar stupid oh how about by them yeah yo yo help help help help he's gonna be behind me where you at that's i'm just like i can feel some of these like yeah that is not happening if i'm still in keyboard mouse i and like all the competitive people nobody yeah yeah i tried to get the two shot melee freaking none of the pros high level players are pretty much using uh keyboard mouse coincidence no i i don't kill there with keyboard master i don't really ask i like that there is a mode where if i want to play competitively i can limit it to inputs granted i wish they would let me queue with more than one uh one other person like like the open playlist or whatever i just find it ridiculous when the controller people are trying to complain like hey don't match us with pc players if it's because you think they're they have hacks or whatever that's one thing uh but to say that you're at an inherent disadvantage against keyboard mass i hate to tell you this chief just ain't it not in a game like hey whoa not in a game like halo and like call of duty or something where it's about twitch shots and just a couple couple shots to kill that's fair but with a the longer the time to kill the more important sticking on a target is and nothing helps that much then um you've got to okay what the [ __ ] oh oh that is not friendly i don't know why what you doing down off the rack you want to see a nice snake let me show you in another in another life next time we are nearing victory to be honest i've mainly been slaying it's a rare i don't know i'm just so focused on trying to use controller that i haven't even been playing the objective and for that i do apologize friends but uh he's definitely hiding oh there he is he's hiding right there that's where he is ah but we already won darn guy we just had to win uh 28 and 13. pretty good oh my 55 like i had 60. um to put that in perspective i don't think i have ever in all the hail infinite matches i've played since release on keyboard masks gotten 55 and that was my first game on controller almost okay i don't know we just had how did we win did they just play the object oh my wait oh my god i slayed wait what oh my god i wasn't even close anyway everybody in here probably is more than 50 you will never see that in keyboard mouse never capture the flag oh i'm getting the sniper snipes baby i'm back check it ready i've got you my friend okay aim assist didn't help me that much that was oh oh i was gonna say that was pretty bad but available okay i'm gonna go in there basically i can see it's coming back at their base what the [ __ ] come here you finally heard me he's like wait why do i hear two sets of footsteps oh my god oh no nah that wasn't even i will say i probably am a little bit there's absolutely no aim assist with the sniper on keyboard mouse but i'm able to like flick whereas on the sticks i look like an absolute boomer who doesn't know how to move his aim that's nice that's real good there wait how'd you die oh that's how got him i was surprised to hit the grapple nothing else about that though was worth it nice cap lads god i'm so proud of you all now he knows that i'm here and his friend also that's unlucky round two oh perfect oh yes ah fudge i was i was like okay i'll just man cannon out of here so they don't have a sniper not on his back gotcha ooh but that is an overshield with my name on it you can actually see right there says mr fruit i know nice sniper stupid don't mind the fight though wait what oh he's got friends in all the right places wait no one killed the flag or returned go get him oh my god you're so clutch go get him [Music] that entire time and no one returned that i guess that's also on me but like come on now what what what what what i'm gonna hammer that hammer it's a nice dynamo grenade we're not gonna see it coming okay okay i'm going in there all commando which just isn't necessary i have a team i can try and utilize them but i'm not you cannot hide from zebu man ah hey yo right below you bro brush i hit him once that was actually kind of cool anybody else gonna yeah he's shooting someone by me the [ __ ] thank you for the headshot i mean you could have just pinged them i swear to god no one pings in this freaking game take this where the fudge was i getting shot from i don't know but i'm out you're doing great i'm gonna grab over shield eh i'm getting our flag back one way or the other get pooped on that's that's my sniper don't you touch it don't you touch it don't you touch it no touchy thank you that was oh i actually did kill sister okay gonna say feel like i should have gotten to kill me thank you do we have both of them i think we might have both snipers um easy painting one shot indeed where's the last one did you get the other one i'm gonna assume you got him nice work we do it both snipers push up this is the easiest flag capture of our small infinitesimal lives i think i kind of made up that second word i've heard something remotely close to it and uh it just kind of felt right i went for it but uh i'm saying it just didn't okay okay what what kind of a mating dance is this ah oh jesus christ oh okay you know we're in dire straits when i have to start capping the flag myself but if we're practically spawn camping them and no one is oh wait what where did he come from but see that was definitely a part of the controller i get shot in the back and i kind of just have to accept death i'm like who's shooting me huh i'll get you i swear you got the overshield what the [ __ ] did he just jump off with me or am i crazy i guess i'm crazy if i hadn't run out of ammo i was ready to beat and bag his body oh are we gonna grab this flag or what see i'm gonna be honest keyboard mouse i don't even bother to shoot that man because i know i ain't touching him the controller you know i'm feeling act up you know what i'm saying yo he's won nice okay the only problem though is i don't know if i'm too good at running the flag ooh i'm not when it comes to uh controlling i'm just gonna walk the dog no i'm not they know i'm here team ah oh you're the best wow let's go don't i was gonna say don't you take that that sniper too i've earned that oh fudge you know when we're screaming mlg they'd be like yo snipes taking fruit by killing them and now it's like somebody take them because did you kill oh somebody else help me thanks nice i'll run with it my son go go go [ __ ] what what the [ __ ] oh how did i not mail him yes i am but it doesn't matter cause i'm going in baby they said sniper i don't like those words let's go impeccable what wait a second why isn't that a metal impeccable no you don't okay maybe you do this is where we fight this is where they die okay you literally buddy r you actually just died to him that's incredible wow i wish i could be as oblivious to you because life must be good you know innocence is bliss or whatever like goodness gracious ignorance and in a sense i guess we're not here to get philosophical but you know are they really that different all right don't mind if i do he's gonna be like oh he's going nope i'm taking the man cannon bob stupids i'm so dead ah slide okay check this out ready ready ready ready ready ready ready oh wait i gotta hold on to it oh wow i was about to it's because i had my grapple i was gonna drop it hop onto our flags you know grab it with this with the grapple and then it was gonna be cool it didn't happen but 17 13. okay didn't quite smurf as i got a little eight assists to you know like other team player that time accuracy still over 50 percent my goodness and well let's see who we were playing diamond two unranked plat diamond diamond diamond diamonds again [Music] [Music] you
