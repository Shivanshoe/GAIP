yes this is perfect i'm going in i'm going out i'm going to fire my shot account no please hi evie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video i've been a busy boy i don't know why i emphasized boy like that which can sound weird i have been attempting to acquire the mmxxi seal as you can see here my seal collection is um pretty bad it's uh it's frankly it's terrible the only seals i have are dredgion and mmx ix now when i logged in a couple weeks ago to start this triumph and i need to start getting ready for which queen i believe my seal progress was 9 out of 28 i think i'm not going to be getting the triumph score you can skip two this is obviously what i'm gonna skip and most of the rest of these are pretty easy get kills with special things in gambit might just skip that to be honest no game but that'd be nice kill some things in playlists kill some things in crucible complete nightfall strikes like order i'm gonna be doing actually i might be trying for conqueror in a day before uh witch queen so that's certainly gonna be complete defeaters chosen in the lightning round i have done a good amount of dares in fact at one point i needed just one just one zero's chosen wrap i i sat down here and in a stack of six people we ran through six hours of dares and i didn't find one of these lightning rounds so i got a little vendetta there this one complete the catalyst of egg receptor which i was like okay well i'm gonna skip that one because i ain't getting the catalyst like with my luck uh i i had to complete the wayfinder's compass which i was pretty close to so i rang like three more astral alignments with it and uh yeah the last astral i mean i got it so i guess i'm gonna complete the catalyst i just about decided to quit destiny after getting the grenade launcher kills in pvp all 100 of them but that means i finally got the withered horde catalyst i got and i'm almost completing the hockman catalyst i got and completed the arbalest catalyst i'm about to get the no time to explain i've gotten and completed the dollar horn catalyst i also got the ward cliff coral catalyst i haven't done anything with that yet some other catalyst and currently i don't have it yet but i'm working towards the cryosthesia 77k catalyst and what i realized too while grinding pvp i'm like wait a second i never even did a video on this when it came out because much to my surprise i didn't realize i don't even think i logged in during the season of the splicer at all oops but the good news is i only need to kill nine more guardians and then defeat some combatants in uh something i don't know so that's what we're doing today we're gonna be using the cry anesthesia as i continue to grind endlessly for witch queen the crystal sidearm if you don't know what it was i didn't until i started using it liquid cooling direct hits by a charged shot instantly freeze the target indirect hits freeze combatants and slow enemy guardians now what's that well it's the ln2 burst baby press the reload swap fire mode after final blow to enable a charge shot so you get a kill with the sidearm swap it free somebody get a kill and then you kind of go on this never-ending perpetual even it just keeps feeding into itself now of course uh slight problem it's a sidearm so got that going against it but that's okay also who's out here playing the trumpet is that you huh what do you want huh you want my love and affection fine you have it here come here come on i think we need more no i don't care about your bunny dude get freaking get over here do we need one more i think we need to [ __ ] okay fine i'm also using the iceball mantels i've never never used them but i get a overshield instead of a barricade sure why not we'll try we'll start by hopping into a game of control i actually tried to use the wither horde to get the kills but i swear to god i shoot it once and suddenly the entire enemy lobby is like oh hey guys we're playing the floor is lava now we saw one wither horde so we're never touching the ground and that was my life but i gotta say i love destiny when i'm here and i got things to do and i've had a lot to do and i still do to get ready for which queen because i'm trying even harder this time like i'm gonna bounty hoard man i've never done that and i don't feel good about it but i need that artifact level because for the day one raid i am convinced or well not convinced but i am determined to not be the problem if something arises i will not be a daddy i will help my team get to a day one completion and honestly it's been a lot of fun preparing like i gotta be honest i haven't had this much fun or felt this good about destiny in a really probably since forsaken its point is it's been a while also get frozen oh get frozen oh my god you're so bad okay hold on check this out all right you see that little thing it's all revved up and then we oh okay apparently i missed the chart shot i mean why is this the rest last two minutes so the super bowl feels a little rigged i don't know man you're healing everything's terrible it's all right you know i feel like they should pity me just off the fact that um no please off the fact that i'm using a sidearm okay i want to like it i do but they make it difficult to love you know it's like i i want to give you my love and you look when you st that's fine thanks for the team shot but when you steal the final blow brother i what look at this freaking ac one dirty in there i hate it no i'm not gonna go do anything about it because you can just sit there mean friend friend i swear to god the games before this we're going really well which is like hey this gun's kind of fun i okay and that's why i was like hey you know like let's let's do a little video that's when i realized wait i haven't done a video on this this is perfect yeah i'm going in i'm going in i'm going out i don't wanna wait for our lives to be over everything hurts i won't die it's just anomaly man just you take out what like 12 maps from the game or whatever but you keep anomaly really that's what stood the test of oh my god oh my god it's time it's time gamers i uh somebody's got to do something about this ac 130 because i can't i got a part i got a sidearm don't you understand the good news is once you got the shot it doesn't go away until you shoot it so that's exactly what i'm gonna do i'ma fire my shot cam yes what the sad part is um you can freeze them and then you have free time to shoot them in the face in the el gafescus and by the but yeah you get a freezing with your your shot and then by the time you shoot them like twice in the head and do like a quarter of their health they break out already sometimes i feel like it baits you into actually uh i also haven't used my icefall mantle by the way i'm waiting to win a gunfight and then use it to like heal you've got gotta be kidding that hasn't happened so screw it give me my oh i can't sprint though uh i didn't know that yeah i'm i'm so slow wasting time all alone you were just wasting mine see there we go okay use it to get a kill and then reload to freeze again and then i'll get another kill get him yeah you stole the kill though bro that's please please please i have so much to look for the cool part too is i have no idea what the catalyst is gonna do i i really don't so once i get it it'll be like a little surprise okay i'm i'm tickling them not only that but you to know a real kicker especially if you've watched the channel for a while you know my draw problems well that splint i've had in my mouth for the past like what are like a year and a half that's the only thing that's keeping my jaw from absolutely destroying me at all times um yesterday while i was eating some food i don't know how but my dog found it i no longer have a jaw splint and frankly it's just a matter of time before my jaw's gonna start locking again so i'm trying to record some videos while i can still move my mouth and um oh by the way yeah i you know i talked to him it's like hey i might need another one because i don't know how long until i'm going to get surgery even though i see an oral surgeon here in a couple days but realistically in order to get surgery it's probably going to take a couple months to set it all up and i'm going to need a splint splits two thousand dollars my puppy had a nice little two thousand dollar treat i hope it was worked i hope it was worth it oppa i hope it was worth it no please [Music] looking like we need four more guardians guardian i just need not this stupid freaking map it's a good start as far as i'm concerned look at that i swear sidearm bullets disappear man they just they don't they just they're there and they're gone okay well maybe i should just hit the head that's the weird things you freeze but then they reduce your damage by like a third so it's like what's what's what's the point what am i doing here how did that not i hear the rains down in africa and everything it hurts i'm not shielded again does it really wait you're winning stay strong i can't stop taking the kills we got a problem huh what the what what the fudge just what all of that what what just transpired help me oh god oh jesus hey yo let's let's have a little dialogue here look at that class regeneration i don't know what what's going on there exactly but uh frankly i like it i like it a lot mm-hmm i swear everyone breaks it's like you freeze them and everyone's like and i'm back and i get frozen and it's well i guess i don't really have myself to blame i haven't really found it it's middle mouse click that is what i bound to do i don't think i could have bound it to a worse thing so yeah i'm not gonna lie whenever i get frozen i just kind of accept that that's my life now yeah now that i'm realizing it i i don't really have any room to talk or complain because it's on my phone you know it's also my fault not getting more freaking side oh come on man i probably need like two well okay for the record okay other people have been mainly taking my kills okay not not all my fault okay i i want out of here i want to go home that's okay all right well the good news is my team isn't getting kills great stuff guys i love what i'm seeing leave this i swear sidearm bullets supposed to be instant there's travel time or something there man i'm telling you i don't know what it is yeah see like the reduced don't tell me don't tell me two more look not the greatest score line but i'm gonna be anomalies trash i hate it i just hate it all right look let's make this quick okay in and out rumble game get two kills what i just kind of realized is i saw mantle going to be that good because with the new well i guess if i'm not using void because the new void 3.0 using my barricade and anyone and allies behind it or near it or whatever get a regenerating overshield so why would i use it to only give myself an overshield and slow myself when i could give my whole team shields i guess the argument would be like just walk around and still shoot and there's nothing in my way just seems like more often than not you wouldn't go for that yeah that seems like the logical thing so obviously i'm gonna keep using the iceball mantels sorry day one raid hey look you need a shield too bad i need a shield all right me sharon is caring some riff raff nonsense but your parents told you because they're weak they're soft sharon is not caring okay it's actually i was reading this reddit thread the other day and it was like what's like a common saying phrase or manche whatever that's like just not true or like people told you and then you tried and like it's just that's just not how the world works one of them was about oh wow that was a quick kill about it's like do what you love and the money will follow you guys like nope did what i love for 30 years the uh the money yep never showed up okay wow that was easy that was easy okay well if that's the case okay see where where was this last game hold up normally i'm just gonna exit the game because i i got the catalyst done but hold up i mean if while fragging i can continue to frag i i mean why wouldn't i hold up i don't know how that didn't hurt him this is good maybe i should have been using my energy frankly because also this isn't terrible for pvp but whatever i guess if i find a super my vorpal will come in wait i got five shots with this though uh it doesn't one shot body shot though doesn't i don't really remember well if you just hit heads and we'll never need to figure out the answer to that oh my dude i'm gonna be honest oh my god you're just a gamer that's some nice amos that's some very generous aim assist and it's not even as egregious as as the uh i can't i don't know what's happening yeah oh i'm popping off right now hold on yeah maybe i should use my entire arsenal isn't isn't that a crazy thought okay you know what else is a crazy thought how did that not kill that guy okay ladies and gentlemen the cryosthesis 77k i love both what am i getting shot by i don't know i don't know oh you know what i totally forgot i have to i have the aspect where if i like slide and melee it'll shoot out all the freezing projectile thing yeah it's it's so just weakening with the with the gl pull out the sidearm kill no one there i what yeah i don't know about that one chief you know what in fact this is this is our first game we played right right guys yeah there's there's nothing else to show because okay all right okay well now the grenade launcher it sends out a freaking wave dude if i shoot it at your feet right in front of you the wave should hit you look i'm just it's just it's just how this works nice blinding aid that was that was actually that was okay wow yeah okay all right well ever since i started talking about how well i was doing we've been doing poorly just don't acknowledge it and it will come naturally see there we go that's good i could have been doing this the whole it's like why am i so stubborn it's just like when i'm using a gun i'm like oh well i just got to use that gun well if it's better if i do something like this then why wouldn't i you know what i'm saying yeah oh i didn't reload i didn't realize oh my god but it doesn't matter yeah dead man's tell man what are you gonna do what's he gonna do except die that's exactly what i did oh come on man we were we were so close to greatness you okay i i wasn't entirely i wasn't really planning on just killing her the point is isn't to kill the grenade launcher it's to weaken them so that the sidearm then actually has a fighting chance because of when else in destiny do they have a fight what is this and what's the point of freezing them with the gun if i do a third of the damage so then they just break out and frankly i probably put myself in a worse position i don't get it but i'm gonna keep doing it anyway because that's the gun and i do like freezing people uh wait how did i one shot him i don't know but screw you yeah it took so long to reload and charge i was gonna freeze him i was gonna wait about to lose god i just threw it so distracted okay like what is this i'm dead well we were close oh that's him wait this is my opportunity he's dead i can pull this together maybe not no why you like this ah rip all okay we're tied wait wait a second what what what i'm throwing come on here's a crazy idea use a loadout that augments what you're trying to use and you have a better shot i.e throw some grenade launcher waves finish them with the sidearm it's crazy right because the point of it too is to get a last kill with it so you can freeze people and if that helps you get last i suppose with it why not i guess i've always kind of done this though where it's like yeah but i'm reviewing or using you know for the video x or y so don't use anything else a screw it what does this defeat vex nexus infinitude in the gospel and europa well i'm just gonna knock out two birds with one stone here real quick and also expect a lot more d2 content i have a couple to upload before witch queen and then we're especially going hard for witch queen because those first two weeks before day one rain i gotta tell you i'm gonna live eat breathe sleep d2 okay same pve though this is fun just freeze kill keep going okay look at that return to banshee for the catalyst which i'll do yeah i just took i just took a big hiatus from d2 pretty much since beyond life or yeah that was it right which isn't which isn't a bad thing but i've missed a good bit but yeah i don't know like i'm suddenly like i'm back in destiny man i think what helped was focusing less on all about pvp more on pv and actually like instead of grinding pve to play pvp crying pve to play pve like some of this end game like grand masters and stuff i never bothered that but those are fun master and legendary lost sectors a lot of fun the challenge is fun i also don't think i'm close enough yet but oh never mind i was close enough look at that it's a little embarrassing too but i'll be getting lament soon don't ask me why i'm about to do that yet xenophage i i know i know but i'm i'm getting there okay give me that catalyst baby what does it do projectiles from the time portal shoot more frequently oh that's nice rapid fire hey wow that's that is that's a statement that's that's what that is and that statement i love let's get started come on banshee tell me sweet nothings thanks we'll be watching shattering a frozen target refills his weapons magazine from reserves is that a good thing i guess more for pve right because if you like for even if you freeze them and kill them that doesn't work right and if it does is that a good thing because then you would still have to reload to get the the burst yeah it can't hurt that's all i know and probably have to get a lot of kills with this thing yeah i have a lot of catalysts to actually fulfill uh can anybody say thrallway am i am i right or am i all right anybody no okay good day to be destiny fan friends with that said thank you much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day and i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music] foreign
