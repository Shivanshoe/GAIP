someone running at you with an energy sword just just take your hands off your keyboard at that point it's too late just give up if you can see them ah but i i can shoot them in the face no no no you don't understand are you that was not a backflap in any units i got you joey don't worry great distraction good job sadly distraction does not uh give me points these weak breaks i'm dead i'm dead good job joey i distracted for you good stuff we appreciate the distractors so you see we just keep distracting one of us is the distraction at all times good distraction before we get into today's video i want to play a game and i want to see if you can guess what i'm thinking i'm thinking of a video game and it has global pvp massive pve battles over 600 plus champions all right i give you three guesses but you probably know what i'm thinking rage shadow legends thank you very much to raid shadow legends for sponsoring today's video you've heard of it you know it you love it and if you haven't played it now's the time link down in the description box below to downl this dude was a priest of the light at one point but had an epiphany while stargazing as we all do wait he sought light wasn't much of anything without darkness maybe it was right maybe he wasn't but his fellow priests didn't care for it and they kicked him to the curb lucky for us he went off to the master of the magic of the void so we have a nice supply of void potions to ascend our champions with he has something of a chip on his shoulder about the whole being exiled thing so he's not giving up his potions without a fight the main trick to fighting malek is dealing with all the poison he puts out it's ola and he has an ability that deals all the poison damage you can take all at once which can nuke your whole team if you're not careful now my favorite things in raid are the pvp battles i enjoy pitting my champions against theirs and hopefully showing them that mine are better as well as so many new champions it's that dopamine hit you know so what's new in raid you might be asking well there's tons happening every month special events every day and a whole bunch of awesome new champions with a
