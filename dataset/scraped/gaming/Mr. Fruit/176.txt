ah detective timer again just don't hit the amiibo look at whatever the fudge ah jesus there we go there we go okay oxygenated [Music] how much duct tape is this going to take all right nailed it wow rio was way better at that than me i quite frankly i believe it sonic's coming this way sharks going that way sharks trying to get away from a dead body shark oh fudge oh no i need a mask oh no oh no oh no no get me out of this i don't have time i don't have to off fudge i don't want to explode i don't want to explode i don't want to explode i don't want to explode i'm too young i'm too young i'm too young oh okay so anyway like i was saying shark thank you sassy wait what i'm fake's been fighting i figured i figured it out i figured it out i figured out how to do the math guys we're all good many of you guys exploded because which is bizarre because he ran there and then ran back with me so i think he thought he got it but he did oh yeah killing spree okay so more importantly what about don rob like what have we seen here i have i don't know i have not seen it where did you see them oh did you find them i know i know very informative i'm asking about all the other bodies i only saw a shark and exploded right in front of me i have not seen any of them so far exploding a lot of them just i did like one task and electrical and then yeah i did one time immediately right boys just skip here i am once again sonic ran up here wait hold up i don't think anyone's used them okay i saw sonic do that yeah sure all right um which one which one did you find super quickly i found i found reuben okay where was he he was like at the very entrance of med bay i was i just saw sauna but i didn't see anyone else to the top floor and then that's right i've been downstairs like this entire time any upstairs i am a downstairs i just i was in the uh dcom area i saw bryce do the sea urchin thing and that's what i was doing wait so joey what were you doing okay so i came from comms because we'd like just fix comms or whatever and then i ran up to the hallway there's like a hallway that goes up to the part where i was killed the first round walked into med bay because i had one thing in med bay and then i see uh reuben at the very start of bed bay like just at the entrance okay 99 sure it's chilly because here's the thing i just saw sonic through the glass in med bay doing the scan i was duct taping and i was like okay he's scanning cool then i got done duct taping and i ran immediately from there to go fix comms and the interesting thing is joey said they fixed comms but i was just running into comms to fix it because no one had fixed it oh i thought we i thought it was finished i could see my tasks again i don't is it because you were evil yeah it's because you're in a monster it's not because i i couldn't see my tasks it's kind of sucks i don't know i i will say that the last person if bryce bridge the thing is the thing for me is if you were there i saw i saw reuben i didn't see sonic fruit we have to vote if you hard such joey i'll do it hold on well hold on he said he saw sonic i never saw sonic oh wait you called ruben oh yeah i called ruben wait so who i don't that's what i'm saying it's bridge what don't do this imposters just exploded i thought you were talking about sonic the whole time no i said i said wonderful god i'm so okay i'm so sorry bridge to be fair the only reason i shushed him is because at some point like he was like yeah like i was bummed too like i think i saw like um um like uh something something and i was like man that's kind of weird and then once i realized wait joey didn't call sonic's body that sounds like oh what the fudge he's got a point joey ran down this way though bryce is down here no oh what a break kill me no bryce don't do it one of them here is not like the other will they stop doing this okay joey's been roaming around bryce could have killed me ria could have killed me joey still i don't know wait what oh i couldn't see these tasks because they were canceled right right right well you bet okay i'm sorry i just got really lonely and i was scared we had a friend's dead somewhere and that the other kill lonely hey all i know is uh who voted that the imposter i met okay but at the last second yeah well because the whole time i thought you were talking about sonic and as soon as you said that sonic was like ah [ __ ] that's fair and the only reason i voted or not right sorry bridge was because when everyone's like yeah i'm bottom i bought bryce or bridge was like yeah yeah like i like i'm bottom i always bought them that's right and i was like that's kind of i have a question that was all i had i'm gonna be honest uh how the hell do you do this task with money in your hands and donuts oh what the hell is that what is this how much money you have i have to do math no i know i'm not gonna lie i feel like that was a casual throw up yeah bro i do tests too yeah i do i feel like you're trying to cover yourself seriously you know what i know it's just i was just up there in the kitchen so i think ria saw me go up there you guys have been together a lot of the round though so i mean if she killed you then we would have known it was her we'll see what happens we'll see what i you know it's quirky like that although to be fair joey did go for reuben he reported reuben's body but that's the thing still though is his communication thing he shouldn't have seen his tasks i don't know who just says i feel like it's a bad idea at this point just to clear anyone for the sake of clearing someone but feel like i i trust ria the most maybe that's going to come back to haunt but i don't know i'm going to go grab my mask because i don't want to die everybody everybody don't kill me rihanna don't kill me gotta fix calms [Music] oh wait what nothing feels better than hitting that perfect bop joey's over here joey joy why joey why are you following me joey what are you hiding joy what do you hind joey joey i got a fudge i don't even know where the button is oh sweet jesus where's the button i'm calling it fruit how where did you go how did you get up there what do you mean wake it up okay well hold on i have a i have a serious question where is the button well i just found it that's what i was looking for it's oh okay here's what i know there last person i saw with the bria was bryce but then joey comes top out of nowhere and i figured somebody was dead and i also figured their cooldown was coming up pretty soon so i had to call this to 50 50 anyway because otherwise we would lose i like it okay so i think your original sauce of cheese hat was right well here's well here's what i got well joey reported the body you didn't that's all i could do and hold on if i may add if i may add in together a lot of times fruit a lot of times we've been completely you were awesome so i made an admin map which i was like oh but then that made me realize wait he he's looking at it to find somebody to kill also joey why did you go back to cafeteria twice in that round well honestly after well that's the thing that's what i was just gonna say is after my donut task i'm done i don't have any more tasks so i've just been wondering that's why i followed you up there mr fruit and i i tried to like kind of do like a short and come back to see if you were like dead or killed someone and then i couldn't find you so that's the play i haven't seen bryce hall game so i also haven't seen ria more than like once and it was like in an elevator i'm gonna vote with with you know anything that isn't me but this is your toss-up here it was it was a dispute between lovers and bryce killed me you think i would kill rhea i think so well then i'll vote fruit and just see what happens maybe you voted him come on chef 50 50 baby come on come on i think that was an interesting idea mr fruit i'm just gonna let you know he can't right after oxygen when uh fruit you and bryce were getting masks at the same time i i danced at you guys and then i chased after joey because i saw that he was going back towards cafeteria bent out and kill me fruit i believed in you with my life he killed the wrong person we went for sure here we just vote joey out like easy game [Music] is oh that was that explains why i was finally finally joined i was gaslit there's a reason i was like wait i just saw sonic let me talk about this because i saw his body at the beginning but then you're like wait i reported so long i was like maybe he did i knew you saw him so i was like crap i'm gonna say i killed ruben i don't even i was that was a complete like i didn't even know where roone was where he was killed i was like i'm just going to say ruben so he he knows that i'm idea y'all can't keep getting away with sniping me in the last five seconds wow i don't i have to keep doing this stupid smooth brain plays because i never get imposter dude in every lobby i'm in i'm the only one fighting for crewmates dude no one ever has anything to say all right just whatever that was the last round you know it's it's a new time even though this entire session no one's been playing detective but it's fine it's fine i'm just it's it's fine guys okay like it's cool it's whatever oh don don't do it please please when is fruit summit hopefully soon we need to figure out with all this delta gamma bizarre stuff but i would like it to be very soon i miss you and dado i hope you're doing good been long dude i need a detective song what's a detective i mean i only have like the beat dude but isn't that being sneaky not a detective you've been hit by you've been struck by fruits [Music] [Music] yeah we're friends friends friends friends friends and sons friends friends i'm making an alibi oh fudge i gotta get a mask i thought someone was coming down the elevator i think i just might call it myself whoops lips yeah i'm sticking with bridge rich rich bridge rich oh sick [Music] you'll never know wait why did he move in the middle of his task well that's kind of sussy wait am i getting marinated no bridge no wait where did bridge wait did he what the fudge what the what the he was he might what man made an olympic sprint detectives can be sneaky that's true but i need like a fudge man i don't have a detective song okay this is trouble and knowing my luck i'm gonna get stabbed [Laughter] made it boner was going to kill bridge but i stopped it i saved your life bridge oh my god you're welcome oh my god you're welcome he's about to kill my friend and i said no because that's my friend you are my friend let's see if we go together the likelihood we get killed is small i found my friend you got a friend in me come on now to communications you got a friend and me bria what were you holding what's that what what what was in your hand it wasn't anything are you sure because it looked like it was a knife oh that's a whole claim into the elevator he almost murdered me why aren't you you're going to murder me aren't you oh so we're just basically that's awesome that's all you got really shark yeah all right now i'm such a shark all right i thought you saw her like slice somebody and actually okay here's what happened right i went into the elevator maria comes down she steps out and it steps back in and i'm like that's us okay okay do you have anything to say about this event so i was gonna go do my tasks down there and then i was like no if i stay down here he's gonna think that i'm suck so i went back in there to go back upstairs okay okay let's let's let's break this down let's break this down hey listen okay here's what i have to mediate shark ria i don't care it's completely irrelevant i haven't seen sonic or joey this entire time because i also haven't seen bryce i think i saw you downstairs when i was upstairs mr fruit so i i do think cause i was up with rob and stark so that place is robbed upstairs when the mask thing was going on yes i was what mouse thing i was pushing the mask wait wait wait i'm down to just vote what elevator i could vouch for joey i saw him these questions what about the questions no shut up where was it it's called electrical the one where you have to do the puzzle thing the with the pipes wait but that that's that in order to get to that he has to come from communications whereas bryce is dead body is oh so madness being thrown under the bus he's like five seconds left i'm just going to call it we got bro wait why didn't we start [Laughter] there's some votes missing why did we vote why didn't everybody vote you didn't vote joey nobody yes i did i i scared yeah you voted all right i think i got him i think i saw what his play was he was going to immediately throw sauce off of himself by being like saw you with a knife but then i'm like wait a second he actually just sussed himself because what elevator i didn't see him at the left once oh the right ones you mean the ones by communication which you have to go down to which is where bryce's dead body was but wait that also means ria was in the elevator wait but then wait are they in all night together wait a second i'm gonna take this down just to make sure i'm not wrong but i didn't look at the voting though there was only three votes see the piping oh no the electrical yeah this is the elevator you have to do i'm not crazy so shark could be right and it could be rhea it could have been either one now i'm sus maria ria ain't safe from my wrath oh brit oh hey bridge is here bridge stay with me stay with us oh won't you stay with me cause you're all i need thanks prince i trust him oh rob and sonic rob went to the right sonic went okay wait what is sonic doing what wait sonic and who who was that sonic and who ah fudge how do i fix electrical oh no i lost bridge i lost my oh no i lost my my like what the fudge you call him when you're on like a field trip you know like you're your buddy oh no rich there he is wait how did sonic get up here but there's no body down come with me come with me my son come with me i need to do this uh nautical nonsense oh wait what that was it huh it's either joey orria i think okay okay explain that one because i watched joey robbie and ria go into the elevator and then i took the elevator after them and i was like all right let's see who ends up dead who's in that elevator because i have a few reasons someone's going to die i think it might be real because i saw a bridge and fruit lingering together i really yeah i only trust bridge wait did you do is was the body in the elevator no it was like it was in front of the room in front of the elevator the last time i saw him was in the elevator but then i went up we both we all three-parted waves because i yeah i went to the right to the observatory or whatever and really maybe rob went up to that room maybe she unparted ways i think it was shark but it would also make sense here's what i was thinking shark was in the elevator right next to where the person killed christopher mr fruit shark but he came but he came into the elevator and ria was also there but if they were taking it together they would have been near each other so it's one of them so i'm saying if she saw sanria and we killed shark and it was a 50 50 if we get ria out now go for it but there's most yeah there's probably still two killers if you think that that's actually kind of killing me do you think that's not shark then there's still two killers and then that'll just if i don't think it's sharks i think it's you though i think it's julia too why did well joe hit me with the movement like he was gonna murder me off the phone i want to say i uh no honestly i was checking to see if you would i haven't i haven't slashed anyone well i also feel like it's real because the two imposters voted with me i i really didn't i mean that that's fair but i just hope i have all this power i ain't got nothing and as you've all noticed no one and i mean no one tries to play detective or make sense of anything like if i don't speak up what are it's like yeah i guess we got nothing so whatever if i got to throw some darts on the board that's exactly what i'm gonna do hey what i'm going down bro where where's this last book man upper lobby i guess but i thought if i just randomly exploded i swear to god i picked up the mask okay oh okay good news we got one of the killers out because the game would be over it's joey yeah it had to have been real so whoever did it was a double kill i told you i honestly don't know who the other person is though yeah i'm thinking it might be i'm leaning towards joey i i i i was gonna say well that's ironic cause i was just about to say i don't think it's don because i was alone with you probably the most this yeah okay well then actually you were just we were both upstairs well no i just realized we were both upstairs with boner right yeah he died upstairs at right outside the elevators and went upstairs he's right there i didn't see where he died okay has anyone seen bridge i have not seen bridges i actually haven't seen bridge but i still don't feel like it's him for some reason i was downstairs the whole time and i got the mask and there's two people above me getting oxygen mask so then i went because yeah fruit because i actually i passed you upstairs fruit like because i came out of the elevator to when i went into the elevator right now he doesn't remember okay we need to not vote because we'll just throw we're getting in the elevator remember yeah and then i went down to first floor wait you found him by that elevator no i went top left in first floor and came out like if you start in the upper floor if you go in the left hallway elevator's there his dead body was waiting up there i can't it's all i'm saying it's an even number if we get the wrong one we give them free victory so we ask it yeah i don't let the record show i am sassy of joey okay that's what the bunch and who didn't eat everything i this is kinda saucy wait the impostor 100 had to vote so it was bridge or joey dawn didn't vote don't trying to throw though maybe but maybe by not voting she was hoping that it would be lopsided somehow okay so bryce is the only one oh jesus okay okay you know what time it is i don't i hope no one saw me coming this way okay i have yet to use this but you know we bout to what the fudge fix that freaky my the only one that fixes the cameras i got like two channels we got the fudge not even good ones like this like why am i the only one ever joey what the [ __ ] where's the button where's the button give me a button give me a button how do i click the button how do where's the button we lost we lost we lost i don't know where the button is we lost it's done i i don't know where to click wait what how does she make that work reisters are the only one up top don killem where's the button where the [ __ ] is the button all right we gotta see what just happened wait oh bridge let's go no no no no no no it's joey let's go no it's bridge mr fruit it's bridge there was one person in this match who you could trust okay fruit all i have to say no no no all i have to say is who was there when we were doing the the water level thing yeah which was the only one not there and i was locked in that room with you for like struggling with the elevator how do you do the doors what the [ __ ] i couldn't open that door mr fruit bridge where have you seen dawn dawn was upstairs with me we were in the meeting room-ish kind of thing because i saw i went to admin table and looked where people were and i saw she was in meeting room and i was like i need to go hang out with somebody and so we were the water went off and then we went separate directions because i didn't know where the elevators were here's what i know last person i saw with don was joey this entire match except for the little end i've been chilling with bridge maybe he's marinating me because there wasn't a lot of kills going on so it's very possible there was that double kill that happened when i wasn't with him that he was waiting for me but joey was also the last one at the table and didn't call the button which unless i'm unless i'm just getting a big lather on the old barbecue and slathered up in which case butter me up and call me a biscuit i wish i think it's growing last one i saw with donald trump the last one i saw with don you're the last one i saw with don mr fruit i'm tough it just makes sense give me them cheeks boy it just give me the cheeks makes sense you wanted pizza are you gonna get dominoes dominoes here man [Music] [Music] foreign
