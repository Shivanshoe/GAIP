slow-paced style shooter a la tarka enjoy all right uh would you sell your soul away to us sure territorial mutilation starting i think i'm gonna throw up it was so pretty okay this is a new world but it's a new world this sensitivity is a little high and then evac off the surface that's an important step what if i don't want to escape ah a simple hint try not to order too many creatures scan for minerals here's the rub rule of law doesn't apply down there and it's not just the local creatures that'll be after you competition among prospectors is fierce come and see me once you're done down there we should talk i open mine and whatever this is all the leave lonely it's nick law and towards the ebank location fine i want to mine the rest anyway oh thought i had a jet pack apparently i can't afford that anymore low danger now we're more my speed what do we got around here huh not oh there's something up there quit it you know the recoil though now is pretty nuts you should be like lasers oh it's so [ __ ] so atmospheric oh what do we have here oh my god oh i was like that's my whoa a grenada oh this is very tart kind of you got your packet and you got your safe pockets and no

absolutely poop on you now and there's like no way to really recover health that's that sounds like someone's shooting right muffled because it's in the distance okay yes those guys are having quite the cockfight okay hardened metals you would what i think the thing only finds materials so oh here we go a strong stem now we're talk safe thing is full we'll screw that who needs that no you don't

[Laughter] where is she going it's fine it's fine i've never played tarkov before and i want to make it a tarkov like game so i know what i'm doing it's simple don't make too much noise which i think i'm doing a great job of and don't die working on that one and figuring out how to just make it into do i need did somebody forget to give me like a passcode a key card like somebody forgot to give me some vital intel here okay all right i don't know what uh whatever all right where am i the water facility there's nothing in the water facility man wait a second how did i not see this before oh close that don't mind if i do ooh sneaky nah i know what i'm doing they'll never know what what what is wrong with this that's bizarre wait what pressed it um okay i don't know what i'm doing man you

shot me hello what is going on ghosts are shooting me killed each other suck all i have to do is find some freaky metals but i go to a place it might have metal and there's no metal and then every door is closed i don't know what to do i don't know what to do but that's true hey first time didn't kill anyone died second time took him with me third time i kill them they don't kill me okay who wants a piece today sam you want me to go quiet you want me to go slow absolutely not what if i did none of that where are we i'm going to the rock pools no power plant that seems like sounds like a place with metal you know hello oh what's that what's that what's that what's that hardened metals i knew i like this place okay three more um any hard metals i'm just trying to call out to maybe they'll answer everything's not awesome nothing to see ooh that looks strong med kid okay keep that that's what we call slow but steady progress that's a character arc right there character development hello all right we're good if there's anyone here they'll answer right guys ammo harden metals okay we're we're halfway there me you just think with such a big place like this there'd be more some beautiful water that's really close chief i'm not gonna lie you know what they say find and shoot first i did it oh my god he's dead yeah stupid would you have uh how do i uh freaking give me that oh my god oh look at all this stuff here that's so cool give me that what the fudge okay fine take that what about this what why can't i carry this what is wrong is there a carry limit i'm not seeing must be okay well that was complicated oh we did it we did it and i've realized i should never sprint so whatever i'm sprinting maybe we should invest in some padded padded boots maybe make a little less noise would it kill us i don't think so like oh yeah i just gotta get four hard metals by the way it's the rarest thing on the planet first mission by the way like we we have total faith there's no i don't need metallic alloys metallic alloys why it seems like it's like area based so then why the other place only have two horns what evac oh really someone is shooting over there oh no oh no just keep riding just keep running don't spit on me just keep riding okay i think he back have a nice day okay hard metals please let's just make this painless wait i'm just going to walk around screw it i'd rather walk around and die and crouch around for 20 minutes and die oh my gosh these alloys again bro had enough of these gosh darn alloys oh great all right try me come here you shot you my little friend huh oh my god wait no man there's some dude right here or is that the monster i can't tell you i think it's the monster right because otherwise he'd be aggro on something holy suck

are you kidding all right i'll make my final standard oh my god we're cool we're cool just fine it was so fast so much faster than i had anticipated shard slicer that's rare that's dropped something for that okay look at all these containers surely you would store hard and metals inside of them wouldn't you screw you come on man loot it are they just stealing my hard metals like i don't know evac will go offline in five minutes what what do i it's not my fault dude oh god okay i guess i have five minutes to find hardened metal there's nothing in here quite literally nothing i'm pissed i'm buying here no faking you no you can't shoot the glass okay move move come on come on baby what i agree puppies that's what i'm saying all right i'm e-backing i'm out screw this place and screw everybody get here imagine not even getting all the hard metal couldn't be me oh wait i know little little fat there we go i was like maybe with a little sense of urgency wouldn't kill ya come open the door say we go animati wait what how long is it gonna take me oh thank god it is ariel's oh look at my loot value woo i didn't i didn't even complete it but i survived it's one small step for me one but actually that's it no large step for anybody not everyone survives their first encounter with fortuna no i didn't don't worry now go check with whichever faction sent you out and claim your contracts rewards i would if i completed it overall uh you know i'll have to give it another go but i don't know it feels very meh but hopefully the rebrand does well i don't know maybe various gets in and we were able to do with him then i could have some fun but [Music] [Music] foreign
