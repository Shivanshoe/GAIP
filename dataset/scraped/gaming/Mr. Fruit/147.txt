boom this is a screenshot because it wasn't recording or streaming when i got it we gotta win only last one too and the sad part is it was around right before this it was almost a flawless dub okay easy clap but then yesterday another dub uh this was the comp that said comp is just early on just get big numbers because the meta for the most part is the spawning things you know and then you get turkey and then you get like tiger for turkey blah blah or the fly turns out you can't go past 50 50. had i been able to he would be like an 80 80. point is i know what i'm doing a little bit better a little bit better but it's still tough and versus mode is re-enabled where you actually queue up into a lobby with other people uh but it was terrible the the timer in between rounds is like three minutes and everybody took the three minutes so it was like 10 minutes and i played one round i'm like i'm not doing this so we're just gonna hop into the arena all right prepare for it two um you're normally supposed to play flexible right play what you're given but to try and demonstrate i'm gu i like to call it the d-gen strat the d-drink greedy strap and we're gonna see if we can pull it off results may vary uh so not ideal here but the strat is get pigs and ducks pigs and ducks there's a pig there's a duck we like that i'm just getting the horse so maybe we have a slight chance at surviving here and then we could go fish but i'm not worried about right now we are the rolling rangers i like to go with the alteration here but see i know what everything does now you know we don't need to i'll turn i think i have it on fast forward we'll go a little slower oh i turned off fast forward perfect see bob crickets we actually lose this one unlucky that's not too surprising sad all right first tough l you normally don't want to drop so early but i dropped early we're going another horse because we need them early early stats show me a duck or double pig i regret the fish the fish was a mistake i repeat the fish was a mistake okay we're gonna go scoop no move move pick move move there we go i don't want to combine you just yet you got to kind of get a little greedy to get a good sell and some staff boosts once you get like level two threes in the shops because early on we don't care about nothing this that is a stat heavy team gm okay so another quick l i yeah yeah yeah yeah like i said greedy it usually it usually goes better than this uh what the fudge um i say we could get greedy but we're kind of at the point where we can't really get greedy anymore because uh we're kind of like dying so because you know technically i could don't even combine the pigs and then you actually get a little extra not the point whatever we're combining simply because i don't have a choice pretty much is just there we're gonna we're gonna get rid of the fish like that uh we're gonna freeze we're gonna freeze let's re-roll we don't wanna know that uh maybe we'll go here look i swear to god like seven seven turtle already oh what the fudge are these dude stats yeah this okay this isn't even remotely close okay all right well that's this yep okay hear me out here terrible all right we're selling the duck that just ain't happening so we're going to put you here we're going to buy you but it might be time to sell the pig for fudge i didn't want to have to but i don't have a choice i'm thinking we go here for the double melon thing and then uh we're gonna refresh not helpful we're gonna refresh not helpful who wants some meat you do all right at this point we're in desperation mode let's be honest we haven't worn around and we have no extra lives just a rough start you know but that's okay wait oh does he just lose me phone okay well forgot about that interaction that's kind of prepared love me what isn't okay this is gonna actually wait we're gonna win around baby oh sheesh oh my god what did i tell you guys operation dj greedy strat is a go even though so far none of it is going according to plan let's buff these guys there you go we're gonna do a dodo bird why um good question let's reroll okay i don't like what i'm seeing here re-roll another whale if i will a whale in what order does it go if he eats first then we eat the whale that ate that okay i haven't actually tried this okay so for the sake of science i don't think this is gonna work all right only one way to find out oh wait it's simultaneous oh oh it worked i think right no yes is it working i think it's working hold on okay then another whale ah but it comes out as a two-six does he still have to turtle though no that's the interaction i was curious about that's a big oh my god that would have just saved us what an rng drop oh my god we died okay we're alive kind of works but i don't think it's worth it hey maybe i'll do a kangaroo i don't know why not i don't know why i still have this dodo bird thing nah whatever ah okay degenerate is not going well by the way uh so we're mainly just panicking and currently just trying to hold on to anything oh my god we're getting no wins okay what am i looking at right now good lord oh my god and the stupid all right speed this up i'm pretty i don't need to see go go power oh my god rangers can we do it i don't think so it's kinda close wait wait a second oh my god a little kangaroo that we tied no we didn't die no you literally anything but a badger okay so see normally penguin's great but i haven't won level two okay so sometimes you know things just go terribly and not at all according to plan that's where we're at right now not at all according to playing fudge man all right yo well contingency plan we're not even looking to win we're looking to tie we're just looking to not lose [Music] you know what yellow just trust you know trust in something love what i oh well i mean i don't hate that i hate that though not even level twos man like what is this lock ah yeah okay nice wait what why why what happened to the splash damage i didn't see any splash damage oh there no okay man i'm just blind let's go okay that's a dub we got two wins big upgrade uh shark's just better than badger uh the little hippo that could oh my and the crocodile snipes the sh okay well that's yeah i don't want to jump uh get ahead of ours but i imagine that this game it's not doing splash james doesn't only do splash damage if it kills something oh yeah okay that was not even close oh melon armor replaces splash damage and yeah that sucks um maybe um yo free gold look at that [Music] we're just going to put you put your rod on in there whatever and freeze you at this point okay okay i can make a level two shark but the problem is i won't have a full board and that's just asking for a bad time uh he has a shark and a dolphin now wait so i didn't even get to eat it oh my whole strategy is gone oh the melon oh my oh heavens at least trade are we dead i think you were dead no no we trade no we win no we don't ah what wait i i didn't see melon armor did he wait what the fudge happened did he what did he okay that was just a terrible game one i'm gonna be honest with you all that's why it's called the greedy gambo okay oh my god is he doing the greedy gamba strat mr fruit made that that's great we are the hooting warriors i know i said i like the alteration i could have gotten hooding hedges but i gotta keep guys on your toes we lose this one no we win this one wow winning around one me in this economy greedy gamba is greedy gamba stonks who do we give this to true greedy gamba greedy gamba greedy gamba [Music] not even remotely close what that's our first tower right that's our first talk ah we're getting there [Music] it's all gonna come together you're gonna be like i don't understand trust trust in the process i don't think you're believing hard enough frankly see easy win even the greedy gamba has a power spike oh my this isn't even fair shut down shut it down oh my oh my god do we freeze the giraffe i mean he's really not that good especially early on but ah looks like he's the best we got we're missing a few components for the greedy gamba namely the swan okay miraculously we trade with that okay and we beat that oh this is this is your boss so you never stood a chance okay thank you next ironically i can't say no to that which means it might be time friend thank you for the gold giraffe oh my okay this is true i don't want to get rid of the duck yet okay the duck hasn't had its time nor has the fish because he can boost everything but this hurts but you know it ain't greedy gamba unless you're making some on the off chance we lose sure okay see we get a level three flamingo we get a bison suddenly the greedy gamb is alive boom stupid i don't care stupid oh my these games aren't even close all right so we can do that we're gonna do that we're gonna do that who's kidding i'm not losing that's a level two next turn we're like really close to edging out he oh he's got this once the edging out but we're not quite there and the game is just kind of taunting me ah but my kangaroo is greater and that's another solid dub five early wins you like to see that don't mind if i do okay now that is interesting that is interesting that part of the greedy gamba is just gone i'm gonna be honest with you a hippo here is interesting very interesting i'm thinking about it i'm done thinking about it okay you know what we're spreading the love [Music] come on one flamingo man boners girl king the kangaroo is a good idea but it's too late that is a large turtle oh my god but too bad he's dead oh my god we beat his cop he thinks he's got the best comp little does he know he's up against the greedy gamble easy but here comes my flamingo ah ooh actually not a bad oh no we couldn't you know the greedy game is not complete we need a penguin we need another flamingo we need a bison so at this point it's just kind of a oh that's unfortunate no it's not oh my god we pooped on this dude how a level three fish look at that it didn't even do anything to me huh how is this possible lord give me something ah monkey i want the kangaroo and i want to get him to level three but if we buy him now we don't have a chance of hitting something else right now and stacking him isn't end-all be-all you know what we're playing for ten wins we're close let's try and get there so we either hit a level three kangaroo and flamingo or like like it ain't looking great chief okay this is great that's a knockout but that's not enough that's annoying okay we kill okay we won you win those wait wait what happened what wait did something trigger my melon armor wait i thought we were gonna sweat what happened was dude how does one get so unlucky how we're getting unlucky man if we pull this out it's nothing but a small miracle nah nah oh my god no that didn't matter i mean let's be honest jesus and yeah we're dead a little wait for that buddy and by that i mean real late for that we're gonna hold off but hold on okay i need two kangaroos right here show me two kangaroos what if no kangaroos that works too how did they know nothing no all right pray to the lord above i don't think this is it but it is what it is we had a good thing going oh my this is fine it's not fine this is fine it is fine no my god it's not wait we died let's go okay we're alive baby gives us more time to turn on we're so close come on [Laughter] ah i think it's too late i'm gonna be honest see this this is big this is big if we can make it work i don't know what else to do maybe uh get rid of rhino for leopard next turn if we survive i don't know i don't know oh that's not good chief oh come on okay oh my god we did it that's a w let's go now i'm thinking we just get rid of the rhinoceros unless we get another one but i don't think it's gonna happen okay you lost your chance there we go i don't uh i don't and these items are not ideal all right this is not ideal ah why couldn't we have hit that earlier unlucky all right here's to hoping we survive oh wait the honeypot gets replaced by melon armor what this whole time what was i doing whatever oh my that is terrifyingly not a problem okay wait a second wait a second where one went off one more one more the greedy gamba takes on its own form do i try and get another leopard well nope all right we re-roll come on no whoa mushroom hold on [Music] we did it oh my is this worth it wait what's actually better is this giving plus six plus six better because the only difference here is he gets plus eight attack right the kangaroo coming back as a one one just means kangaroo's dead i can't make a level two leopard i don't have enough money i think we mushroom because he's not gonna get more mel he's just gonna get eight attack i don't think that makes that much of a difference we're mushrooming the flamingo we're saving this actually wait a second no this is it unless we tie this is it come on greedy gamba this is such a scuffed team ah let's go oh my all right well okay that's game all right well oh my god wow that was anticlimactic [Music] [Music] you
