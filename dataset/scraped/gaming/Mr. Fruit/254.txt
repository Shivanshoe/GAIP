hi there hope everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to the human benchmark test after using my gigantic brain to practically break it and set records i'm back again to try the other ones and at least perform above average i hope i don't know why but my ego just really needs it let's get into it y'all remember i did this one and i scored below average i will not and i cannot accept that so i'm just doing it one more time uh give it my boy scout best because i can do better i will i will be better we can all do better i haven't come up with any devices to actually memorize this it's literally just look at this and hope that within a short amount of time i can retain the numbers on my screen and it's going to be a lot harder if i talk while trying to do that but that's what i'm trying to do because if i can't talk and remember what can i do i can remember that number that's what i can do okay here we go three five four zero nine six easy easy right like i said easy here we go eight two nine two one eighteen nine two one eight two nine two one three two three go on in all right five eight three eight six one six nine nine yeah one lads i doubt i'm gonna get that's probably where it ends oh jesus [Music] ah fudge what was it oh i put eight and it was nine dang it okay okay we're we're above average we did it we did it thank you thank you keep it pausing all right on to aim trainer now uh aim trainer okay well it's a good thing there's not just being able to speak english test uh hit 30 targets as quick as you can click the target above to begin what is this this is supposed to like yeah what is this test this tests reflexes oh hand eye coordination well i'd like to think i have some of that oh what are all those years playing fps good for here we go here we go the intensity of my training was maddening at 400 times gravity even a simple what a task became a desperate fight for survival i'm vegeta training to be better than goku uh anyway okay yeah here we go 366 top 20 nah i can do better the thing too is if you i don't know if you can see it i probably like dead in the eyes because i literally unfocused my gaze and i just didn't move my eyes i only moved i don't know if that's the play i also missed just clicking a couple i think it would have been a little bit faster let's see i can i can do better okay not when i i miss just click eight million times trying to i just i barely don't move my mouse far enough just get better aim well oh my god okay all right all right all right no no no no no try it again what am i doing here we go okay that's better where's that put us but okay it's not great i i feel like i should be better than top twenty two point six percent i gotta make top twenty let's get into 80th percentile come on man this is your thing right come on freaking you're cracked right intense focus initiate now [Music] that was terrible dude it's the my mouse frickin dude give me a tablet and like i'm fragging all right whatever i guess i'm top 20 whatever percent screw you guys all right uh typing okay okay i feel like i should land pretty high i'm gonna i'm gonna say i can be top 20. i think i can get 80 times how many words per minute can you type okay i'm going to assume you can't make any mistakes my hands are kind of cold i need to get my hand warmers i don't have them i'm unprepared for this all right we're just going in cold probably gonna be warm up here we go [Music] [Music] oh my god [Music] okay i just my biggest struggle is the typos like once i mess up one there was like one ladder it's like back forward backward back forward let's just see where that put me probably not good [Music] oh get pooped on okay never mind what the fudge i didn't realize people weren't gamers boom that's much better where does that put us top 2.8 not as good as my chimp test okay well we still got two memory ones which can you tell where my my uh my weaknesses lie the the two lowest are memory is that a coincidence no i don't think so you'll be shown words one at a time that's not verbal if you've seen a word during the test click scene if it's a new word click new though as long as you can you have three strikes until game over bullying points batman how do you get points i don't know short term memory that's not my strong suit in fact literally any kind of memory and a lot of that has to do with my depression i'm not i'm not making that up that's actually a um it's a big symptom of my depression it's my terrible memory um so thanks for that brain anyway let's get started tipple new grandparents new scene scene oh god okay [Music] i wait i haven't been paying attention [Music] oh wait no fudge i went too fast [Music] 48 words wait so how does it go according to points does that put me like right here oh no okay try that again i'm better than this rose bush inseparable i've seen apollo verbal memory here we go i can't remember what i saw last time i always have this time i saw reverbs okay i mean 50. okay now i'm getting confused like i have to take a break because i can't remember what i saw this run and i'm getting confused with last run okay i gotta do visual memory we'll come back oh the visual memory uh it's memory again okay i can oh i can do that ah it's live just like a little video game that's fun okay catch the cell um uh no idea what that's in the shape of but boom uh okay we're just slowly increasing the tiles huh oh you can okay [Music] ah fudge fudge oh [Music] whoa i don't know how i did that [Music] okay holy jesus [Music] ah yikes holy suck i my brain doesn't have time to look at the whole thing fudge oh i did i missed i'm just going too fast fudge suck man where does that put me not great it looks like that puts me oh okay wait i'm better at visual memory than aim trainer what the [ __ ] am i doing all right it's gonna average the now unfortunately i don't know it got to 14 or whatever and there's just like it's like oh my god you guys are home right oh this is so easy yeah sure you do it okay tweet me your results or comment down below you know like the video comment let's get that algorithm let's get it gamers oh these are easy i feel cheating when that gives me like some of the easier patterns but when it's just like three it's like oh jesus i can see it the patterns they make themselves known to me jesus christ fudge [Music] oh [Music] no [Music] no [Music] we were close dang it a little average to 15. top 10 percent okay okay so i'm good at one kind of memory visual memory and then there's the other memories verbal memory test no what am i fudge okay really see i can't what do i i should just save my results because if i do it again right after i can't remember oh my yeah i should have just taken the 52 or whatever man fudge i suck at this yeah i thought i saw that what oh my god what am i badge i hate i don't know the flushing doesn't work i saw vulnerability earlier i don't know man when when what when i don't know what [Music] my brain hurts me i i had an out-of-body experience what i did so i just started picturing the words not the word itself but what the word would look like and that helped so let's see what this puts us at [Music] and suddenly we're in the like top nine percent number memory terrible sequence memory honestly should have been better i messed that one up i could do it again or i could not reaction time yeah aim trainer sad about that one sad about that one visual memory should be higher than what it is because the average verbal memory they robbed me at 10 words per minute and then the chimp test well if you want to know am i smarter than a chimpanzee or a fourth grader here you are feel free to take all these and show me your results most of them are gonna be better than mine but hey i freaking tried okay i'm gonna do a sequence memory one more time one more time but because it averages it it's gonna be hard to bump that up i did what the fudge was at me all right that never happened here here here are my scores i'm not kidding like i did these back to back i i took like a snack break my brain is fried is that sad you really gotta like oh my god like freaking oh it's like someone literally fried my brain ladies and gentlemen that was the human benchmark part do i'm smart now so i can speak french thanks for joining me on this adventure again
