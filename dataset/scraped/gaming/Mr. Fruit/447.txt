heidi everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to destiny 2 beyond light if you're wondering why i have a much more attractive titan well first off your words offend me because it's it's totally not it is a sick looking titan and it hurts because it's not my titan but that's because we're checking out the brand new raid hand cannon the posterity which i was not lucky enough to receive not only that though but this boy got a dope roll speaking of which thank you very much to trav for let me use their account we're all decked out in raid gear i could use the succession sniper rifle or the heritage shotgun he just sent it my way so i'm just going to pretend it's a divine intervention from the gods and equip it the posterity hand cannon and the commemoration machine gun first off the raid weapon aesthetic is incredibly i love it just look at this thing and the iron sights like like matrixy or something anyway the role we're working with is quirks for rifling for increased range of missile appended mag with zombies killing wind final blows grant increased mobility weapon range and handling for a short duration and get this rampage kills with this weapon temporarily grant increased damage stacks three times and the fun don't stop there as rampage spec increases duration of rampage so you throw all that together you mix it in and you don't get a thanksgiving dish but you do get a nasty pvp hand cannon which it's a 180 rounds per minute hand cannon as well so i don't want to hear this about mr fruit get the hand cannon on your own the counter likely why doesn't your titan look this good well first off that's all semantics okay it's all objective and you're wrong at least about the fashion okay my titan is killer but the hand cannon well i just got like the shotgun three times in a row what do you want from me so we're gonna be hopping into a match of control welcome to javelin4 is the lmg but more importantly here's the posterity i'll show it for no it's fine guys i'll keep okay well happy won't play and i'll be the one to capture this yep there you go oh my god though it does look so s what is going on over here i also didn't change the sensitivity oh my gosh and he has a very low sensitivity as it turns out oh boy got a double though i guess okay i think this is the sensitivity i use i'm gonna i'm gonna be a little bit honest kind of forgot what sense i use so who really knows but boom the posterity taking him to pound down look at this thing it's nuts there are pb why are you why are you in our base get out bro apparently with some of the raid perks you can get a roll where the hand cannon can have a magazine size of like a 36. don't ask me how um it's all above my peg grade i just know it is indeed possible boom blocked you with my wall and now i'm very weak and very afraid very afraid yo i'm out of here you like that about a bing about a boom i hey look it's my wall all right i'm gonna use the shotgun it's a slug so in other words i'm not gonna hit yep missed absolutely completely utterly missed hey buddy they're coming for you oh my oh well i guess i should have said watch out enemies my buddy's coming for you you know what i'm saying well we got a we got a flag over here i don't know what accident i was supposed to be wow i died fast 180 handking anything with the last 180 i would have used was is that like okay well that's the entire enemy team and i'm kind of a potato but we got the kill would that be like luna's howl i think before it got nerfed to the ground as well as well as the not forgotten yeah so glad i ended up grinding for all that just for it to be sunset which i knew was going to happen to be fair at least when i was getting not forgotten but well i still don't really know why i put myself through all that but that's really not important range is okay still got nine in the mag overall what what is this by the way tectonic harvest ow i'm out here harvesting tectonics now don't get me started on that is that like fracking cause that's a big oil political issue and i don't know where to stand on that it's more like uh them earthquakes out there in in california and tectonic plates is that what that's about i don't know what i'm talking about but i was frozen i really don't know what i'm doing right now listen look it's early in the morning okay i haven't eaten i i think i'm just in a in an odd state of hunger really and so my mind's kind of just lost it which to be fair i don't know when my mind ever had it um but watch this wait what hit me well hopefully you weren't watching because there was nothing to watch bob oh my enemy team hello hello check this out ready i said stasis not stacy not to be confused because that is my mother's name and i love stacy she's a fantastic woman a fantastic mother and i wouldn't trade her for the world i said stay see us what are with all these what is going on over here god bro they're just they're hunting in packs look you and me heart to heart but the bad and heart to heart i want to tell you what i have to say i've been playing a lot of cold war okay it's it's a different beast you know the way it aims that's why when i first played goldball i was like bro this ain't working because you know every game you know it might be like hahaha uh i have gun i shoot lemon also by the way get absolutely destroyed uh that guy just killed but it's never so simple i mean yes it's point and click right but every game handles differently you know you can't just intermingle all the time you got to get warm you got to get warm and this is my first pvp game for a little while so you know what i'm cold my hands are cold that's not even a lie my house is a little chilly a little chillier than i would have preferred oh my god [Music] yo they said it wasn't a one-man what am i doing right now they said it wasn't a one-shot melee but if you just made them into a wall with enough force guess what it's a one shot a little scuffed but it's a one-shot and well quite frankly i think it's better because when you get a kill like that it's a lot funnier slug shotgun to the rescue oh my god that did no damage why did i may you could hear me slice in the air with that fist [Music] as i missed absolutely everybody i've been playing the objective quite frankly i haven't been fragging as hard as i need to be doing all around it's like mr fruit oh never mind hey thanks for the kill guys hey you do that all the time for me and i'm i'm going to frag out you know i'll be honest with you all i'll be the best teammate you guys are he's half health he's out push push push bna b98 i got you i got you i got you oh my god i actually had you uh behind me ghost like shotgun oh my what what's going on here okay okay lights out suddenly wow look at us team hey you want to cap this oh they took it i was about to say in this weird parallel universe where i play the objective and we get a triple cap we might actually be able to make this comeback now can be very difficult not gonna front but guess what oh my god i'm gonna waste my entire super on this dude yo what if i just jump i can avoid the entire titan shaper isn't that so much fun oh my god yo screw you yo screw you indeed oh wow that's funny embarrassing for him but i think it's funny okay 34 damage i'm massive wait a sec oh wow we were kind of making a comeback and then my friend just kept dying not my fault we started to pop off at the end that was my best popping noise i can't really you know where people like put their finger in their mouth and they're like like pop it or whatever i can't do that anyway overall i would say not bad especially for the first like half of that and then look at the rest of my team no wonder we had no pressure raining down on me i'm gonna get in trouble with the dmca i see the gods favor us today they said hey how about widows court and i said no but um well here i am so clearly i lost that battle with the gods not ideal not ideal especially the 180 you know range ain't great fall off's pretty pretty drastic and overall if anyone's using any kind of a long-range weapon oh or i'll just get this sick flat oh wait a second wait a second oh that was just lag oh my god one mag four kills how does he do it we'll find out this one secret and why doctors hate him uh i'm tired of going to the doctors actually this freaking job problem bro worst part too is this splint bro it's fixing my job but my teeth are done for bro they're over did i not freeze a soul looks like it oh the precision had oh another precision had mr fruit kind of crap mr fruit yo that's three slug shotgun precision shots in a row your boy kind of on a different wavelength right now oh my god what was slowing me what why who where no i ain't even go front though you know that's hot and i'm the one that did it and i'ma say you know what that's hot oh that's hot why are you sitting in your little well or what it doesn't matter holy heck or she has a bow i'm not messing with that i'm weak i'm weak come on chase me chase me here oh my god i can't hit a shot get the bone arrow though it's a good thing he couldn't hit a shot either huh i can stay high octane but not all the time you know what i'm saying it's exhausting being at a hundred percent all the time that's why actually i'm only ever using 20 of my brain capacity just because you know what if i used 100 it wouldn't be fair and mainly because well to be honest i i don't have a hundred percent brain capacity i am somehow alive by the way this rampage thing this gun's got this whole thing right now is that no bro i was popping oh running why are we all here and somehow not why i got that kill huh well deserved obviously i really need to change my super bowl because it's it's it's it's not oh wait saying he's he's frozen yo yo it's just not a great multi-kill unless you can find people all bunched oh my god where am i going all right well he ran away yo oh nice tracking super frickin screw you oh you're frozen it's not great it's not terrible it does one thing really well you know it makes people run away so for that alone oh my sounds like somebody's got a pulse rifle spoilers that's going to be my hand cannon also spoilers oh my that well that's a spoiler and a half right there yo somebody someone oh my god i'm bad oh my god i'm bad
