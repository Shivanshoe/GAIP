literally like the entire team i don't really know what i'm gonna do here fudge man firing my entire load in the middle of the city not a good idea in the middle of the keep he's gunk swallower that's disgusting and i'm all out of stamina so i got fireballs on me you know ah bruh bruh yo skirt oh i screwed it too hard fudge me okay that was i'm trying the bears i found oh my god i want to kill a banshee please i've never gotten to kill the bench oh they're all on it yeah rip all right so i'm just gonna blow my shot blow my load out ow okay all right this can be the first game i go negative i've got to finish him oh my god look at how much health he has what the fudge yeah i'm lighting him up team but he has he actually friends fudge silly i can't finish him god dude i can't do anything because they all sit out here my team is just nowhere to be found what the [ __ ] i'm trying just wait until the full game comes out and my friends get on and then i stack on all you guys and think about that not letting you get away i might i might he tried for the armor but he didn't get it there we go i gotta try and get the wraith and they got it again okay great i'm gonna go on goober because he's already weak i killed him but i died for it okay oh my god you see i hit him with everything and then his teammates just poop on me okay yeah why do i bother why do i know all right release that's some good damage but not good enough dodge i almost killed him right there too it wasn't even a com competitive game man it was a 1v6 what was the rest of my team going we didn't even have six for starters um yeah why not we'll go wind guard and i'll go with smoke trail let me go ahead and grab infinite and then the shields let me just get outside find somebody bop target acquired target acquired oh well played he ran into a wall which kind of made me run into a wall i want someone to chase me so i can use my poison but i found him all right i'm using my trail my poison trail it's not it's it's not as effective as i would hope it would be i oh my god i blinded myself oh my god my poison killed a gun let's get it i'm chasing this dude so oh that was a good skirt that was a as a connoisseur of skirts i have to say that was that was pretty good come on there's got to be armor somewhere ah they're on me they're on me [Music] this guy's really wants me i'm just gonna ignore him i'm not gonna give him what he so desperately desires instead i'll probably wind up not killing this guy instead using my poison as i fly through their poison i do not recommend ah pull up oh my god we missed the armor it's right oh it's right there well don't know in fact me and my dragon go back since the uh second century you know to the battle of scorch wall you've probably heard of it it's legendary all those epic tales you heard of was me oh this guy's oh come here and try and escape me uh i don't think so i don't think so uh oh that's my armor you give that back yeah i went berserk i did it look at my health boom boom boom boom oh my god massive damage massive damage oh my god look at my fireballs oh my god put on poison too what are you gonna do okay what i can't see now where'd they where'd they go oh no this isn't even fair oh my god i'm pooping on kids yeah oh come here all the damage the damage i'm gonna go to my friend it didn't work it's on cooldown oh berserk ended no suddenly i'm so fragile i must avoid them at all costs yeah meow no the dessert was sick though come here oh don't oh okay we need to work on this targeting my friend's thing because it really likes to just go into the middle of mountains oh this guy can't escape though he escaped well played almost retrieved the drake piercer all right i got a one shot guaranteed i just have to lock on to somebody and i choose you got him i'm gonna die though but we killed him here we go there you are come here i see you you cannot escape me but your friends can very well assist you oh come on he's so weak yeah nose dive right in there what are you doing here rascal i dare you to chase me through my smoke because that's oh they are well mouth that's a fat dog oh my god wyverns are the most adapted flying of all dragon species because their wings are like body suits and they're small and lighter than most dragon species the more you know thank you thank you thank you look at all these people with all these high levels too doesn't matter [Music] you
