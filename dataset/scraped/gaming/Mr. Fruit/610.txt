heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and my friends my friends my friends and my bite wait a minute i don't know who you are and you're not my friend hey hi how are you my name is mr fruit there we're acquainted that we're not friends anyway not important what is important today might go down as the greatest day in destiny 2 for you boy [ __ ] heck are you [ __ ] about making fruit i i'm sorry what come with me a little louder for the people in the back skill based matchmaking has been removed in non-comp playlists some people will feel one way or the other but for me it means i might be able to goof around in the crucible once more to prove it we're gonna randomize my loadout survey says wait no stop no i don't no i don't need armor oh no what the fudge am i looking at you know how many weapons i have and somehow i get double snipers or whatever i change it so we have the escape velocity submachine gun the apostate sniper rifle and the play the game grenade launcher and whatever this is over here oh i hope this is no debate now see i'm not looking to specifically pubstone you have me mistaken i would just like to play people who use a variety of things instead of the same loadout over and over and over again and also enable me to use different things and see some success rather than slowly but surely lose the will to live i'm just saying i just appreciate it if everyone i played wasn't unbroken or flawless okay what a lovely day now the weird thing is you can't immediately just be like ah yes i can tell right now but we got a curse breaker riven spain and some people with no titles well unfortunately that's my team rewind like what is this guy doing i'm i'm worse oh my maybe i'm the bad one maybe this entire time i've sucked i get it some people feel strongly about skill-based matchmaking one way or the other but all i'm saying is it's a good day to be me it's so odd it just feels like it literally came out nowhere but because quite frankly i mean it did okay run run as fast as you can look at that perhaps that's definitive proof the seven serif couldn't tell you if i've ever been killed by that in the crucible so oh wait what how did you how did you wind up there you little rascal i mean my loadout ain't ace here but like i said we're randomizing it so we're rolling with the punches yay and in fact he's rolling with my punches oh i'm dead the allegro look at this i don't i don't even recognize half of these names this is great i hate to be a debbie downer though but you know this ain't going to help smg's be any more relevant as you can kind of see here i mean they're good at close quarters and yeah oh my god am i really this bad the answer okay he just walked into my he walked into my ah wait how did he not die the warlock honestly might have been a third just walked through my barrier if it hadn't disappeared maybe he destroyed it i don't really know what happened but oh my god i certainly can't snipe though i'll tell you what god and it's a super low impact sniper too so i'm just doing like i'm i'm tickling them let's be real here oh okay there's the smg nope there it goes and yet somehow i regret this loadout and i can't tell you the last time i sniped but i don't have to tell you that you can tell i'm rusty i mean look back when i was grinding last season for like trials and stuff absolutely popping off just like i'm warm oh my god oh i thought i killed him right there that would have been sick but like like when i'm trying warmed up you know like there's you know i can turn it on now check this out ready they're not gonna see this coming skirt you in the chosen one do i feel dirty absolutely am i going to take a bath i think not you shotgunning abe he's trying to shotgun me at ranges i try and shock on people uh looking like me out there buddy ol pal there's a kill oh what well there's not a kill the fudge am i doing uh yeah i had to have just peeked my audio i'm so sorry the third dude just you see i i've been the scrub this entire time oh my how did i not head shunt that did i not headshot anyone all right time to pull out the john's excuses excuses think of some excuses uh you know i haven't eaten dinner yet they're team shotting i'm only a frag or a night where there's a half crescent moon my crops are dying and it's affected me mentally my hands are cramping i'm a little gassy that one is true i i really am i've been okay all right this thing actually just sucks doo doo man there's no saving this thing don't worry we're gonna re-randomize next round i'm the greatest oh my god how do i do it i'm gonna get a sniping head shot one of these days nope today is not that there nova bombing get me now mr slova bomb lame pop you're dead give me your ammo all right head shot time baby here i come here come here i go you better watch because it's going to happen real fast [ __ ] me yes all right i can dye a happy fruit i was thinking about it don't ask why i was driving back from the eye doctor today and i thought about it you know if i had a dj name like a stage name it should be fresh fruit or like market fresh fruit get get it and you know okay if we end with a positive efficiency you know what i think that i think that'll prove it since i'm using this thing i mean i guess that was good just hit the head every time mr fruit will now and don't get team shot lamau and oh and there it is lamou now like i mentioned though at the beginning comp playlists are still well and alive with skill-based matchmaking and rightfully so again i'm an advocate you have a social playlist oh my god and a ranked playlist the ranked is skill based and the you know social whatever is i i think i'm just bad and the social is just connection-based whatever you know doesn't have to be super sweaty but you know what this might signal mr fruit playing d2 pvp more which means more destiny videos because as long as i'm having fun i'm all here for it and hopefully that means somewhere along the way i get warmed up well i'll tell you exactly what's going to happen the next game i'm going to be warned i mean look at that team shot impeccable oh god if only i could do that every time i'm helping you but you did it all yourself you're a big boy your mother must be so proud sniper only from here on out they don't call me a crack shot at d2 for nothing crack shot mr fruit back at it again okay great great great no that's not great not good look at that the archeological well played everyone in this lobby well played i am so happy to see you all using a variety of things brings a tear to my eye that was such a bad game on my point my bad but somehow tied for a second on the team with a positive efficiency spin the wheel again we have the loud lullaby hand cannon as far as i'm aware has never been great in pvp so this will be interesting the bug out bag i swear to god i don't have this many smg's i don't know what's going on and the steel cybel z14 sword game joined in progress we're losing but barely this is this is mr fruit combatable territory they called in the big guns and they were right to do so i am here my friends never mind you know despite the the matchmaking oh okay yeah despite the matchmaking whether it be skilled or connection or whatever they oh um okay i think that speaks for itself no matter what the team shot is always going to hurt i can't hit anything from that range this is incredible i mean probably goes for the enemy too wait he's using the loud lullaby i want no i get a lot of this guy idiot nice kill me oh my god come here come here fight back fight back i said fight back you coward oh you stole that kill you and i still take damage for that those are your sins ah ah i'm hurting hey let's pull out the smg i don't know maybe this is a better smg you know i don't really know it does have slideways i don't know what it does but i know if i slide something advantageous happens at least that's my understanding oh okay it's pretty close range pretty close range hello sir and i had to reload give me a second oh what a clever guy but see people don't complain about teams in skill-based matchmaking you know at least not where i was they all just kept it pinned up you know this inner resentment that they would just hold like me i would yell at my teammates not in game i wouldn't take but you know it's cathartic to just you know say it out loud it makes you feel like you know it's not your fault even though 90 of the time it is i'm just not man enough to own my mistakes oh good shot me now check this out you got a little damage on you buddy old pal okay but it doesn't matter i don't really know what happened okay so this randomized idea was a terrible idea terrible terrible idea regardless of the nature of matchmaking there are some guns that you just should probably stay away from in pvp 110 hand cannons aren't exactly something i would i would suggest okay let me slide here for slideways and just get absolutely eaten alive i hear a spectroblades i hope they're friendly doesn't look like it how did i not get that kill oh wait what the we just let him run into the nest curse you in your shoulder bash i wouldn't know what that's like i'm a human missile speaking of which i got my melee right here which should give me my super bob leave that damage okay not quite but it's going to be here in any second oh my god it's you gotta hit your shots if you miss a head shot like it's practically dream dream i've never been good with this thing so let's see if i can change that fudge i tried to go right above the steps i mean yeah i still got the kill but like i could have gotten more now the only thing we're missing is another pinnacle weapon to chase or ritual weapon whatever you want to call it these days to chase and crucible for ranked you know because currently there's still no reason to play it right uh oh a telesto how very interesting a very interesting indeed what a nade oh my god he's insane i can't believe he didn't hit anybody does that that looked good and it felt good oh my mr fruit you're back at it again oh by the way guys i'm an absolute idiot mr fruit i hate to tell this to you but you didn't have to tell us that we already knew that that's rude and i was trying to mimic the audience could you please leave me alone i i was literally one thing away i thought he was gonna die one thing away from getting the undying title last season i just had to do a flawless public event and i just hated the public event so much and i wouldn't match make it with anybody that i was like i'm not doing this um and then i kind of just forgot about it and then i was like wait a minute it's a new season which means i can no longer get it so yeah slight oversight there oh mr fruit you animal same thing goes for flawless i think all i had to really do was like i don't actually remember i think i just had to carry someone or something like that what a nade oh my oh my and look at this if this isn't skill-based matchmaking well you would have had me fooled look at the look at the score this is still a nice competitive game no thanks to me feeding a little bit the perfect scorp okay i'm running from this though oh but now he has friends i'll get somebody before you can kill me oh he'll take it wait did he run away what he deemed me not worthy he's like screw it this guy ain't worth it i know i shouldn't be but i am offended i am worth it even if you don't think so all right now let me just prep this scoop oh god like oh my wait how did i just two shot that dude wait what the fudge just happened i'm not really gonna complain wait what i i didn't hit the ground i swear like flew over him am i crazy because i i i see all these human missile dudes who can just like go through you and kill you is that not true because like i thought that's what i tried to do or do you have to like skate right above their head or something i don't know clearly there's a skill gap with that super that i just don't understand nor can i execute on this is great news though for stuff moving forward some of some of the new guns and whatnot i guess i killed him i gotta get i got another kill i know that much we were so close maybe this means i can start to use bows more in pvp yeah uh who am i kidding of course not i want to make him work i can make them work i just i just lack the mental fortitude oh we lost and well honestly a heartbreaker 91 to 90. but your boy at the top with a 2.6 for efficiency 37 elims that's not something you just dropped casually with this thing look no offense but like come on you know i'm right ladies and gentlemen even though there's really not a whole bunch of new content in this season at least so far especially for pvp this might mean mr fruit destiny videos are going to make a return before a fall dlc i know i know with that said i want to thank all very much for watching have yourself a fantastic day i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] you
