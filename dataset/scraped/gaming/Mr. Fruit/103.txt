what a lovely day uh you don't seem to be doing so hot buddy el pal let's go you stand no match against what everything hurts heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video another weapon review now thankfully it's a little dark at the tower right now and you can't fully see my character you might be like why would that be a problem [Music] [Laughter] because that because all of this now one man's trash is another man's treasure and i think it is gaudy in a great way you know been looking forward to this apologies on the delay i've had a whole bunch of jaw issues and i haven't been able to talk and or eat for quite a while so you boys on some anti-inflammatory steroids muscle relaxers and painkillers right now aka i'm not really on earth right now but that's okay because this is destiny so really i'm just rp i'm with the tr in the tr it doesn't matter we're using the bxr 55 battler today aka the halo battle rifle if you don't know what bxr refers to that's a little easter egg in halo 2 there was this whole well the xr shot this is a big thing you would like shoot reload and cancel with the melee you you get it yeah anywho this is the role i've been running around with chambered compensator accurized round who doesn't like range perpetual motion which i think is actually really good on this weapon gain bonus stability handling and reload speed while in motion and then i'm not gonna lie this is kind of wasted because it's inherently it just doesn't make sense on this weapon now why is rangefinder a bad thing i thought we love rangefinder and i do but if you look here intrinsic trait this battle rifle or pulse rifle actually has its own frame the legacy pr-55 frame and that's obviously an homage to halo if you played halo you don't really ads majority of your gun fights are hip-firing because in halo you get de-scoped as soon as you get shot and you don't lose any sort of accuracy from hip firing so that's what we're gonna be using today using the freehand grip as well to get some extra accuracy and ready speed while firing from the hip rangefinder is there you know if someone engages us from farther away but as you may have noticed from the title of this video if i aim down sights the video ends so let's hope i don't accidentally aim down sights now i have rocked around with said br for a little bit i haven't had much time to get on last time i was really using it was iron banner iron banner what what iron bait listen this splint thing i got my mouth right now for my jaw they had to make it even bigger because i'm going to some oral surgeons here soon and it seems inevitable that i'm going to have to have some sort of invasive surgery so this is just a band-aid fix however because of that it's like i've got just giant hard cotton swabs in my mouth so sometimes i just talk over like i trip over my words i bite my tongue i can't even like i gotta lisp sometimes so my apologies long story short your boy's struggling but you know the content never stops but before getting today's video tis the season to be dripped out and fun and there's new merch baby this will be running until january 15th if you want to grab it for yourself they're made to order so no limited quantities and as soon as you order them they'll get working on the order and send them out if you go to their website as well they might have some holiday deals so that you can actually get them before the holidays there's leggings joggers two alternate all-over prints graphic tee different colors cup as well as water bottles that's that's a lot like what else what else could you could you need so don't delay order today love you guys okay you guys didn't have game audio but i caught it way sooner than usual so big pogs look at this thing i even put on a little shader to make it kind of look like the battle rifle ah with the old radicule and everything oh what a day what a lovely day uh you don't seem to be doing so hot buddy all pal oh he stuck me well i took him down with me what kind of a spawn is that half health no no no no first off don't ads and don't use something else i'm here to use the br brother and apparently personally hulk hogan brother and surprisingly capture objectives this is strange it doesn't have great range though which is why see you know i'm teasing you but you could aim down sights for the longer ranges because like right here it's it's you know i'm not i'm not gonna brag about it it's it's doing its thing it's attempting at least okay you know what all right yes scallywags wait a second what are you using always one check get in there don't be afraid okay somebody oh thank the lord almighty above you know i was gonna be pit i can't see a darn thing out there just hold him left click did he shat or die what's no i got the kill though let's go perpetual motion times two i don't know do i just have to keep walking around i'm gonna be honest i've never used this on any other god but i got on this i'm like hey seems pretty good to me and apparently it does not go to times three what i was like i don't have any buttons near where my p uh turns out i do you hate see it alright here i come nerf shoulder charge doesn't matter well it does because i can get the kill now it's mainly just a movement tool for me you know oh nice kill wait oh i was assisted what the [ __ ] well you know it's it is what it is excuse me oh boy oh boy well what do we have here man in a rift i really am playing halo out here okay okay using the br strong side and what's next unfortunately i haven't played nearly enough dares of eternity to get the uh oh catalyst for the forerunner so that i could uh be able to use the fragmentation grenade but it'll it'll have to do uh friend i need your help never mind i got it it was all me it was on me don't bother trying to take credit dude it's not like that's not cool wow okay nice shotgun you stand no match against what everything hurts everything's not awesome i'm in so much pain oh my god what is he using he's got a sword in correction he had a sword i don't really know what his game plan was there but uh yeah nt i guess oh you got that oh my god he does not i straight up was like yo bro like you got that kill i'm not i'm not gonna worry about it why okay well come on man come on i knew i was gonna die but you didn't have to do me like that not even that he stole it from the other guy who's killed rightfully was he was playing with his food and i respect that he was letting me live for a little while like uh you know i knew i was i got god what not sick dude sick not only does our shoulder charge not one shot anymore it just doesn't connect anymore so that's that's cool that's the thing okay i don't know why he was looking the wrong way there the shatter dive does not one shot me anymore although i don't i don't even know if i was frozen i am happy about that change i am and i have seen some titan pvp players on twitter complaining that titans are in the worst spot they could be pvp right now whereas hunters and warlocks gotta have all the fun frankly well there goes my one super for the game frankly i haven't played enough with this new sandbox to know one way or the other i just know that you know somebody's complaining that titans are bad so i'm just gonna chime in and be like yeah they suck comparatively so just know i'm handicapping myself by not playing something else because oh my god oh my god getting chased it's an ice tornado bro like nice tornado battlefield 2042 could take some notes at least this one's an elemental tornado okay i'm gonna be honest i didn't really can't really see anything i got this cool new 4k monitor but i'm gonna be honest it's it's bigger than most well actually it's the biggest minor i've ever had so like it it just feels like i'm at the front row of a movie theater looking up like oh so i just can't see the whole screen anymore you might be like oh my god like how big of a monitor you get 27 inches 20 27 inches that's it oh but look with my whole setup like it's it's big man okay i'm usually like 24 inches the biggest i've ever gone you know i prefer it to be a little bit but you know i couldn't find any other 4k 144 hertz that were smaller so so alas it but it is really like bro sick br kill me wait did i i technically ate yes didn't i listen i technically have an ats with the br so that is the most important thing what in the who like seriously what oh my god my strafing my hip fire it's insane in the little three burst okay okay little killing spree little assist little skirt skirt i can't how it is just white it is a sea of white when i look outside that door like am i the only water she's like felt like the guy from spongebob doesn't help that i'm also blind i don't know they're really gonna push me blind like right now you know i just need really strong prescription glasses but if they had it their way not even those would help thanks there's no real strategy here i'm just roping them you know it's insane i can't keep up yeah you can't yeah yeah where the what the fudge where i don't know i saw a c red on my radar and yet i could not make out a single person oh my god he's one shot right oh my god i'm the best oh i'm so aggressive there's no way they're like he can't be flanking us who would go around this with me i would oh my god imagine not hitting a single person shot there yankers okay that's pretty good oh and somebody else is burning yeah sassy oh you guys got him nice he's not a sassy vodka he's a dead baka oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy the turn the turn the trick wait we're about to win weren't we down like 30 40 points i kind of just given up i do that quite a bit okay but i'm not gonna throw this game for us i'm not gonna be that guy for my team i'm gonna be the guy that helps us oh my oh the fist of havoc sheesh just as i got my second super hey look at look tied for most opponents defeated okay first crucible game in like two weeks go on new monitor like i think you guys are just underestimating how much this new monitor is it it's a big deal okay it's a it's a big change my world got three inches bigger okay and as we all know some women think that's enough so pretty big difference that is that's a grenade that hurts frank lee who went you know frank i meant frankly oh i thought that actually just absorbed my ooh ooh i want ads but i can't why because how else was i going to click bait this video then if i actually do ads people be like see in halo i would have been fine there because i would have knocked him out of his skull holy jesus imagine yo that actually almost seemed purposeful nice people can be like dude mr fruit's kind of like raw with it brother oh my god you guys ever just become extremely gassy not just me i'm not i'm not just exclusively talking about the basement either that's a usual occurrence but you know sometimes up in the attic and you know what it's it's that what oh wow look at this look at that oh yeah give me that incredible what'd i get oh wow uh so much stuff my screen what's ironic is like everyone on my team right now was like the enemy team last team or the last team oh oh i'm sorry i'm sorry uh exo joe i'm forgive took me until my last verse to realize he wasn't trying to fight back uh he he was

you know then after that gonna probably take another muscle relax or painkiller and lie down and cry everything hurts and by everything i mean my jaw rumble it's like it's like what happens more often a regular game of 6v6 where you're all trying to kill each other or a game where y'all can come together and be friends that could have been just like in world war was that one or two two i think because the trench forfeit now was that one no what were won the trends trench uh it wasn't for dance or whatever but it was like christmas day and them in the the french like um like had a ceasefire and then they all played soccer or something with each other like yeah i'm probably missing a few key details here but the point is the [ __ ] just happened that was crazy yeah oh my okay i mean sure

happening oh you feel that mr krabs come here come here i didn't want to have to waste my melee but he kept running my movement has been halved oh my god what the fudge da da [Music] second place i i wasn't getting first let's be honest a lot better than i thought nice let's see sorrows first tap the trigger harmony you know unfortunately datto isn't here to help me determine i don't think that's
