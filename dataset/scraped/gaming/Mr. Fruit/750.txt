hi ATO John my name's mr. fruit and welcome to scourge Springer's a brand new game that released on Steam just a couple days ago I think I'm pretty positive or maybe I'm late to the party I don't know but obviously as you can tell it's a pixel art game you know me I like my pixel games and then on top of that it's a roguelike which I love those games been playing a little bit myself and I was like I gotta make a video on this because it's too much fun so let's hop right into it the chiming tree so this is like your home base this one like with roguelikes has a progression system so in between every run there is a semi-permanent currency you keep you can see a bottom right it's like these yellow orbs whatever you come on over here and there's a skill tree quite literally it's like a it's like a tree anyway I love skill trees so automatically like bada-bing about a boom I've already got some upgrades starts with some more max HP lets me build combos for greater things all that kind of stuff and then there will be more upgrades as I move on further and further along making at least the early levels a little bit easier letting you get to more in-game currency so when you're in the run there's like blood currency there blood droplets or something and you can spend that in the run but if you die like a lot of roguelikes you lose that currency and then there's this old man he doesn't know what he's doing but for the most part I'm this what I assumed to be it's kind of get weird cyberpunk woman with amazing hair I must use L'Oreal or something I mean it's fantastic so we just go ahead and hop on into this weird portal magic and we enter the first world the entangled ingress now I'll let you know there's obviously a boss at the end of this first dungeon I've only been at once I've lost a lot of time so I'm hoping I can be better this time I thankful I remembered I did just move my face but that is so that you can see the health up there that's kind of important for you guys to see but we have health down here below me is the ammo for my gun I'm not entirely sure how you get ammo it has something to do I think with combos or killing enemies or doing damage or something it'll refill the gun obviously you have the map bottom right you have your blood droplets that currency you hold on to in between rounds and the kaabah multiplier which is recently new I just unlocked it but essentially we got our map here it's a roguelike so it's procedurally generated but the crazy thing about this is the combat is a nut so also I'm trying to Oh I reflected that that was so sick this is my favorite part okay well getting hit isn't because that ruins my combo good good but yeah I need to I'm gonna have to tell you cuz cuz combos like that guy so you go in the air slice eat I see and I mean you can slice you dice in the air forever so you can see here then I have a dash attack like I said I pretty much I don't ever have to touch the ground but I do have some wall running wall jumps double jumps then I have that dash attack we can I have this I also have a heavy attack which stuns some enemies and can eliminate some projectiles there is a new skill I saw that I'll get soon which will actually put reflect some projectiles when I do this heavy attack I believe but it's very exciting this room I actually know from this icon this is one of the many bosses so when people have that exclamation mark it means they're about to attack and you can stun them so we want to stun this guy I like to attack midair so I'm always ready to dash to the next part douche and there we go I fought him quite a few times and honestly it's like a false sense of security because we oh geez now is freaking easy I know what I'm doing and then you get to the boss and then you get absolutely destroyed there's a shot in every dungeon run or world I suppose to this first world this little dudes chill in here and like I said we have this little blood droplets I can choose to spend it on a slug kabob for one HP increase my gun damage by a little bit or get a completely new gun I don't have enough currently for any of that but we'll go ahead move on here gah and at first I was like if I can just stay in here forever and never stop attack and I was like where's the difficulty oh you see because getting hit at all is very punishing your health is a very precious resource I mean that's no new concept but it's it's a lot easier to hit people than you would think especially because when you - and stuff you are not invincible so you will get hit by projectiles and there's a little spikes on the ground that tried to trick me but I said not today Satan not today yeah but you get a bigger combo for different kind of attacks you use enemies you kill and not getting hit if you get hit it automatically reduces yo combo by 2% these little guys down here I hate him no see he got his attack off in time and I accidentally dashed and to his projectile no oh see just like that we lost two HP which might not seem like a big deal but usually don't get HP back very much and believe me I need it for this boss because I suck poopoo however each dungeon also has this pillar where you can get a passive bonus for the rest of this run so I can choose to get Leppa drops randomly upon finishing a room my god my current gun reloads energy slowly automatically other enemies around which seems pretty decent edge has dropped more items with at least one health item see I don't I think that's what that mini boss we fought is I think that's what a judge is um so we might want to you know I'm gonna do this weapons drop randomly upon finishing a room I always I'll be honest forget to use my gun sometimes just because I'm so used to just whacking and slicing but you'll see there I mean it is really effective to use and I should probably all that spawn to probably do that more but yeah being able to uh oh no foosh get help there is God for good it's see I freakin hate those guys it goes my combo man to cook a combo break break break err no you don't got a stuntman time sir but you can pull up some sick combos I feel so good when you do gah now these guys uh-huh gonna want to try and hit me no I'm just gonna stun like you a lip boom oh and an upgrade increases my gun damage by 5% now don't get me wrong five percent doesn't seem like much but every bit helps trust me Oh oh that was close pop pop now this game is obviously sound-effect mandatory you gotta throw in some sets so you're on otherwise are you really playing the game but I love roguelikes love these little indie games and so happy I happened upon this side didn't see my ghost picking up too much traction I was like let me freaking Travis Hill and I was like oh my god I'm addicted I'm addicted to this kind of game anyway drug likes are my jam even if I'm not always the best at them oh yes done that I got a Osho Tom I got a two times combo I don't think I've ever had such a large combo before I need to stun you yes don't get hit by the spikes don't get hit by that okay got my HP back and I'm nearly it looks like at a max combo I don't even know if I can go further or it's just gonna be harder to do it if I do but also as I take time in between rooms the combo can also just disappear automatically so you got to get moving and grooving oh those little spikes you thought you'd get me huh oh we're at a 2.1 that's insanity okay so the boss room is probably up here yeah that's the boss room well hey hi how are you okay so let's go back down here there's obviously just that room left we've done everything else so I didn't mean to teleport that's my bad but we have 515 droplets which means we can buy a couple things thankfully I'm full HP which is good news I can increase my damage but I could also go with a sawed-off shotgun however I think we already have some bonus damage to this gun so let's just double down on that and then I'll keep some extra droplets for the next dungeon that I will hopefully get to again hopefully is the key word here I've just learned that I have to slow down on this boss that's where I always get in trouble and you have to look out for the very specific moment there you go so he has one specific phase right there where I'm oh you can hurt him and then watch this ready soo heavy attack to prevent that Stoneham all we're killing it right now use my gun I know what you're doing Oh jump out of that no okay we took a little bit damage and he's gonna slam me there I knew what he was doing but too late dodge he's gonna slam you there we got him we got him let's go home okay gives back one HP very nice gives back to HP and increases max HP by one we're full health we got a little extra I survived against all odds so that's continued into the second one this still bastion have always been here once before for this is new territory for me and a lot of these enemies are new to me but this guy up here I know sucks what good that is why fudge me all by I'm throwing I'm throwing so anyway those guys if you don't stop them oh they track you with an auto shot and you pretty much can well you what you can't dodge it essentially which seems pretty obvious you know it's a tracking shot mr. free that to figure that out myself listen I'm just trying to get I'm just trying to help you out I need to stun you stun you no no no and then the jellyfish suck because they throw out really slow projectiles which don't seem too bad but just like that they can get kind of a I can get dicey trying to dodge all that so we can get a fast automatic weapon with important spread or I can increase reload speed see I don't I don't know if this is only for my current gun like I don't know if I pick up an SMG if it's gonna change to this I don't I don't know should we go with now let's try and okay so that doesn't doesn't stack apparently it's odd maybe it maybe does it just hasn't changed the text I don't know either way I'll get some HP back let's try out this SMG ah oh no you don't you don't Satan not today there we go Oh God get all the jellyfish it's just it's a game of trying to stun everything it's fun for me oh okay we dodged that come down here to stun him when there's just some a lot of those man I'm telling you oh but increase in max HP one these are some rare item drops we're getting we're getting that very lucky let me stun you before you can be stupid penis oh yeah don't you just hate it when you run into penis enemies oh my god this is bad this is bad oh oh we got another shop I'm throwing I'm throwing I need to slowly get over here wow wow wow wow lose some more HP mr. fruit why don't you Jesus you're killing it said no one ever let me kill this thing real quick and before you can get a shot off come up here he can be a little annoying but not too bad this guy though no okay oh gee I thought you were stunned I'm trying to get out of the way as long as I put something in between me their shots can't hit me but like I said this all happens really fast and granted you know you do eventually get better at it and I mean that's the fun part about roguelikes one you get better after the combat in the game but then also you get those passive upgrades that help you in between runs so there's always incremental oh my you they attack so fast and yes problem is I'm already at for health that's the problem if I even get to the boss there's the boss room I'm gonna have no health no bueno me amigos nobody know you don't know you don't know they don't okay just let's just get up here let's play careful I should also use my my gun more see I just forget to use my gun unlike Joker god NATO no stop I'm out of frickin gun ammo good okay this is good this is fine this is fine you're stunned let me get this guy cuz he's a little penis huh him - they're all penises ok mini-boss time now only have four health but I should be fine oh Jesus ok but that means I can stun him so I will take advantage of that Wow ok I don't know what that is Wow okay that hurts just kill it please we did kill him but we lost to health and we only got one HP back however killing those things does give an orb that we can carry on to the next runs so those are important fudge me well that's not why it's important and I got hit by that know about die no I gotta be careful about not running into those jellyfish shots seen I can barely go over there that sucks a lot oh we got four orbs so I can do this allows to throw bullets back at enemies with the smash that is very good I don't know what the smash is I think that's my heavy hit then we also get crystallization the accumulated blood crystallizes in the judge blood when going back to the tree from being knocked out one for every 1000 oh okay so now I mean that's you would need a thousand droplets or whatever to get one or back or judge blood and I haven't even gotten that much yet like total but that's good to know going later in the runs I have a better shot and the next I get fury Q allows to perform a fury that recharges over time and that also destroys all enemy projectiles you leave that like that's gonna help not only that but I look like a freaking ninja now I know I talked like a million miles a minute so my apologies but there's a lot going on and I just wanted to quickly get through it all for those of you watching so you understood but also perhaps check it out yourself it wasn't it wasn't too much I think I got it on sale too it's like 10 dollars or something somewhere around there I don't know you can check it out on Steam it's currently in beta so I don't know what their plans are for full release if will be coming to consoles and stuff I know like a switch version would be sick would love to see that but I am thoroughly enjoying myself here and even after this video I'm gonna grind out a little bit more get some more things in the skill tree cuz like that's that's the cool part - yeah I keep failing but I keep getting these droplets that I'm able to come back and then go deeper into these skill trees see what they have for me and then they help me out every run so I'm getting stronger and stronger even if I'm still failing you know what I mean that's what I love about roguelikes so anyway I want to thank you all very much for watching supporting this indie content with that said heavies intact I'll talk to you one farewell [Music] [Music]
