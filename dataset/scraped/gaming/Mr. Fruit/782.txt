merciless though oh now we're on a ten kill spree oh my gut now we're just out your fraggin hidey hole drone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to car Doody modern warfare now Infinity Ward listen they took away shoot house 24/7 but in return shipment 24/7 ah which means we own the camo grind means we have to adjust which weapons were grinding for though currently I'm going for shotguns because shipment is I don't have to tell you it's easily the best place to do shotgun challenges I'm currently grinding at the r9 zero because I just finished the origin another magazine here is kind of taking away from the whole aesthetic here but I like what I'm seeing now for the muzzle we have choke the barrel Forge tack Impaler the old tech laser 25 round drum mags because so often I get caught reloading and that's how I died so instead I just go buck wild and I usually die before I even have to reload so it's a win-win and that's stippled griptape I gotta say though this this is not okay it says there's an attachment that's new but there's not true good you know it you love it we're headed in the shipment and I've never used the shotgun and off of shipment anyway so this is this is the only thing I know insanity also let me just remind all of you if you use mustard gas on shipment your mom's a ho okay quit it just stop this is good though because once we get shotguns out of the way about a Bing butter boom were that much closer I will say trying to get right shield right now and oh my god I I don't know if I can do it that I thought rocket launches we're gonna break me oh I was so naive three kill streaks I have everything else for the ride shield but the three kill streaks whose idea what's that who's like you know what this is a good idea because I want to have a talk with them a very serious sit down they're going to timeout let me tell you that as I can see here yep this is shipment although sneaky sneaky I wouldn't have known otherwise really unless I read the patch notes but they added shitman 24/7 but now it excuse me where's mine no that's not my gun where's my get there it is they added it 5v5 that's right it's not 66 anymore but considering shipment things can hardly tell it's still plenty hectic don't worry about that maybe they did it in hopes of semi fixing spawns but let's be real on a map like this now she's never gonna happen now these people are playing so passively what though and even with increased range you got to put a few shots in somebody normally I just don't stop shooting until I know it says that okay it says that they're dead so I just kind of unload and open okay it's not the 725 let me tell you that I guess that comes at the expense of being able to fire full auto with a bigger magazine but I'm not I'm not entirely sold on it Bob just being honest chief commander okay this is good hey double kill we're alive now leveling this up wasn't too bad but because I don't have any of the shotguns level at all except for the 725 which thankfully I have golden so I don't have to do that one from a long time ago I go to that what that was my first gold if you never saw that video I wasn't proud of it but I figured I was using it so much and I like what people some people don't understand is when I put that video out of the 725 early on like no one really no one was talking about the 725 not many people were using it and I was like this is insane and then it very quickly caught on and then I was like wow what have I done Jesus and I don't think I'm the sole reason people started using it you know I don't think my cloud is reaches that far I don't have that big of an ego now maybe a couple people but now I think it just caught on in the community everybody got wind and then they're like yeah this is kind of insane so while I had it max level I was like screw it might as well get gold for it that's exactly what I did and I doubt I'm gonna use any of the other shotguns and prefer them although the r9o is pretty fun I gotta figure out some sort of a fix for the reload though oh my god it's horrific and this is the origin you eat or you starve it's kind of hard to say it's definitely more of a shotgun that you got to be close honestly long range you're looking at seven eight shots sometimes like just give up half of the time it Hank gonna happen boy my favorite thing to isn't people actually bitter fruit in real life shotguns like shoot really yeah we get it okay but does that sound like that oh my god no I forgot to mention this guys I need a new keyboard my a button is officially giving out you probably couldn't tell right there but I was unable to move left yeah we got a we got to figure that out uh do you guys have any recommendations I gotta get something here so ah god I wasted all my stands rip no you go hi Daniel spawn oh you're gonna spawn right there hmm hmm I got 15 more shots plenty with that kit you stupid monster girls yeah screw you it's so annoying and I swear that it they're like oh my god I tried and I tried and I failed the only problem with the camo challenges really I have it for just about every gun really wish the whole like get 25 of it for shotguns it's 30 which I found surprising get 33 kill sprees I don't mind that I just hate that it's the last one because by that time you pretty much have every other challenge you have all the kills you need it just got max leveled so you're like God now she still gotta use this for how many how many more kills because it does take Wow I just wish that one was one of the first ones that it would track I understand why it doesn't but again that's why I like double weapon XP and not not just grinding guns to get cameras during double weapon XP but completely leveling them so that then you can tackle all the challenges at the same time and it's 500 IQ however double weapon XP isn't here so we make do you adjust to what the game gives you right now it says shipment 24/7 so I was a-ok and I say I'm gonna die a lot and so I did I can't even touch that thing alright well I hope somebody kills it okay I'm not crazy about it I'm not crazy about it I know some people swear by it maybe I have the wrong concoction of attachments look at Jesus Christ oh I only have a knife but I know even with I have a couple attachments that are supposed to extend range and all that stuff and or like tighter fit out pellet spread and I'm just not feeling it I'm not feeling thankfully it's it's over with and probably the worst challenge aside from the whole kill sprees at the end just because that one's just a little tedious is the headshots with this one well 725 it's pretty easy and it's like one slug but you have like a giant spread here so I essentially like I like I would fire like that to where like the bottom of the reticule is at their head so I knew the only stuff heading their head was head it's not very lethal but it guaranteed most times I killed it was a headshot my left isn't working my god it's getting worse it was happening very rarely but now I couple times every game I need something yeah I need to figure it out I'm just feeding out here I swear I had some decent games with this though I was fraggin believe it or not once upon a time your and your grandpappy was good at video games me either kids screw you is that the in the kill feed is that the r90 let me see yes okay yeah so he's using the r90 definitely more lethal I'm liking that one more than the aa12 well I guess this is it was they 12 now it's the origin 12 apparently they had like some issues where the gun company has wanted a lot of money in order to use the specific names like FAMAS and eagle that's why it's like point 50 GS or whatever but they're like screw you we're not gonna what I'm gonna pay that much where's the name of whatever still practically the same thing innit so that's what they didn't that's why this is the 40 June 12th I don't know maybe this one is actually called origin now but back in the day we all knew it as the aa-12 and i hate my freakin life I swear if this Vito kills me imma be pissed imma be imma be a Mohammed Abu be imma be imma be really really pissed sweet Carolina oh my god I might have to try my first game ever that's not on shipment what the fudge man is is rough no my god I just saw that guy's name Jesus if you see it you see it if you don't you them yeah you like that spawn okay him I spawn behind a guy and then the guy spawns behind me spawn and behind the guy and that's Shipman in a nutshell and aiming-down-sights I don't know I just feel like that's never really a thing never really do it with any shotgun in the first place never felt like it was very good on or dugeun either screw it let's do some quick play ever since shoot house 24/7 and now Shipman 24/7 can't tell you the last time I played on a regular map so what better time to try it then with my brand-new gold origin I mean it can't go worse than last game right you know what I'm gonna do I never tried this blot will change the ammo to the eighth round slug mags less damage radius but more damage range I don't know what do we have to lose let's see how this goes maybe that's what I was missing who needs a drum mag when you can just have what the Dickens you wanna go mate oh-ho-ho yeah my shotgun is greater than your shotgun the good old city ha ha the only unfortunate things now have to worry about my footstep noise again the Shipman there's so much going on and shoot hassle knows part you just can't a Yolo around whenever you wants but now you cannot hear I'll wait for them because here's what they're not bad the elusive Call of Duty camper they love to find a spot and call it home for that game so they always come back always example a right now this is odd I mean I've done lots of studies I did a whole thesis on this I mean according to all my studies they should be here by now there's damp Tina machine alright well you know what I'll um we're doing it live let's go come on I'll get my damage range it sucks poopoo and I get an assist ah life is cruel oh and I just realized excuse me excuse me how did those first couple just like not hit at all do I have to start a de-essing but Miami on speed is so slow it's like it wasn't oh look at the where is it going way to come from cotton-eye Joe like it's fine that's fine we'll figure this out oh he was also using the origin 12 shotgun oh oh I see your game I thought the camper would be there I thought he would have come home by now please Jimmy your parents miss you ah there's a kill and now I know there's a guy I have spotter I see his footprints oh there's a couple of them I'm coming to save you buddy cuz you are moments away from Jesus Christ okay they went this way never mind wait we're in the I'm all in this sense Oh our smelliest wabbit hunting season I don't know where the other four set of footprints went but we're just not gonna worry about that we're just gonna worry about what's in front of us right now and what's in front of us is I am oh I don't know but I'm jumping down Oh No yeah Oh got my I got my a key stop working again it's so disorienting come on keyboard work with me of all the keys that could go out like what the heck it's not even the one I use the most it you know I W is the one I use the most I mean come on that's how I play every game I hold up they're coming see out they're not coming wait what what do they know I wanted the knife um but then they started shooting and the guy heard and I started panicking and so I had oh I think he turned the corner at the worst second possible for him great for me Val and I'm dead silent so he has oh my god what is going on here hold on yeah well take that okay it's kind of UAB that's kind of harsh uh my vibe dude I'm literally just trying to vibe bro okay okay it must be this ammo attachment or something if I dude my shots are disappearing my left keep it I can't I have to move left with my mouse look right this is so disappointing I don't have a backup keyboard guys this is this is this is this is not oh god it's not good I'll have to rebind all my keys instead of last make it east it just it just doesn't say I have to move all my key bindings over I can't do that what adapt no thank you aha revenge is a dish best served without an a key that's right I don't need it lads never heard of her I'm more of a with guy you've been struck by you've been hit by a whizzed user but but about a bump them but a bump them my egg he doesn't work bump bump a bump bump but a bump bump I can't move left okay somebody is um okay couple people are doing stuff well what Jill look at this I found me a couple of tangos I can't hear for the life of me because I'm talking too much much fruit shut up they're here ah ah I got grenade grenade gangbanged gangrened they're saying for that if not I just made it gang grenade bang gang grenade gang gray bang Gingrey bang yeah let's got that that sounds nice does it though gangrel bang ya'll dude let's go gang GRU bang that dude yeah I love Gangu banging mr. fruit okay I'm gonna stop no yeah I honestly just should have never used the 725 to tap booty clap that's funny too cuz he's using the origin and at the very least you needed to tap pretty much anyway yeah I should have used the 725 last because then I wouldn't know what I'm you gas grenade using fiend you will pay for this you how did that not you know what come here where did he go where did he what where did not need if I were to use the r9o right now you Billy oh yeah this is way better why bother using the order ye well for starters origin is fun to say and on shipment it is one of the better ones because it's full fire full auto and you don't have to really waste between shots so I mean if you get a lot of people at one go it's alright but I don't know severe lack of range which I know shotguns are supposed to have was a little too short sometimes takes like 9 million bullets by that time brother you're already today it hey there's a toot at booty clap ahh that's my new saying hey I like that this is mine now mm-hmm you guys ever seen that mean pretty funny it's like a guy he's like made something and then his friend goes like whoa that's pretty cool and the guy goes yeah I made this and then this friend grabs it he goes no I made this it's like everything it's like reposting stuff on the internet on Reddit and Twitter and all that kind of stuff you made this no I made this oh you are so dead me muchacho oh you know I should have done I was thinking about it just animating them getting some good assessing this song up in this is AE okay I'm sorry I I don't know why I just said his a I certainly don't hope that becomes a regular part of my vernacular well look at that that wasn't so bad now as I mr. Fred I think you just judge a book by its cover that's not true I would just level this entire thing today and completed every single challenge so I think I have a pretty good grasp of this weapon and again wouldn't recommend recommend other shotguns but not this one what's he like right there if you can turn corners it's a great corner turner and on zan but aside from that brother just put it down like that first not even Oh specialist bonus though ah fudge I forgot to put on my war crime I forget what I'm going for challenges Oh someone just trying to look at me he's me my high alert alerted me I usually just go specialist to help me out a little bit with challenges and all that kind of good stuff but I can't get a war crime if I have specialists on mr. fruit I'm gonna make this daring jump oh my god you're a hero mr. freedom aah gasps freakin merciless though oh now we're on a ten kill spring oh my gut now we're just out your fraggin oh my god we actually were on a straight-up tear and then and then well here we are you know what I'm clear and B yeah somebody had to do it you're welcome call me all night ah well never mind I'm done call me no Mike because I'm outie oh I am surprised I killed him I think my friend weakened him up got a little saute in there you know what I'm saying we didn't eat that raw and uh had some nice flavor into it so I can't take all the credit oh that's a great piece of meat what did you do you just cooked it right I think no you had some seasoning some prep first off I didn't even kill it I just went to the local butcher and paid way too much for all you Wow some nice reflexes me mr. fruit plate what that is it some nice reflexes me mr. fruit that's like a weird first person or a second third person makes I don't know it's can't eat this guy see me where did he are we running in circles I don't I don't know I'm getting dizzy this is perfect never mind but it's the all the booty tap or two - what - taboo ducat that's right - ten who the clap we won the game we saved the world gotta be careful though if I keep winning dude military's gonna be like draft him draft him at World War three time this guy kills it in cod Haley that - Katie though once we get off a super crazy map what a big not a mum you know what I'm saying Matt about the origin ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for watching this and supporting this terrible terrible idea I had of getting Damascus we grow every cluster every gold means we're that much closer hopefully by the end of this week before playlist update I've got the other two shotguns done boom Platt shotguns we go from there but I think much for watching have you listened fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
