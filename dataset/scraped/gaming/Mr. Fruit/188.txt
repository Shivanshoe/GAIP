preach my good hello god god oh jesus christ it's it's subtle don't react get burned wow that's embarrassing hi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty vanguard and before we get into today's video i just want to remind you all that unless you click that like button i own you legally it's binding so or maybe you're into that okay either way just like the video thanks we now finally have a look at loadouts kill streaks field upgrades what are we working with here oh attack dogs bruh love that ghosts freaking black ops give them to me intel aka just a weird way to say uav i guess that makes sense because it didn't have uavs back then okay that's canon here package yep spot wait sp wait spy plane wait what hold on ping's on the minimap over a short period and it's oh it's only on the summoning player oh okay so whatever it's like it's like uh solo spy plane spy plane counter spy plane glide bomb okay that's probably predator missile cruise missile kind of thing death machine oh that's sick can't wait to pull that out and get gunned down before i can even rev it up oh persist through death until ammo is depleted oh never mind that's fun mortar barrage or war machine oh that was death machine this is the war machine and it also persists through that that's cool flame knot oh shoot and then oh freaking let's go attack dogs i'm probably never going to get that look at those those dobermans or something oh look that one's so happy oh well that's unlocked at level 4. ah fudge i wanted to see what they had okay well we'll be playing team death match we've already done champion hill before so i want to see what just a regular ol multiplayer looks like in call of duty vanguard tactical pacing six versus six that reminds me so i don't know if they gave me the option i assume they didn't but in the full game you can actually tailor your matchmaking to tactical or it's like chaos or something or realistic and depending on that is how fast you'll find the game and how many people so if i go chaos on this you know on this it's like regularly 6v6 and tactical but it could be like 10v10 or something and then realistic would be like 4v4 you know slower pace it's all about what you want to go for ah but let's m1 grand you know oh my god there's so many good ones i'm going to go with the m1 grand it's so sick adaptive triggers uh fortified high alert overkill perks oh god i hate that i'm excited to play it but god it's a call of duty freaking wait can i can i adjust the fov what the fudge is this um i don't think i can is that still just a pc thing oh man feels like i'm like right now what is it like 60 fov i think i'm going to throw up oh bring back it up all right well that was unexpected he's probably said what's this idiot doing i was thinking i was going to like kick it in kind of thing that was anticlimactic um all right i don't know the map either so this is gonna be interesting hey i think i remember this though from like the um the campaign initial gameplay or something could be making that up prop i'm getting i'm getting take this i don't know what i said but i go how do i oh guys guys anyone got eyes anyone got eyes anyone anyone anyone anyway is he there can even go there okay okay i see him now i see him okay freaking smoke that was a terrible smoke he's up there right in that little wind i'm gonna mount i'm gonna light this dude up show your dirty little face it was this boner doing hello sir really now he doesn't challenge me oh there is now that's i don't know sweet moses oh i do have overkill though so i guess the shotgun normally isn't something i can rock although this is a giant map feels like i don't know if shotgun's really the play here but i'm pulling it out anyway here we go somebody's doing something over here oh he doesn't know what what wait i killed him why let me replay oh he's got full of things so he knew i was looking at him is that high alert or something i don't know but i guess i have like incendiary rounds uh aka get pooped on grabbing supplies oh oh oh oh oh oh maybe there's nobody i don't know what i'm doing man this map's so confusing dude what are these guys call of duty pros they've been playing this like what's what's going on bruh bro you got somebody right in front of you ah i can barely make out people in the distance too or maybe it's because i'm just not seeing anyone maybe that's it i just don't even know what to look out for all right here i go i'm making plenty noise stomping and crunching oh somebody's watching me why does it feel like oh get burned you stupid pleb okay let's stay in this building seems like there's a lot of hubbub around here i like hubbub means action i'm all about action is there a way to get are there not stairs at least there's some public service who's looking at me who's looking at me wow that's embarrassing so you can see i handle pressure really well what what okay all right let's let's change the load out here let's go uh sniper rifle yeah oh oh now where can i purchase i have no idea wait there was a guy in this building that sat on ah oh here it is here it is this is where i started the game yeah you might not remember that but i do okay what are we looking for here if it's using the modern warfare engine i wonder if my sniper scope will have a glint ooh the silencer is nice that silenced it but i have a feeling that's gonna impact dps a little bit bop ah fudge i just keep finding them that's just the worst possible timing i really don't have much field of view here i'm just going to sit like this they'll never think to look right the fudge no that's an electrical box what's the point of this stupid oh we got action whoa one shot one kill baby i think someone's in our building oh that was a head shot tater tots oh hold up i got intel i'll go intel voice shaman okay so apparently they have to be pretty close because i'm not getting any uh fudge me that wasn't my best now was it oh he's laying prone come on where you at poke peek do something come oh somebody's got a cruise missile i'm hardscoping for for my life man oh here we go i don't even know what that means that's what i get for camping ooh look at the little flashlight that's fun what is this thing oh three round burst okay oh jordy kill him well done okay i think i have a stem is that what i'm looking at right oh somebody's who's looking at me who's looking at me i need names you cowards yes what the this map seems small but big so far it just plays a little strange wait a second oh is this like modern warfare where they're not showing up on the map so i just have to get used to not looking holy grenade rigor mortis now jesus christ is this a horror game jump scares galore yeah i still haven't figured out if it's a stem i need someone to wound me but not bravely okay that's perfect thank you okay that's a stem that's a stem that's gonna be a little contentious um and what i mean by that is uh that's obviously all i'm gonna be using uh it's all used in modern warfare let's be honest what is this gun the it's reversed whatever not feeling it not feeling it bit of a miss for me right now maybe it's the scope it's just feels like such a large scope feels gratuitous i forgot i have um i have this thing go goliath accelerate sure it's like a free rc xd come on buddy come on there we go okay hold on you don't see anything this is actually large not that mobile so i guess it doesn't have that much going for it i'm going in oh come on come on get get in are you kidding you're big enough for this well that sucks okay but now i know they're in here [Laughter] this thing sucks i'm going to i'm going to this stock dude i got ghost forward intel and double time oh ghost you know i love that you know i'm about that life freaking grenada the fudge you might like what's going on guys level 15 on my team level 11. it hasn't even been out for it's been out for like minutes or hours i don't actually clearly long enough that they know what they're doing and i don't oh my god someone's on a 10 kill streak his name's literally skill based matchmaking that's what his sbm and he got dogs it's a little sus victory way to go guys oh the enemy team really won though i mean let's be honest nice play the game let's see it nice frag look at this guy freaking jump in his shoulder and use something you're nuts but yo what i'm saying is catch me on pc how about that oh this map looks fun it's also fun to say uh we're rock we're rocking the mp4 i love the weather effects okay uh i love how one of their selling points stuff for the game is like uh reactive environments aka destructive environments aka things other games like battlefield have been doing for a really long time but ooh i love the reactive aim down sights like i don't have to go all the way on this trigger for it to activate it's it's subtle but i like it also i got a kill and it gave me a running thing what does that mean does like ghost activate only after i get a kill or something where am i getting shot from i don't know what are my perks survival training radar tactician okay see so yeah i don't really know what happened but wait wait wait i see that guy on the radar wait maybe they do show up on the radar we're gonna hate this high alert thing just because everyone's using it i don't know what this is is this an impact grenade uh-huh missed but reactive environment sorry i'm just really trying to sell myself for a sponsored ad whoa look at this fast-paced intensity what a cool map the boat is react we react i'm jumping down script yo where you at oh i don't know man i see i killed a guy i got a little run icon i don't know what that's about maybe it's the game reacting to me so reactive am i right guys am i right yo call of duty when am i getting a um partner code are those still those are things right like modern warfare bro like come on also what am i getting my account back i've talked about this you remember how i got like damascus you know in modern warfare hundreds of hours uh cold war war zone all that progress skins bought yeah my account's gone it's been gone for almost a year now still don't have it back so if that you know if we could that could be a thing just trying to get in their good graces you i just want my account back man that's all i want holy oh okay yep snipers leave a glint snipers leave a glint confirmed told some grenade dude what is this playing back my day everybody's around the gun didn't care about anything all these tactical players are out playing me and so i'm just trying to find ways to make excuses but really they're playing the way i should be playing amen brother all right fine i won't sprint around like a crazy person look where it got him no dude how is everyone they're fast what is what am i looking at how is that little machine pistol better than my sub machine gun he's already found the the broken meta apparently where do i find this machine pistol i'm hearing so much about who is looking to die today you are that's the answer i wonder if it's like a trait of the smg's i don't think they've done that added intrinsic traits to weapon glasses there's an idea though okay he tried to drop shot me get absolutely pooped on sir what let me let me just for one video let me look like i'm decent first person shooters now again it doesn't help them on controller an absolute potato these days but but if you're a fragger you should just always frag right doesn't matter the peripherals you use it is such a lie yes it does holy oh see skill based matchmaking i'm playing i just played with it there are more than like 20 people playing this beta bruh but you wouldn't know that because i'm getting paired with the same people reactive environments so cool i'm sorry oh oh wait whoa now don't get me wrong i am excited for this game i'm excited for another call of duty i can't yep that is somebody oh i almost had him i don't know if he has like ghost or if there's some perk that hides your username farther out but yeah i kept i'm like is that a guy i think that's a guy i can't tell if that's a guy oh reactive uh platform is in use oh jesus your friend you are my friend ow oh everything hurt oh my god dead bodies everywhere why does it feel like somebody's looking at us what are you guys doing up there huh get it get a job oh oh god you weren't friendly now they're behind us none wait what am i oh my god oh what up dude i didn't know we could get up ah well maybe i was better off not realizing you could go up there about here what do we have here hello i have come to react to the environment yeah react to this react to these nuts is it like react environment like how we're killing uh our our planet is that the kind of reactive environment we're talking about somebody oh my god stompy mcgee over here yeah watch this watch this they're not going to see this coming they didn't even know i'm going to open it up hello oh i says i love oh who's hating me do they know i'm here they don't know i'm here wait can you destroy this wall it kind of looked like that grenade kind of right oh jesus christ where am i going freaking i'ma try it ah maybe not maybe not i don't know why i keep screaming like a banjo i'm sorry we all handle stress differently okay like for me i eat peanut butter filled pretzels okay or peanuts filled peanut butter peanut pretzel filled peanut butter i said that right right what is this thing oh shoot i don't know but it fires like crazy oh it's a panzer shrek oh my god what the fudge i can't see dick i mean sorry that was rude of me i can't see anything nothing okay wait guys there's somebody over here jesus christ every time i'm like it can't be that bad and then i look down the sides i'm like what it really is that bad got him um i'll play quite frankly let's try it again i think there's someone here but i can't nope that's a palm tree could have pulled me um prediction and then swap nothing okay i'm going on the beach call me normandy because i'm storming it baby whoo somebody's behind me pain let me care package oh i don't think so oh i don't where is it where is it i cannot see it i got lucky next time i'm taking it out oh okay i'm liking this thing oh yeah fast firing pretty stable what's not told we got one yeah we got one man this kind of feels like modern warf it really does feel like modern warfare i'm having a hard time discerning the enemies against the map they all look so similar holy hip fire go great single that felt good wait oh that was a thermite well maybe it didn't feel that good gotcha you sassy little baca wait what no but your friend wait we're running out of time and we're behind let me just get 20 24 kills real quick is that how many 24. oh man i almost had it oh but we win let's go oh my god he has a death machine death machine go burr indeed we win even whoa my god i'm still level two what the i just want loadouts man oh i like the look of this man oh this has the machine pistol well let's try it out you know for going back for the historical pieces like this give me world war ii alternate timeline where it's like right after the war or something but the germans actually won you know that's the stuff oh my god how did someone kill me with this thing wireless battery levels low that what the how did they kill me with this thing like nothing in the magazine i guess the duke's just a god where the fudge oh they're driving us react react okay fudge it's reacting but too slow i'm so surprised you wouldn't let me just melee it down okay maybe we put the machine pistol away after i get one kill holy suck does that guy just happen that kill me with this thing have an anti-recoil plug-in or something oh my god i'm i'm actually a cowboy trying to wrestle a buck like what oh my god wait but maybe a headshot with this thing kind of kind of do me nutty though oh my god wait wait a second i think we're onto something i think we might be onto something don't sprint around corners i gotta put remember this is more like modern warfare what did we learn when we played that you gotta play slow gotta play tactical gotta let the environment react to us oh my god i'm so good at this game holy suck hard in my language use the intel i've called it a favor all right show me where they are ow oh they're behind me man what are you doing sitting in this corner i'm gonna i'm go i'm coming for you i'm gunning for you stupid darn it get pooped on stupid oh oh you're dead you are very dead yo what is this is this i like the sights on this uh and i'm gonna say i actually really like this map it's it feels very call duty it's not like super big or anything it feels tight-knit and once i learn it yeah i don't know this feels more classical like modern warfare but on smaller maps and i'm here for it i'm gonna use my goliath hopefully nobody decides to walk on by oh but how am i gonna get inside i don't think i can get your dead body out of my way come on i see a kill get your dead body out of here can i really not come on buddy come on oh come on come on man here we go here we go really wow what poor timing i don't want to watch that it hurt once i don't need it what the i think i think we're under fire what is from where okay well oh there's a fella over here oh there was a fella over here giggity get getting caught trying to smoke me out i'll smoke you back out that's my friend so sorry is that sbmm is that it is bro i'm playing with the same four people like what how's
