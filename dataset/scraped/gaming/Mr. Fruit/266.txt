heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the internet where you have found yourself on this website we all know is youtube hey hi how are you and welcome back to more garlic phone in today's video i did something necessary a necessary evil and i think we'll all be better because of it it'll push us to be better people and that's what it's all about right enjoy the video we're establishing rules ground rules for this one round okay okay two rules one no among us in any shape and or form god okay and we even have to do that and two no words you cannot put any letters or words the only time you can put a letter is if it's like a logo or icon or something okay okay like a m for mario yeah like a name for mario would be fine but anything you have to add out of it or anything does not count does that make sense mm-hmm [Music] i wanted to go like harambe like instead of here um so did you guys all pick beautiful prompts yes see i'm throwing it i'm flipping it in this universe never heard of that game could you tell me about it it's about an alien magic school bus okay whoever wrote this well played oh my god this is hilarious okay clogs an artery we got the magic school that's hilarious something like that and then we got the magic scubas i can't tell you the last time i watched that show okay so i can't write magic or anything i don't remember if there's like any specific things that like set the magic school bus apart i don't think so and then it has like little stop sign on it game changer i don't know how else i want to convey this it's like some more arteries i'm gonna make this quick and then like because it's like oh pain you know um and it's inside your body i don't know that that challenged me creatively so fair play um yeah that was tough proud of that was tough out of what i do no among us around is going to be good i'm already feeling great broke the rule where they wrote a word i'm just saying son of a it was a logo no it's not it was a logo mike explicitly said right something i'll have you know thank you uh first off and secondly there was a way i could distinctively make something clearer by putting words but i was like no i can't and you know it makes it more challenging you know challenge your brains also this is a great drawing wait what so many um so many freaking spongebob things where did this come from squidward and a box arms out all right now we got to move to squidward i can't remember squidward at all um something like this right it's been a long time i used to draw spongebob all the time in class when i was younger but it's been a minute since your boy had to do that i think he has a little tentacle thing and then he's like t posing essentially apparently [Music] like that and then i don't have time to do his clothes but something like that you know having not seen squibbered in a very long time at least for my memory i think that's pretty solid probably proven wrong um i was singing the entire time i did my drawing i just want to let you guys know that i i feel like i know [Music] who is this um what the heck is this i feel like i'm thinking of the wrong person oh my god i feel like someone tried to like they couldn't figure out how to draw something so they tried to like draw other things to like create the word i don't um i'm scared to draw this frankly um and i think rightfully so [Music] um jesus okay this is the iceberg piercing it you see what i'm just going for here here scene bit of a stretch but work with me all right and then we got to add some ice here you got like some shine because it's ice you know okay then the titanic which i can't even know what it looks like so that alone is pretty embarrassing does it have a red stripe i know i feel like most boats have red stripes that's what i'm gonna do it's got its little thing got its rotors but then it's like blushing like wait um it's like it's the best i could do i'm so sorry forgive me father for i have sinned i mean honestly it doesn't look it's just the iceberg stabbing the titanic really with a new river it doesn't have to be weird i tried to do so much that worked i think i i think that might have been my best drawing i didn't want to break the rules i feel like i'm about to start working for pixar whoever has my drawing knows i've got i've got the job um what is happening here these are pretty good you know i'm liking it's very off the wall and you know what i'm gonna say this i see a meme here but it's an old one and it checks out and i'm not mad for now is it like my meme no my meme oh my goodness i feel like i actually drew really well this time yeah all right here we go i'm proud of this round from what i immediately screws up by writing words okay listen it's a logo i forgot about that the humans honestly though don't worry i got it thing harambe the humans nice that was the idea it's like an alternate universe that's a reverse harambee though yes wait wait do we actually do we know the name of the kids no do you know that lord i i don't know the name of the kid i don't care the mother is a horrible parent well i was gonna say like this is harambe i'm trying to figure out like so and so put harambe down because like you know but nine children that you were sitting there the whole like 30 seconds you have to get like there's like a wave of in the background like i don't know where this happens no that's supposed to be the like thing like where harambe is at and like it's just reverse harambe and like the the mom the mom harambe left the kid harambe down and had the very nice humans the very nice human picked it up but but what the mystery doesn't know is the apes are gonna kill him also what's up with that monkey's nose we got nigel my issue is that the bean children are missing like chunks of their heads i will say we kept on track for a pretty good amount until the last one yeah again guys so mo documents but you must write marvelous okay i can understand the confusion i forgot what squidward looked like oh you guys can't wait to see my very color choice why is he t-posing it's squidward's in the box arms out yeah why wouldn't he be t-posed in the imagination boxing oh i noticed was his spectacular mustache i know yeah yeah oh that's just his normal mouth oh that's his mouth well i forgot how squidward is a mustache it was the eyelids it was the eyelids once i put the eyelids right i was like oh yeah i think the hat helped out too yeah yeah like the perception of this drawing like it was like depth to it it kind of looked like he was in a microwave but i didn't say that one class in high school or something uh it did not get anywhere from the modoc though that was enough yeah to be fair can we talk about how good this modoc yeah i was gonna say that's an excellent modoc yeah that's incredible i have no clue what modoc is that's it you don't know what i oh my yeah ahead yes very talented i like that in the harry potter yeah to make it yeah the hair helps sponge bob is very surprised it was the expression [Music] circle kratos from fortnite goes to applebee's wait a second hold on why are you the way that you are i'm bringing it back the thing is hey i'm okay with it we've had a soft band on applebee's but it's back in the meta the i know when i got this and i want to know how it went from kratos to who i saw yeah that is clearly oh bless you what have you done links iphone that is not link at all every time the prompt or drawing gets the bless it changes completely every time 180. i like it it was that was a good link oh my god to me no yeah i tried guys all right i it's completely different it kind of looks like a uh worker from house yeah having well he's like giving you two options he's like hey man it's one of these um yeah see that's what i got and i was like wait it was supposed to be kratos for the boys at we got applebee's um but for some reason someone decided link is kratos yeah just pretty much identical figures but to be honest drawing looks like like creative magic school bus clogs an artery yes rage i got this and i was like that's so clever oh that's a good way to draw it okay so i took it to the extreme yeah he's like i'm so sorry forgive me sad school bus running overkill oh [Laughter] see if it the boss from cars had a hit and run with harambee every time bless gets to say something it changes if you look at the drawings in order it really is a beautiful story yeah it's getting big it explodes and then it comes out and hits and then okay i wasn't inviting to the wedding so i just assumed it was like this yeah probably no [Music] oh i thought it was somebody and i was like i don't know if it's bob marley but because of the glasses i thought it was like 80s 70s it's pride month raj i focused so hard on the glasses that's not a mask there's no blue in well i just i just wanted an inside look to fruit's wedding but i guess that's okay so yeah and that's exactly how it went down from a weird white guy in wedding dress to bob marley yeah as does every wedding the titanic and the iceberg get loved [Music] [Music] [Applause] between the titanic and the iceberg i got you don't worry yes a little more zoomed in right now i got you well no no rob this is telling the story it's telling a story because they're getting closer oh yeah the titanic and iceberg make love less than true oh if you will getting closer if you want to see the music if you want to see the story continuing [Laughter] that is an actual story and i'm actually downloading that that is so good that's good oh that one and they lived happily ever after i love how barry accidentally we made like a story of it getting closer and closer captain iceberg ahead nice nice steak to stay the course man [Music] foreign
