hi 80 Holdren money miss mr. fruit and welcome back to balance and in today's video I will not mention how I enjoy this more than overwatch right now or how I think this game is criminally underrated because I do that every time and people are like mr. fruit you do that every time and that time doesn't count okay from now on there is a new champion in the realm Tiberius the weapons master I was looking at his abilities and apparently he well he does damage so let's do this I gotta get him I gotta get him given to me yeah we got him yeah I love how he talks what accent is that I'm not a dialect master jungle cat is that maybe he's evidently a damaged character so I plan on doing a lot of that or has its work this is my main ability okay so they can ricochet that's important to note why they ricochet a whole bunch of times I don't know what I just did oh I can throw my blade this I believe I'm faster and I can attack faster and then I found a pound as a jungle cat load this thing anyway I'm a little confusing apparent when I activate it I can then use two different abilities up to five times for 15 seconds does this happen to lift me it does I'm so glad because I was gonna die otherwise ah boom oh my god oh my damage oh I need to get get away from this though hmm okay we're good and Bob throw that toss I'm missing no I'm not that's a kill awesome buddy over here huh Oh pounced boom boom throw my sword oh ma I'm already Pro I'm already a main of tiberias I was about to forget his name and I was like this is oh my never mind maybe just what the heck I was like one hit and I'm done all right I got to make sure to use my cue though there's no reason not to increase movement speed and attack speed I think so boom boom you're dead boom boom toss my sword douche bring it back bah miss okay whatever fine you're dead bah boom why aren't you dead okay I had to reload that's why Oh broke let's go we already got the point oh my god I love paladins is it because I'm just the best that is purely speculative and I can neither confirm nor deny these rumors oh my god but my attack speed phone boom Ricky Shane boom boom throw my sword boom bring it back boom uh-huh oh and I got my old now let's see what this does ha ha oh my god ok I don't know what I'm doing but it's sick for sure go pose oh my okay I am a fan let me see if I can ricochet under that dude it didn't work but he's that the fellow Tiberius must be but I don't have never seen him on the loading screen I don't think it was I think I'm just crazy and another kill another one well were you running after you boy oh my got my attacks beat my damage my sword throw recall boom Oh jump wait this isn't a part of the script wall jokes on them just means I got to get some more skills so now they are done for jungle kitty bout to go ham where you going come back here up it well nowhere is the answer was fun while it lasted wasn't it buddy oh my god come in yeah yes another kill throw this Julie oh my god that's a double kill it appears to penetrate through people good to know you're gonna die too yep yep yep yep yep yep yep and even better watch this whoo Boosh that was not quite as cool as I wanted to make it sound on god boom bolted ah oh skadoosh oh my god and yeah yeah I'm a genuine cat ah now I need to be able to climb walls there should be an enemy to counter me and all they do is point out a laser and I'm immobilized I can't help but focus the laser alright let's do this again but in even more style and I know I know I hear is that even possible well my friends we're gonna find out I love this though oh my god yeah I'm above or behind rather I suppose it's how you look at it ok the important thing to note though is long recalling my thing I can't attack but does it really matter the ricochets really hard to get used to I feel like you just kind of get lucky with it I'm trying don't get me wrong oh bomb King you brass cap the point I'm practically single-handedly carrying this I'll leave this guy leave this guy who's he thinking oh I don't know what that is you throw the sword recall it oh my god his whole kit is just so sick what about you ma'am huh you want a piece set that champ imagine if I had a real wet wait wrong game mr. fruit wrong again ah you've got a hit hit your shots there we go or hit your plates I guess as soon as they spawn there we go I'm headed in boom ba huh you didn't expect me to come right at you did you mmm you're so weak and he's dead Oh Oh your friend kind of took that one for you you should be thanking him sure I'm going faster ah we'll use attack speed gah gah go go go and I'm gonna oh shoot oh come here me aah her name is made by the way I just keep saying that so I have to hold Kay I think I'm running out of time

we won hey let's go top play baby yeah you like this boom kill I did a lot of this this game so it's really hard to tell which one they wanted double kill practically mine yep that was stolen from a triple kill Quadra kill best damage yes sir he's even sitting at the home screen now he and I are one were cut from the same cloth oh look at this skin I'm a cheetah friends friends you can all stay behind it's ok I'll I'll still look Gary this you're not as soon as I talk big and I'm gonna lose but that's okay is this this is a div French man yes it is yes I knew that wait is it no no it's the

recall it I hope my golly that damage we're gonna do a bridge wait but that's not fair hey who just makes that giant wall it must be a skin that's a dope skin so I'm sort of like pixel Arcadia retro scan or something objective captured let's go team play in the obj for me appreciate that I'll play the kill them objective that is just as important because it allows us to pressure the objec I don't want to hear it okay what are you doing up there huh yeah what are you doing what are you doing what do you want for me wow that hurt don't worry guys up push the obj I'm actually doing something I know she was you know then I throw my sword and then I recall it and then I go oh my god I am in so much pain get ready for it I'm about to alt and it's gonna be crispier ready Oh God where's you oh wait come here where's Jim comeback was yeah what the fudge I'm wasting my entire old on this tea but whatever foam yeah we got sending the message boom we got him boom boom oh my wait more than got him push six bro easiest easiest games of my life Iberia is literally setting the game too easy mode let's push the advantage on their side they won't see this coming except evidently everyone on my team is doing it so they probably see it coming all right let's demon before I do this a-hole you sweet summer child boom bounce Tom oh what's that the support in the back is getting jumped on Oh No Wow sword boom throw you're dead make it oh hold on I had to reload make it another one that's right you can't heal through all this damage hopefully you guys kill the other ones cuz I practically did myself I got you you lucky son but maybe the Ricochet would get hip-hop I would have been so sick yo check out the wizard oh you did okay okay okay but I'm kind of hurt hold on oh there we go now I got the kill to heal going though another another person almost down let me just pounce go dude yeah you're dead boom take that take that ah why do I recall my sword recalling the sword actually seems to just be the worst choice because I I can't do anything dying mr. fruit really that's embarrassing but that's okay I got my old and they're about to taste my brass and I got to tell you I don't think they're gonna like it much boom boom whole intro oh I don't know what that was but that hurt a lot was that your old it must be wait a minute we lost the objective but I'd I talked so big what do you mean this cannot be possible what did my sword just go just like disappeared you know you know just throw some swords do some damage we got to get their backline now I have a lot of healers going on here oh but they're here yeah look they got like eight million healers okay well then I know what I need to do ready hon gah skadoosh boom boom boom skadoosh boom yeah that's how you take care of things with raw brute force strategy was never my finer suit and thankfully I don't need it I'm going to hide right around this corner and they're never going to see it coming Jerry give me my sword back alright I know they're right here I'm just waiting for them oh oh I don't know who that is but well they're dead and then up my attack speed is that a Heuer yes it is well gonna be hard to take the obj without any healing huh bro oh my golly single-handedly killing the enemy team it's what I do it's what rather Tiberius does Oh what is this a wild healer Wow oh wait you're getting healed wait this is actually hold on oh my god you won't die so much healing them I'm buying some more cauterize here in that try and heal through my attacks I'll just go cauterize three yeah then you're gonna realize what pain really is check this out what you know boom up my attack speed boom cauterize you ain't healing girl not today not on my watch oh Jesus holy shucks I'm sorry I did I accidently okay but crucially it all went according to plan because they weren't on the point just as I defense successful exactly right now the rest of this is the cakewalk I must amend for the sins that I have committed which is we let them take a point doesn't matter how many points the fact is they got a point and I'm not a fan and this time you're not getting out of this girl wait yes you are what we don't know that Jake is but new plan just fight everyone except that person I don't have enough damage or something to get through it it doesn't really make sense wait a minute they're actually about to get this point wait what the fudge well then I need to do something about this don't I good douche on God and then skadoosh boom and skadoosh boom and skadoosh boom and skadoosh oh i got stunned i must increase my movement speed and then come back over here because they will have think i would have run away but i did not and that is a kill and then pounce Boosh right onto this
