hi a bee hold on my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare you guys thought I was done with the Damascus grind didn't ya thought I finally gave in did you well uh bah freakin Bob that's right gold and platinum done for all the LMGs now you gotta say with this buzzsaw blueprint platinum actually looks clean now technically we've only done a gold video on the PKM but I've been grinding away got Gold's on all the LMGs before making a video so I was like hey why not just use the plat then you know I'm saying well we'll use plat and then if I remember a game - I'll switch to gold so you get the best of both worlds if you're curious by default this is the sa80 7 LMG we'll be rocking the sa80 7 twelve point four inch factory barrel five mill watt laser torch deck CQB Comstock that stippled grip tape and that Gucci slide a hand if you've watched my call Duty videos you'll see there's a common theme when I make a loadout how can I take whatever gun amusing and turn it into the most SMG variant possible now I must go ahead and apologize ooh I just took a sip of my warm honey tea you might be able to hear it I'm still pretty sick but the card tint must live on so the cheese help my throat feel a little bit better and it makes me feel all warm and fluffy and sad you know what I'm saying nothing like a warm tea on a cold winter morning I should learn how to make like good tea it always seems like so delicious you always hear about people drinking and everything like that sounds amazing but you know what else is amazing the plat on this camo oh my gosh it actually just looks like that I'm telling you what the gold trimming sprout like this is this is actually kinda nice with it if I'm being honest with you I can't see a darn thing for the life of me but I don't need to see to be able to tell you that that man is straight-up dead sir a guy hiding around here I think there's there was a guy hiding use six somebody get over here oh fudge kind of a spun was that a little just spun right oh by the way I am I'm an idiot so I am running hardline and kill streak because I I don't know I don't have a good answer for you maybe we'll get a gunship it's kind of what I'm hoping for we'll run out of ammo pretty quick because I wanted scavenger but sometimes you just you got it you got to take things oh wait a minute oh no you son of a that was reloading my gun because I just found one of my old guns laying around I got more ammo I got excited I know I'm getting greedy with the kill streaks but I didn't remember to at least change them it took about three videos to remind myself hey change of killstreaks mr. fruit I'm a bit absent-minded when it comes to that thing wait I only got one of those there's like three people lined up only one of them my anus four oh okay thank you for the killed Oh what about your anus bro it's it's real it's not you don't need to bother yourselves with these sort of trifle concerns wait a minute I'll protect me you pleb I got a cruise missile inbound this is how the gunship starts at old it is TDM on shipment which means like two kills and the game's over but if I can get these screws yes okay we're one off we are one off right now from the VTOL okay that's a good start and then VTOL over here hurry up please I am I am exposed I'm running I'm running to hide I'm running to hide alright VTOL you need to start doing something buddy old pal shut up guys this is fun and this is interactive I hope they don't have a radar I did not think about this if they have a radar I wait is that a chopper gunner war put the fudge who gave this guy a chopper oh my god I almost had a chopper gunner [Laughter] don't work yourself up there mr. fruit you're gonna you're gonna trigger your asthma and your coughing fits again okay calm down take a sip of your tea you're right thanks dad seriously that is one of the things I hate about colds though is they feel twice as worse because of my asthma I feel like if I didn't have asthma Bob would kick this thing in the butt already I briefly swept to the golden camera so you guys can see it this game I this might be the first time I kind of prefer the platinum it doesn't quite shout as loud as hey look at this camo I'm sick but it's kind of like a okay it's a more subtle like oh you see me don't you yeah hello and then you look oh my god you a beauty girl are you looking good that's how I feel I will say that say 87 is one of my favorite SMGs LMGs and fruit and slip there like I said I tried making my last in jeez so sometimes the line gets blurred you know at what point am I using an LMG well ideally never is the answer I mean some of the big ones like yeah I don't m87 or whatever the one with like the hundred round belt to boot is oh my god that thing is it's too much that thing takes forever to start going for it even no matter the attachment should never watch the fire it spits up slowly it doesn't do much damage because you're shooting eight billion bullets of that that's why so it's like a I still think PKM is the best it did get a little nerve for a while ago but that ain't stopping it from doing what it does and that is destroying people oh nice kill me hide behind this forklift me old friend I don't know I don't know why I said me instead of my friend what am i some sort of a sick pirate I've got scurvy that'd be it yard oh wait a second Oh hide hide run to cover hide hide run to cover use this predator missle I don't know if that's an enemy just spawn right in front of me I'm looking for more than one kill and here we go oh oh my god chopper gunner in bad chopper gonna freakin it bad give me a second give me a second fudge me ah fudge me did they spa oh my oh my I was I was one off from a chopper gunner after my veto why it's the only thing about that's why I want to play a trust man at least when I get my killstreaks oh I got somewhere to hide I can't hide anywhere to let my killstreaks do all the killin you know I'm saying cuz they're so busy they're just so tiny that frame suck dude whatever I swear by the old gods and the new I will get a chopper go to this video all right I can't guarantee anything but I will certainly try leave this in conspicuous corner chopper gunner chopper gunner does whatever chopper gunner does what corner am I going to fudge where are they oh that's where they were but they just spawned so I can't even hurt them stupid why can you shoot people off spawn but you can't you can't use a kill streak hot spot there goes my hero get quite cig like I used to of to SiC y'all make me suit it's a great meme you haven't seen that you might be confused oh my god just look up like y'all make me sick alright take number fours or something okay okay okay eight million kills and bound kaduche what only one yeah sure in my name Samantha but it's not more like my name is mr. vegetable which again it is not well I got a VTOL that doesn't matter because that's not a job Ariane and now I don't want to call to be told because it's useless I can't build towards the next kill streak and all I'm gonna do is get more kills and make my skill based matchmaking that much worse I need some tea I was more so eyeing at the sweet release of tea on my throat and not so much the sweet release of death green tea is very good though for the body it's got some nice natural caffeine which caffeine and the right doses and all that kind of stuff can actually help promote healthier metabolism green tea is the healthiest beverage on the planet it is loaded with antioxidants and nutrients that have powerful effects on the body these include improve brain function fat loss lower risk of cancer and many other impressive benefits thank you google ah ah didn't switch back to the platinum see this is why I never changed my KML because never remember to change it back platinum is so much cooler but whatever at least you guys got to see one game with it and there's plenty more platinum LMGs to come so fear not and by plenty I mean two more because there's only four you have to get for Damascus no I did not finish the holden or whatever that thing is is it holden or am i just thinking of expanse which by the way just caught up on expanse finish season for man season five wins such a good show yeah Thank You Amazon for saving it by the way the real helm is Jeff Bezos I love you you and me can do it like they do on the Discovery Channel dang and I just got my predator missile too but I won't be able to enjoy that slaws of what oh my god I'm seeing so many different bodies I don't know who's who peekaboo we had a shotgun well no wonder for some reason I thought he was using a sniper I was like oh yes getting close and come fake is it tea break and resume I got put a little too much sugar in it though I'm using stevia or whatever cuz I was like um ha I won't use actual sugar will give me being health conscious but I don't actually know if that's a much better alternative be I put too much in it just kind of it all came out at once okay listen it's it's not what I wanted to have happen but it is what it is the honey's nice though see I don't think I needed honey and stevia I think that's where I went wrong well who really knows it also doesn't help that I googled it you know how to make tea well okay not that like obviously but I was like how long do I put water in the microwave for tea yeah then I followed a week II ow like I said I'd love to be able to learn to how to make your great cool tea but that don't Oh the OL asthma's acting up

anyway or makes me think of the Rugrats movie anybody else who's that just me why are you spotting right in front of me like this stop I am trying to unmount the king on top of the mountain unlike Smaug okay I know this is gonna sound weird I tweeted it a little while ago I to get hype sometimes I'll listen to the voice lines of Smaug from The Hobbit I know it sounds pretty stupid but God his voice is just so good and so deep got a role at bay see my wings are like every Taha chills chills bro I know I know I know it's weird it's weird excrete I'm a weird dude alright what do you want from me this should not be news to you and if it is well I'm so sorry feel free to unsubscribe I'm just kidding please don't fudge me what yeah what the fudge I got like black screen to death or something I don't really know happen the good news though ah suck that's not good news but the good news with alum Jesus there they do have some nice range not a whole bunch of fall-off at all in fact you can

Seuss making up rhymes and words here rec sedate rested oxidation oxy the fudge is this playoffs called you know what I'm talking about it's that who cares anymore oh god I can barely breathe I've been trying not to record too much because I know how annoying it can be to listen to somebody who's all stuffed up but I'm out of videos so I got to record something so I've been trying my best to make it so I'm not as unpleasant as possible to listen to hopefully hopefully it's okay I don't know but I guarantee I've been dry for a second there I was talking in such a way it sounded like I was Barack Obama it was that like key and Peele sketch where he spoofed Obama so yeah it's just the right thing for America to do moving forward and I think the I don't know I can I mean I can't do an Obama impression but it's the way he speaks that the pace and he's much more delivered with his words I'll give him that much better speaker than I you imagine me president oh what a scary world that would be and that's why I'll be running fruit 2020 for everybody 2024 hope to hope to have you in my campaign I'm accepting donations now which may or may not go towards Reese's and tea instead of a future campaign but I cannot confirm nor deny that hey we're waiting yeah I didn't know but the game says it so it must be true okay dodging and now bobbin and Weavin you want to kill me no I'm an elusive badger victory that means tea break Oh guys I'm out of tea looks like the agenda for the rest of the day is a lot of tea and not much talking we are gonna continue this Damascus grind my friends so with that said only thing all much watching have you Liz a fan - yeah I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
