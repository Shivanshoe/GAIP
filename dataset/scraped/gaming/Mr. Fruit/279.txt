heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to roguelords it is i the purveyor of all things roguelite roguelike card battlers freaking daddy thing like that in fact i made a joke tweet about how i'm debating making my 27th channel and just naming it mr fruit plays roguelikes in my gaming career i would say currently it's my favorite genre i'm all about it okay but the thing is especially on the main channel whenever you play one it's usually longer form and it's a bit different than what most people expect coming to this channel so some of them are like one-offs and stuff and i know that upsets some of you so maybe further on i will just dedicate uploading roguelite or roguelikes to our second channel more mr fruit or maybe you know finn act up and actually make another one i probably shouldn't because i've already made like too many channels so i don't know how many that works anyway let's get into it i'm excited about this one okay so i completed the tutorial and i don't think i've played beyond that i saved myself for you all so we're gonna start a new run here it's very similar in the same vein to games like slay the spire and whatnot we've seen a lot of iterations on that formula since the game came out and was popularized this one it does something pretty cool and i'll show you all the gist though tldr or tldw about the intro and the gist of the game is i am the debu i'm the devil and we're on earth chillin freaking demons everything we're like freaking owning dudes but then the vampire hunters the demon hunters whatever like rose up and they were a little tougher than i was prepared for me being the devil they banished us to hell and so i'm slowly coming back trying to regain my strength and destroy the demon hunters so that's what we're doing here the club shut your mouth cut from the chest drives out all inspiration from anyone who chatty cathy over here okay so you're gonna see bottom right you know very similar to slay the spa and whatnot where you have the little route ahead of you i like the fact though that the overworld you know you kind of see yourself running about i don't know if i can view my party here i can so you get to choose your disciples i don't know how many are going to be in the game you can probably already unlock more i'm not really sure this is just the demo but i have three people this is the interesting thing you use three people and you all share the same energy so unlike some other games where it's like slay the spire and you have like two characters but each one has their own action points this is a pool so you have to decide and distribute accordingly to who you want to go and whatnot so we have dracula the headless horseman and bloody mary so they all have their own passive they recharge their skills that's another thing is using a skill takes an action point but some of them if not all of them have a use so if you use one you can no longer use it until you recharge that person's skills and that costs action points as well but see i am the devil and this is a really cool part i can essentially cheat as the devil would so at the cost of my own life force i can add or subtract hp add or attract sp which is like another form of health two different ones remove statuses move statuses i have one i don't like here you take that friend i can recharge a skill add or subtract chance of social tests i can create a portal i can replace one secondary activity with another i don't even know how to use them all i just know i can if i want to so what is this main activity uh i think this is where we have to start i don't have a choice so my disciples go to the home of okay thank you for your narration i'll take it from here my disciples go home to the you guys don't come here for exposition okay i want to show you the game your influence is growing that's another thing terror depending on what your actions are on the game it can affect future battles and stuff so the falling effects will affect the zone situated in two nights i can double the number of souls to be won upon arrival in this zone i receive 60 souls or upon arrival in the zone i discover a trait from one of your disciples i the following effect oh all of those are taken into effect oh wow oh and then they're split up so i have to decide upon arrival receive souls upon arrival discover a trait and it's elite combat yo we're freaking going that way gamba this can only go well right we're going to go into combat and even harder combat yeah why not so we're going to take the road less traveled there's a cdn effects present in the zone are none and look for the claw okay sure the claw main activity choose your approach it will determine which rewards you receive at the end of the combat so i can attack here and it will give me a terror effect in two nights or get a skill or get some souls i like the skill because it's also kind of like an auto battler there's no auto battling however if you collect three skills you upgrade your skill collect three level twos of that skill and it becomes a level three skill so you can even evolve your skills it's sick so we got term one i can click on count dracula i love the graphics too we have these two privateers what are they going to do weaken and prepare they prepare to inflict a penalty and prepare a powerful attack i don't like that going to steal 8 hp and perform a powerful attack next turn well probably no sense in doing damage if they're just gonna steal it but so then we have to learn you know the vampire dracula can inflict damage can apply vampirism which could heal him or anyone that hits it we could steal hp the headless horseman is more of a tank kinda he can provoke which means all attacks would be focused to him and he gets a little more defense he can apply some bleeding he can steal a whole bunch however he has an interesting mechanic in which devouring charge for instance it takes five bitterness to launch so i can't even use it bitterness as you see right here he gets every time he suffers damage it'll increase my charge so then i can pop off bloody mary inflicts just solid damage but the thing about her is they're all bloodthirsty so bloody mary can usually only target the weakest enemy so they're both tied on health and stuff so that shouldn't matter here but i think i don't even need to provoke because i know they're going to hit me so i might just try and zerg this privateer down before they're able to do anything so let's inflict some damage and i didn't even tell you oh by the way yeah she has a cool ability where not only does she recharge her abilities she puts a cursed mirror it's like a debuff on somebody and every time she attacks that enemy that has the cursed mirror it it like reflects and does the the ability again there's a lot to it so we're just gonna walk through this slowly okay i don't wanna overwhelm you but we're gonna inflict three to eight i don't think there's any way we can kill here this will inflict seven to twelve and bleeding each time they inflict damage the holder suffers five day damage so they'll probably kill themselves but then we'll probably be done so three to eight that's just such a wide it only takes one action point though so let's see how this goes we did bare minimum it appears okay that sucks well you know what i'm gonna do they're just gonna heal themselves so i'm going to do this with the rest of our action points so i don't know if you'll heal yourself first then bleed or bleed then heal yourself i don't know but we're out of action points but if i wanted to i could go the devil mode and so i'll just show you this guys for the fun of it i could reduce health by two it'll hurt me one but now i don't have to think about it now here's the other thing this makes them vulnerable and i forgot about this because this is an important mechanic so they're not dead we just have to hit them one more time with an attack of the same type so we reduce their hp not their sp so i have to hit him again with an sp which i can no longer do i don't think devil mode can do anything about that yeah uh i can't do anything that's embarrassing okay so yeah we'll just on double mode and end our turn they applied fractured 11 damage wait why did you do more damage than you you lied to me holy four by three okay that's a lot um and we have like none of our abilities suck steal two by two by three so that should kill you here's what i'm gonna do here though um i am going to cast twist of fate here so now instead of four by three it's two by three that's much more manageable then we could inflate two by three by five only problem is i would need to high roll here to kill because if i hit five on the first one then the second hit would activate the vulnerable but if it doesn't rip and i don't think anyone has yeah whatever forget about yolo oh my god i wasn't even worried about it high roll high roll easy that's how it's done so you're going to attack her well what if i said no use provocation so now you must hit me and i take reduced damage you boner butt what say you to that and then i'll give you vampirism and sharpening and i'll cast it on can i not cast it targets one ally oh oh you need two action oh wait oh i'm all at action points okay that's embarrassing well then we end our turn well i didn't like that i didn't even like to see what the fracture debuff did neither oops okay you have five though so now i get a steal nine to 14 which is very nice so let's do that select you oh you steal both too you saucy mix he's practically full health easy now looks like we're going to have to reset her skills so i'm going to cast my cursed mirror i refresh my skills and then i could possibly inflict enough to kill her but i don't want to take six damage and gamble that so instead i'll reduce it but see then it goes through the mirror and does it again so now she's only hitting me for two i guess i probably could have killed whatever it's not important instead we'll do this which needs two never mind we won't do that in fact nobody can do anything because we don't have enough okay well then we just end our turn you're fine you're blowing mary all right so they're gonna prepare to do something well i'm not worried about it because this will hit twice make you vulnerable and then all i have to do is hit you one more time bye easy we lost four health across the two of them not that bad it's not bad and now i get to choose a brand new ability or perhaps one we already have so this one each time what is this oh apply three bleeding we don't have that uh dracula gets timeless vision plus three spiritual damage and plus one ap bonus um i don't think anyone's really doing spiritual damage i think spiritual damage is the sp i could give him one to inflict sp damage though but i don't know if i want to do that oh this is three bonus what the fudge oh but it targets all allies oh plus one action point bonus what does that mean does that mean everything costs one less or that turn they get one more ap i don't know apply bleeding isn't bound three bleeding at that or inflict yeah let's just go with bleeding throat in that slot confirm thank you very much you didn't get to see what happens when we find one we already had but um yeah let's go to this elite combat and get absolutely pooped on am i ready for an elite combat probably not what a charming oh there's an elite in the zone elites are formidable adversaries the power is much greater than those of regular enemies defeating them earns you a relic oh we automatically discover a trait is power look at that dracula gets plus eight max health and plus one physical damage that's kind of cracked what the hold up okay yeah it's automatically applied well jesus carry me more dracula i can't remember in the tutorial but i think sometimes you can find like side things in here but yeah if it's anything like the elite bosses and slay the spire we're in trouble holy okay yeah there's three of them the admirable or the admiral oh my god hundred health 100 sp what the fudge okay that's not great what are mediums preparing to steal sp and they have ages what reduces the loss of hp by six well i don't like that weekend in preparation watch so we need to focus somebody but i don't even think we'll kill him so maybe i should just provoke oh wait do they fully heal in between is it not like slay the spire in that sense wait a second it's my judgment or i don't know i don't know if you fully heal in between combats i guess i never paid attention game are we playing i'm going to apply bleeding to you so uh all those attacks you hit me with enjoy that screw you then we could inflate seven to 12 get rid of the aegis or i'm trying to think if we should prepare instead of wasting next turn they're not gonna have armor so maybe we should just wait one turn so i could apply vampirism and sharpening [Music] uh i'll give that to you because you're about to get hit right yeah i'll give you vampirism so next turn you'll pop off and then we are going to bleeding won't do much because you're not attacking i could bleed you but at that point it's a little redundant i think [Music] and i guess i could just reduce the attack or just go ahead and hit him with some fatty damage hmm yeah you're gonna be taking 11 damage do i care that much yellow let's just do some damage that's nice that's really nice stupid all right some good sp damage i won't lie to you oh wait you heal everyone oh did not see oh oh six by three good golly misses molly what is this transforms received healing into damage oh that's not good all right well screw me right did you fully heal and did my bleeding do like anything to you huh i could curse mirror and pop off that way but i think we'll go here and that should make you vulnerable vulnerable indeed which means we'll just do a simple kill here wow all right one down and then i gotta worry about you well you're doing 12 damage too maybe i provoke you're gonna be taking lots of damage but it should prepare his devouring charge for next turn yeah he'll be taking a little bit of everything but honestly not terry play not to replay at all we're at action points so jlhf two damage two damage easy two damage two damage two damage easy that is so good carry me now i get to steal whatever i want you're gonna you're gonna heal everybody oh i don't think so friend i don't think so i'll murder you but wait plus damage why did you okay i don't know what's going on completely ah fudge we gotta like reset most of our things this will make you vulnerable but then no one can clean up or wait wait maybe maybe we can oh this guarantees to kill you oh easy easy clap then we'll finish you i hurt myself because a zombie unlucky what do you do you can recharge skills in devil mode oh that's done right do it yourself it costs three to recharge an ability though that ain't cheap all right so he's just gonna heal himself stupid now what's he playing dude 16 damage to everybody um how does one um say no to that is that a thing i can do what the fudge is wait a second um i don't uh i feel like bloody mary is probably our best choice because then i also get a place to mirror on you who shall die uh i could apply six bleeding and inflict a lot of damage i guess i could reduce the incoming attack by four but i don't think much so instead take six bleeding stupid and then take my damage boost that's pretty good 22 damage we'll take that all right that hurt oh jesus what does he plan do okay so i guess he just attacks heals attacks blah blah blah inflict decent amount of damage chris smears still chilling on him so why not five five five five that's 20 damn bloody mary you're nuts you are cracked should i even bother with any of these guys skills i don't think so if we just need raw damage he's kind of vibing well yeah i think we just keep this up then i can do this again oh no i cannot does that take okay well then fine 11 bleeding that's excessive it just means you'll have it for 11 turns it doesn't stack the bleeding in one go um not okay only damage to him that's totally fine because i'll just choose a target recharge skills oh interesting i never that's strange recharge skills recharge all the disciples skills oh oh wait is that really oh so you would recharge everybody i'm mourning as i go all right i'm going to provoke he was already getting hit but now i'll take less damage uh inflicting more bleeding is just excessive at this point so i'll just do some double damage here 24 damage let's see how much he hits himself for with his bleed 12 damage oh because the double attack that's pretty good all right well then i think this should kill okay yeah you're vulnerable which means you're going to love it uh yeah we'll just hit you here okay i really hope we we heal in between battles let me tell you that much because if not we're in trouble but now we get to relic when an enemy dies their statuses are randomly transferred to another enemy hey wait that's pretty good unless they have positive statuses i would assume they only do i don't know at the beginning of each combat earn plus two ap only for the first turn still pretty good all combatants earned spiritual unfortunately no one's doing spiritual damage maybe maybe plague carrier i mean we could pop off the first turn but yeah let's go play carrie nice all right we freaking pooped on that elite dude that's embarrassing and you call yourself an elite combatant among the roots of these trees yeah what the main activity i think the person you're hearing is the devil me i'm not sure enigmatic headstones choose a disciple to pass a social test so i um i think if i this is telling me if i choose them this is what they would get plus 10 max spiritual points plus three ruse what is that plus eight max health plus eight max spiritual points that seems pretty good he's our tank anyway your disciples enter a village where a huge pie has been built and its center is a woman tied to a stake struggling to free herself no one is watching if she is a witch you should probably save her she'll be more used to you alive than dead witch hunts have increased in the new world during your long absence some people might even believe that since the coming of the light innocent people are safe from exit expeditious condemnations condemnations i don't know why i mess that up but happily for you this buyer is proof that just isn't true hello lady douglas horseman offers to check if she's really a witch or merely a falsely accused innocent soul see whether or not she's a witch it's easy and yet only 40 for the accused woman leave the accused woman to her fate not screw it i don't like this let's uh improve that to 70 5 health sucks but success i don't know what this does headless horseman feels a noxious aura typical black magic practitioners emanating from the cursed woman accused she's definitely a real witch house horseman offers to check if she's really a witch or me wait what oh so this helps inform me examine the accused woman didn't already do that yeah i did okay um so that's free because she is a witch when headless horseman finishes untying the witch she gives him a meaningful look and slips an old spellbook into his belongings then she puts a curse on the devil to almost burns her at the stake and disappears into the night quickly oh you shall not spread by itself choose a reward so we get a new trait and it looks like this is like a tier 2 or something with the purple border so it's already kind of decked out so vampiric domination targets all enemies to exhaustion which reduces by half all the hp and sp inflicted okay so they'll do half damage for two turns remove a protection and plus two damage to allies for each status removed it's kind of hot on guard target yourself apply to propagation and two shell which is what he already has but it's the better form that's nuts or burst of anger inflict 2 by 10 to 16 hp jesus that's a lot of damage these are all kind of uh sick either vampiric domination or on guard i think i'm gonna go with vampiric domination and it kind of seems wrong okay yeah so he got extra health good for you man now we run through the thicket what are we going into the sacrificial altar i don't know what that means you shall not leave until all the mortals in this region have bowed down before me yes sir although i guess that's me so yes me are your disciples approach a pile of rocks seem to come alive a set of glyphs written in blood from a symbol that your servants recognize easily that of a sacrificial altar your disciples can sacrifice a skill on this altar to strengthen their connection to your realm and gain an extra skill slot huh you will then discover a skill with the same rarity as the one sacrificed but choose well because you never you can never again find a duplicate of a skill that has been sacrificed oh sacrifice to dominate oh i could get rid of the bleeding i'm not getting rid of that that's freaking sick um that's good because it can be pretty effective if they're vulnerable i mean that's good support he doesn't even have enough skills to sacrifice i think i'm gonna get rid of the bleeding although it is nice maybe evidentially as one physical attack uh yo well whatever it kind of makes the plague doctor thing i got more useless but with that the humans will finally submit to my yo eeny meeny miny moe conclusion use of this skill ends the turn so i'd have to do that as the final so she gets to steal a little bit of everything uh we can get another stabbing which we already have so we'd be one away from upgrading or twist of fate which would be one away from upgrade but i'm just gonna go with damage because i'm a monkey so if we get another one it'll evolve which would be nice uh which way do i want to go uh it's a random event or a sticks fountain to regenerate your diabolic essence or purge your disciples negative traits uh i don't think they have any negative traits oh i see so my hero health they all regenerate but if during a battle if a hero falls and it it's excess damage to them it goes straight to your diabolic essence that makes sense okay oh my god what the fudge of course it's an elite combat okay we're gonna do this thing optional thing first screw that extra activity uh choose a disciple we can give you extra temptation spiritual damage and spiritual points ruse occultism and max health or 18 max health that's a lot of extra a lot of extra hp i feel like giving them some of the social things is good but i'm just thinking about pure combat which might not be the best play holy cow this thing is massive geez for one book chapter okay geez um temptation spirits are never expensive so maybe we should invest a little bit into this yeah but the plus spiritual damage is useless could give you more i don't know punching bags are so good whatever we'll just give her home your disciples point out at charlton's stand they think they sense the real relic mixed in among the useless bobbles a horde of mortals is attracted to the stall like bees to honey you can't be sure if it's the traces of magic in the air that fascinate them or if they're really stupid enough to believe the lies this charlton is feeding them bloody mary eyes of charlotte's trinkets with interest identify the nature of his wares let's identify success pog bloody mary immediately identifies the relic but refuse to touch it it's a sacred object filled with the powers of light magic makes me want to dance what destroy his sacred relic curse his wares let's destroy his sacred rock they may destroy sacred relic a racist benevolent powers its positive influence on the world disappears and all the mortals in the area sink into a morose temper oh jesus long effects will affect the zone situated in five nights that's all ways away though i guess we'll take it though i should probably plot a course then um but i have to worry about that after i fight this elite and it's only gonna be harder than the last one i'm terribly sorry oh boy tortured soul hero fan i can't even really say that so you know what's bad sinistra of course she starts with it aegis each time the heal holder is healed reduce the disciples max hp by two well that's kind of nice what do you do each time the martyr suffers damage he earns plus one damage what and he's got 90 hp oh my he's gonna hurt just jehuba aoe damage what the is going on here other aoe damage wait a sec i hate this all right i guess we just kill a hero fan then right what are you doing and everyone else just take some damage go shut your mouth who should i kill it's a good question buddy you're gonna be taking a fat dick and that's what you're gonna do she's almost completely dead through sp if i don't kill this guy so let's kill this guy 7-12 7-12 this should set it up for a kill from dracula yep do another one then dracula can finish you up all right that reduces a lot of the damage um that's all i got for this turn but that's fine okay now okay aegis is gone wait no did you have two things to be just what the who thought that was fair this tortured soul can suck my wiener he's he's never gonna chill okay if that's the case i'm gonna reduce your hey who are you hitting you hitting everybody oh you're only hitting one so now i actually do provocation yes and he'll be taking zero damage attaboy um so we could bleed you that's it or we could apply exhaustion remove protection plus two damage to all allies for each test removes ways i think we're gonna do that yes plus two damage they're exhausted look at that they're doing nothing oh this is great that is a pog move my friends no damage is laughable wait oh he literally did zero damage so didn't even trigger my bitterness whoa okay all right sinistra you need to die now my friend debating could reset your skills on this you're already a lot of damage is what you're doing a whole week huh yeah let's just do that frickin some good damage what is this preparing to apply a bonus oh that's not great does anyone else have one mana attack no that kind of sucks wait devil mode can i can i give myself i guess i can't give myself another the devil is in the details can i you would think i'd be able to give myself more well maybe not i guess that could be a little p but isn't that the point oh i could i could give myself this that's only three damage there you go all right that'll make you vulnerable next term we'll finish off actually wait if you hit me with your punishment you should kill yourself right oh it only reduces max hp oh wait maybe not but you're still vulnerable get destroyed what did he apply to himself shell it's only one turn though i'm not really looking to attack him um we could refresh everybody i don't think we need to let's just do that and then you get to cast this for free we'll just steal some of that don't mind me and then uh you won't have enough i don't know if i'm not worried about it though oh we took away his bonus right so he doesn't get too no he still keeps torture okay that's unfortunate uh maybe i'll just recharge everybody's skills for next turn there you go my friends um all right still hurt a little bit but we're fine what's he doing next turn preparing to buff all right so we just gotta go all out on damage this turn what game are we playing um is it worth doing mary's cursed mirror i want to say so but maybe i'll just save it for next turn so just do as much damage as we can it's only one bleeding uh do as much damage as we can over here do as much damage as we can he's gonna be doing so much damage though sweet moses we're not killing them nearly fast enough eight by two not great we could remove protection apply exhaustion i mean that's not a terrible idea sure is the plus two damage permanent i think it is that's kind of crazy um i could even do a shell on him but i think i'll apply my mirror for next turn that's fine damage ain't got me scurred who are you attacking you're tagging him again oh yeah sure be my guest there's 22 damage don't mind if i do there's 24 damage don't mind if i do we're almost done oh wait oh i don't even have to high roll oh wait no i do i need two action points for that fudge uh well rip there i guess we chill i need some more one mana freaking one action point things i mean i guess i'll reduce this even though it doesn't matter perfect all right now he's dead because we'll make him vulnerable and then repeat the damage he's down easy yeah these relics are and we get another relative the comet begins mary places the mirror on a random enemy that is sick each time an enemy dies the headline horseman receives four bitterness also pretty sick because that means he's fully stacked every time or each time air plays four skills in a single turn she recharges all her allies skills okay the only question i have is if i play one and then the mirror repeats it does that count as two skills otherwise there's no way i'll ever that's a good question that's a good question skirt i guess we'll find out hopefully that's the way it works okay let me figure out where we want to go we got all the ways to figure it out but um discover trait 60 souls double the number of souls to be won sell your souls to the grim oh no each relic has a discount oh or oh each rock has a discount i might want a discount all right we continue forth yes you see a number of pyres along the road it looks as if those who practice witchcraft were persecuted realized okay well my third grade reading skills aren't fast enough humane is rising what upon arrival in the zone one of your disciples receives a random negative trait ooh i don't like that okay well i'm not going that way yeah screw that uh pass i don't want to go that way anyway this place is teeming with life welcome green wall what is this city it's mine i'll tell you that i guess this is important i'll do the narrating sir even though i skipped the first one the claw of carrion chapter two my disciples enter the valley parade they approach the main square from where they can hear loud voices residents are shot in a name hope etched on their faces caleb caleb my disciples i literally muted you the sanctual woman is there and among them a man holding the claw of gary and in his bare hand he raises the claw and the townsfolk goes silent with a sweeping movement he brings the artifact down upon his arm no blood flows from the deep ash respectful memories heard the wound closes he speaks serve the saint to illumine and you will be rewarded i immediately understand the true nature of this caleb he is an imitation human i reveal to my disciples the existence of a puppeteer specialized in automaton who once made a pact with me they will find him in the town of capelleon of course to capelion rage on effects will affect the zones figure out what that means later oh i don't have to fight anybody that's kind of nice okay oh i don't i'm not going this way what is this upon arrival discovered trait that's unfortunate that would have been nice but i'm not going back 25 percent or extra chance of passing the tests perfect and these are all the same so it doesn't really matter am i brilliant i hate fields i don't really know if i have another to see them skill to this sacrifice will make sacrifices powerful but who will i choose yeah we don't really have the the opportunity i i mean to be fair i haven't really used this one not that it's bad though in fact of all them this is probably the worst because i'm thinking like this might not look good but if we give ourselves sharpening or we use exhaustion and get attack then a multi-hit benefits a lot more from increased damage so whatever i'll get rid of this i'll probably regret it but hey when in rome could get another on guard and he'd be close to getting a level up he could get secret boot localization this skill reduces the impending attack by two per charge of bitterness oh uh inflict damage depending on where the adversary is weakest oh okay and burst of anger inflict multiple damage it's three action points though you crazy i think i might just get another on guard that's great he literally does no damage unless he has five charges but you know what that's just what you got to do buddy all right suck it up buttercup welcome to the range could give you an extra physical damn three physical damage well well well but see again this is all it doesn't help me yeah whatever plus you're physically freaking yeah dude oh i forgot to read what this was okay rip the prophet you could use your powers to bring about some of these catastrophes that would seem very apocalyptic or you could give bloody mary the agreeable task of wrecking her own style of habit make the prophet's predictions come true stir up the morbid curiosity of the crowd make the prophet the first victim of his predictions ah let's make his predictions come true success bloody mary discreetly taints the prophet's voice with black magic so his words directly influence reality from now on each reign of fire each plague of crickets and each famine he announces will begin to happen all around him he will cause destruction in mayhem wherever he goes the humans will no longer doubt that the end of the world is approaching 62 souls sure magic makes me want to dance spells are extremely volatile weapons but you did yourself proud i don't know what's happening um wait what she receives temptation ruse and spirits but i thought i gave her something else oh oh they all just get this oh what the heck oh wow wow okay gamba or bonus uh so we want to go one of these stixx fountain um or an event let's go event i don't i'm not worried about my my diabolic essence currently i feel like i got enough i feel like we kind of chill in there this tree is already dead let's see what i can glean from it let's choose a disciple to pass the social tests you could get plus one stealth oh that's a social thing scare and physical damage plus one's plus exponential extra temptation well this guy gets literally plus two in every social event i mean that's pretty good plus do physical damage though ain't bad i'm just going to give hell's horsemen all the social things why not your disciples stealthily enter the walls of sick trees seeking souls right for the harvest but the streets are deserted they finally find the villagers agonizing on makeshift beds in the main square they've all been infected by the white plague and they're slowly wasting away a doctor moves from bed to bed lost and thought what should he do with his patients you might whisper some ideas of your own in his ear should i purge sick treat with fire and stop the spread of disease no i can't that would condemn too many innocent people to death the doctors lost in conversation with themselves the doctor doesn't even notice when your disciples arrive he's utterly defenseless headless horseman could easily take him out i kind of want to push the doctor to burn the village the chances it succeeds is slow so i'm going to push that in my favor i don't even want to gamble uh he uses his most bewitching voice to explain to the doctor that fires the only way to stop the white plague before it contaminates the entire world the mortal is spellbound by all your disciples words and prepares to torch sixty immediately move on to apply the same treatment and any other villages where he finds the illness extra soul sure more more i want to see more oh cool she gets extra stalled in hell i guess depending on what you choose if if some of the characters you're with like it they get some extra stuff too it's fun all right now let me go spin some of these souls when they see your disciples the peasants run off to sound the alarm in the nearby villages they'll be waiting for you and that is not your advantage upon arrival one of your disciples reason negative ah fudge you won't be able to avoid that too that's nice oh wait a second sacrificial altar what is this uh isn't that exactly what is this yeah okay i don't need to do that right now let's uh spend some chaos first in a secret meeting place hidden from the mortals your disciples meet with the grim reaper it's time to do some business what do you want to exchange for these souls look at the relic discounts the holder earns plus two damage for each of their depleted skills that doesn't really help because you don't have much but whatever i bought the disciples earn plus five for healing they provide no one really heals whenever you're about to suffer damage expected to deal the final blow to the devil he becomes invulnerable until they start the next turn that's one free gimme what is this 20 is this a random skill or delete a skill i don't i'm not sure plus five for healing they provide like nobody heals really what is this um bleeding heart we could get close to increasing that timeless vision unfortunately we're not anywhere near that plus three hp plus three sp suffers three to six hp does that max hp carry over all the time because that would that seems a little lp i don't know oh but we get a um level up stabbing we're definitely doing that so it went from 7 to 12 hp to 14 to 21 uh yeah i am pleased with these offerings oh and now she take them oh she gets to discover something else i could get another stabbing wicked cast oh this is one action point that's big 8 to 14 hp or deadly gash inflict 11 to 16 and apply 3 bleeding i feel like this is good just because we never have follow up yeah let's go with that me alike your disciples growing powers unfortunately if i buy one of the skills i won't be able to buy the scapegoat but to be fair i think if i'm at a point where you have to use this i'm probably dead anyway so i'll just i'll play to win not to not lose does that make sense um getting one of these seems nice i'll discipline i can't tell if that carries over because i mean if so that would be nuts i could just infinitely stack so that's probably not how it works it's probably just in between matches i think um so let's just get another bleeding heart that we might evolve that sometimes all right that's all i can afford fairly well i could sacrifice something is there anything i don't think i want to sacrifice anything nope i think not now unfortunately somebody is going to receive a negative your disciples observed numerous footprints in the mud as they approaching since the voice of good have been preparing for their arrival i have so many negative effects effects present oh all right well let's see what we get here the current zone is under the falling effect blah blah blah i don't want it bloody mary you're not an idiot she gets minus two roos uh honestly that doesn't seem that bad it doesn't affect my combat skills speaking of combat skills it's elite combat time and i'm a little frightened i'm terribly sorry but it seems do your worst what is bounty hunter with 108 health yeah why not diva preparing to use an unknown effect privateer um well bloody mary can only even attack diva if she wanted to and ironically our glass cannon is not a glass king anymore she has the most help um 17-24 what did i choose oh yeah i went with bloody metronome i don't even think she's able to use four skills you know it's unfortunate well we could just inflict a lot of damage in fact i say yeah if i just do this give her the mirror uh do this let's see if it stacks no it's only two okay so there's no way i can do that what is this you're going to love it wait what huh hunt each time a disciple uses a skill is locked for two turns each time i decide who recharges plus one damage enemies oh okay that's not great well then i'm gonna save that we'll just do simple damage just to finish you off huh yeah that's not great nothing else i can do ow ow now okay yeah i can't take much sp i only have hp he's gonna do 11 to everybody which actually would kill bloody mary oh well that's not good that's not good at all is there any way to stop this reduce the impending attack by two i don't know what else to do yeah okay so at least we're not omega done i could apply provocation but it doesn't matter because he's doing an aoe right i guess i could just do it to reduce damage but um i don't want to do this because there's no protections to take away yet um what do we want to sharpen i guess i could just sharpen myself yum and see now i can steal some hp give me that yes [Music] uh what did you do to us what is increases the hp suffered by three okay preparing to buff himself i think to apply a bonus that's fine i'll just strip it next holy jesus we're gonna take 27. oh i see well that's not good can we kill you in time i wonder we could do a lot of damage approximately actually yes i can guarantee a kill on you so if i just do this oh wait i have to high roll oh no i don't i think i hired anyway i had to land right in the middle and we did all right well good news we get a vibe out now i could go ahead and recharge everybody's skills slight problem is now he gets plus one damage but it's honestly not that bad so bring it on bounty hunter what bonus did he give himself wait what huh i thought did he give himself like plus damage or something well that's unfortunate because there's nothing to strip now man well let's provocate ourselves yes [Music] and then yeah i'll wait on the other one now the question is i think i'll give you extra damage for next turn and then in this one i'll just do a little bit of tickle damage and next turn i'll use all my action points to do as much damage as possible your damage is laughable okay he's gonna buff himself perfect so all i need to do is apply mirror this is at minim i'm gonna do 42 damage holy [Music] or how about 50. this can do a lot too 36 holy breath bloody mary's insane death oh now you want me to take that away from you well all you have to do is ask uh although this can get very close to killing you do i have a way to finish it off i think i might hold on oh wait oh it just uh i didn't realize that that's pretty good okay well then screw it it's a little late and bloody mary's gonna become vulnerable but we should kill him next turn so that doesn't become an issue because if i'm vulnerable and they hit me with that that's when it hits all of my health and well frankly i'd rather avoid that and i'll get to do just that okay i just need to roll a six here don't suck okay you suck but whatever we want anyway any acquisition is sold by 20 each time you earn a terror effect you also receive 20 souls each time you sacrifice a skill you weren't 80 souls maybe just terror effects sure well that was easy peasy book chapter your you order your disciples to come here as quickly as possible in order to continue this book and i figured out looking at the legend it does show an icon for final combat so there we will know when we're nearing the end because it'll show final comments so first we got to go through the story stuff uh the chapters so to speak and and then wherever that goes we'll find out but first hunchesta yes it's great to be here i'll narrate don't worry my disciples enter copely out out okay maybe you should have narrated and find the puppeteer's shop he knows how to make a mortal out of an imitation human give him a soul shut your mouth sorry to do this he gives us a wooden puppet with a hollowed cavity if my disciples remove a fragment from caleb and place it in the cavity with a fragment removed from another human being they will then be able to send the person's soul into caleb's body making him mortal as for the perfect soul the puppeteer suggests that we visit a sanctuary the centuralumen close to junction intrigued my disciples and i follow his advice decide whatever and what i'm doing with my life now let's go make a mortal or whatever the terror effect and that gives me 20 souls because of the relic i have finally aha yum yum your hold over the world of mortals is growing you moved up the notch in terror chances to obtain wicked level skills one chance out of four and discover one relic such a powerful relic was hidden in this rat hole don't mind if i do when a disciple inflicts physical damage they earn plus four spiritual damage for the turn bleeding and decomposition inflict two times more damage uh it's not gonna help too much because we don't have a lot of flip-flop each time you kill an enemy you earn six souls at the end of the combat or when an enemy plays preparation plus one ap um [Music] seems pretty good a lot of people like to prepare so that or just more souls [Music] greedy it's my judgment not greedy greedy not greedy why not okay so where am i headed if i go here we get a negative effect however i want it hello but we discover a trait if i come over here double the number of souls we want fudge because i want to trait but i don't really want rip i don't want to risk a negative so we'll just go this way to combat dilly dilly oh wait a second wait i could have would have just purged the negative can i go back okay that was stupid of me whatever let's fight um attack discreetly i'm gonna do this because we double the numbers of souls to be one so i would like traits but oh look at us we're in a little uh place i love the graphics okay only one cine straw how hard could this be probably pretty hard i don't like your aegis i don't like that you're attacking me and i don't like that you're weakening so instead i'm going to take away your protections i'm going to apply exhaustion and we all receive extra damage that's so good so good uh let's just do some damage let's prepare the cursed mirror for next turn we're out of ap it's totally fine then we're just going to nuke ya i'ma i'ma throw everything in the kitchen sink at you you're gonna do six damage to all of us you're gonna need to do more than that let me tell you because bop bop and then bop oh you gotta be kidding me oh wait we kill you yeah bloody mary is nuts new wait wait what oh my this is new oh fudge i didn't bother to look that there are waves oh shoot huh that's that's pretty good oh okay rip all right you are going to provoke you'll take that all real well i know you will we come over here uh we don't do much we come over here we still don't do much so i'll just uh how about i we'll take you out first i get all my things back so i'll just do some simple damage nothing crazy in their turn you are doing something oh you're provoking oh shoot now i can only attack oh fudge well that sucks big pee pee doesn't it well played well played sir okay who are you attacking me again i suppose i'll provoke again not entirely necessary but whatever then um yeah i'll just i don't know deal damage to you i guess i don't have a choice oh are you kidding me i didn't even realize that still goes through the mirror wait a second that is incredible my goodness all right whack them we'll reset skills next turn i guess shell i don't like that i might just take all their negative things or positive things for myself but that would take all of our action points because this guy's really pooping on our party and i don't like it so recharge everybody's skills take away all your bonuses and then we all get plus two damage not too shabby i can't do anything else perfect it's not that bad bloodlust luck oh just lock in some of my abilities well jokes on you because that's totally fine okay so if i split the damage here this is a big brain uh the odds of me rolling high enough oh wait i can only oh but now i can only hit the lowest health one that makes sense um so let's just do this you're vulnerable so do an easy peasy attack there come back who are you attacking okay don't even care all um i'll just apply my mirror to you do some decent damage bob um sorry about the extra damage there dracula shake it off buddy don't be so dramatic this double wave thing really threw me for a loop well played but it wouldn't be enough to save this poor martyr another night we still got out unscathed easy 18 free souls dope mind if i do the current zone uh all right that's what we got that's a lot of souls baby yo where do i get to spin this cash up here's the answer but do we want to do a story or another battle story gives us cool things but also i kind of just wanted to battle to get more traits we haven't really been able to do that i want better traits dang it all right stupid isolated farm i get two skills what yes please okay two waves remember that so don't go all out or maybe go all out who's to say we are going to take away your aegis yes we're gonna weaken you yes and then i'm going to weaken this and now i'll set up my mirror seems to be a pretty good pretty good play we'll take a little bit of damage but it's not that big of a deal who you hitting him that's perfect we don't have that much extra damage yet unlucky but i think we're doing just fine uh this will kill so now all everything's on reset but honestly not that bad oh shoot but there's three of them overseer automatically comes with provocation as well and they're all looking to do to crack ton of damage jesus maybe i'll provoke this will you kill you will you die how much damage are you taking 24 that's actually pretty good to take all that you build different friend um okay let me do it again um now we don't need to so i'll set up a mirror on the priestess oh i can't i can only gosh doing this well maybe i'll hold out maybe i don't need to i don't know what do i want to do uh maybe apply vampirism and sharpening let's hit you up girl and then you'll just have to do extra stuff tomorrow i guess tomorrow next turn do some slight damage nothing crazy that's all we could do yes now stack that up he's going to steal all of your girls regeneration wait what the fudge at the beginning and end of the turn heals themselves for three to five are that much like that and they're all gonna apply bonuses i don't what stop it you're not allowed i forbid you i'm gonna go for the priestess you've got some extra damage let's see this will make you vulnerable because you do insane and then yeah i'll just finish them off with this doesn't matter too much i yeah i don't know i pretty much exclusively use bloody mary i don't know dracula has his own play style headless horseman i just make him taunt every now and then he has to and then i literally just use bloody mary to do everything for me i don't know if that's how you feel you're supposed to juggle a little bit more but yeah all my eggs are in the bloody mary basket they both provoke okay bloody mary can only hit overseer anyway it couldn't mirror but headless horseman's about to get absolutely so we're gonna steal some hp don't mind if i do and then you're gonna provoke take half damage easy clappers and then maybe recharge everybody's skills now maybe i should have done the mirror yeah whatever oh wait what did he apply though what is that what is that what'd you do to me depression yo same uh freaking at the beginning the end of the turn suffer sp oh that's fine you're not really doing sp damage um i think i don't have to use my mirror i think i can just kill oh but you're provoking of course you are why wouldn't you be all right well then i guess oh wait wait wait wait no i know what i'll do we're gonna remove your bonuses and exhaust you wait what why didn't it remove huh wait what why didn't they i feel debated okay well screw me all right here's big brain though i'm gonna mirror the martyr this term while i can because normally i can only target the weakest enemy next turn no provocation so i'll have to oversee her but then it'll all double back to the martyr yeah big brain i know oh the shell see wait let me look what does it count as the shell oh protection oh that's why okay because it kind of does secure and the other one was a i don't remember but i see what's going on now i like that damage you pleb i'm trying to think does it matter no i'll have to do all of it anyway all right you vulnerable which means bop bop goes over to you enjoy now he's just gonna buff himself i don't know how but i'm not too worried about it it does have a lot of the shell but i can reduce your attack by four and only by two why do you resist it uh i don't know i guess i just don't care that much uh i get a steal from you and then i'll just go ahead and provoke you hit me with her best shot we can't really do anything except hit you with a small attack so take this you fiend i feel like i should be using my devil powers more but i don't have to so why bother let's refresh everybody's skills so that we can absolutely poop on you and i think yeah that'll do it another clean round and we get two skills count them one as you can 24 souls oh we're gonna be rich dude okay oh shoot this is what it was talking about so we we got an upgraded one we had a 25 chance and we found it so i think it'd be dumb to not take it throw that in there i am pleased oh shoot he's getting everything it's just so bizarre i mean he suffers like i get why he doesn't but he we just don't have a lot of healing for him to really take advantage of it but this inflicts 12 to 16 remove and enhancement add one charge or turn to the horsemen statuses that's freaking sick yeah we're going with that all right well now the headless horseman's just double cheeked up i guess let's go let's go sun and then i'm ready to spin these souls man i'm rich fight me you nerd well okay there's only one wave 168 health 238 sp and then reverse on the other one sweet moses each time a combatant suffers hp they receive polarized hp what does that mean i don't know okay whatever ooh you're doing a lot of damage what's this all about who should i kill yeah you're just crazy now enhancement no that's a passive um your shell isn't gonna do much here we could apply exhaustion that could be nice but i think oh oh i don't think i can target her reduce that by as much as possible thank you very much and there's no other way to weaken it unfortunately so i'll just do as much damage as i can and i can't target you okay it looks like we're sharing the sharing the damage then that's not bad polarized hp doubles the amount of spiritual damage suffered um [Music] wait wait is it aren't you supposed to have polarized sp why do you polarized hp i don't know okay i need to hit somebody with sp damage though because then i could make it so they take more you see this is a fight where i think they really want you to have double the damage but um or like a mix but we definitely don't oh and this applies to everyone oh what the oh no this weakness 4 to 10 hp okay what just happened and why am i getting on help i need somebody help not just anybody yeah we're gonna go ahead and uh provoke but then you take double damage too holy suck and there's no there's no protections to take so i only apply exhaustion which isn't bad though it might just be worth it [Music] no i'll just bring him chip away um you know i might use a devil power decomposition let's change it you take that that takes five hp yolo screw you and then whack you [Music] oh boy what other devil stuff can we do i could heal and stuff i could just how much would that cost me 31 health i would kill myself great all right well what's in this this just went so what do we oh my god now you're hitting him they just keep swapping the thing because they they oh jesus inflicted stop it what i'm not okay with this i'm listening what is this each time another combatant inflicts damage on the holder they lose oh heck no i can remove that though oh and check this out okay so i'm gonna remove that get pooped on then that charges this if i can steal extra stuff from you to heal me and it did double sp so now you take 17 damage and we're fine with that then i could i don't have to do anything else we could refresh bloody mary's abilities i think that's a fine idea you're fine headless horseman right stop with the decomposition holy jesus oh my god aoe 48 what the this yeah this went it's how so fast jesus is there any way i'd stop this no um i think he's just gonna be vulnerable forever i don't know how he fixed that we don't have increased damage so that's not doing nearly as much as i would hope in fact bloody mary just does way better than that so let me just reduce this but then it's still 10 is it worth it i don't know let's just do some fat damage to you first see this is when having sp would be huge but we're all specked into one thing which is completely my fault i know that we can't i should just put the mirror on one so we're going down i don't think splitting is worth it but is it too late kind of feels like it whatever the split and the next turn we're just going to go all in on you oh my god the decomposition holy sucks oh my gosh okay well now they're doing physical damage everyone's going to become vulnerable sweet jesus please kill this thing and then i'll panic after this turn to figure out what the fudge i'm supposed to be okay i think we kill this okay sweet suck oh what it immediately overflowed i i thought they would have to hit me once after being vulnerable oh suck a panic what uh give you extra damage and then i just pray oh my god you have thorns of course you do wait a second this is going so poorly so fast what are you doing next turn spell damage physical damage no no no no no i can't use my devil powers because he'll kill himself right oh jesus let's get down to business yeah that holy suck wait a second and the problem is he can provoke but then he okay he can steal though oh this is big okay so if i hit you with a normal attack right now that'll mean we can get more sp back from you she's vulnerable now of course she is jesus uh i have to steal don't have a choice and then oh god and then i have to unguard you're still taking six damage no that's enough to kill me it's high time i interfered all right i have to add just this now i think it should only do one damage no it didn't overflow wait when is it over what are the requirements oh my god you gotta be kidding me if this doesn't remove the thorns first this might kill me you better remove it first what's keeping you from ridding us of this vermin disciples that defeat was calculated it doesn't this plan is working perfectly you've got to be kidding me since that ended sooner than i thought and we didn't go as far as we thought i think i'm just going to splice the two because i technically record these at separate times and i was going to make this a separate video but i think i'll just throw this on top of the first one because of what happened uh rip well if you want to see me try it again let me know see how that goes hopefully things go a little bit better um yeah it just went 0-100 i guess i need to figure out the the exact way overflowing health like that does because like if i had known that i could have avoided that turn and i think we live we still would have taken some damage but it yeah i just it took like i took like 35 damage in one turn like what the fudge so yeah my bad i did something wrong there so anyway regardless i really like this game i think there's something there and there's even more like you're gonna be able to mix and match your teams because like i'll i'll vaguely show you if they will let me hold them yeah so please this disciple is lost i don't know if these are even made yet inspirational you know because it's early access well it's a demo but so you'll be able to make a huge variety you can figure out who you like the most find synergies and whatnot so that's pretty cool and then there's also difficulties reminds me of like monster train and stuff um where you beat it and then you can replay it again but it's just gonna be harder every time uh which sounds fun so with that said i want to thank all much for watching have yourself a destiny i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
