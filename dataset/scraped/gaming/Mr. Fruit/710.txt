[Music] let's use an ability how about braver do it on this guy George oh wait well I missed ok it very quickly has a range which makes sense but skirts the crazy thing too is might be the same same characters and the same story but because of the way the game has been chained and it's like a whole new game they just don't stop coming do they yep as usual go ahead try and shoot me there are quite a few of them well yeah yeah try and hit me yeah come on no really try your bullets are ineffective oh it was close though he thought about 900 my god oh yeah that'll finish the job in new abilities

know it's not turn-based like the old games but listen there's a reason you don't find many turn-based games anymore it's a dying John or not it's not it's not widely appealable how about that one of us now what was his name again cloud cloud strife right and he isn't a soldier anymore still he's a professional unlike the rest of us man has a chiseled jawline oh now let's talk about the real Alpha
