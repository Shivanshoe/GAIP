hi do you hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell i'm so excited to continue this journey with you all i'm hoping to beat it soon that would be nice i don't want to upload it to the second channel because starting i don't know when this is going up monday 27th 28th i don't know june uploading a brand new randomized soul link nuzlocke with blue and pokemon pro and diamond on the second channel so can't juggle two things on there at once uh so long story short i don't know i'm just getting to the gameplay mr fruit what the fudge are we doing here like come on what's what let's go okay so i said i might you know give it my boy scouts best a couple times off camera and that's exactly what i did i think i did two runs actually yeah i did two runs the first run i wanted to see how far i could get uh trying some different strategies actually perfect nights the first six nights boom no panic nothing freaking bragging bro made it to night nine swiftly got absolutely pooped on because night eight i survived but um literally the entire city was destroyed i don't think any building was standing and my magic circle had like two health but i survived until night nine and then the last one i literally just ran through and just tried to do some challenges for some prowesses like i've made a whole bunch of buildings um had them just produce things um you'd some tainted essence just kind of a farming run that's really all it was um but i think i've learned a couple things um notably when i made it to night nine um just give everyone a freaking bow uh that's really all there is to it but like what the fudge those are busted um and use the second loadout slot to get those additional bonuses um i've learned a lot that's all i know because the uploads were like a little behind when i was grinding and i was like bruh cringe like i swear i'm i'm a little bit better than that now no a little bit so we're hopping on into this there's not too many upgrades i've gotten that i think you guys have missed out on uh night one this is pretty straightforward let's go ahead and see what our uh guys and gals got here though the biggest thing uh thank you comment section was realizing i can just press e and q or even there's these little arrow buttons to swap in between cuz i'd always be like okay well then let's go to the next person yeah dummy you just click this it's super easy anyway let's start with monica is a surgeon 15 crit what the that's kind of crazy oh i i did unlock every starting hero comes with a trinket now so that's fun uh plus 20 healing received five percent dodge but a little less health that is totally fine with me looks pretty good to me chief sniper okay well obviously that makes sense you have a bow good uh range damage skill range oh sh 15 critical power bruh cal kind of cracked plus six percent range damage oh my god this boy just started out with 13 range damage minus three daily man in region balls but i'm fine with that what is this less damage oh my god an extra ap and additional experience gained holy brat brother that's uh that's pretty good okay wow these are some cracked characters oh my god this guy doesn't have a negative trait miguel go on extra magic damage mana and daily mana regen i must be wearing something yeah that reduces mana regen yeah okay that makes sense uh six percent physical damage 20 healing received okay that's strange um we got the scepter though scepters on you know i'm just gonna be honest with you they suck i said it you get an extra move but you lose daily mana regen um i might even just take that off you for now let's see what what did you get you get uh did everyone get the same no so extra ap and experience game putting that on our archer seems like a pretty good idea we also get oh a two-handed sword i have yet to use one of these so we slash we thrust we charge and we sword blast easy peasy yeah everyone yeah i mean the movement's nice and the accuracy is nice but i don't really want to um impede i mean your mana region isn't that bad right now anyway screw it okay looks great to me uh the only downside again is the fact that we got a couple of these fellers uh rock and longboat can like sit back here rock in melee wombo combo i don't think the enemy can come up this far uh but there's only one way to tell let the nights begin oh not even remotely close what was i scared about eh let me see what we got okay so this just deals damage it hits two people oh that's fun it's a slash what's the difference between thrust this uses momentum and oh it's only one action point that's important charge oh really oh my god wait what oh shoot so i can like omega like freaking oh yeah look at that oh that's fun okay look at the movement and sword blast uh just a lot of damage and it hits a lot of people sick all right but what if i came over here and uh did a little bit of this oh well i liked that yes i yeah then we have magic scepter which is free but whatever it is what it is meanwhile we have the longbow which will be really good for cc later on um you can also give friends extra dodge what don't we like about that um apparently i can only kill one dude rude it's also oh no it's not because of my uh which i'm gonna call it trinket thing attention damage is not the difference between oh come on give me that oh there we go and people always like high roll low roll i talk i know it's the reliability um i also haven't turned my light on hopefully it's not that egregious i guess i could it's a little late now though isn't it or is it unless you clicked off the video because oh my god your your webcam lighting is butts see all does make me look whiter we already know i'm plenty white okay so if i come over here and i do some of this that animation is sick oh my god my momentum damage right now is kind of cracked so y'all ah you know what balls do i really want to balls this early kind of i'm thinking about it no that's a terrible idea there's really no point ah forget scoops freakish okay leave me alone all right i'm gonna give you dodge capabilities your dodge is incredible now they'll have a hard time hurting you yeah yes um i doubt he can even get close enough if he wanted to one last shot i doubt this will even break his armor it didn't sick okay i'm not gonna waste man on one dude it's not worth it man i also don't think there's any more prowess for movement i could be wrong but that's what i bought dodged and one hp in a dream on our barricade here what an absolute hero um i could propagate this and stun but i feel like i really don't need to well we'll hold off on that let's see what we let's see what nonsense we can get up to here i guess um i would have to high roll but i think it's possible okay i mean one health that's fine with me here we go so no oh we got them all of course we did freaking pose and then come over here thanks to momentum jordan dunpo how far can you move uh far enough to hit me you could you move far enough table okay so we'll just chill over here what do we want to do about this about we just whack whack um no one i guess we just is that even worth it yeah why not just tickle your pickle wait wait don't make it weird i didn't mean it like that you guys the one that made it weird but i'll just go ahead and finish these off before their armor comes back or okay okay he'll just dodge yeah sure why not um i guess i can just go ahead and use and i still don't even care about using my mana uh i could snipe shot though that sounds very fun yes okay sure why not we got a kill nice oh and we can actually kill that dude perfect boy just crack don't we i'll give you dodge i don't think anyone's gonna hit you but you can never be too careful the swarm's approaching never approaching fast 37 left uh i could use my sword blast but i think i'll wait on that instead i don't see a problem in this big old aoe stun right here if i stun okay we stunned all but one yeah i'll take that you my little friend what do i want to do about you what is this little rascal doing over here um i have not yet gone far enough to fully farm this if i come back yeah it's still not oh that's it you just hate to see it wow um not guaranteed to kill you guys um then again not many things in life are guaranteed are they well so deep mr fruit oh you're like a poet okay i think i'm gonna propagate a stone over here why not again oh my mr fruit how do you do you like me and i like you do that and do that oh that's just great you my little friend take out everyone not stunned but uh but and why not all right you know what i might just punch this dude screw him up yeah give me a whack what was that 90 chance that's actually a higher chance than i thought what the all right well brain check on that one out of range sick out of range sick oh there we go okay well hopefully you don't need dodge because i can no longer give it to you blame uh watch his face what's your name i'm calling you out the guy that can't punch your dude square right in front cal yeah with the fudge cal you make me sick um just go for another big ol aoe stun just keep delaying the inevitable all right great um oh you know what i'm feeling a little saucy monica you you sassy minks okay good news and scooters and okay great just going swimmingly i think die die die die dodge unlockers okay you're gonna take a hit from them um but i can give you dodge fear not my friend i will not let you succumb to their even treachery i need a perfect night no damage taken easy dodged what'd i tell you no damage taken indeed whack come over here oh do not hit my friend never mind how about we just whap and wow clean first night i would hope so if we're having trouble on the first night like that then we got bigger fish to fry there are bigger problems to address either way nice level up there everybody sick work another night survived dilly dilly thank you thank you and thank you yes please not the biggest bountiful harvest of souls but i'll take it all the same knight reward what do we want you guys also pointed out i was a bit dumb on this one the tier of the unit is can most often times be more worth rarity rarity adds extra traits okay what the fudge is this is insane okay i don't care about the other i'm taking 10 percent ryability 3 damage 15 armor and an extra action point uh yeah what is this extra it's not bad but this gives accuracy resistance reduction 20 crit power though uh nah we're going baron cape what the fudge up all right let's level you up first off everybody get your xp come and get your xp here oh i'm just giving what the everyone and their mom is getting an extra ap what the wow um we really want to keep you melee we don't have to in fact we could make you whatever we want and with that extra crit uh it's very likely i could just make them an archer or something so for now we'll just play it safe and go to accuracy i don't know what i want you to be yet okay wait a second we're kind of freaking popping off right now 23 range damage this early what okay this has to be the run right that's what the game's telling me i have to survive 12 nights and i've never made it past eight well nine but yeah we could we we got this um you could also be whatever we want you to be you have a lot of magic and physical it might even make more sense to just make you now right now now where are you getting this from oh just base but you just start with base seven percent with that sure uh well then what would i want with you i don't really want any of this that hurts could just go range damage okay but i i got to make one i won't have three archers um 20 experience gain i mean i'm not against that yeah sure why not don't mind if i do extra reliability damage armor and action points sounds great for uh some ranged humor the extra experience gain on you is nice but yeah we could just make you an absolute killing machine hold on what's everyone's experience game 135 145 125. this guy doesn't have that trinket we can just go all in on this dude yeah why not hey you want all the experience game buddy you got it there you go buddy yeah a little less damage but that's fine don't worry about it plus one action point it's probably honestly better no not on the sword i don't know it doesn't really matter uh you have extra actually an armor this could give you extra movement actually but less daily mana regen next armor is nice but having an extra move to move around not bad but if we do lose health then i blame it on the armor but whatever let's get that movement gamers okay so i've been experimenting with like how i want to try and do early econ and i'm going to be honest i haven't really found anything i like let's get these out of the way because all they ever do is disrupt my buildings okay but i know first off no matter what we do we build a gold mine now how do we want to build them could just do a house wait let's see house house no just to gold mine here uh we're gonna upgrade production effect i'm going to use a wardrobe i'm going to get that gold back um i could upgrade this for another use so let's see that would give me another 25 gold or i could build another gold mine which will get me 10 next turn which isn't as efficient right and then yeah and then worry about that i think that's the playing get all of this stuff out of here um well well maybe not because then i can only just let's see just give me what 14. let's see what the shop has oh what is this oh shoot frickin yo i had somebody with like 55 magic damage with a magic orb you use this little death ray thing holy cow man it's nuts it was pretty fun druid staff though the night i made it to night nine with one of these things yeah i was prepared i never realized like whole opportunistic thing and everything freaking nuts dude i might just swipe that right now and get rid of that stupid scepter oh my god we could get mana at another action point and another move point i can't afford this what why is there so much good this is this store is cracked what the what do we have here extra multi-heads good golly misses molly all right i'm gonna have to ask you to calm down right now again i just grabbed this now i don't have anyone that does multi hits yet but if we do get someone yeah i'm copping that now screw it a short bow is nuts don't get me wrong um let's just sell that we don't need that so i could get the druid staff here i wish uh i mean those are such good pants brother but no okay i i think i'm gonna get the druid stuff i think it's worth it at least for now and it's tier one where you at get rid of that trash scepter you got there this gives you extra block perfect i'm gonna throw that on the secondary see this gives her extra four block even though she'll never use um and then you know i'll even give this as an off hand for you if you want to use it for whatever reason again no multi-hits right now actually yeah you're just propagation okay then we uh we gotta destroy something people are always like don't destroy it for the gold it's not worth it shut your mouth i'll do what i want and i think it is i think that little better little extra bitty cons all but worth it and i'll just leave the rest all right i'm not going to bother building defenses we don't need that no materials used that's fine you think i need such a crutch i am insulted all right with this druid staff though oh we gonna be popping uh i'll tell you what something like this uh i know i'm not gonna get hit because they'll hit the barricades so we're we are protected gonna use this for the extra free essence whatever at the end of the round but it's just so sad i've come to realization almost every melee well it's kind of just trash really hope they balance past that because right now it's like archers mages and then out of screen is melee there are a few good really good melee weapons but you know i don't know chief uh unfortunately i cannot move there because they're in my way i was really hoping they wouldn't stupid runners man okay i could really use thrifty on this fella tell you what uh but uh probably just gonna be sting everybody i don't have to um one thing we're definitely those just gonna bring i'll just yeah i'll just clear this front line which then freeze up for me to do this didn't kill i all my one health and aid health all right now you're just teasing me what the come on there don't do me like that come over here come over here yeah yeah hit this dude how much movement will i have after this two move okay i should probably back up now getting a little ahead of ourselves okay saucy saucy saucy i might not even need to use ap on these guys frankly i'm being honest with you all see like i have all this ap but i need more stuff to use stock because i don't want to use any mana right now i'm not nearly as frugal on mana as i as i used to be but on these early rounds not only early waves but early rounds like this like come on but i guess i'll be sting that's pretty good that's pretty good that's pretty good all right go on then go on then lad move around for the sake of it armor up i guess uh give you dodge just in case who really knows three extra action points screw you there freaking nobody's touching me okay so the fun begins i also unlocked ballista or catapults um yeah they're kind of bucks first couple waves they're great first couple nights and after like night four they only get two uses per night and after like night four both the uses in the same area of effect like wouldn't even clear out a wave it's it's sad makes me very sad but it is what it is yo take oh take this well that was fun but of course everyone and their moms has to live with like no help great hey where do you think you're going no you don't rescue because see like another thing too is like entangle people and then they can barely move and then i do extra damage then it's it's easy money let me tell you um debating if i should what i should do here i'm gonna one bang that dude easy i knew i would we crit that i think we might have go on caleb you're not even the crit master monica's the crit master uh yeah i'm just trying to think how to use the least amount of resources here uh i'm fine using the bees i just don't want to use them on these guys that are like already on death's row so i think i'll just do that and then propagate from the back to the front very fun you could even do it again if i shall wish what's your main regent oh you're fine you're fine go over there maybe a little bit of this oh actually that's great that's fantastic thanks buddy um let's do that and then you know what we could swap over to this map and i never thought you'd see me do that huh freaking okay i gotta give you dodge now though you're fine over there you can't move but i'm not worried about you you're a fragger um get rid of you and yeah i mean they're all just gonna die from poison that guy can't do anything in fact i'll just i was killing that easy all right yeah sure boy we got some runners oh wait what the fudge got hit oh i didn't even bother to look at that i didn't think anyone could make it to you i'm a scrub dude lost four health in the great battle of night two of darksburg number nine or whatever it all blends together these days i could even possibly kill all them uh let's figure out what the fudge i'm doing this oh i'll tell you what i'm doing yeah god nobody wants to die man [Music] um see if i come over here just a little bit of that get you with that bop get you there bop and i'm out of mana i'm debating could just tangle them how much poison damn okay literally all these guys are dying to poison so i don't have to worry about them so i'm just going to take out the runners and then you know i'll just uh i'll throw my bees back her i should hear because then it should propagate like that you guys will not die to poison granted you won't either this turn but whatever um it's just weakening uh can anyone hit me over here double checks i don't think so i'm gonna armor up just in case anything else we want to do here give you dodge and put you behind the wall even though these guys should all die to poison um in case i made a miscalculation i don't want to take any more damage there we go easy using like a sunday morning um i guess i gotta take care of you huh uh i'll get the bees going back hurt [Music] uh what do you want to do buddy bones you want to kill everybody i know you do bodge man what said you want to kill everybody and then you got to make them look like a fool i could do this all night all night long wait are you out of moves oh my god okay i did not pay attention to that that's all right i'll give you some dodge you'll be fine walk it off uh let's just oh you're gonna die to poison i have to worry about you i think they'd get hurt by poison first if i'm not mistaken um okay yeah before i do anything give you dodge could do snipe shot duh but i don't need to do this i don't even need to but yeah why not all right help you out one less dude to hit you bop one health are you kidding me oh the heat screen and then i'll just arm wrap on it uh yeah and i guess i'm gonna test the fact that uh okay yeah poison hurts first okay and you're not even gonna get hit by anybody what am i worried about clearly nothing go on hey get them off get them off go on monica wait i probably should have given it to the guy who gets the most experience game right or is it all evenly distributed i'm pretty sure evenly look at that miguel with the extra ding already that's the extra xp coming in clutch much another perfect night i need all of your money why don't i get a little like what whatever i'll take it all thank you yes yes me lord okay job's done you should try this out i think i will uh what item do we get oh shoot it's multi-hit time [Music] plus one crossbow comes with extra dodge which is a meh but we don't care about that alternatively we could get or that's that's actually pretty good i could give that to monica and she'd be like 25 critical hit chance actually those are really good but uh no i think hand crossbow takes the these are really good but i think we get more value out of the crossbow later on all right friend i don't know what to invest with you i really don't i could give you the hand crossbow and just keep the other guy in the longbow for now it's not the worst idea i've ever heard will all the extra crit chance i don't know if crit change is exactly useful with that holy breath dude this guy's getting cracked too bad you don't do physical damage uh i don't really need the movement points but i'm almost just tempted to take it because i can't i think i'm going to probably not the best use but um i guess accuracy accuracy always seems pretty solid we can go stunning but i think we'll just go a steady aim first it's always a good idea miguel with the double level up you bet you're not ranged um we'll gamble gamble paid off give me that extra magic damage we're also looking for poison damage if we find it um i'll just take some extra mana accuracy isn't huge i guess i'll just more experience game why not right oh oh my god i could go for 150 experience game is that too much of a meme because i could get the poison damage all these are sick this i'm thinking about it i'm really thinking about it because right now he's got i could could get him to 185 percent experience this boy be double cheeked up turquoise if this poison wasn't here i wouldn't even be debating it it seems like a meme but whatever i'm doing it full sin dude okay well we're going to give you poison damage here and definitely propagation bounces that looks pretty solid to me let's level you up girl i still don't know what to do with you let's just give you another movement point and you use momentum but i don't know if i want to invest into that but i'm worried if i reroll it's gonna be something even more useless so didn't really uh leave leave much room to figure out what we wanted to do from there what do we want to do here well we'll go with swift as the wind that's your chance to get some movement points back to back us up out of a bad situation i put myself in all right i think i was working towards something here's a generator with better defensive gear item that is pretty good i want to start with wealthy haven but um twenty five thousand dark cousins i can also get heroes general with another action point so we'll start with seven kind of nutty but i guess i'll just do this and whatever it'll take a while but here we are now we gotta continue to build our economy improves passive production i'm trying to think money-wise how does this manage so this will cost me 90. the next one is 200 i think so i don't think the math checks out here i would need two 290 and uh if i upgrade those it's not gonna help right 290 157 i'm 100 something off if i do max production here i get 50. i'm still quite a bit off rip i wanted to try and just zerg down the ultimate ultimate thing i hate to see it all right well i'm just going to build another gold mine then do i want to build this sure and then let me think uh i definitely need to do this then i got to do some math okay definitely because i don't have any extra workers i've built any houses i'm trying to get the most bang for my buck right now i should also check the shop real quick the ark arc masters druidic staff plus one action point from the boot hello it has less bass damage though okay but just another actual point i mean at this point though so my people are i think they have playing they got enough i already got a multi-hit one so feeling pretty good about that oh extra opportunistic and poison damage but that does remove the experience gain we yeah i'm meme in it like i said okay so there's nothing in the shop i want so that's good to know so if i build another workers camp at the very least i'm gonna do this okay and i think i do this yeah now i think this is the play because next turn this will give us what 50 gold from the boot it's pretty good whereas yeah yeah yeah this is still where my my math gets a little muddied [Music] i'll upgrade this use one worker which leaves me with one marker which i'm going to use here for the gold ah mr fruit what a waste and uh shut your mouth all right i don't hear um grab that so i'm gonna save the gold now i think i want to save to try and hit this because if possible next turn upgrade this to 55 and then get three uses and that's a hundred what 65 gold just from that and then put that i'm just gonna try and max all my gold mines asap i think i don't know again could be a bad idea i don't know and i should equip this crossbar i got the fudge am i doing um okay but see ironically i can't give you the crossbow because have um yeah i might un-ironically give you the crossbow [Music] okay yeah you're getting the crossbow get out my way scepter um buy some new okay sell this sell this okay how much is all pog we can hit another gold mine that seems pretty good all right another 10 gold not the immediate return we're looking for but we have all of them out there now our economy's rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling you're gonna carry me with this we're just gonna put everything ablaze or quick shot everything either or uh it doesn't really matter to me what night are we on night three oh we do have double duty now i guess i should put some defenses down now unlucky okay so who could probably solo you don't have any aoe yourself you're you're more support um in your kind of support and you you could probably solo if i use blaze yeah i think i think we'll have you solo means you will not be selling you guys right there and i think we're good no materials used yeah i'm debating if she'd even bother [Music] mayhaps i'll just put that over there with the solo and then i think you guys are fine trying to greet this as much as possible i'm trying to push the boundaries as much as i can uh let's give you guys some perks also tomorrow if i can't afford it i would like to get a super early sear and then just omega push back the fog that could be pretty big because that's what i've been doing too after everything seer is huge all right don't tell me this is gonna have the least amount of ads because i swear i mean um a little annoying i can't reach much hmm little runner boners could just wound our reckon ah see papaga if i had known i would have gone with initiator had i known i was going to give you the crossbar see that's why you should kind of i was dumb on me i mean i could still just go in and melee everything but winning all right they're practically dead anyway i'll give a scene now this just puts me in a worse spot because that wasn't my best idea was it uh whatever multi requires my site of course well oh my god everything in their mom is living with no hp hey back back back back it up i have line of sight what do you mean see i just kind of bumped myself hey whatever all right worst case if it seems like there's going to be more i can always rotate it ain't that big of a deal you ain't nothing but a hound dog run all all right i don't even need your help i appreciate you trying yeah i don't need it thanks okay yeah as it currently is you know i'm just gonna flex you're right here and we'll see what next round looks like then i'll just shine from there yeah it looks like a healthy mix everything honestly is that going to reduce my movement speed it did all right well i think we just start blazing everything now just propagate everything really dodge sick all right that's not bad the multi hits of justice screw you this thing's dodging everything man all right this crossbow's freaking cracked i think we're gonna be just fine oh yeah i just freaking i don't know you do that so yeah i think we'll just come back here because the bow is good at single target but i'm not going to be killing many things in a bunch anyway so let's uh get you to propagate yeah how fun yo literally all the they're all dead all right then and now you're gonna die and you're gonna die and you're gonna die oh my the extra range damage this early on is actually insane now totally forgot about you joe all right we're good uh is anyone not going to die to their poison no you guys both aren't going through so whatever i've yeah the extra ap to be able to do with it what i win five action points okay whatever freaking fine army yourself treat yourself all right i think we've got this handling music in this game it's a banger yeah see that was that uh i guess i'll take it a little slow here on the blazes if i don't have to to avoid uh unnecessary mana usage unfortunately you are unable to help so what do i want to do i could go with you feel faithful um and just freaking he didn't die but that's okay uh yeah we'll just take you out oh okay so i know we're not even going to break the army here so it might seem useless but he's not going to move at all so now i don't have to worry about him so i'll come over here bosh see yeah now i can let everything else approach it out of me trying to figure out i think i'm fine right here you're chilling you're omega chilling [Music] i'm gonna run up whack him come back the ultimate being um yeah you you treat yourself real nice over there okay oh the crawler or the runner don't hit oh what i should have damaged him rude i think it cripped me um okay we'll see now i kind of want to do that one we're kind of being split up here i don't like it all right i'm just gonna use some blaze uh blaze you plays you blaze you we don't do like much damage but uh you still can't move now the problem is i can't kill everything um let me see what we can do over here first you're dead you're dead you're dead you should all get cc for the most part perfect if you're not you'd die all right i'm up i think you got the rest of it yourself buddy if you don't sorry little wait um let's see who could i be if i be him that should kill won't propagate here which is but the rest of him are practically dead look at that kill you kill you um i'll try and kill you hey uh use a little bit of mana here because i'm boozy like that switch back to the crossbow see having all this is very nice um whatever will i kill you it will uh all poison yeah i'll try and kill you easy ah i don't think that'll kill never mind or gucci perfect i'm just going to come right back over here and chill till the next episode uh actually there's quite a few more wait i think i've been baboozled okay this is the last of them so aside from my this little bat right here i think this is all the archer's dealer so i think we could kill them all actually we might be able to just cast some debuffs move along and help next turn here um i promise i can't too far away okay if i can just freeze these guys okay whoops kill them don't you hate when that happens uh let's maybe kill you rip let's yeah let's just take whoever whoever is threatening any kind of damage which was pretty much only that archer and now possibly that archer so no um yeah i guess i can do this too um propagate right here saucy stuff saucy saucy kill you you almost died of poison oh wait did i miss on that whatever sorry friend i did what i could even though it was not enough forgive me uh okay poison's gonna kill you i need line of sight on you oh my god now you did i didn't have to do that but whatever uh sure dodged feels bad um yeah i don't want to waste anything else on you guys i don't think i have to i really don't think this does anything anymore but oh we got a couple left my bad i think i'm actually fine uh they're a little too close though what the [Music] um why do i do this perfect and then oh wait no but i don't have enough movement no [Music] uh all right [Music] looks like a pretty good time to whip this out easy clown poison you just because i can oh we're good okay i can just move him here and finish this guy out and he'll dodge okay we did it uh three perfect nights oh my goodness girl i was just stretching let's go miguel oh give me that give that good stuff a little bit more seven extra gold for that whatever i'll take it mmm and some saucy tainted essence yes very good oh yeah look at that gold oh yeah that's the good stuff give me that give me that give me that give me that we're at 218 okay oh tier 2 wooden rifle oh really oh a tear uh yeah tier 2 dagger um but you have to like if i wanted to use dagger at this point i'd have to build very specific for it it does give extra move and critical it gives momentum which is useless but like [Music] honestly i could put this with the crossbow because it's all about multi-hits and if i stack poison five multi-hits on daggers like could be fragging the wand no and i did use the rifle once it's definitely it feels like you use it for suppressive fire which is really good but i don't know [Music] it's not bad though i could pair it with somebody right now this dagger i i would get rid of the the mm-hmm [Music] jesus oh the two-handed sword fella well we just get rid of between this one i know i'm kind of torn they can both be pretty good oh i don't know what to do let's go is it cow with the no it's monica it does give extra reliability and the suppressive fire it's it is insane you hit ten targets in a five by two for two turns minus three move points and minus 20 damage so then you could just keep stacking that over and over and over it's really good for support like i could even give this to our friend yeah maybe i give this to um the guy with the dual crossbow or not dual the longbow right now since he doesn't have a secondary ah they're both so good i i'm gonna go with the rifle i'm gonna do it i'm sorry but i've made up my mind all right before i do any perks or anything let's figure out what i'm doing and stuff so i don't mess anything up here i wanted to buy some gear what do we got no high tier stuff ooh short bow though i think this is the best thing in the game i'm gonna be honest with you chief which sucks because then if that were the case why would i why wouldn't i just you know [Music] what's the point of getting the um that rifle i just got i could check this botch okay well i might buy this but let's see how my economy is going to look first off i'm going to upgrade this and then i'm going to up so i could i'm thinking 100 gold this turn for another 55. or i just do this i don't know we have 128 left i think i need to start buying houses for workers and i might get the seer it might be a little early to get this year but in early seer just sounds fun and nice quite frankly gives us a big cushion to make sure this knife goes perfectly oh i only have two more workers [Music] even if i get enough for a seer right now i wouldn't have the workers to use this year um i know it might seem like that was bad but literally next turn this now gives us 110 gold off the bat and then i get another 100 so this will give us like 270 gold or something next turn pretty good i'm gonna pay dividends but i think i need to start getting houses let's build us a house this little development we got over here oh nice i think i'm gonna upgrade this [Music] or i could build another house actually if i do i might be able to afford i'm not gonna bother doing the math because i guess i'm just lazy i hate that this would go unused when i destroyed this two building around [Music] all right and that gives me enough to do that and i get to do that and then i can buy another house if i wanted to i'm rich let's slow our roll there mr but you understand where i'm coming from let's see that'd be my fifth house you can just barely afford it but it would be nice i don't need manuel or any of that yet yeah i just don't like that this is gonna be so awkward but maybe it's worth it that's probably worth it all right we got two more workers i can't put them to work anywhere else except for demolishing something so demolish for the gold you know i'm a fiend i'll choose my tank traditions real quick [Music] sheesh that's what i like to think of peace [Applause] all right only three people here is gonna be intervesting um yeah realistically i think i am going to buy the short ball hold up hold up how much will this sell for six i don't think that's enough less accuracy okay i don't need any of that wait a second hold up sell that buy the short bow boom all right we win gg game over now he should be able to hold aside by himself if he wanted to but um all right let's start leveling up here extra critical chance is nice is it better than range damage it's up there but i might just invest in range damage just because we already have such high base i know like i kind of want to see where we can go with that accuracy yeah i don't want to be missing stuff [Music] um you don't want any of that stuff i think we'll just go cherry pick it next we're looking for armor seems nice right there but that's not what we're going for um we don't need resistance we just need like poison mana crit probably although no you don't even need crit because we just need like propagation and stuff which we're not finding rip rip all right well i tried um yeah see we don't need any of this so i'll just go up reliability yay anyway thrifty oh shoot you know it thrifty's like my favorite trade in the game 200 and i can't deny it do we go range damage with you yet i don't know because we could always build her as if we are going to go physical with her and then the next hero we get give them the crossbow and the multi-hit [Music] i don't know i like i feel like we should be using her better because of her her insane crit i'm gonna do it let's just go physical damage i don't like any of those i don't like any of those ah this is good experience game whatever probably a terrible idea if i had to say so myself but what is he gonna do okay let's see i see yeah at the same time whatever i don't know what i'm doing i'm botching monica so hard i'm so sorry girl i'm gonna give you extra multi-hits then why would i give her physical attack and whatever that last thing was i don't know i don't know what i told you i don't know what i'm doing okay i'm sorry yeah all right build some defenses probably should probably should how far is your range with this not as far as i'd hoped some skill range plus would be sick that'd be pr that'd be a little gentle short bows range big it's just real big okay i think i know what i'm doing um i've never tried this so this will be interesting uh we're doing this together so i unlocked where is it the watch tower so i would like to put it but this building is being a boner it's only problem is i won't be able to clear out whatever whatever forget about it putting a watchtower here you are going to come over here you're going to climb to the watchtower build defenses we're building perfect and you're just gonna you're just gonna hold this fourth down by yourself can you do that for me buddy honestly i think you can i think you can yeah so then uh you two will fight for good and evil over here perfect edge do this armor up and all right and eyebrow uh you know i'm actually going to put you one behind now with this you should be fine nevermind you're good is that coming yeah i really need to push the miss back next time but i also kind of need the end i don't know what i'm gonna do i don't know if literally putting everything into one mine was to play that's what we're going to find out all right friend you think you can hide from me i see all this is kind of actually busted okay now check this out it costs two mana but uh i'm pretty sure oh oh my accuracy is so good they would can't dodge they have zero percent chance of dodging a little push both and see this is the minus three move point in minus 20 damaging it's nuts it's definitely its best thing and i forgot to tell you it also has assassinate which i think is the single best leave this single but look at the range jesus single best damage to this runner i would do 475 to 498 damage that's pretty good i like that but what do i like about this um i could okay do you one shot these things it would be a gamble instead of gambling we'll just have you dodge everything okay we're gonna suck let me just there we go hit you you hit you hit you perfect we haven't killed anyone so we're still getting plenty of multi hits um i'm actually just gonna poison me yeah screw you then finish finish finish finish dodge dodge dodge dodge whatever it's all the same here we go and then poison you you'll die and scramble back over here uh i get to do this for free which i'm going to do so that with opportunistic whatever we uh absolutely poop on him he dodges of course he does hates you not everybody is specked out in accuracy like our friend uh cal we can all be not to be as lucky did i immobilize him so i couldn't move i don't know he's just stuck behind that tree dying the poison that appears to be his fate my apologies oh wait don't do that um okay do that and then oh no i will not let you aha you cannot escape my eyes for they see all um best i can do is kill three here hopefully at least and then less accurate but we'll kill if we hit boy fixed that'll do pig that'll do and let's get an omega propagation going here fo free might i might i have yep okay like they're all dead easy um then movement debuff you guys in fact i'm not gonna worry about you i'll finish you off next turn i'll just make sure i kill everyone here um debating if i go here i think i need more room so believe it or not i'm still potent in melee range yes which means easy easy easy oh but i already killed right i was trying to be greedy and get extra multi-hits all right poison should uh just about kill all of you except for you hold up make sure it's gonna kill everybody yeah some of these even have double poison so easy all right you might be taking a couple hits though my friend i really hope not uh so yeah it turns out i don't actually need to help you guys at all instead i'll just do that come up here hit you once that's all i can do that's all i have to offer okay but it's just gonna be archers looks like didn't even break but they probably minus two movement points rude we're still chilling here though uh i don't think i need to use that much energy on you guys you're not even worth it oh why didn't you die why you gotta be like that brick yeah we're doing just fine over there on that watchtower let me tell ya i don't even need to use blaze right now it feels like in fact i feel like like that don't kill anyone pog now we start killing or do we let's do that perfect now we kill why isn't this fella in front of me dad the world may never know um i'm gonna double poison you screw you you're dead next turn stupid here we go nice good stuff lad i can't i don't have any more for you sorry then we'll come back here armor up all right so far we got this in control pretty well i'd say not too shabby but if i'm not able to get a new hero and at least this year but i think a new hero we might be in a little bit of trouble so we'll wait for that to be a surprise for the next day um let's do that you can't hit you unlucky switch this okay this combo kind of nasty i have no way of that's really annoying oh i'm gonna have to go around later or something uh i don't even need to use blaze yet still don't think i need to um i can't propagate that actually yeah i can propagate pretty good right here it should be all down here right yep they're all dead um just debuff you guys i guess i'll have to hit you twice and i'll one shot you and then i got eight movement i think i can make it work i didn't even realize i got this dude right here hi yeah somebody died rick and then uh i'll just get rid of your guys's movements yeah you're stuck so i'll just poison you let you slowly die right back next don't have any gate here not my best moment i don't know what to do about that figure out later we've almost seen all of them i think oh he oh nevermind he he flew into the base all right that makes it easier for me thanks i guess um inside how much uh first off let's just propagate with some bees right there feels just about everybody except for him which i could probably just kill myself if i want to um i'll do this kill you kill you come back kill you well poison will kill you uh arrow that's pretty good bop i honestly think this side might be done so i'll hop off yeah i think i'm actually done yet dang boy you know i'll shoot this dude while i'm at it why not all right so you gonna have some fun friend you want to propagate no no point wasting the mana bop bop all right let's kill you kill you poison will finish you off poison will finish you off poison will not finish you off or you off so whatever screw you gonna throw some more poison on you lep you know what take a third one it's on the house and then harbor all right it would appear that yes the last bit of practical overheads are just others just a couple stragglers which thankfully it looks like i should be able to take care of without having to get back up on me yeah i can return oh baby a triple now what do we do here see i don't even need to use my blaze proper game right now because i got bees they're all i could ever ask for what um i'm not that concerned about saving mana but like i literally don't even have to so why bother you know will that kill you yes it will you're gonna die to poison you're not you're not you will you will you will perfect really really my dude fine double poison you you're dead you're to die slow you can't even hit you but screw you um that's pretty much it right got nothing oh wait i probably could have gone back out there to kill the bat this darn bat oh nevermind i see it and absolutely destroy you let's embarrass you over here [Music] punch you kids yeah all right four perfect nights so far let's keep it going like i said the one time i did it off camera i got the six perfect nights let's see if we can do that bare minimum miguel's xp has yet to to uh pay off in that he's gotten another level advantage but i still think he's doing pretty fine i think the meme was still worth it no regrets i've weakened this fool well that was easy oh now they're coming from the places i of course just wasted all my materials to defend okay don't take the item reward i'll leave that gold 343 sheesh uh well actually okay let me see what my choices are i don't have to pick holy tier four plus 30 poison damage i have a feeling i know where that's going extra move eight extra mana 16 dodge dang what does this do what does this do i'm throwing this on uh pujama closet here we go here we go buddy perks what would you like i could give you 12 percent extra mana or magic damage right now [Music] uh could just give you extra live but see i don't need any of that i think just is does magic damage affect i don't think that affects poison damage i mean i guess it'll help its base damage you know i'm gonna go with reliability i'll wait until maybe i get a little more mana and bump up the magic damage i don't know i mean i don't know well i'll just go relax then it could give you more magic damage more armor gamba we need propagation bounces or what propagation bounces fudge rip man whatever monica are doesn't know what she's doing fiend because i don't know what i'm doing with you and that's entirely my fault let me check the shop no real high tier stuff i could upgrade the shop but as you can all tell i've been busy doing other things ooh plus one skill range and accuracy but we only get one trinket um [Music] and i don't really want to get rid of that that's our current archer um maybe the cross no well then we lose our multiuse we can't do that okay never mind i never buy potions should i probably but today's not that day let's go back to level now actually wait let's see if i get an n let me decide after that because um depends on like what hero we might be able to recruit or whatever so let's build the seer but uh i need to keep her keep it sheriff let's get rid of you nope building structures here don't know if that's the best use of space but whatever go ahead and repel the fog very nice um need some more workers because i could build an end but i don't want to build it where it could easily be destroyed like i'd want to build it like right here but i need more workers um guess upgrade workers upgrade workers is it time to invest in materials i think so all right build the n wait i think i don't have enough money because of buying those stupid upgrades oh yeah increases here capacity by one oh wait does buying it automatically give me a i don't know uh slight problem i don't have enough gold to uh buy them you're a wizard richard oh shoot the sniper ranged skill range critical power poison damage less health extra range damage this boy do be kind of cracked or this lady you have a long sword do you have a you have a druid staff oh and you come with poison damage don't you no you don't that's someone else you have a pistol oof i suck with those you have a druid staff honestly i think aziza the best play here okay is there somehow some way i can get 40 gold here [Music] um yeah i might have made a boo-boo miscalculated the gold not terribly but apparently just enough should have saved some of my workers if i'd saved some of my workers would be fine one little two-hand i'll be able to do the night with three but let me tell you it'd be so much easier with four so much easier because see i could upgrade a thing to get another worker but that gives me one worker i would lose gold i'd fudge papaga there's no way i can sell 40 gold's worth of stuff oh mr fruit you big dum-dum [Music] no no i can survive the night i know i can i'm just worried i'm not it's not going to be perfect and that messes up econ a whole bunch uh why am i like this punch i know i'm gonna figure this out that's the end of this episode thank you ladies and gentlemen for continuing to support this series i know it's gone
