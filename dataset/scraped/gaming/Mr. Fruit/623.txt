hi ad ho-jon my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and I've got to come clean about something been weighing on me for a little while we haven't had a modern warfare video an unusual man of time could that mean he's done it he's gotten Obsidian Oh funny thing they've literally made no progress [Music] the Obsidian grind completely broke me if I had any motivation to play multiplayer it killed it I just can't do it so I think I'll admit defeat obsidian you went I think I'll just stick to my Damascus let's get to making silly stuff so comment down below with a loadout that you think I should try or certain guns certain attachments whatever it might be and if I end up choosing it I'll highlight you in the video speaking of mindlessly grinding ship in 24/7 shoot house 24/7 this is great we're gonna start in shipment because I also still need to get the LMG and the shotgun kills to unlock the new LMG so I don't mind grinded for those oh great ok joining the game and I hear a helicopter we're gonna be fine check this out I'm a degenerate I'm sorry Bob now somebody come into my smoke oh oh that's two kills near smoke let's get it yes oh I am that guy right now okay I don't know what to tell you I need to get smoke kills with my LMG and so this is what I don't know if any of these have counted yet who am i shooting alright calm down calm down get your smoke back mr. fruit reload reload hold on I killed him with my smoke wait what am i shooting okay this most kind of bonus because the the 80s is just so large I can't see anything that's happening I wish it would just tell me if I've already done oh okay that's oh that's got to be it okay okay great we're gonna swap it out now now if the Robeck oh my God look at me grinding the 725 I haven't used this thing in a hot minute since it was just a terror so we're here to see is it still and see is it still up to snuff I guess we won't find out today this makes me so happy now rewind back to black ops 4 I was playing at this time in its lifecycle I'd be finding like no games so bless up for cross play did AI how are you yeah we're gonna smoke this give it a second somebody alright I think I'm jus baiting myself with this whole smoke thing Oh Mike maybe not that's to wait for them to turn the corner or something your friendly friendly friendly okay apparently that guy wasn't friendly though wait why should i spawn into a flash well how's that fair oh nice who through the smoke love you I'll double smoke it I can't see yep there we go okay that's got a count that's kind of count hey mister 725 it's been a while for good reason I always felt like I needed to take a bath after using you you're filthy but you've received a significant amount of nerves and I haven't really seen anyone complaining about you anymore so I'm gonna assume that we're all good the old 725 bore that that would have taken one shot and I could have had twice the range brother I don't know why I'm picking up like a southern twang here I just ride along rootin tootin cowboy you know I'm saying take me down to Paradise City where the grass is green and those girls they are so pretty oh my okay I don't know how I got that kill he had to have been weak cuz I refused to believe that I would have killed him at that range death look nothing Damascus but then again it's a very flattering dress let's say that you could put in you know maybe I got 3 out of 10 on the attractive scare and I'm saying and I mean it leo I get 9 out of a 10 easily adds plus 5 plus 6 to beauty stat not today but yes today Dragon's Breath rounds what do you do but I took him down well actually no he took me down with him because that was it worked the other way around yeah on shipment I'll show you 725 is not as good as like the origin gob let me just tag everybody for a little bit oh well I appreciate you decided to just walk in front of my shotgun like that Oh No now many people bother to make me look good in front of my subscribers this will not go unnoticed I'm a benevolent king even if it's some heads sometimes a little tyrannical in nature but I can't help it or maybe I could and I don't want to Oh Oh what am I talking about well I'm so glad you asked well in this hypothetical world that exists in my brain you know there's a house fruit in fruit kingdom and I'm I'm the king and of course I rule with an iron fist I'm dad watch this watch when I respond oh it didn't happen that time oh well that's not happening okay as soon as I was gonna point up these on to us I'll check this out you think this is safe it is because you can aim and I cannot skirt well that's the wrong button Oh got him though oh it did at that time did you see that do you see that I'm not crazy I'm not crazy he like flicks up my aim for just a split second nope oh okay that one felt pretty good I don't know if I deserved it I feel little roundabout but okay I was gonna say mister point-blank just hit hit body mass or something bro okay hold on Oh double jump STDs I'm hardened over now I oh I didn't actually mean to shoot twice fudge oh but I'm alive no I'm not well call me a paper cut cuz I was on a tear that doesn't make sense call me an ACL cuz I'm torn victory that was for you guys I'm reading a postcard back as we speak dear subscribers and viewers thank you very much for your continued and undying support may we all fight one day in Valhalla love King fruit the tyrant well throw to shoot house although I admit this will probably make this whole smoked deal a little more challenging let's see if I can do this right you Yahoo that smoke now the question is is it close enough that I can technically get a kill off of it I don't think so well rip me huh so they want to play hardball do they all right well then let him yeah I can't do anything about if I just I'm a simple man I immediately regret the shoot house decision there's a terrible decision why'd you guys let me do this yeah well we got to mix it up it wasn't like I need to optimize the ground it's like what would the people want screw the people okay as I'm sorry I didn't I didn't mean that and again is this gracious King I would never say something so divisive is that smoke okay yeah that definitely seems like it was near smoke okay but that's that's one out of three it's gotta be someone in here right will you jump up the oh my oh my what am i doing justjust let him have it yeah that's right totally deserve that kill uh-huh put down a smoke Bob there's two out of three where's the three out of three holy jesus I don't I don't think that counts no but we're getting kills oh wait did he really just he did spawn man the odds are stacked against me Bob throw smoke away for them to come ideally please okay that's got a count that's got a cat switching over to the shotgun I'll give someone a free kill relinquish me from the hell of that is live give me the sweet release of death but I'll make you work for it you know but I haven't played much crank it's just like scuffed movie version of amped or whatever that thing was it actually just called Frank oh my god okay 725 turns out is still pretty insane if I'm being honest with you all how many ten okay so I need what like 14 kills oh my god well if they just keep making it this easy I mean I'm not gonna say oh I'm not good wait I'm not gonna say no here's the point we only need two more kills and then that'll do it for the shotguns I I think the problem with the Damascus Graham was that I was so tunnel vision there's like Damascus surf or bust then I got it and I was like oh okay I'm free let's enjoy the rest of it but then they're like yo psych your zip sitting camo and I was like breath and then yet I did actually just broke the camel's back I guess I'm a camel no no Moo wait no that's not the sound of camel makes I don't know oh wait I know the sound of camel makes update as well it's me mr. fruit the ape you thought I've changed but fear not my friends for I have not I'm still the degenerate you know in love we just got a bit oh you just gotta a bird hold that W button and to their spawn and that's what happens folks more all the story is do as I say not as I do wait but I also say the hold W so don't do as I say or as I do actually just never listen to me from a horrible influence except when I tell you to drink water that's a great influence do that I'm looking out for you so remember if you have an idea for a funny loadout or challenge or whatever you would like to see drop it down in the comment section below and perhaps I'll give it a go thank you very much for watching has a fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music]
