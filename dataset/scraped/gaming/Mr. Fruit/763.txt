hi ad hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare in the road to Damascus continues this time a brand-new secret Golden Gun mr. free what are you talking about it's it's the ak-47 ah but do you notice something I don't know if this is like an easter egg or something but you can customize the ak-47 to look like the ak-74 you and in a way kind of play like it what you got to do is put on the old compensator for that recoil control because it is dramatic eight point one inch compact barrel we love that 80's bit 5 MW laser sprint to fire speed now here's the key no stock for increased movement in 80s speed and stippled grip tape increased 80s speed and sprint of fire speed hmm mr. fruit no sleight of hand I know I know I must be ill or something listen you can't really fit it in the idea with this is to make the ak-47 feel as much as an SMG as possible you'll be heading in to shoot the ship we don't care about sights we don't care about range we want a 80s as fast as possible al adhim up a shipment first try let's get it and the gold is looking nice there's none of the black really on the back of this so all we see is some Gucci look and gold I'm down for it and I'm down to clarin on whoever comes I must warn you God Jesus Christ may he look over us a whole excuse me excuse me coming through coming through look at this believe that 80s because there's another one all done this guy sees me off his spawn never mind my friend saved me what a hero for what a guy what a guy what a guy what a guy indeed I'm not gonna have any time to talk at all am i no what if it's not like I should be surprised it's shipment anyway what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say is I popped out for the last couple games when I needed to get gold I'm talking like three plus KT every game straight up like ninety and thirty almost every game like I was a man possessed and so might foil our plans a little bit here if I'm trying to be the very best that there ever was screw me if you're not I just took off specialist totally forgot about that it's nice when I'm going for camo challenges but you know what we got to try and get our favourite oh my god I forgot I have juggernaut and everything alright well it's nice that I'll never get those but hey for the memes right I'm supposed to have kill chain on I probably should anyway I mean ghost on this map doesn't really matter anyway they don't really need a UAV to know where I am they can just you know turn a corner and Bob out there I am Oh screw that's what we'll do I'm ready to go right now I'm feeling it I got specialist bonus they're like three four times every single game was like man in fact I was coming close to a new coin game actually I was worried that's like now I don't have recording going like imagine if I actually did it I think it I didn't get there is like eighteen or nineteen but it was it was close I was like oh my god am I really about to do my first nuke and it's gonna be off-camera am I really gonna do that and then I was worried that's like God if I'm like one off then I'm gonna have to hide swap my thing go to my recording software and Ryan record yeah well I didn't have to have that issue because well obviously I didn't get it so the other alternative was get the nuke instead of having to worry about not getting the last kill oh my god Guetta quit running into the shipment Oh head low enemy team Oh No one guy laid perón's I couldn't see him behind all of his friends yeah we didn't have to worry about it but I was like well maybe if I just hook oh god oh jeez you can never get used to this kind of hecticness no matter how much you play uh-huh oh yes some people quitting huh I don't blame you we already got the spawn trap going here watch I'll just watch them all spawn me up hey hi how are you guys and then we just sit right here post up I'm a horrible person I'm sorry but sometimes it really do be like that except my friends are ruining the spawn trap guys help me out of here but quit no you're ruining my spawn trip out there we go yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep okay hold on now watch can't get my feets all off in time the airspace was crowded dang it - place is still too crowded let's trying to get my VTOL out there and if we'd gotten our VTOL honest and I've never gotten juggernaut in shipment because I never have equipped but it would be hilarious and if you disagree well then you're ridiculous I mean come on I am all especially and domination every time I see juggernaut like in that spawn okay they just sit in the corner and look on the other side and then when they adjust and they never die the entire match I'm sure for the enemy team it is it's just the worst really while I am trying to make it an SMG the hipfire accuracy is leb about that but huts buh-buh-buh-buh-buh huts ironically when I was going for the camos here I leveled it all up during not mm and XP just grinded it out and the funny thing is the last challenge I actually needed to get was just the kills like I think the max is like kill a hundred enemies I had every other came out done at about 730 kills was it huh I was very efficient with the grinding okay nobody ever said it be easy oh that boy just shone right up behind my friend but it's a good thing you got me brother you got a friend in me you do do you got a friend in me I don't know the rest of the song but I probably should in it this dude he's just still Manning up on these barrels and I keep dying to him so clearly I don't learn my lesson watch this ready truck shoot it's all about the movement speed atsp it's the best I can get as far as I'm aware I've literally everything that can help 80s I guess that's not entirely true now I just can't even get out of spawn uh the compensator whatever whatever I have on the barrel for a muzzle that does reduce 80s speed everything else improves it but I've also been told 80s speed can actually cap out on certain weapons so I don't know like if I'm actually overdoing it it's hard to say god I was kind of fragmented me Kenny but these people have really uh made a turnaround really made something for themselves I got a small loan of a million dollars but do you guys are having to strap themselves from the boots up you know green green blue collar whatever yeah alright yeah it sucks when the tides returned what the fudge can i okay okay at two kills that's our first in way too long I'll take it another uh-huh they spawn right there bot what a throw don't come over here you mountain oh my god how'd you don't learn my lesson oh we almost missed that now as you all wait I still might be tol hold up get on in here and boy so yeah obviously the thing is you only really want to use this on smaller maps or like the playlist like this with [ __ ] in the shoot house because even your range and the kick is well it's nothing to laugh at nothing to scoff at it means business oh boy I don't know what you killed you Oh a proximity mine a bouncing betty oh Jesus Paul sweet Moses I'm just fireman I'm just I'm out of here actually okay reload reload you know I missed your fruit if you had sleight of hand I know I know maybe I'll take off compensator maybe and put it sure done let's see if I can manage the recoil I mean it shouldn't be that bad might not even be much of a difference just because I got a cab it's because of what I'm normally having to deal with man why couldn't I've gotten the beetle out in that life though in this very game I was about to get juggernaut now I can't even get through one sentence before I die and I'm a pretty quick talker I'm really over this I'm gonna stand right here and assert my dominance haha yeah I don't need cover I'll stand the high ground we've learned anything from obi-wan it's that that trumps all I loved you like I brought that oh look at this guy leave it holy this dude was do was just do doing I know what he was doing he trained throw me 19 thermite me I don't know but whatever he was trying for oh and when I wasn't looking the other way whatever is trying for didn't work and don't ask me why but something made me think of pizza and now I really want pizza should I eat pizza no but do I want pizza absolutely will I eat pizza possibly but do I want to undo all the work I did at the gym and stuff you know I've kind of come to terms with it it's hard to make a decision but at some point you feel alright I'm consistently working on and for the most part eat well so at what point what's my goal what's my end goal here and I think it is to be able to eat pretty much whatever I want without having to feel guilty I still feel guilty sometimes but as long as like two out of three meals every day are good and then every now and then one of them you know maybe not exactly healthy whatever and so be it I'm not gonna have the ripped by because of it just because my fat ass alula my metabolism is already pretty slow so I won't get like super cut but pizza man I don't know I like food too much to give it up that's what I'm trying to say also victory hey play up the game yeah everybody enjoy my golden ak-74 you like that don't you oh Jesus me it's me spawn camping don't look look away hey it's not what it looks like I swear yeah actually it's exactly what it looks like Oh friend hello other friend yeah it's got all this blue going on am I missing something what is that stuff that's something new to the store I don't know you kids and your microtransactions that I totally get as well you know why I've talked about this in some videos it's why I hate microtransactions cuz I'm a sucker and buying them and there's this philosophy by this I always forget his name but this like billionaire angel investor guy and always talks about the way he got rich quote unquote is by saving and cutting down money on every aspect of his life that didn't make him happy and then doubling down on the ones that did and not feeling guilty about it which might sound obvious but like me it talked about this on the podcast if you don't already listened to Gigi overeasy hey what the heck what are you doing every Sundays screaming you know maybe you got a starbucks everything at a five dollar coffee kind of ludicrous that that up over year and you look at all like it adds up you don't really think about it but it adds up get you to I won that mind game GG neared too busy thinking about casting focus up yes you need I am oh is this like eSports stuff must be you okay buddy you okay you stuck here let me help you yeah come on now yeah oh geez we're getting shot buddy I'll protect you alright new mission protect we Lynn you're not my friend it does not matter who comes next they will not slay you no no no he is my friend you are my friend my friend is gone oh you'll forever be in my heart loved you like a brother should not have shot my arrow is compromised I think there's someone above me I was right my god mr. fruit you're correct you're as cracked as concrete that's right and the roads sometimes that tax money don't seem to be doing anything there's this pothole on my way to the gym every day that I swear if I forget about for one second it will just destroy my car it's insane I don't want anything Anna fix that I keep forgetting okay so coffee point is unless that that coffee super important to you then maybe cut that out but if that is like that starts your day off right you love it's part of your routine than fine get it and don't feel guilty about it but then watch do you look at all the other aspects of your life what are some stuff you don't care about what are some things you do you have to figure that out so alright maybe I really want to spend on this coffee fine but I'm gonna cook dinner tonight that's a couple leftovers instead of eating out this time or you know I don't really need a new pair of shoes I already got a go one cut back on clothes only buy when you have to this kind of stuff it's just figuring out what you like spend money in that cutout in the rest and that way you can be happy while saving some money and for instance for me you know with like a car I don't really need anything crazy I just need something get me a to be an ideally decent for the environment as well as some good miles per gallon I was looking at full electric but I ended up recently getting a hybrid really what you got a Camry so yeah like the most economically smart choice you can make great price Toyota lasts forever like for all I know it's gonna Oh God gonna last me for it geez I don't know 10 20 30 years who really knows as long as I can take care of it that's the Toyota Way and on top of that it's hybrid it gets something like 50 miles per gallon I'm not on the highway it's insane and so for me yeah car didn't mean too much to me it's some good reliable that kind of thing but if you're into cars then you cut back on a lot of other stuff to be able to save up and make a purchase on a car you really like without it breaking you or stressing you out it's all about being able to do something and not having to like justify to sell for a or B and just being able to do it be happy because that's the number one thing in life figuring out how to be happy spoilers no one's really figured that out yet but he says he has or that's the best way he's found it is money's not into all be all but it certainly helps when you can be comfortable in your life and also double down on the stuff that makes you happy and I think it's also an important exercise to do even if you don't implement the stuff it makes you step back and kind of look at your life and you can ask those kind of questions like what does matter to me or you look at expenses you normally wouldn't be like oh wow yeah I didn't even realize that I was spending this much or this was adding up or I don't really care for this that kind of stuff and then you'll be surprised what you find sometimes so there's a mr. fruits typical tangent ranch of the video I hope you all enjoyed coming to my TED talk I should do listen to it a lot of TED Talks a lot of TED Talks some GDC talks that's what I do during either workout or cardio don't judge me okay I'm stomping around like an elephant geez Louise nice nade me it's gonna push him back oh haha you're stuck between a rock and a grenade and yeah there was no winning few video to do oh wallbang reminds me because of those outfits though the eSports I didn't watch cwl the cod World League or whatever they're calling I think it premiered this weekend or something but didn't do a very good job of promoting it especially beforehand I even know where to watch it understand to see what the competitive community thinks about modern warfare I don't have like are they digging it I know like I don't know what people's opinions are I'm also really interested to figure out what maps they use I feel like that's the most important one cuz I'd be really interested to see which maps pros like and don't like him what's in rotation cuz yeah I've never really pay attention I just know there's always some pros that are like this is the worst Call of Duty ever it's gonna kill competitive and then they still play and it's a never-ending cycle and next year they're like this is the greatest Cod and the other people are like this Cod sucks and yeah like I said the cycle of life and death for ranting along about all this kind of stuff that I think I'm doing a decent job not too shabby huh I did have someone comment or tweet recently like hey you inspired me to try a YouTube channel so I tried to like record some gameplay and commentate I have no idea how you do it are you able to form sentences while you play and I will say it is a it's an acquired skill you know the multitask like this it's not easy and that's why I think some people don't like wow you only did a little above average yeah well you try and talk about the intricacies of life and at the same time not suck in the super sweaty competitive game where I can't even hear game audio because of my talking and all this kind of stuff like yet then come and talk to me okay cuz when I first started God knows I was terrible I was just god-awful what I'd like to think I've gotten a little bit better at it definitely found my groove you know what I'm saying more or less some people like well have you and that's toxic I don't appreciate your negativity you know what today's a new day I'm gonna play the obj in hardpoint can't tell you the last time it actually I can't tell if I've ever done that and currently the objective is to kill them so they can't cap no I'm kidding I'm at I'll actually can they are definitely behind us alright I have to help my friends yeah it definitely seems cool holy sweet Moses where they coming from lay back down lela lela lela doesn't matter what's that guy's name like banana pancakes he does like just guitar and singing fantastic singer making banana pancakes Jason hold on I'm googling this I'm dying I've spun the same guy anyway Jack Johnson that's him I love him if you haven't heard Jack Johnson give him a listen you'll probably be surprised too are at some point you've heard one of the songs I checked me out playing the obj I'm gonna close this game out nobody fear but check this out first how do I I know there are some people god I know there are some people that jump on top of that forklift but I've never actually done it myself or bothered to figure out how to do it tried to learn on the fly did not go well and that did not go live and come on nine more seconds oh it's swapping in seven six I'm gonna say it's in the middle two one oh let's go mr. fruit I mean you never plays the obj rised I knew that three sure know how yeah all right somebody finished it for me well done look I got the most kills in a lot well I sincerely hope you all enjoyed this video thank you very much for giving me your time and your ears you're the best I love you and with that said I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
