hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome to Grambling Fantasy Versus if you're curious I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing here the game looked really cool it's from arc sis people who made Dragon Ball fighters II and it just released I've heard good things that's like I got I gotta try it and I am about to get destroyed I am utterly terrified but look at my wife who Catalina let's go Grand whatever protagonist my anus look at me I'm a waifu yeah that's me they really know how to make some beautiful games though oh I love you Catalina marry me I believe I'm gonna start with a projectile sir yeah Oh we clash so it's actually kind of sick I'm gonna go with a jumping attack okay we only know how to use projectiles alright this guy seems about as bad as I do douche okay so far so good now check this out your Jenny like that oh my god I kind of know what I'm doing here I'm gonna throw them Wow I think we tried to do it the exact same time how ironic now check this out sure okay and if I do this and throw the swords in oh my god I want a match is this real life Wow he's bright this now Oh chase Harris no okay wait this isn't what I yeah I'm gonna do this nope no I can't what's the right button hold on it's fire ball forward I thought would you just work alright I give up I just got to go in check it's up overhead go for the low attack oh you saw that one coming did ya well how about this I don't think so and then we're gonna go for the overhead yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to go in for the throat how are you always ready for the throat that's incredible yeah yeah good god you make me feel good about this game which which just means I hear yeah you know I'm saying check us out I think hold I'm actually gonna let myself get hurt now check this out ready if I can land this Oh actually oh wait but you didn't let me do the whole animation oh but then I go like trust in me dude and he's like no it's cool anyway I was trying to do a super essentially and you saw the first one where I throw the blades but if you do it with an extra input below 30% you get like an Omega super I'm not convinced that I'm not just playing level 0 BOTS because people can't be this bad like I'm bad what Strohm how it's done ready I'm gonna start with sure they never see that coming overhead into the combo and then oh my gosh I actually reflected that bomb put in the overhead no not falling for it good ok ok oh oh oh oh so now we know combos wow about that Wow ok good news is I don't have to test my defense if I just press forward and only go offensive brilliance mr. fruit let's try it again mm-hmm then with a projectile gonna we're gonna we're gonna fake him out here with a throw the in see this coming with the overhead and to the overhead Wow I just I just perfected them all then I'm so noble okay so these like you have to play these placement matches before it puts you online so I'm just not sure if they're actual people go fireball backwards to charge it what wait okay so you have one two huh all right well you want to test me huh Wow all right so you actually know how to oh wait what are you calling it backup for huh what do you think this is I'm gonna block but into a throw backwards throw good yeah you like that ah reflect fake it out oh I try to DP oh wait there's like a some sort of a I don't know hold on here I go and am i special I don't think it's long enough oh it's not gonna kill but this projectile certainly well yeah it just keeps spamming that Yas hey I like it you know what they're making me they're making me feel like I should know I'm doing even though I don't at all but it certainly feels good oh you like that block strings oh oh and the punished okay mister oh oh how do you do that oh you like that projectile now the anti-air and then I'm gonna go into my deep no apparently I tried to throw oh my god wow I can't believe I blocked all that honestly oh you interrupted my super wait you cave you can heal but that is not gonna save you oh my god we would early would early one would really want just hit him with there we go let's get is it don't throw this please well at least we'll get to see what it looks like to actually kind of play the game and then I'll fight actual people there is an absolutely unit dude with a giant scythe and I want so desperately to use him oh so you're immediately starting with some blocks oh I don't know what was that I missed the overhead how do I miss the overhead okay so this guy's no joke huh oh but you weren't expecting that oh I tried to throw him but evidently oh okay alright check this out okay so the AI is clearly levelled out I thought I reflected that I swear I did there we go okay do you like that oh I tried to use invincible frames but it didn't work alright here we go hmm please tell me I hit it please tell me hit it all here you go darn it why I always killed him before it goes into the cool cinematic let's go Catalina we managed let's see if he's still blocks oh he wasn't expecting this time out that did hurt though we're watching we're watching our guard here somehow managed to avoid all that faked him out with that ah oh he didn't see that coming ready I'm gonna I'm gonna Juke past him oh my god I seriously almost know what I'm doing here yeah and it feels good it feels powerful you're skirt we got yeah screw you Lancelot I'll take it while I can okay so apparently I'm halfway through my rankings said that list oh my god I can only I'm worried they're gonna be like did the students killing it put him up there in the ranks and then I'm just gonna get just boned that's a large sword for such a little girl that one hurts yourself I think she's some sort of an help that's not really important oh you like that blog though okay okay you like that dodge though I hard all I tried for the DP it didn't work we're gonna go for that though oh I did not see that guard coming oh but I'll get the guard what you're so tiny I can't even Wow why do you hurt so much okay all right oh I just need a little bit of damage and Here I am okay ready here I go please don't my head it please don't hit it oh she blocked it oh that's that's so bad I'm gonna go for the overhead wow she even saw it coming huh that's incredible I am trying really hard to get through this black wait I'm alive I just need Wow literally living on a prayer I was trying to just stay far back enough to just throw some projectiles because even if you do block you can take chip damage so in other words you could very easily die I love that open in though I think that's gonna become a staple if you love to do this weird yet that thing and I don't really appreciate it we're gonna throw though oh she wasn't seeing that coming into this wall combo Bop oh I didn't see that throw coming though I got that range on you girl ha ha Oh okay alright watch this watch this I am about to destroy her oh gosh who's gonna jump in no home Oh take this ah watch the chip damage sir I'm blocking I'm actually blocking this yo I know the CPUs or whatever I'm playing are leveling up but I'm still winning false sense of security I'm telling you what but let's go oh wait a second I think okay so I have been regs now oh boy opponent found oh boy yeah no all right we got to let the intros Rock nevermind so impatient alright fine real battle time Plus oh my gosh we actually that's incredible we did the exact same thing because apparently we have the same exact move I'm gonna up the ante er oh I thought it was I thought it was blocking okay this guy knows combos wait ah what does he Wow how do you how did you do that I just don't okay I'm gonna go for a throw that didn't work I did dodge it though oh wait we just clashed that entire thing it's that even legal can I play the game now oh yeah that's that's more like what I thought would happen oh I thought he was gonna come to me oh not today though oh oh yeah shoot okay I came to pipe you jerk oh but I block that okay well at the very least he can't perfect me so pretty excited about that overhead okay okay I'm on ahead not by lot I tried to reflect it's not where I can't okay I'm stuck in a corner can someone get what do attend chain how do you even do that well like that yeah I know you do you're a dirty girl ah okay hold on I need a DP I need the DP get me out of here it won't let me GP I'm dead oh my god this dude has combos bro like oh my god that's so sick Wow okay hey hey hey we got him below half house was it though I'm no coward though we're rematching let's go I'm gonna do it ready start the exact same way okay what why does he win these clashes though he's got that frame data unlock evidently I tried for the overhead didn't work went for a throw but he jumped just impeccable it's like he knew and I am just oh there we go now I'm playing the game no no I stopped playing the game again ah he does so much damage you know oh that's a throw okay okay I have to make the most of it well I think I got him I think I got him I didn't I'm dead I'm blocking know what okay I guess I I guess there was some recovery frames there I couldn't do anything about okay okay okay well check this out ready uh-huh I'll go back first no I definitely use my projectile first not fair Oh see the only problem is like when he gets a hit he can immediately combo in this stuff but I don't know what my combos are also that throw comes out so fast oh but now I got you ah okay that's can i DP hold on I'm trying to DP out of this bro DP out there we go what oh no I just got to survive okay oh did I get him I didn't I'm dead again aren't I oh you didn't see that coming what fudge dude that was a crazy angle he came in like a dream meteor I at least had some decent defense and offense we we came close a few times but I really need to learn combos apparently that's me oh wait a minute hey that's not cool wait a minute oh that what that was him mere matches to end all mirror matches oh but he's got like a interesting rescan blonde BAE for life oh wait what wait these Japanese oh wait I'm the recolor what is this oh you like that I'm gonna go for the ant here but didn't work so I'll go into my own oh my god it's like I know what you do but I can't stop it oh I went over that but you still punch me so I am gonna just take the absolute dick and DP out then just get destroyed reflect you went straight oh my dick to teach me your ways Wow wow you are so much better at Catalina Jesus just sounded kind of cute Japanese yeah you like that hmm oh ho just dodge that okay I I'm blocking this wow what accomplished you so much damage she immediately does how I want to do I can't even get in fourth row this is incredible this is incredible Wow IDP doubt though oh all right then they've already won 16 online games f10 yet let me just be the first to say if he's my same rank then I am in the wrong rank [Music]
