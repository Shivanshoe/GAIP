oh bill you took the kill one best kill for the rest of my life i want to be a warlock i finally got him with my that was pretty cool heidi ho everyone my name is mr root and welcome to destiny 2 welcome back i mean welcome to the new season of destiny 2. we're talking season of the haunted baby what is this i actually haven't looked at the uh battle pass oops whoa okay you know that's that's pretty sick oh and one false step an important ornament because that's what we're gonna be checking out today and well not the ornament but the traveler's chosen with it being the brand new season exotic i'm sure all of you are bursting at the seams to know is it good even though most of you have probably have gotten it because of the season pass but maybe i know something you don't okay probably not i'm doing a good job of selling myself here that's not important i don't gotta sell nothing cause it's the trespasser just gotta shoot him because he's trespassing get it it's a joke a d1 exotic that has made its return it was funny because i started seeing comments popping up on an old destiny 1 videos like what what is this and it was my super old trespasser exotic video and everyone's like uh i don't know it started getting recommended and it's come to destiny too so i came to check it out and man i've come a long way watched it and felt many twinges of cringe we've got one bull left make it count super burst but but anyway unrepentant reloading after defeating a target causes the next person to be a longer more powerful superpower uh full board i'm rigging around smooth grip be the danger find the blows with unrepentant super bursts sorry super bar spar automatically reel your weapon and provide an unrepentant superpower so if you're catching the draft it's all about the super you know the drill we hop into the crucible we see how it goes the funny thing too is yeah i'm getting asked like oh well how does it feel compared to destiny one oh doesn't it bring back memories no no not really i don't think i used it that much yeah so oh and let's not forget brand new sewer 3.0 to be honest there's like titans kind of got the least interesting stuff but that's okay i do get uh trip mines now i don't know if that's should i do like a healing grenade i don't know i can do other things so this is pretty cool admittedly consecration is pretty cool you slide and then you uppercut with your two hammers and you slam with the two hammers but yeah that's about it so now what's that ship down there it's so it's so tiny a little itty bitty ship can't tell if it's perspective but it does seem alarmingly small it's like a flying coffin did we get a new crucible match no or map i don't think so no i think they teased it but that's not coming until like next season or something you know it's only been like two and a half three years or something not even just a new pvp map but you know whatever neither here nor there it's time for the trespasser where where um where is the um where's the enemy beat does it there is someone over oh there is somebody over oh he's trying to snipe me okay well that is a bit of a problem because um i have a sidearm and that's what i'm saying okay well i use my trip mine now check this out hopefully you weren't looking hopefully you blinked i was gonna do okay we're not going to call it the bubba i'm not going to yell bop babushka when i do it please god no okay i don't need this what am i doing i'm here for the the trespasser [Music] please free me from this prison all right focus up focus up hey let's get some trespasser kills up in here huh shake it off oil cold maybe not the warmest okay ready super burst mark sparrow but i need to find somebody oh my god you oh what a sick drummer i've always loved trip mines now what if we played a little game where i kill you i get a super burst burst spurs push and i miss it okay okay where'd you go you invisible huh i can't see i can't see penis i wouldn't want to in the first place but yeah i guess we just queued up against a whole bunch of stacks and so my team's like um no we quit because you're a bunch of quitters i don't care the excuse you fight through the guardian i'm sitting here using the trespass ah it's okay there's they travel in packs i'll do the same a b-man i'm with you yes super burst bruh here i go here i go here i'm gonna give super skill let me get a super skill we didn't didn't quite get one but we got another super burst okay it's really really difficult to do that apparently oh bill you took the kill i wish my melee for that it was it looked cool i was like oh shoot this in my moment i gotta reload they're spawning up they're spawning everywhere what is going on here stop it oh my super power that's the name of the game here okay well did not hit much much of that now did we okay you go in there dude it's just it's just the fusion rifle you're gonna be fine he's dead okay superb here we go here i go ah ah super first hurts i've got to dig the trash out check that out what an angle didn't activate okay with thorn huh so we're out here poisoning okay okay and i he was behind you wait wow hip hip zippity bippity boppity i don't want to die wait i can't there's there is too many of them okay there's only so many bus as the man can get like cheese so it seems like if i do want to get a kill with the super boost i can't see like i was in jurassic park and that thing spin on me you know like no no no what's the password or whatever i think all the guys i can't see nothing and he's like slowly going blind you know what core memory locked right there but yeah uh i think if you want to get a kill with the supers you are going to have to get all hey shoot this okay i'm going to super burst the super it worked it does kind of sick yo just just hold up my dude wait why am i in bernie mall oh my god i'm trolling i'm actually trolling burning more go god it's so bad it didn't get changed at all because it definitely didn't need help oh wait it did all right strong it's fine yeah we haven't been mercy because we stayed strong guardians or something like that some sort of crucible vanguard propaganda you know you know how it is you know how they built right weekly cleaning grams wow i would yeah watch out for that not a super burst you took the kill but that's so cute that's all right it's okay does not matter anyway i'm gonna kill trespasser maybe not as super burst probably not gonna kill them at all you gotta get headshots all headshots okay ready this is it this is the superverse kill i've been waiting for and to be fair i do have sunspot yo i have one second that oh god okay it doesn't it's it's fine literally like it well okay so maybe you don't always get the refill on it but you know oh my god what was happening to my shots check it out you may not always get kills with the super bursts itself but what it does is it sets up a kill because you usually do a giant chunk of their health that's is that our okay that's our nade good that's all that matters would not matter okay if you guys would first stop stop taking my kills secondly um some range on this this thing wouldn't i'm dead yep yeah i know some people use sidearms and there are certain players and content creators who just pop off with it looking at like you hold on i'm gonna get a superverse kill no i'm not what is happening i don't i don't know i don't i know true vanguard has like 80 000 kills at the travelers chosen he's a freak okay and if you like sidearms you're a masochist and you're also lying to yourself i don't know what else to tell you okay it's time for the super burst first okay maybe you can't even get it with all headshots what what the fudge was that but we got okay super burst first oh my god wait oh it was it was at the end but it was popping off we we killed with the super thing and it com it instantly reloaded with another one and then we killed him with a burst again and then the match ended well look at that look at me look at me on the team you know i with all things considered i was still on my own i think that's you know something am i am i ready for a rumble game no no i don't think so i think i think we stick to control oh my woof yes you want to commentate this video huh i'll let you go home you guys like my armor by the way it's freaking sick it's a new everest armor so you know sad should probably have to wait for like a bright dust but i it's honestly like some of my favorite armor i just i had i had to i cared and i'm sorry oh god grisly gustling guardian what's the guardian going oh shoot he's guzzling some places yo i just kind of noticed that i kind of like that it's a it's a weird a very weird ridicule but i kind of like it kind of down for kind of here for it uh what are we doing here i should really take off the tripwire because it's do it oh i i hurt somebody change it you know let's go with a healing mate that sounds fun yeah that's new we like new things which speaking of which they like changed the inner accuracy and i tried to okay i just kind of want to eat in there though with uh with my sauce okay you please get out of the way okay or i'll just yeah oh great he freaking roy mustang me dude i want to be a warlock warlock's got like they they literally flick and they shoot out fireballs now hunters send out ash dynamite they can shoot and explode and like yeah i guess my knock-up thing's kind of cool man like the rest of my thing nothing changed you know where the love for the titans it because jesus christ okay [Music] you know what glizzy guzzling guardian probably knows what he's doing right with a name like that he's gotta know what a thing or two about guzzling down something i am pushing with you i tried to take that kill i was unsuccessful okay super wait what what happened to my super burst you're pathetic it doesn't even deserve the echo just that dick buzz i i got a kill i reloaded and what is that thing what the i don't know okay wait superverse super burst first first push ah man i got a kid i got again nina obviously i died no other way to put that uh put those two cents together or something i don't know what a phrase to be oh kill superb can we get like a superverse count going ah [ __ ] oh my god i'm the worst that's a healing nick what oh restoration oh the restoration times two what a guy what a guy with a pound you've been healing me i'm healing you we're uh we're dead like like see this is a trespass but are we sure it is because i don't feel against okay but i have soul invictus for three two not much longer all right if i scared you there i scared myself that's my bad i was quite guttural and in primal came out of nowhere oh restoration i love that stuff yeah really holy [ __ ] i don't like that skirt okay where they at though are you where the where the guardians at where they at though no don't take i'm trying to get a super burst brother oh my god that's a healing name again oh my god okay this is we're gonna have to figure something out here because guys guys yeah oh i finally got him with my that was pretty cool all right look at there's no shot i'm hitting anything lying to myself at that point okay okay running on the ground especially hey team team entire enemy team by the way so um share my name say my name while you're praying please help me i keep trying to heal the enemy with my grenades so i was gonna say jesus can we just okay super that's it that's a super super don't know how people now granted you know most people using something like this would use the rest of their kit but but hey like we've always done when i'm doing a video on a gun it's that gun and bust okay wait wait wait once you start eating though once you start eating you kind of just eaten hold on super super super super something super okay figure if i keep saying it give it in you know some sort of it'll help me out let's see what else has some oomph oh i'll show you boy baby lock them doors and turn the lights down low baby we ain't got no place to go oh my god it kind of worked oh baby a triple did you hurt him at all no and he has a super burst see i know not everybody knows their matchups but in uh in a duel friendship does beat super bursts that is cannon when do i want to pop my super i wonder i don't know maybe after i use this super boss super it doesn't count i just kind of expected the burst to kill so i didn't shoot again if i'd probably tap the trigger game would be fine but nope that's that's still it's still a healing night it's been forever literally all of destiny thinking grenade does damage and now one pvp match i'm like oh yeah uh now it heals it's not that hard to remember stupid triple play play play where's the quadra use this to extend the duration a little bit oh fudge oh we traded somehow uh okay he flew over that didn't he oh she does look cool but it's also very committal and i guess it's not really pvp thing but the freaking the roy mustang fire flick thing give me all that hey yo take that healing i don't know there's lots of you and somehow through all of that i'm the only one to die i'm trying to help i'm trying to help you guys doing great you're just going so good you guys doing so restoration one last kill one bad skill for the rest of my life i can't hit it one last he's dead well i guess i just don't get another kill for the rest of my life ah what was it basing it off of oh efficiency because i got second most kills on the team yeah that's not bad but i died a lot can we really blame myself when you gotta unga bunga with a sidearm because anything past you know aby's dick is is out of your range what else am i gonna do can't hold back i gotta hold w now sure you can make an argument that i do that for everything i always hold w and you would be right yes there you have it ladies and gentlemen quick and dirty travelers chosen initial thoughts interesting pve promise pvp to be seen but a rating super burst by space first out of ten [Music] [Music] you
