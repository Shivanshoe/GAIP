my life easy look at me at 436 you're carrying us the backbone of this team right well i think we just let the ball sit for a minute and a half so we can just you know get to the next one oh no they're just now they're holding up hostage boosting my stats though making me feel a little bit better about myself that's a sick touch the way you like mind controlled him that wasn't in the game when i played all the plan too much simpler times i missed all right no that's fine it's fine it's the pawn i'll send her in there you go oh wow these kids just they've given up they have absolutely given up what made you think that i think it's the 8-0 score or the fact that they're literally scoring for us but it's still up in the air look at me i got like default tag and everything that's embarrassing it's the only way they can score those on themselves right old chip oh oh that's going right in oh i said but got the british accent though have you ever have you seen that uh let's show on apple tv ted lasso that's where you got to learn everything it's like jason's dagus he's like the american he's like a football coach from america oh wow oh my god yeah otherwise this is what i said get out i said bob got my way and i said no no that's also mine i mean if we keep this up this game's gonna last like 20 minutes right we should all right we're just gonna we're gonna kill time
