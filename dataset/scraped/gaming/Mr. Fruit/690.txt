hi 80 homes won money mr. fruit and welcome back to destiny - I changed my shader okay I'm no longer cosplaying as mr. clean do you notice something behind me well well well finally time for the ritual iron banner weapon point of the stag this is what our new bow friend looks like regularly and this is what it looks like with the ornament watch app it's got mines in order to obtain this bow you have to play more iron banner than anybody should we have elastic string with excellent snapback natural fletching feather light with good control you can choose between no distractions aiming this weapon for short period is nice lunch or archers tempo draw time decreases after every precision we have vorpal weapon increased damage against bosses vehicles and Guardians with a super active or I the storm this weapon becomes more accurate in boost Hanlin as your health gets lower it also comes with master worked accuracy and better stuff out there I'm not gonna lie to you not gonna sugarcoat this ok but you can do it just think about it if mr. fruit can do it you can do it I'll even prove it to you by hey I'm putting my playing another iron banner man it's real grinder hours Bob you don't play dumb you know I actually figured out why they call this endless Vale because I analyst Lee get this I'm not kidding you this is my fifth game in a row in iron banner on this map how many maps are there in the game why do I have to whatever it's time to use the stag thing I'll be honest I don't completely the point of the stag ok I'm just I'm just a potato right now the draw time is miserable you got hero in yourself son it is a precision frame which means we need to draw behind cover wait until it's ready and then lose I'm gonna die I could use some heavy don't you take the heavy without me oh thank you I have a bounty to kill a guardian with a linear fusion rifle step 1 find an enemy guardian step 2 miss step I'm running I'm terrible I'm running oh oh there we go freakin nailed it freakin why aren't you dead wait what okay I'll use my bow and I got an assist watch this ready - bang that's bang through the door oh wait they're already off of it well done team

don't want shot you just can't have that happen thanks for the bro I need to turn down my since I am like I I don't know man aims all over the place mr. fruit you're the problem right now could be the worst gun in the world but yeah any guns gonna suck if you can't hit hmm oh my god what am i doing right now what am i doing just die just die okay I have knockout let's see how much extra damage I do here okay all I know how to do is press the melee button oh come all ye faithful but you must hit your siya hearts flashbang through the door okay well there's a hit thank God but still looks like Oh would you leave that oh there's a kill okay mr. fruit go on son go on we're finally doing something Oh I spoke too soon I spoke too soon just always in a singing mood man can't help it oh hey I'll take your trades at the end of the day guess what that counts as a final blow for the quests just means I'm that much closer you mean done I'm fine using this a normal crucible it's just I don't really want to I don't really want to mess with this in iron ban are you no I'm saying brother oh that's some good damage oh oh push that push that push that I made it out of clay no this is mine this is mine hahaha what I say mister you don't need to charge this all the way skirt you were out of your bubble brah you had a bubble and you left your safe spot your safe space it's a firing squad should be duped boo boo boo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo at least I had something to play for this iron banner that helped Oh a nother final blow holy Hector's we might have this bovine a blow thing done sooner rather than later never mind the fact though that I have to play like 8 million more games of iron banner to just get to the next step oh we won well done I am so proud of you guys stabber a rumble test this Lobby is about being for a rude awakening they're probably expecting some insane sweaty loadouts from everybody and everybody else perhaps but me no uh okay I'm getting flanked from every which way all right that's not really cool guys you don't have to team up on me I can hardly 1v1 with this thing okay if you want me to want V to just exit stage right please always weak he's weak mr. fruit Oh somebody else took the kill what do you know he's got a shotgun oh nice little flick to the dome ski now I'm a hundred percent dadier I need to I need to hide oh I'm in so much pain la la la la la la la Elmo's World no no no no no what oh my benders his phone and air to wrack there oh why did my arrow not like I didn't fully do it the whole way cuz I don't know I'm trying brother haha gotcha oh my god he's not in plane mr. fruit please okay oh my god I'm cracked and why is my benders like this dude is this fun for you I have a bow please pity me coming yeah okay okay okay I have knockout so I do increased damage and I can figure out just how much increased damage that would do if I could hit something for the life of me which I cannot so oh my god I gotta kill this is incredibly I'm doing it I'm really doing it that's a mind bender you know what I'm practicing social distancing IRL but time we do it in-game as well I'm gonna need you all that oh oh no I thought about actually actually getting a kill but then I was like no no no no oh my god wait this charge is so much faster than I thought nice crowd shot dude let's see so what you're uh you're crouched shouting Mindbenders ambition user so pretty much the the PvP base as a whole cool cool cool and that's look look at with my heavy machine gun you're why I have trust issues I'm doing it to myself how am I supposed to succeed with my bow well I'm not really supposed to is the problem but I try anyway American destiny one when skill based matchmaking wasn't a thing I could actually use random loadouts and see some success but now now I get punished you use the meta or you die oh no I'm talking about haha screw you says the wolf I don't know who the wolf is oh my god in that guy okay hey that's two kills with a boat Oh mr. fruit go on son sometimes words just spew from my mouth like poop from a butthole see I rest my case but anyway sometimes it just comes out I don't really understand what it says yeah we [Music] the zombies from plants vs. zombies oh Jesus yeah I'm dead well we had fun didn't we gosh oh my god wait I escaped his tether you will not some prison me come on down 11 kills he only needs one I can do this I will do this I got one okay ten more let's do this probably get all those with just this super okay game over nevermind thought using an accent what hell yes man I'm actually headed in the iron banner again look I got to complete this quest one way or another so might as well be double whammy while we we touched out the bone oh we joined a game in progress I'm actually not too upset about this because that means the game will be over soon and right now I really just need matches complete so yeah have a win-win for us here oh and that's a win what you son of a well played I know I've mentioned this before and so several other people why do I not get some sort of super energy or something though for joining a game late there's no reason everyone should have the super and I get punished because you decided to put me into a game and I can't hit a dude I'm just a potato right now look dude I haven't used bows in a while okay can you tell yes you can I know I know it a rhetorical question I'm trying bro I'm trying but like oh I killed him in a super sure why not Oh miss that oh I hit that but yeah just sold bombed it's precision frame I'm not a I'm not a big precision frame it's like it's like all my oh oh go on son it's pretty funny with any gun one kill I sleep with the bow one kill I woke just like this isn't saying oh my god I got a kill I'm the greatest player that there ever was bro I think I'm liking just accounting for way too much drop or something I don't know I was play war zone last night I'll tribute it to that it's not true at all I'm just letting down the medieval lover that I am if I can't use a bow I'm a disgrace Oh get embarrassed hold on if yeah okay okay all right this is going well why am I still burning what the fudge is still burning oh my god hundred eighty four to the dome though knockout almost actually worth it but yeah it's still not a one shot so not really that would be pretty nutty if I could combine it with knockout or like a sunspot or something and just one shot people then we might be in my band business Bob right now that would be a that'd be great because well it's a tough market the Dow is falling as we all know you know times are desperate around here screw you oh god I can't even hit shotgun shots oh yeah but I can melee no we lost so on for priming grant must keep going quest almost done don't don't do Tito Tito oh I didn't realize yeah last thing was iron banner and what did I play again friggin forgetting let's rail although this is a new map so this is uh this is new sorry you tagged me from how far away yeah after out reviewing the footage it determines that you're a liar there's no way I should have gotten tanked hey let me count that flag thanks kids hey let's go get your and I need that flag too all right I'm hop am ba okay what ba okay and Oh God Jesus what I'm just I'm terrible they saying no reason I was on the sub class was for knockout because I thought it might use but now I know it doesn't one Ches what am i doing also don't you did toaster get off a toaster toaster well I didn't mean like like that like completely reset it like help me out here brother watch this watch this I'm insane I'm insane dude read that guy like a book where's his friend huh where's his friend whatever doesn't matter I'm gonna cap a wow that actually I'm alive incredible and I came away alive granted one of the kills was a shotgun so does it really count mr. fruit well I suppose we should ask the board of committees because I don't know who the board of committees are and they don't know the criteria for counting what constitutes working out with the bow or not if you know how many kills do we need per frag you know I'm sagres just a lot of variables here why does it take so long to register bowheads like I shot that dude in the dome a while ago oh oh that body got you dude oh the ion hunt wolf heart the hunt is on is what I meant to say that them bears these kids with a bow give flashbang he's blowing oh it's too late to change my subclass but I should have could have and I would have ooh we got a little precision thing going here okay go on son go on I was about to whack him so hard our team is dominating let's us mercy them so that we can move on to the next right how does he get his super to my discipline stat is just straight up garbage I can be top Fragger by a mile you really didn't die oh ho but night it but I'll be a top Fragger by a clear mile and I'll just what yeah sweet Jesus 27 yeah if I get one more tear goes down by 43 seconds oh god I need more employer I could be getting so many more free kills but instead you say you Juke guys guys it's stopped I I need I register this gameis I hit him like point blame I mean I don't think down there oh my god point black sucks too because for the last pinnacle quest I need to get ability kills but guess what if I'm not getting my super kills well it's gonna take quite a bit oh we were just weep we are going in now I mean never mind the fact that it's like all team shouting but I am also assisting my team yo let's cap this lock him out and win this game even faster that's right bag it up buddy Batman bag it up okay they did cast a super which is mildly terrifying but check it oh my god okay I'm gonna hide under here five minutes left okay three two one we're good we're good what happened to their super did he just like where'd he go oh I thought that was a friendly tethered because I'm a detriment ye right well there's an ability kill we'll take it where we can get it right now it's the only place I can get it captured oh my gosh mister fruits staring a kill down and I'm like you know what I don't really I'm not really feeling it dad I don't see you're not my dad dad wait yes you are cuz you're my dad oh hey I can use a shotgun haha we won well played team well play well for those of you with the too long didn't watch and somehow you skipped right to the very end to somehow see my micro review it's a bow it behaves how about does in PvP so that's up for your interpretation [Music]
