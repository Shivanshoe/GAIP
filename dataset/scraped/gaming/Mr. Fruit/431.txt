hi edie hello everyone my name is mr vert and welcome back to destiny 2 and what is that the hawkmoon is back that's right memes never die my friends i've been told by the kids these days it's uh pardon me but uh rather lit get is it i'm in the is it i'm on i'm on fire so yeah that's the deal i'm here trying to get the hawkmoon because i don't yet have the hawkman so that when i get the hawkmoon i can make a video on said hawkmoon arkham inception am i right as you'll see here i'm on the last step but it's a painful step defeat champions or defeat guardians in gambit and crucible matches i have decided to defeat guardians rather than champions and apparently i need about 200 of them but there's a slight problem about being cool and then fire is you got to listen to this dude brand bonding anyway shut up so i'm almost 20 so i got a ways to go but together you and i can get this done so to the shut up salad you ruined it you ruined it it's over dude look we're playing mayhem because it's short matches probably the quickest way to get kills i don't know and that's right i could have done a review on the hawkmoon but instead i foregoed the opportunity to get it on my own account and show you guys on my own account because otherwise you guys always they always make fun of me [Music] also i gotta tell you oh geez i have this mega ulcer in my mouth bottom like right underneath my lip right side of my lip which is just the worst because i just got over a jahuba ulcer on the left side and then literally just mirrored this one showed up as soon as the other left and so i'm just in constant pain and suffering i'll see you guys don't have to lie my guardian do be looking kind of sick right and you guessed it we'll be using the thunder crash it's the most sure-shot way of one-shotting supers you know if i go like cameras and stuff and other people it's not likelihood but this one i just a good day to everyone that what oh there's a titan brother i was gonna say good good day to everyone that's accept hunters and like our whole team is hunters so it's not that i have anything against hunters it's just well i guess i have something against hunters now leave
