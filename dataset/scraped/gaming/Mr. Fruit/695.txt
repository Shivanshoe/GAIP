I'm doing it let me just let me just there we go all right just watch over me you guys here we go here we go I'm a better soldier I'm the better soldier ha ha ha ha I really am what a turnaround screw you let's go hi a top-1 my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to overwatch it has been well a really long time but it's the best time in overwatch new hero time echo to be specific now since Blizzcon and the overwatch 2 announcement we knew echo was coming we just didn't know when well bada-bing about a boomer who she is she seems pretty nutty but we'll see if she's nutty in my hands that's just something about that just doesn't sound right her main fire try shot fires three shots at once in a triangle pattern her alternate fire sticky bombs fire a volley of sticky bombs that detonate after delay her first ability flight fly forward quickly and then free fly briefly her second ability focusing beam channel a beam for a few seconds deals very high damage to targets under half health and in her ultimate as things nutty duplicate become a copy of a targeted enemy hero they cannot swap heroes for the duration now what it doesn't say during this is while your duplicated you have a 650 percent increase all charge and it lasts 15 seconds yeah alright what skin to choose okay we got classic classic you know I'm thinking classic oh my gosh I got a pocket mercy we're gonna wait now all I have to do is hit my shot solo all right I'm gonna set up a little here you ready for this yes right okay okay I don't want to be stunned McCree stay over there but they don't expect me to come back and do they yeah I'm gonna get oh oh wait I was pretty much just an assist okay check this out though if we can crack this I'm gonna use my beam for action okay he put his shield down what the heck did no we're sticking Roadhog though oh you like that Lita strafe this is insane you know I've gone from the game but you wouldn't even know you would not even know I'm gonna I'm gonna break your shield come on put it up boy alright I gotta find their healer there she is yeah I'll leave that all right focus down then I'm gonna come from behind oh my gosh wonderful sights I can see clearly now come to me mercy I won't let you die okay but this is kind of terrifying tomb mmm check this out check this out now I'm Reinhardt's huge no I will get in stop pushing me won't let me play the game ya ever tower yeah like that huge good dog oh wait no oh you gotta be that's tragic it's good try could we get a quick replay there Bob I was charging him about to pan him he was surely going to die but my hologram duplication thing ran out at the last second so instead of pinning them nothing but well played to them I was about to just start wrecking with Reinhard but instead they just cc'd me for days so I could not take full advantage of it see how well play skirt yeah give me that free damage uh-huh uh-huh yo mercy mercy girls call sick what you doing what you doing girl what is he doing bebe you are so lost no I'm good okay that didn't even come remotely close who do I shoot do I do I go for mercy they're stunned I think I don't know it's working though I'm gonna use my beam oh my gosh get melted I'm coming mercy get out of there girl yeah come to me screw you Reaper oh my god oh my god mr. fruit you're actually killing him oh oh he got his thing right back in time tragic but it won't be too tragic cuz check this out and one second I think I stuck the oh oh I did I stuck soldier which means I can duplicate here as soon as I kill him okay I feel like going for a tank is the play but I think I'm gonna go for Reaper because they have so many tanks come here Reaper come here but let me choose you Reaper here we go no you're gonna die cuz check this out will you let me why can't I there we go Knight died died died - oh wait I let him cap it though it's about to run out okay it ran out now I run away darn it okay well we tried okay buddy I got your back I got to get the wreck oh oh and I'll get her I almost have yes I am the undefeatable demon king I'm dead here but I said I am the greater echo echo echo echo that duplication is way too much fun a lot of strategy behind it - you think either okay which is the best old or which is the best countered their team using their own cop against them just massive brain you know I'm saying which is just the perfect kind of character for me because that's who I am big brain mr. fruit oh oh my god get sniped I even helped kill someone else oh this is incur a Blair in crab lair wait a minute there mercy my puppy is on my headphones get poppy I can't I can't ah sorry team papa was a having a little fun with my headset cord so I bad timing I was about to have my ol we could have popped off but now I'm just gonna sit in this doorway take a fat look and probably okay see Oh fine you know what let's let's monkey up here let's freakin I'm the best Winston ready for this oh yeah yeah yeah what up now yeah where'd Winston come from it's me your friend but oh wait I'm not okay but now I gotta go okay we had our fun and I have to try and kill echo if I can get her below half we're gonna all we're in I lady we're in aisle 8 anyway okay oh not on my watch I stuck in with all those that's huge damage Moira next what more right you're not getting away mmm Oh Mike all right I found my main wait there's someone in here stagger them even harder yeah Allport merci what you doing over there echo this is too good all right we got to get on Winston here or better yet Moira oh my god seriously if they're below half health the damage just starts rolling in this is insanity it Winston with some of those bumps or miss Alphin oh but he's just weak overall oh now he's not well played well played but I almost have my old so the question is no no don't kill my team all right fine I'll show you who's dying die die die die Wow they immediately killed my Reaper okay well whoops so I mean obviously a tank would be the safest play here nice rez although we're kind of bone here anyway Oh nope I couldn't get away in time I seriously think the biggest skill gap though not even necessarily aim which I mean obviously that's biggest skill gap in any FPS but knowing when and half of who to old and when did oh man it's hurting my brain just thinking about it I'm trying to figure out who does who to stick we're gonna go I'm mercy and I I'm messing this all up oh Jesus okay I'm going in I'm go come here boy you're not escaping me okay so I think it's my bad my team is not very aggressive and I'm literally won't be sick see all right okay I'm ready now oh I'm ready ah hold on hold on did I just who did I steal oh oh god I can't even well there goes my my old god that's sucks but that's okay it's okay it's okay it's not okay I'm dead so it's not I tried to grab one of the tanks don't ask me how I grabbed Reaper the tough out though I really like that animation though because you can see freeze-frame it's actually just like a projector for the face you should a wife in material don't worry about it oh I'm having fun with her though but she has like almost no defensive capabilities but this is the best thing setup those bombs mmm like taking the high ground here it's always a good idea hello hello where are you I'll go for that echo go for that echo I'm on the back line I'm on the back I'm on mercy Oh Mike Mercy's deleted I'm just gonna rain death from above that's what I'm gonna do oh speaking of which death has been range okay okay I'm gonna destroy Deva probably overkill but with mini diva stick her a couple times yeah that was so sick hammer to actually hit him into the back line with my bombs on him you're not getting away from me yes you are oh my soldier but soldier okay but soldier nothing yeah stupid more friggin healing up man what you think you're doing huh man these projectiles are even slower and I thought Oh soldiers probably good pic though hitscan against me but it's not gonna save you I'll tell you that much I don't I thought he was gonna die all right break the shield here get up okay that's not good I'll have my old here in a second oh oh I'm a steal your bomb come here girl come here skirt oh wait did I just throw the bomb away oh wait but I get a get a mech back too can I get another bomb I'm going for another bomb I don't care I'm doing it nope I can't no wait what are you doing hiding over here Reinhardt you are a long way from home oh great slam way a jam and they're dead so no point oh I think I stuck them with a couple bombs though that's so good good chip damage good old builder also builds healers old blood you know you win some you lose some don't you oh my god oh oh I'm a group harder except it's except my team didn't okay see I'm pressing W about my teammate can you blame me about what they debated me he liked putting on a boost eyes like guys what if we just leave him alone like booze he's gonna be like I could do this and he's gonna die that's a guy rabbit Oh soldier Oh soldier you're so dead you've got who in your sights as far as I can tell you got nobody screw you Reinhardt oh my god dude this is this is actually this is Incred get out of the way I can't the freakin top of the proof kept bonk in my head on the top of the finger I couldn't get away I kept flying all right let's see who we want to copy Reinhard or solider seems like a really good idea here in fact I agree so much that's exactly what I'm gonna do hammer down and I'm just gonna keep going oh you're like oh good thing we avoided his open oh wait you just killed me okay I was gonna say I'll alt again the end oh they they killed me i'ma just destroy soldier come on Moira oh you want to go mercy you wanna go I can't hit my primary fire for the life of me but that's that's fine right guys I I don't need to be able to do that right okay mercy why are you so you're so agile it's a whole mic I just start melting though I just it just starts and then I can't help but but just continue the carnage darn it oh the rest though res I will protect you kill off she got the rest oh that's not good - that's not good ah okay escape because now doosh doosh doosh yeah he did it again gosh dang it okay yeah oh but I almost got it again another one yes pinned oh and you're at home row I've played overwatch characters unreleased sometimes and sometimes don't okay but right now this is my character I mean I literally haven't touched this game seriously and well god only knows here and a half I only come back for new characters but this one might convince me to stay around I totally thought EKKO is gonna be some sort of a support though so this is a pleasant surprise to say the least we're gonna go ahead hop up just get a little bit of chip damage where we can if I can fight oh oh god oh my god wait where's Winston and why is he hurting so much of the heck oh there is die Winstead well first off you're gonna have to stop jumping around so much sir that should break his bubble nope okay jebaited and he's coming for me I couldn't get over the ledge it's hard to do much of anything against Winston if he jumps on me I only have a little bit of a chance if I can stay in the air and the diva can eat my projectiles and stuff sold your hits can well obviously that's gonna be good just have to not fly as much I suppose oh you're dead and there's a Winston he's gonna be a very upset e spaghetti very upset e spaghetti as you can tell your sir you need to you need to calm down Winston you know how you get when you don't have food in the old stomach oh no oh hey guys you can hurt yourself with your own oh my god what a forehead play was gonna kill him with the bombs but they woke him up so I was like alright fine I'll chase him he puts up a bubble I kill myself like what I could not have gone worse alright Sigma though I'll take you down never mind you're just getting off my god well you're kind of getting absolutely shut down if I'm being honest with you oh that's not good though oh that would be fun getting Sigma's thing all the time like that there we go there we go there we go alright somebody get this monkey off of me I mean let me start to burn him oh you don't like that he does not like that no okay I don't really have a way to escape T puzzled or what I should say rather is flying up is never the answer mister fruit you know what I'm going to I'm doing it let me just let me just there we go alright just watch over me you guys here we go here we go I'm a better soldier I'm the better soldier ah ha ha ha ha I really am what a turnaround screw you let's go oh my god Oh lunch team kill coming out of Soldier 76 but wait a minute folks we got bamboozled it was actually echo prediction on those bombs not a lot happening there nice have to worry when when a soldier gonna get his alt back and what is Winston doing over there Winston buddy God your shield is really just a mood killer oh I'm not letting you go away come here yeah whoa I chase you down like the degenerate I am now check out this flank hold on hold on they don't know they don't know she doesn't know that's bad that's so bad oh no oh no oh I've been danger chuckles aah ok screw you nice sleep nice sleep I didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have but the bombs the Splash Damage the Winston oh wait oh wait what okay we could have saved that but okay okay let me see if I can pick somebody off here probably not no okay call me crazy soldier normally can't get up here so I think I'm gonna go soldier oh okay that's fine I'm gonna go soldier take his alt from up here they don't have diva bomb so this is good as long as they don't immediately know where I am don't get slept don't get slept I need to do damage to I okay fudge but he's got us in his sights I can't beat everyone oh okay okay I got the soldier guys I got the soldier just focus the monkey oh wait who didn't who did she just choose oh we have a soldier - that's that's a new development I can't get any healing and I'm not blaming my team it's just gonna make this a little more difficult I'm trying I'm trying team the bombs all the Reds this is this is too much for my little heart uh uh screw you Winston the bubbles the damage was freakin jiva Winston screw all these tanks did we see nine wait no we won oh oh my gosh and I gotta tell you I can't remember the last time I had fun in overwatch Bosco play the game it's echo but it's soldier but it's not important look at this oh my gosh just exactly the play we needed this is insane I even switch back to my Noma form to get a little kill there mmm cool that's echo eighties and gentlemen well shoot now I got to see what skin she's got I got to get some comments to get gold
