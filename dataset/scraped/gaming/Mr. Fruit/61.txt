i smell blood in the water no it's so does he i'm enhanced because i'm perpetually in motion i can't keep up just a little bit more range man like it's all i'm asking for heidi hello everyone my name is mr root and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video we're finally taking it oh congrats on the ascendant alloy buddy you probably just bought it from rahul but either way hey proud of you that's kind of what i was about to say with witch queen came weapon crafting and with weapon crafting comes well essentially any curated quote unquote god roll you why i said quote unquote god roll because it's whatever you want to make so you can see here i have three well i have like four and five six it's not seven i have a lot of crafted weapons here right now but thanks to the brand new update and wellspring drops boosted rebuffed finally got the come to pass auto rifle so i'm very close to finally getting the exotic glave now but that's not why we're here we're here to check out the forensic nightmare craftable submachine gun my favorite thing about all these throne world weapons are the designs but specifically because they take shaders so well look at this it's exquisite and you can't argue with me otherwise because i will just refuse to listen to what you have to say be extremely close-minded and we'll get nothing done achieve nothing we'll go nowhere because i can't hear you la la la la i'm not listening uh we got across grip yeah i could do a whole bunch maybe counterbalance maybe freaking sprint grip maybe freaking freaking mod you know whatever dude whatever i want we have your hammer forged rifling for increased range ricochet rounds for increased range here we go baby enhance trait this is what crafting gets you to do and you're able to do as you level up the weapon you're then able to craft enhanced traits of the regular traits you can usually find on the gun so in this case we have perpetual motion enhanced the swapping gains bonus stability handling and reload speed while the wheeler is in motion for short duration what does the enhanced trait do i don't actually know i'm assuming that you just get more stability handling and reload speed i'm not sure but that's that's not the point kill clip i could have put enhanced kill clip in here but the thing is uh it's freaking expensive to make enhanced perks so without knowing how much i was going to like the role i figured hey i'll just put kill clip on i know if i wanted to make a pve roll i think i'll put on perpetual motion no matter what but i think honestly if i was going pve i'd probably put on like headstone for a stasis build that sounds fun of course it has the psychohack origins rate go ahead and put on the crucible tracker because i'm taking it in the crucible and i added precision frame giving it 10 extra range and if you're curious i'm using pirated clash for the shader so i've actually been holding on to this submachine gun for a while i leveled it up a long time ago but i could not get ascendant alloys for the life of me but since they again patched it gave rahul the ability to actually sell them again i figured hey i can finally do this so here i am so let's not delay up into the crucible today i also don't know what exotic to do i guess i could have done um what are they called the peacekeepers classic reload studs submachine guns and allows you to write them instantly cruiser handling with smgs and your movement with wall you know the more i'm reading i totally thought it was just reloading while stowed hold on hold on oh jesus wait uh let me uh check in uh destiny item andrew do i have something in my vault here oh uh okay okay yeah but what did i have on these holsters i don't really need that i guess uh at the very least just give me uh a recovery right for sure okay whatever that'll do oh my god what what are those okay well now i just look ass it looks like i'm wearing a fanny pack frankly kind of a banana hammock almost oh my god i'm zooming you can't tell but i swear to god i'm zooming perpetual motion is already activated i've never felt this fast with my titan before can somebody learn this kind of power perpetual motion times two now normally can only go to two can oh crouching in the back like okay i'm getting my revenge right now poder podr porter i lay claim to this kill and lay claim i have kill clip has been initiated now if i had enhanced kill clip this would be lasting longer but it's not but yeah i'm like i'm not i'm not just hyping this up to be something that i am zooming i got kill oh my hold on what is okay oh even with all the added range the holy cow i'm still doing nothing okay hold on okay look at that leave that dodge pop that over there i'm hiding over here this is not good in fact i'm very afraid right i'm super afraid help me help me team uh somebody how have they not come for you okay whatever i'm gonna reload i'm enhanced because i'm perpetually in motion i'm helping my teammate oh yeah nice barricade stupid i'm alive and i'm back to help my friend yeah okay the range is pretty atrocious i know some people complained about the the zoom site uh i got nothing there yeah it's it's it's small there's not much say about that but i don't hate it but but i definitely think uh you know there's a little left to be desired as far as the range goes i mean i almost have 80 range i don't actually know how or if i can really get it much farther the the range i mean like this is it feels like this is oh little grenade kill this is about as good as it's going to get you know this is primo cream of the crop as far as range is concerned and that is what it gets us i'd like to think i stayed on target pretty well there but my bullets decided uh not close enough chief not close enough okay and everything hurts i'm gonna bait him go my friends get baited for me yes die in my name i won't forget you or what you've done for us okay kill clip activated now they know i'm weak there's another k i don't know kind of liking the kill clap i think it's increased duration actually enhanced kill clip i don't think it's increased damage yeah i think it's just kill clip let's take a look at that um here we have the sunset antiope exact same same weapon practically uh 600 rpm as we can see here 600 rpm except uh well actually the same precision frame but he has damage at range wha what just happened what was what what did i just witness okay i'm telling you though give me that kill clip oh and we're br okay that one was an assist so i didn't get a kill clip that one's not my fault okay what was i shooting i think i'm going a little too fast frankly i can't keep up okay i have all the like reduced flinch while he's in smg i was experiencing a lot of function i don't think his antiope is doing that much but you know apparently i'm wrong but um when it's cooking it's cooking that's right i'm i'm thinking about my engagements something i never do and you i've got no friends ah what's that all about well just because you're a warlock you're gonna have friends just like that those are your friends he's like yeah that's actually exactly it mr fruit yeah thanks clearing that up for everybody nice throw absolutely no kills there there's another one yeah yeah okay i didn't get anything i'm still weak somehow this guy wants to take me take on me take on me i'm coming friend nah fudge okay you know i'm so glad for whatever reason i've come across every other 600 precision frame submachine gun this am i looking at this right this guy has over 15 000 crucible kills with just this gun sweet baby jesus that feels illegal what and it gets the adept range must be nice again um this is what the forensic nightmare is competing against uh specifically at the shira's wrath isn't sunset unlike the others uh it just doesn't feel great all around yeah somebody help me help i need somebody oh the dom blade on the bubble get him okay i don't know why i'm in i smell blood in the water yo it's so does he ah no no no what so yeah let's look at it that way you know should you use this over she euros probably not no but is it easier to get a good role than shayur is yes yes it is especially not an insane god roll adapt like that that's that's just not that doesn't happen i've frankly i'm still baffled myself okay go friends go there we go beautiful teamwork freaking freaking i'm done it'll be and who knows maybe not kill clip won't help that that much if you could throw an adapt range on this oh yeah i don't think i could get accurate rounds i didn't put i put ricochet i don't know maybe i could have maybe that one my fault okay i don't really want to deal with any of that so let's just do a little bit of it dude how does it bounce like that was a little little doorstep or something okay okay and yep it's me versus the world then we lost okay still top of the team though when we didn't even have a team really everyone just kept believing you know we're going back in the rumble i still feel like the biggest thing holding this back is definitely the range otherwise i think i'm in love like i really don't know how i squeeze more range out of this i really don't yeah do i go spring grip i don't i don't really know here maybe you know let's go counterbalance sure why not my friends okay wow what is on your face a lot of balls all the balls in the face a lot of balls in your my face balls oh we got a crowd chatter here oh he's burning no he's not i've been lied to yep okay great there's a kill i am so speedy with these things like see normal movement speed not faster rolling around at the speed of time i can't keep up oh there's a nice little kill weapon leveled up you'll have to see it i don't i don't know why i'm pushing that when i'm don't even have half my health it's just the problem is in order to be in optimal range i'm in shotgun range like you saw right there if things were just a little bit different that goes okay but this thing is smooth as butter right now let me tell you it's going exactly where i want it to now check it out i don't know what that was damage just kind of appeared out of nowhere on him come on kill clip he's gonna fusion rifle me no he won't dude i can just chase anybody i want i can ape oh my god you see he's using shira's wrath just just a little bit more range man like it's all i'm asking for is that an empowering rift okay you know what i don't want that i don't i'm perpetually in motion and ah with all these adapter weaponers aren't you guys just the coolest look at me i've gone flawless and trials you know what so have i but i don't feel the need to boast about it and post it everywhere i can't fight you at that range i should contest for this heavy actually i'm going to if i grab this heavy means they don't have to have never mind that's a hand cannon has about three times the time to kill i do there we go we got the kill i took the heavy i'm just gonna fire this thing fire and forget you know what i'm saying boosh nice okay there that's it boom yeah now we're thinking with strats freaking shotgun i just took icarus grip off so not my best idea but i will take that kill clip while perpetually in motion melted like a stick of butter in a georgian summer it really does get hot georgie i have family there and it's nothing that's more miserable than a hot summer in georgia you think you have tinnitus because it's just all times they're everywhere you can't get rid of them doesn't really have anything to do with anything i don't actually remember how i got there either okay well skirt what what that doesn't even make sense oh so skillful just dashing around with your shotgun must be nice having a movement ability like that and pvp this is what i have doesn't even one shot you know anyone anymore by the way if you're curious yeah just not entirely sure what it does and now you're gonna give him this kill i hate it i hate it he just hadn't shot me we could we could have all been friends right but why can't we be friends so maybe it's because you're a boner huh anything about that you've got to be kidding me shotgun freaking icarus dash and you make me sick what are you doing i pulled a cod right there but yeah yeah i stopped he's wait is he using a black talon what the fudge is at 100 that's anova bomb and i'm not really about it i only got one of those how did i not get both of those stop it oh there's one okay okay and i'm going to do this to debate him okay i thought you were closer ace of spades good lord all right it's just hand kings and and my smg twin that is better versus the world but i think we did okay with all things considered all right peacekeeper is kind of nice with it i enjoy that and again in normal you know pvp match where i'm not just trying to use one thing let's say i was like that sweaty mcgee using a shotgun you know running around everywhere then i could be like unload my forensic nightmare swatch to my shotgun shoot it swap back it's instantly readied and reloaded so there is some merit there but also why not just use that for like sharers wrath because it can't get enhanced perks dude enhancements are way cooler all right that's why so i guess all in all it's it's an okay gun if only they give it a little bit more range a headstone role in pve though is interesting and to make enhanced perpetual motion and either is worth your time plus it's it's one of the easiest to craft and stuff so i don't think you could go wrong putting some resources into it you don't have to fully invest into it but if you also don't have a good shiras or something you know just uh why not why not all right but i'm not gonna lie to you if your gun pointed to my head what do i do this or the shear or his wrath obviously i choose this because that's the video i got a quick bait make you think that every gun is the greatest freaking ever go freaking just rap it would be the sheers right though i'd pick this year's wrath okay love you guys bye [Music] [Music] you
