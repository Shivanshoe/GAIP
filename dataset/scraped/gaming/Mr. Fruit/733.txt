hi ad Holdren my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to paladins not the most popular here on the channel but you know sometimes I gotta upload some games I just want to play myself so to all those that watch the Paladins thank you very much I love you I'm gonna be taking Cassie for a spin today I got a crossbow so you know I'm here I'm a damage dealer I'm a sucker for that I don't play support characters that much because then my team has to really rely on me and I I just ape you know I'm not a great team player but it's good that I recognize that this crossbow is looking sick though so my abilities obviously have a crossbow that I shoot and deal damage I can blast myself backward while dealing damage fire an explosive crossbow that knocks other people away roll out of danger and send my bird do some scouting at least it's something like that I think what all of you guys at your pleb horses I'm over here on a speedo oh well you do have like a an electronic lager that is pretty cool I'll be honest I don't think I've ever seen this map before this is exciting and take oh my god mr. fruit they have families oh my God look at all this damage I'm doing well okay he was like some sort of a shield I mean I see it's been a while since I've played against him so I'm not really sure I'm an idiot hey what if I just don't move and take damage up the butt like that great idea me it was the best of times it was the worst of times I feel I guess you'd be going a little bit faster than this but that's okay I think the soul baby could pair a little bit more I need to focus this guy because I do have extra damage to shields which would prove useful about all the time boom hit you got oh I damaged him i'ma roll this way you can't escape me but you did how'd you heal so much hold on wait what Oh picture shots mr. fruit well done look at this def cannon on top of the payload you're doing great my friend although I'm not a fan of these people shooting you like that oh my god get deleted up mr. fruit mr. fruit mr. fruit i'ma send my bird to reveal all the stuff yes give me all the information the lay of the land if you will oh my is this even fear is this so loud mr. fruit

I almost had them yeah yeah I went deep but like I said it's all I know how to do we're successful let's go team I don't wanna say it was all me but that's pretty much exactly what I'm saying that was a first good round at my first good round I mean we absolutely obliterated the enemy team so let's do it again he'll run back to probably pick a little more inconspicuous of a thing to travel by but yeah whatever who cares you know I'm saying okay oh who are you well I know who you are sky high power I'm a big fan oh and your dad don't okay now let's get this guy I do do extra damage to shields cuz I got that loadout thing oh I don't know happen Victor Victor Victor how many times do I have to tell you quit shooting me well I died for a good cause because we're well we got them again yeah

this point it's like mr. fruit calm down I'm saying I'm gonna push this guy off the objective we're just gonna score with you right here oh never mind he I don't know what that is but he's very angry he's very angry he's brooding if you will and okay hold on let's just kill him shoot wait wait wait what is happening what is on me what just I don't know but we want I don't really know what happened there for a second I guess something like cc'd Mir or something also who cares about you will you watch dude okay cool you get Lee play the game whatever it's like a participation award okay it means nothing it means nothing hear me clearly I'm not upset that I didn't didn't get it ah but look who's up there for best damage oh wait a second oh that that guy was on our team oh wait I take back everything I said this is awkward we're gonna try this skin out this round very vampire slayer' ask booty booty booty oh I know this map though I'm very familiar with this one and I know I'm gonna find someone right here and I did and they are yeah they're already dead that's about right yep and they're dead and they will shortly be no you can't escape triple kill to start off yeah yeah yeah

the map imagine just a minute oh my god yeah it's the innit where's my team I've seen to be the only one doing well which would explain a lot but let me go ahead and all you all have vision there's no excuses now no surprises until that person because she has been giving me a headache and a half or we just don't we're really good at just not doing things and this person is really good at trying to escape me I'm gonna land straight up on you that was a horrible idea forgot that yeah she's AoE and actually the closer the easier it is sure my bad but I can get raucous I can get them get leaving to me leave it maybe not actually why are these guys doing so much damage guess what I got shield breaker though they're bulldozer whatever it is so you might think that your shield will save you but they will in fact now I now drop the map yes yes I did oh I thought she might be able to save herself but new brick brick oh you're in your eyes huh what if I just OH time it perfectly so that as soon as you enter you die no no keep wasting your all on me this this girl's insane I don't know how to shut her down but I need a freak yeah I think I should go reduce human because I don't know what she's doing but she never stops healing so that seems like the play to me oh you're so weak we're gonna play this game again huh oh there's a short-lived game a game nonetheless though that we won we'll get the healing on this yeah that's insane all we got to kill that we got to kill that's all that matters and then this person I'd pretty sure that's her hole and I should just leave her alone Oh No thank you you you and I'm out of there and watch this you're gonna chase me good do it do it that's what you get you should know better you don't push the hose bro rookie mister my team's dying again I'm bagging the action how can I help by killing him real quick now focus her very good very good screw you guys what's going on over here that seems like a nasty oh okay you wanna die oh well don't mind if I do yeah sure thanks for making it easier on me and then this girl wants to challenge me that'll be the last time you ever try that oh shoot okay hello good sir and farewell now let's
