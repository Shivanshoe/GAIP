hi ad ho everyone my name's mr. vert and welcome back to destiny too and in today's video a brand new exotic this one was a doozy for everybody to unlock for reasons I'll explain right now but first off thank you very much to kingfish let me use this bastion not gonna lie doe his hunter do be looking pretty fresh I was gone for most of this I was just a pack south but there was this huge community puzzle that came out of nowhere a whole bunch of Python coding people thousands of pictures and resets that whole thing was above my paygrade but once they solved the puzzle at the end awaited a brand new quest to unlock a new exotic which happened to be the bastion which for those that fall destiny - bashed and was on the roadmap to be released next week but it's here now don't ask me it is a kinetic fusion rifle you heard me right kinetic fusion rifle its intrinsic perk charges to fire 3 spread of kinetic slugs and it straight break through a portion of his weapons damage bypasses elemental shields in reality it's almost like a charging shotgun now actually as of the time of this video reset has happened and since we unlocked it through the puzzle last week everybody in destiny can go talk to saint-14 and get the new mission themselves to get the exotic but I'm hoping after using it I'm convinced that I need to go get it because it's so sick now there's a lot of strife in the community because of this entire quest though because since Bastion was on the roadmap for next week we're like oh there's got to be something secret behind this who knows what we're gonna get since the whole puzzle was a surprise well surprise it it was just the weapon we were told we were getting next week and a lot of the problems people have is the fact that we were told this was coming next week so we we got our hopes up like oh this must be something something new something different so a lot of people are thinking you know if they just didn't put this on the roadmap and this was the reward a lot of people would be happy but because they kind of jebaited us it doesn't matter I mean everybody was getting their minds are racing they're like oh gee horn which would be insane hold on let me try this thing what Willie there's a animation don't let me happen in right now when I have two shots though because it okay that was okay so that was damage not a lot of it okay I have no range or we just need to work I like this - watch it - dude do reminds me of some sort of like bye check infinite looking thing I don't know but I'm a fan of that we're gonna see if I'm a fan of a gun though I have been told it is a little butts but I am here to form an opinion on my own three genes people from the past this is mr. fruit from the end of the video coming back to talk to you at the beginning of the video because I must atone for my sins I made a little judgment call on the bastion a little too early and then we kind of get nice with it so stick with me bear with me and and that's it from time-traveling fruit okay or ice for you present fruit for me past fruit we'll talk to you right okay whatever this whole time travel things confusing there are a couple stands out there the like nuts it's totally worth it and we'll see about that it kicks that much as girl kicks and just a lack of range and what appears to be damage range and damage because if it's firing four shots and body shots dude ten damage and that's to charge we're doing forty that's like a body shot with like a hand cannon so maybe precision damage does approximately half a billion that'll I guess be better oh wait okay there was 30 damage okay okay I can get behind that Bob we got we got a kill we're doing it so maybe the it's just the damage fall-off is extreme so we did 32 that dude with our shots but previously we're doing 10 so yet you just gotta you gotta get in close Oh see there we go okay nevermind it yeah as far as I can tell this is just a shotgun that charges I don't know why it's a fusion rifle but it is and I didn't mean to let go of the of the trigger there but it did and it's too late for that I'm grab it Oh as I wait a minute oh my god I'm on a five kills freak I haven't done like anything he just wasn't there chief it wasn't there I also have the weighted knife mr. fruit don't forget to utilize that ah fudge well I wasted it some people are guessing next week what will get is perhaps the catalyst for this if anything I'm hoping maybe increased range or reduced cool time so far from what I've just experimented with for literally just like no amount of time at all if there is anyone that has no business discussing the bastion it's this guy I'm pointing to me but you can't see that but I love making the ration mm-hmm just coming to my happy place I mean to my happy place if you do not want you at them with this thing you have to switch because you are not going to be well unless they don't shoot back then you can probably kill them again oh so does my voice sound a little bit different I don't know it's a little hoarse a lot of talking done at the convention so far though I have avoided the PAX plague I need to find some wood and I must knock on it because god only knows I suck a big fat wiener I suck I'll be a big of a wiener writer Jack I've got a big fat wiener and I want to kill myself ah the good old buttery can rub down if that's not an innuendo then Bob I don't know what it is we love our new exotics around here though no more exciting time than this but the problem is if that's oh oh the old er tanned well done in charging I'm tall I'm all charged up let's go wait what oh my god I was spamming my melee how do you mail a so vast whatever we'll play punishment you're not here to mail a mr. fruit you're here to use the greatest gun destiny has ever seen oh that is that's bounced for some reason that warlock looks like a Titan don't ask me why probably doesn't at all but for some reason it looks like a Titan with that aerial move and I'm jealous I'd love to do that power play though its own surprised we haven't mercy these fools get the charge up and oh my god we actually that was decent range that was not that's kind of where it falters the problem is that that is the problem the problem is this is a shotgun but you need to charge it so if you come up against another shotgun who doesn't have to charge you're getting die because that's the optimal range I feel like that's what's holding us back right now give me a second give me a second give me a second seems stupid charge and man but we want well now like I said I obviously haven't done the quest and the mission yet but essentially what it is is we're like going back and messing with a timeline and we actually find our grave our Guardians grave so apparently we died for this weapon to mess with the timeline and give it to ourselves in the previous timeline but I know myself and I would not sacrifice myself for this weapon this is not the one I would die for I would probably die for the premarin or the no land beyond anybody else anybody else there's that just me well some way I would just be wildin right now I am dying what else Kourt ah yes a nice short engagement map for Rumble as well this is good this is good this this is forever good mind because watch this first kill or not and we did almost regardless of range you need to hit the in tongue the entire burst why would I use this when I can is usually Mindbenders ambition probably same kill range in fact ambition might be a little bit better but spoilers everybody it doesn't need to charge that was half damage thankfully like I can't hit the broad side of a moisture evaporate or not upset and we're charged up and that's a different fusion rifle that's actually just better yeah I'm starting to see you know I'm just I'm not really not really feeling it nope not a big fan right now it seems like it doesn't know what it is it's a lot of things and it's not good at anything it tries to do it's one of those you know I'm sayin's like a smorgasbord it just some identity crisis ie ie doesn't help then my eyes are inflamed my nose is running I die I don't know what our G's are going on right now that's like oh wow that's cool yeah I guess but that's that's you know a I'm gonna kill somebody is this maybe better in PvE I kind of heard its butts in PvE though long story short I've heard it's but everywhere although that was a decent range okay wait a second wait hold phone where is this coming from this seems to this seems to that like that range I would take that that's that's not terrible okay but then there's a fun fact I have read that it has predictable recoil that's right apparently every single recoil is the exact same we see us go up in here so it might just be that you need to learn the recoil pattern and account for that wind shooting and I don't have ammo grab this mo okay now I'm good to go come on now are you a big boy juice juice ah see it seems to violently and I mean violently kick upwards so what I'm currently do that got that no ah fudge I forgot about kept it with fudge you're saying whatever would appear that shooting yeah lower mass and then letting it kick itself upward naturally is advantageous oh nice shot I've what the fudge I was like haha output what in the Dickens is this fun I don't know but it worked out for us I was like hah outplayed him he only spawns with two sniper shots I should be fine well apparently he picked up some because we did totally outplay the first couple but I wasn't anticipating the rest I appreciate the midair attempt yep oh this is so strange it was butts but now I'm killing it honestly a decent wow that was quite the lunge a decent range with all things considered honestly like if if we could do this consistently okay you're telling me that none of that our now if somebody's got a thorn all right who do you think you are charge it up oh my god you just got Blaine turn I'm gonna clean them up yeah try and snipe me boy try snipe me boom okay yeah I don't even think you can get precision damage so that doesn't matter shoot for lower mass bro oh there's the kill great stuff mean I got a hurry I got a hurry boom there's another one I'm running that time right that time no I had I ran out of it yeah it's it did you do this is so strange it's like sometimes it does nothing sometimes all of it comes out at once ah I don't know as soon as I said I hate it it's like hey I appreciate you talking about me like that behind my back well I did the funny thing is that I am talking behind his back because I'm holding it in front of me ironic isn't it ah okay oh you know what yeah maybe I judged a book too soon I judged a book by its cover and for that high Bala dies I don't know it's still pretty close range but we've started to get a little bit more reasonable range kills that not being one of them because I missed the end hold my god I'm death but what's incredible is we might know that's about to say we might make this comeback we did not well play your best efficiency though okay that way okay okay okay okay I need to make a little audio thing here to put it back at the beginning of the video to let people know wait a minute this is like this is like quarters of time this is like me going back in time to give myself something I'm going back in time to give my viewers a heads up that we shouldn't judge this book by its cover by the bing bada boom and the weird thing is now that I said that I'm going back but you've already heard me go back so you already heard past that was present fruits thinking about being future fruit to the Past fruit to the past viewers but you're the president view all this stuff is crazy I still don't think it was worth me dying for in the present to give to my past self and I'm not really convinced this deserves the exotic spot slot whatever in your loadout because again put on a Mindbenders ambition and it'll kill from about the same range it's not exotic and it doesn't need to charge beside from that it's a new exotic so that's the cool thing and it does look cooler than the my inventors ambition so checkmate but that said I don't think of much watching have yourselves a fantastic I'll talk to you and the next one farewell [Music] [Music]
