tough huh yeah it's a tough word hr dude i am hr and i'm not in the group chad sharks just happy to no longer be the punching bag hey man i'll take whatever it's like it's like the new jerry i never thought was the punching bag at all i thought i was the punching bag i was just trying to make you feel better plus you're the punching bag to yourself yeah yeah you're like i have to bonk you you get in the gym you know i'm so frustrated i need to vent this out you go to the punchy bag you put up you put a picture of you on the punching bag stupid punching bag wins punches is this what being hazed feels like no that's not just what the kids do all right ladies and gentlemen welcome we're playing knock off which is different than normal guard kick film we'll probably do some more normal as well but with this one you have to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster so you have to what replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster how does it work exactly we learn by trial and error i mean i can explain okay just draw the same explanation okay draw a scene so others can describe it i can draw it like backwards draw a scene so i was gonna describe it i can really draw anything so what do i draw to make it red oh you know what i know what i'm doing do that fill it in boom then wait don't do that i lied okay we're gonna go with no don't okay we're gonna go with we're gonna go with this okay better then i'm gonna use this and fill that in much better then i need um oof no no i don't like that let's keep it moodier um okay one son here and another son here you might see where this is going it's tattooing but what are they doing on tatooine i haven't figured that part out yet um anything how i want to do like that maybe something simple okay so it's tattooing and then a little tie fighter over here meow meow wow there's two of them of course and then way out in the distance um so where am i going with this great question okay we could do um [Music] what's the roly-poly i can't believe i can't remember the name of that droid we could do him uh okay he'll be uh he'll be a jedi the fill tool makes this a lot easier i'm like this i like this thing and then um yeah i'm pretty sure he's like this and he's like a little roly-poly thing except his little thing that comes out of his compartment and he's holding a light shave up not bright enough he's holding a blue lightsaber [Music] he is a jedi and then we gotta show him he's been like rolling obviously and i don't know what else um to do this droid who i can't remember on tatooine dual wielding he's dual wielding oh now this is cannon okay he's got a purple lightsaber sure nailed that i don't know where i went with it but we went somewhere i'm gonna be honest i didn't know what to draw for about 45 seconds all right you guys you guys you should not be talking right now it's not until that time i had no idea what was happening so let me put it this way i still have no idea what's happening if i got my drawing i wouldn't know how to describe it so what the oh i have to replicate this whoever got this one this is beautiful so you have to you have to go it says memorize the drawings okay okay i don't know who drew this but it's beautiful i'm gonna draw it now this is an anime reference that i don't understand okay wow that's so good that's actually so good um i mean it's so good i actually love it okay we don't have much time to we don't have much time to replicate this and then the next person that gets my drawing is gonna have even less time to replicate it something like this night was he happy i don't know we know little peoples i don't think he had those um because i know what he did have was some shosh going like this oh yeah oh that's hot that's hot actually i don't want to put the smile over it that didn't work oh my god i'm running that time yay [Music] got big old pupils my son um is that all you had oh all right it's gonna start ramping up this is so simple yeah you really do so faster and faster every time i believe oh god he's just getting real sad um i could have sworn i need this bigger and he was crying i'm gonna use some different wine thickness or something like that you know to portray things what am i portraying i'm not entirely sure [Music] he's very sad what is he sad about [Music] well that's for us to find out i guess [Music] um i don't know i don't know what else to add i mean that's like oh fudge did he okay sure sure i appreciate you mr circle tool do i try to mimic what is this what the fudge do your best man okay what uh i don't have much time um and then we had what color does it really matter okay something like this i remember and then the words i i i'm i'm thinking that my last drawing might not have submitted i'm gonna be really sad if that's the case um i want to say it's some sort of a cassette that says poop i'm getting nervous it's going so fast it's going so fast i can't keep up under pressure i think the last one didn't submit oh jesus um um okay i don't have i don't have time good god okay uh come here um do i even have to uh dodge i could use circle tool but apparently i want to make this harder myself and then uh he's like freaking me and he's like meow and then they have legs whatever and then he's like he's going super saiyan clearly uh beautiful nailed it all right i think i'm getting faster and faster jesus oh what is this i don't have time to figure out what this is um is it shrek some kind of shrek and then they tried to do the s and it didn't work um so something like this um then he had something like this and then it was like he seemed kind of indifferent and then um i don't know what i'm drawing anymore this is very confusing oh okay i think it's supposed to be the windows desktop thing was there a sun oh floodge wasn't paying attention oh jesus um i'm just gonna assume this windows desktop sun um and then clouds [Music] clouds um yeah sure i'm starting to realize i didn't even all i noticed was blue green i don't remember if there's a sun oh my god more okay um go go go go go there was this and there was this and then they had um curly hair and they were kind of sad or different i'm not really sure i'm getting faster um no i want them to be looking this way kind of like that beautiful i want to know what it started at us because i forgot just how much time you have i want to know where my droid and tatooine got to all right i'm done i started drawing like so abstract at the end there hold on i had yeah honestly that was there was nothing what happens now now we go through it and see how it progressed throughout the game oh okay oh where'd you start off with mr okay let's see let me um show you all what i started with [Music] wow i turned i significantly improved on shark's drawing yeah probably let's see wait did you oh is that what this was now let's see where bless took it i nailed that it's actually really funny because it stayed the same the entire time it started out with the sequels and ended with trash shark i swear to god if you did this for everything no no no no no okay well then walk me through this why why so i saw space stuff and i was like oh this could be like a destiny reference because you guys like playing you saw tie fighters those are jordan with lightsabers they play destiny probably no i log in to do the story every week and then i go back to final fantasy that's true oh the poses were a little less dramatic but i like it i put that really hard because this is the quickest way i can't compete with you barrages i don't have a tablet i don't either none of us do accept price hey guys yeah look what bryce yeah what's your excuse i don't know it's really showing i'm curious why they have green pupils they're terrifying okay sorry i just imitated what i saw that's even better i definitely thought it was super shame it turned it turned into super smooth like third legs where's the circle oh it's it's tien i see what you did there i think if that's what you meant to do beautiful oh yeah i see i thought it was interesting i think yeah i think i encapsulated this really well okay yeah it's interesting because blue added another golden aura that wasn't there and then rob just assumed there was golden hair but there never was i know how that was i like the last ones i see it for like a second i'm like i got this what was that like what was what was there yeah dude it's something's completely just oh i like that i like how you yeah i tried to stick with one color all right bless what did you draw you bless the blue came from you yeah the blue came from you it's funny shark bless turned jotaro into kakyoin oh whoa spoilers dude that's crazy dude i don't know what that means okay well to be fair everyone went with but at least you're stayed in the same dr it went to a different raggedy anime the anime all right bless let's like go over uh what mine was if you were there you know exactly what's happening what i wasn't there lovely wedding no one calls it a wedding i wasn't there for that one this was my first time playing so i didn't know you could immediately go oh my god that was equally as good that's what i wondered it was like the second round i forgot some of the colors but then i fixed it look hold on honestly it looks like a cassette tape what are the letters always always very funny i i don't know what's going on this is what blue made it be upset with blue yeah yeah blue so what exactly you're like oh i'm drawing now so i'm i just dropped i just saw it was like replicate your thing and i saw a time count down and i was like oh so i have to wait for this to go and then i could start that's what i thought it was like and i was like i was like you're on because i have no time um that makes sense nothing more romantic than two balls and if we look at the first picture in the last i think we did pretty solid yo you guys were very mean like i'm not joking bryce blue why am i getting called out all i did was drop i would like to explain so this is jesus this is like a a typical tuesday oh family events and that's this is a dog yeah that's their little idea that's what that was you know it's just a little you know it's just a little s a tuesday morning for a normal american ass family it's beautiful i love it yeah he's going to work he's going towards taking care of the baby like take me to work with you it's a beautiful morning what a beautiful family what what is sad for my life what is papa s walking into what is that that's my attempt out of this car how is it oriented it's like a top down side it's a world of s's so you wouldn't really it's so in the world of s's cars are two s i'm really trying to see the car it's beautiful thank you you don't see the car yeah so i had no time because i had the same issue blue did so i did my best i did my best but i did baby ass and mama ass just get land of a dog to be fair that dog looks like the uh the meme so i'm glad it turned out even halfway decent see you can tell that bryce didn't know how to do the s okay it's funny because when it got to me i'll just say this i thought it was a drawing of shrek so how is this dog evolving yeah there we go yeah that makes sense so i'm like oh it's shrek and an ass [Music] [Applause] oh i know this by heart i know this my heart was like oh my god i tried honestly that's kind of cool it's like designed like 10 seconds to draw it again it's abstract it's on it looks like an alien is like looking at a gym it's kind of cool you know blue i'd love to see you after this you know take a little more time and really flush that out i think see what you have there yeah can i commission you for that i'm gonna have the alien shove that ass up his butt okay okay perfect love to see it that's where i hope this was going see again continuing with the family values here what is this yo that's a corn dog why is he like questioning that he's like yeah all right it's really bringing back to my childhood where my dad would never mind uh so mr fruit i just want to say i got it your father is zeus as well and i was pumped i was like that's really cool it's a greek god joke so there we go joey's is like the guy [Laughter] see this hey this one has some continuity to it yeah that's okay about the mustard how are you gonna eat the corn you know now well now it's like sticks too now there's a circle it's a sunburnt potato and they see i think i fixed that i think i go a lighter shade have a potato i like how you added the little potato that was nice yeah because like he didn't have it so i assumed the first one had it looks like it blesses looks like he's handing the guy a joint or something that's what they call it in that dimension this one was for dork oh my god well guys it's been fixed this one doesn't [Laughter] you maybe had 15 seconds of seeing the picture and drawing and you decided you know what screw it i'm drawing that yo what mocha sauce my ass is a dumpy don't worry i got you why does he have a triple clap like what's going on there uh backpack i mean you're just like a drawing i did in 10 seconds i like it okay what the detail on blues is where he's squatting down i like the shiny one i like the shininess he really is working it out a little bit he's like straight up yeah he's putting his ass in the air i love joey's trunks like that this is original this is cool and dump truck among us okay perfect i'm glad you like it i like all roads i love [Music] wait is that a kangaroo yeah that's hilarious i nailed the i thought i thought that was blessed i like the hair i'll give you that i was actually proud of this okay boys it's a kangaroo you can milk i like how you're like i've got nigel thornberry oh wait the kangaroo i un-ironically did it and i and i un-ironically did it that's what that was oh it looks like a really weird dinosaur i thought it was a dinosaur yeah it kind of does look like a dinosaur it looks like that's that's nigel what's up just as i remember i know mine turned into guy fieri melting in a lava field so bless gave me like the little raggedy anne annabelle doll oh that's how i got to this oh my god i was that's how we got here that's how we got today started with a joey joke ended with i like how blue kind of ruined the kangaroo because he just all focused on thornberry so he poop of the face your memory of what nigel looks like is actually pretty incredible like yeah i was gonna say yeah that was that was maybe google yeah that's the last time i've seen nigel so maybe that's really wrong but in my memory that's exactly what it looks like all right blue started out with joey's like yeah i guess yeah oh that's beautiful that's what you did with your amount of time yeah desktop background tan it seems like that's funny what it turned into oh it's beautiful there's no way this turned into something i don't think yeah it's kind of changed i'm pretty sure it's okay yeah i'm loving this so far it's very simple it's a little hard to screw up the day it's day time now yeah it's getting a tiny bird it's map well to be fair bless tournaments it went day time night time night actually it's just the cycle we're going through the daily cycle continuity ends up on tatooine oh beautiful watch oh gosh did i keep the car oh my god whoa that hill got bigger yeah that hill hey that's the crypto market am i right okay an earthquake happened there okay so you want to know when i was saying like you had you had seconds to view the picture and then you remembered things that weren't there i was like there were three things i was like why the hell clapped up though about to make me act up funnily enough i saw rob's picture for a second i was like i think it's the windows xp but then i was like yeah kinda yeah don't worry i did not ruin this picture nice there you go except in this world the sky is white in the classroom in this dimension way to go i i honestly i'd be pretty sad if we somehow yeah me too if somehow that turned into a des2 one we'd be insulted i called this piece my friend started without me and i didn't know what was going on what do you mean your friend started without you yeah we didn't start without you when we started you did start without me i i was i was definite in the call and i was getting everything fixed and then i see the screen change i'm like oh i guess we're starting i was i was going to say something but i'm the intern so it's really not my place i like the detail yeah well it wasn't a lot to go off of so oh my god what did i ran out of time i'm so sorry it's all coming back oh my [Laughter] me last week [Laughter] please stop saying that please don't that was pretty good i thought that was a pretty decent game yeah that one yeah that happened okay but now we we know what we're doing so we'll uh we'll try this one again [Music] you
