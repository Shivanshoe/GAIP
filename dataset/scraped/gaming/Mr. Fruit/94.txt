hey gore i am gorba i'm so happy you're excited about who you are but uh gore i'm gonna need you to do something here buddy i am fruit see we are one and i'm sure groot's around here too you guys will be best friends but but for the time shape up soldier nice heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and i just discovered i have a superpower now my origin story isn't that i was bit by a spider some radioactive thing from the sky landing i wasn't injected with super serum nay i made a destiny 2 video that's my origin story and my super power triggering the entire fanbase with one video i recently made a destiny 2 video where i went through trials freelance using the dead man's tale you might see where this is going because you might be one of those very people that was upset with me i just looked at destiny er trials report whatever i was like oh these are the top guns whatever put them on didn't think about it my bad because i conveniently forgot what the masterwork did i j i just forgot increased tip fire rate of fire and removes hip fire accuracy penalties yeah so it's it's good to hip fire and um i never i never hit fire all right you guys could have been constructive or rational with your feedback but most of you chose not to and i respect that so in order to right my wrong i'm headed into the crucible to hip fire alright so put the pitchforks down okay let's not cancel culture me yeah although i guess if that was cancer culture it wouldn't we're canceling this dude why he didn't hit fire with the dmt down with him there will be more destiny 2 content to come and i have some pretty cool ideas and series coming so stay tuned for that but that's also important because it means i'll be playing more destiny 2 in general which means i'll be more warm for videos and less likely to make such paper plays well okay maybe not paper plays but at the very least you have a decent idea to remember to look at the perks on my god you know oh shoot guys hi thanos is coming what is that the mind solst it's one of the stones what is the blue stone's the tesseract no that's what what the [ __ ] space reality i don't know time control oh it's a long neck girl shoes okay all right let's warm this up alright see there we go already hip fired more than i did in the other video it's it's just a scout rifle man and it's not that it's okay see i'm just already i'm already it's like at range why wouldn't i but any guys you're probably on to something it's probably been found to be more advantageous to dip fire something i don't really know holy that's a lot of weak guys yeah what okay here we go here we go again i kind of don't want to be more than friends i want to be your rival and kill you yeah that wasn't the finished song can you guess why that beats me right hey he's gonna rest the fudge was that can't res in here there were two walls between us two and he had shot me can we get a replay on that madden he rest in peace you know okay this is going to sound terrible but i think i killed madden you're like mr fruit what the [ __ ] you talking about well my wife was asking about him the other day it's like oh is that football game named after that guy i was like yeah um she's like is he still alive i'm like no i i think he died a while ago this was like a week and a half ago looked it up i'm like oh my god wait john madden's alive i'm not kidding you about two three days later and john madden's dead i think i i think i did a bad thing i'm so sorry if you won't cancel me over not hip firing with the dmt at least cancel me over that i deserve it two head shots headshot hater that's not friendly what the what in it what is wh why is the entire enemy team a bruh someone else get in there like what but hell i'm lighting the brazies freaking ratagasta whatever what's the freaking place they're trying to get people to come from and what are the rings when they light all the ross i swear it's rhodam is it i think it starts with an r dude i was dead for a second and somehow my shot connected what is this i thought they like kind of went back on more connection based less skill base did that change again or something did did i not get the memo oh okay let's be more realistic did i get the memo i just as always didn't read it that is the most likely outcome it usually is yeah what are wolves love it okay let me put this in perspective i'm the top of my team right now so uh woof you know what i'm saying things are looking rather dire for our hero can i even call my would i be the protagonist i feel like in a story i'm not the protagonist i'm the lovable but not all their sidekick you know and i wear that proudly granted if it were between me and ariel's then yeah i'm probably the protagonist and i mean that he's invisible my freaking what the fudge is on his head wait what what oh my god what the fudge is this what the my god i i did not i didn't know that's in the game i hate it i hate everything about it he had like oh it's that i guess i'm a hunter so i don't know anything but yo that cloak is sick okay he's got that drip drip drip drip drip drip um tick tick tick this song was a bit of a banger i'm not gonna lie to you all good movie good movie yeah wait okay well i mean people are like italian as like the next messiah um okay that's not true at all i'm embellishing but when don't i i mean it was good but you know not my favorite story just didn't really hook me but but ironically like the songs i'm usually not like a musical musical kind of guy but there were some there were some bangers in there not gonna lie to you hey this is kind of crazy guys but uh here hear me out dmt hipfire is pretty good do you guys know that hey guys have you tried hip firing with the dmt because i don't know if you tried this but maybe maybe try hip firing with the the dmt you've got stupid yeah we showed him yeah that was odd i was gonna say eat but i stopped myself halfway i don't really know why you've got you've got to be kidding come on they're all weak man he was already shadow he didn't even he didn't know i was gonna he just screw me man oh games all tied up folks we got ourselves a competitive match maybe there's more skill based in connection based on because they want a more fair and competitive game you know not so much landslides and well if this game's anything it's not a landslide so yeah what excuse me what what i just evaporated i didn't see anything there was no damage over silence and squall usually has like a little tornado like what what the fudge was that man i just i straight up i don't know you guys what is wrong with you people hey good news team i've eaten like three of their supers because they you know these days like they only get one each so i've wait what the [ __ ] did i even shoot i don't even know there was a glint but it looked like so close to the ground it was odd but i killed him whatever it was dude how did that second shot not like that should have been a three shot should have could have would have still top of the team too uh just not really feeling uh like this is mvp worthy performance here but maybe i'm selling myself short you know maybe they're giving me bonus points for finally hip firing with uh oh look i got the uh the ornament for this thing cool right [Music] went on a tear there and wouldn't you know it we're behind on points i guess i gotta go capture us his own soldier guardian whoa there guardian oh my god dude dude you're alive cause of me you're welcome oh my god he's pushing i love the aggression here run away friend run away uh they didn't chase you what the [ __ ] are these people doing using their brain thinking before they take engagements could not could not be me good never is frankly never is oh i'm burning him oh [ __ ] i'm burning him get in there come on okay wow we've got him cornered boys like a pinned animal eyes well done do they they still have one super there's a behemoth waiting for the opportune time to strike and when he does he may very well turn the tide of this dude i stop i got another hit marker there i did boy you did boy come on now come on all right push yeah he's in a well i guess oh check this out though sheesh oh no oh no let's go great stuff guys holy yo i'm so weak oh what come on we're four points behind come on lads we have zone advantage we have everything we could want oh my god let's go nice super stupid i'm grabbing i'm grabbing the point this is huge oh they're grabbing it oh see no no no i'm throwing what we traded we're one point ahead don't die no no wait you i can't believe you've done this like the one game i actually pay attention and try and you know witness the game by objective scoring stuff yeah score okay look at that efficiency okay look most opponents it's cause look they just had zone advantage we outfragged them but we didn't look bro you know it's bad when on top of the team with most zones captured if i've captured the most sons i'm gonna say it you've done something wrong team and that i mean that as a slight to me not you guys mr fruit we demand that you play clash you're playing the objective have you forgotten your purpose in life it's to not play the objective you fool slay my son slay as you command my master yo that reminds me too they're making at the game awards they showed it was just like a cinematic trail whatever but announced a golem game because we were talking about lord of the rings earlier who wants to play as gollum for an entire game what do you do you go around and then you just wait until they're not looking or sleeping and bashing people's heads in with a rock maybe one before they wake up and you have to run away because you call them yeah maybe there's just not something i'm not seeing in there you know who's to say dude okay we're playing that game huh dude ran me ruined my passing holy damage batman sure what are you sure what was that i'm gonna i'm gonna have to check your uh your personnel we really just my whole team was over there you guys just let him through the gates huh battle for helm's deep clearly did not go well didn't even hold the wall for a second come on lats skirt check this out ready they're not gonna see us coming oh my god i got a shotgun kill we know that never happens it doesn't really make sense it's just i'm for whatever reason the fudge was that that man had to be invisible hey gore i am gorba i'm so happy you're excited about who you are but uh gore i'm gonna need you to do something here buddy i am fruit see we are one and i'm sure groot's around here too you guys would be best friends but but for the time be shape up soldier boys okay well name oh how about no thank you i'm out what let me ask that boner is invisible you know what's worse than a boner an invisible boner well okay maybe a random boner in a public space or you know in in class but but next would be an invisible boner actually well i mean if we're talking real world snares that might be best because then no one would know right and then it wouldn't be as embarrassing but that's not the point it's supposed to be an insult here okay i'm gonna die frankly i i need help you can freaking who added stasis to this i want to have a 1v1 okay i do i know we've had stasis for like two two and over two one i don't actually know how long i don't know it's felt like forever and a lot of you have probably gotten over and accepted it and i know it's also been nerfed but i still hate it it's such an unfun mechanic you see i just don't like hip firing though because i feel like i just can't really run a gun even though wouldn't that let me run a gun more than ads i don't know these are the questions we must ask but i don't in fear of the answer because i already know it and it's not favorable for me so i don't want to hear it sticks and stones may break my bones but if i don't hear your words you'll never hurt me check this out ready you shall not pass stupid give me that give me that one rocket shot yes oh jeez oh my god i should kill him that's crazy what dude what he died from the so wacky man like what's the big idea okay i got five over here it ain't me getting me it ain't me i ain't no laggy son of a gun it ain't me it ain't me i actually have internet provider i can't blame everybody though i'm lucky that in my area they offer fiber most areas people aren't so lucky them it's not like they choose to have potato well no yeah nobody chooses to have potato internet it's not a choice oh my god though i suck man that's a shotgun bro how do you mess with point blank y'all don't look at how laggy is you saw that right i'm doing the the glitch step you invisible freaking bruh give it up you're not man enough to fight me face to face are you show yourself demon those looking to hide always have something to hide what are you hiding i wonder yeah i got you yo everything about the titan shoulder charge sucks man i swear to god holy get him get him get him look at these names we got in our team oh look at me lana rogue lightbearer that i am goro do you gotta be kidding me [Music] no thank you i see where is he is he still here is it safe to come out now nice crouch shot stupid mikey wrote more like stupido got him all right i need an advantageous time to pop my ass superior but i'm not i make my own opportune moments laughing dude i swear to god i thought they were spawning over here oh i swear i messed up oh no look out my face man got me fish yeah oh i ran out whoa you missed you should have aimed for the head is that ours i can't there's so many purple orbs man yo any any uh any orbital lighters any orb no okay you you appear to be tethered though that ain't friendly you guys good you got the kill look at my assist oh you gotta be kidding me where you at nice good finish good finish great help stay strong stupid oh what that whatever whatever i am fruit made to patron tank he's super stupid he's pissed i'm pissed for him haha i've worked my whole entire game for the super finally i will be able to pop out i don't know what i'm shooting but i what the where did you get hit from what they threaded the needle i'm coming no i'm not that's a golden gun no jesus guys we're so bad both of us man i refuse to hit fire with the shotgun maybe that's probably i always try and ats with it maybe you don't gotta finesse like that sometimes let jesus take the wheel it's exhausting always being dude okay well it doesn't there's a disconnect between my brain and my motor functions whenever i'm using a shotgun like it was simple it's just like okay we're going to turn we're going to shoot but then for whatever reason it's like a shoot turn turn shoot uh and then we just do it in some like wrong order at the wrong to i don't know for whatever reason my brain just refuses to connect the two you know i think he's trying to tell me like do you don't belong in that shotgun you're better than that am i though a top of the team again top fragger again best streak almost best efficiency so there you have it all right i hip five with the dead man's tail probably would have helped in that trials video moving forward if i do it again i will remember that so thank you maybe next time a little more constructive you know a little less destructive on the criticism but that's okay why tear someone down when you can build a mod you know love you guys [Music] [Music] you
