everyone get over here get the nova shield huh this you we're seeing some mixed results here this man is invisible my dead corpse carve a path buddy carve a path i'm walking heidi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and in today's video it's a great day because it's new great weapon day ignore the fit it's it's not my best but it's just what i had to rock for the day one contest mode raid so it is what it is today we're gonna be looking at the brand new raid pulse rifle insidious now across three clears i've only had it drop for me once and this is the roll so this is the one we're gonna be rocking with today however all the raid weapons are craftable they each take five deep sight weapons though and it looks like at most you can buy one every week per account it's not important point is you're probably not going to craft most of these for a very very long time so who cares in the meantime this is what i got this is what we're using let's get to it i like the aesthetic some people complain uh stublocky i don't like it well guess what i don't like you i'm sorry i didn't mean that but it's just like you know we all have opinions i respect yours you respect mine let's get on with it we have full bore or small bore yeah maybe smallborn appended mag or flared magwell actually probably flared magwell dragonfly which is look we're obviously gonna be going in pvp so i just have to warn you i all these are butts for it's it's not a pvp roll but i want to see how it how the gun just is in pvp anyway so anyway dragonfly you know the drill vorpal weapon might be good for some pve not well you know how often am i shooting guardians with their super active with this thing probably never frankly but the cool raid weapon origin trait soul drinker gain health based on the number of hits before reloading it's not a crazy heel but it's a heal nonetheless and that's pretty big for pvp i think just that little bit can be the difference as reload speed i'm not gonna i'm not gonna mess with that as for what i'll throw on here maybe ah counterbalance sure the one thing though i think people are underselling is how well this thing takes shaders see this it's it's a blank canvas so whatever that's kind of that's kind of nice with it you just you throw on whatever and it's it's going to shine shine brown like a duh man anyway that's it that's what we're doing i've gotten every other raid weapon i've gotten the fusion rifle i have the linear fusion rifle i have the grenade launcher uh in my vault or another character as well as the glaive the only one i'm missing is the submachine gun but i'm hoping to get it with the new weekly reset as i go through with all my characters again so let's get doing isn't that right buddy whoa okay sheesh get on with it so it's time for some control there's also team scorched this week don't have to tell you why that's not a good idea because it's what you literally just use scorch cannons now something i forgot to mention but will be important is this is an aggressive burst pulse rifle so it's that hard hitting for burst fire we'll see how i like it i'm not huge on slow rate of fire pulses but i'm also not against them because here i have like grid skipper freaking love this thing this is my kind of pulse so anyway check out the gun you got the little rotating blocks in the middle you can kind of see the the sights i'll be honest not the biggest fans up but that's irrelevant you know it's like i can see the enemy through the sights and frankly that's all i need to do and not die specifically that'd be nice ready watch this pop he was a bit more aggressive than i was anticipating i respect it though a man after my own heart a fellow ape he must be holding gme i defeated denver what but i lived there i would never do such a thing in fact funny story it's not really it it's not funny and it's not really a story in fact it's just kind of anecdotal anyway i've been watching the bachelor with my wife because she likes to watch that things and we like to you know have something we can sit down and watch with each other so we were sitting down to watch that and and it was time for the hometown dates when it gets down to like three or four girls they go back to wherever the girls families live meet the family all that kind of stuff they have a date in their hometown so this one girl is from denver oh wow okay that that that was kind of saucy i'm gonna be honest with you i like that yeah so a girl is from denver and so they have their date but it's not in denver i don't know if they're trying to be like hey look at denver oh look at what you can do they're like way up in the mountains that's not denver it's like a three or four hour drive from denver frankly and so yeah it's just like that's somebody's gonna be like ooh i wanna go i'm gonna go to denver and go go hiking and all that stuff and then you're gonna realize oh wait it's like couple hours in the foothills more into the mountains just you know the wrong wrong idea again uh that's yeah that was it i know wait that the whole thing you went that's what you meant to talk about yeah sorry okay our team is applying zero pressure look at the score what in the world i was gonna say it's like we're in a room me and you eight enemy store left seven enemy store right you know he has that work there's only six people on the enemy team it doesn't feel that way okay yeah that's a mercy all right so this was just me explaining incredibly dumb anecdotal denver story the match just re-cue here everyone get over here get the nova shield huh you're welcome okay bounce the shield didn't even get uh a hit marker oh but that's a nice nade he's getting a great suck and that's all they're getting okay now look at this line of sight this is where i thrive as i fall it does make it noticeably harder to kill something when i keep falling oh hi what a nice guy oh that pulse it could be a two burst to the dome ski i'm already like 130 on the the battle pass a lot of artifact power however wouldn't mind a little bit more before gm's get here and i know gm's are a little ways out here hold on okay i'm reloading but i how did you not hit me once dude if i wait a little bit he'll hurt me then i can reload and show off the soul drinker thing slight problem never hit me it's like what are we doing here why why are you guys sucking now oh but that's a nice nade that's going to go through the barricade i think he's he's a second barricade how does he do that that's most impressive this you we're seeing some mixed results here okay that was a the wrong hot swap okay i don't know why i reloaded i'm doing everything poorly okay check soul drinker you see that i know you're like wait what instant replay i know it's just like a little boop but we only had a couple shots in the burst but they healed us that's it it did happen this man is invisible a year in what was he invisible to jesus zone be captured well just wait until they get captured by my charm mm-hmm they're gonna be like holy cow this man has it all he's charismatic he's he's gorgeous most importantly here's the raid pulse look at that heal off that off that pulse look at that soul drinker dude that's insane what was that like a one percent heal different brother you like the little firefly proc too which totally again like never does anything in pvp but i did it carve a path buddy carve a path i'm walking we're walking we're talking you're super and you're killing he's invisible he's ah shoot the thing man shoot it okay you just got killed you're telling me before my super melee charge could register his shotgun shot and melee registered before my dead corpse is the thing that killed him just the velocity which it it just be lined up dude this scent this sentinel shield throw all by the way garbage hot garbage i don't know who shipped this and is like hey we're gonna we're gonna literally give it negative magnetism it's going to be repulsed from the enemy you throw it at because it's that's exactly what it does jesus christ all right run to me not all of you not all of you there's there's never just one man there's never just it's never just it you know that guy's a gamer when he's higher level season pass than me and i i've done like nothing with my life past like two weeks except be depressed double kill oh my god the double fist somebody call me mr fister i'd be from your sister i'm sorry i saw the opportunity i had to take it but it doesn't mean i needed to take it there's difference you know i i need to have some discretion but i didn't and that's shame on me he's weak throwing that over there punch what what is with this dude and being able to just like instantaneously shock and melee what what is he using slide shot opening shot quick access good lord that would be why titan and it's a drop am i biased and be a little salty yeah okay i'm top of the team and i think you guys can attest to the fact that that's sad because you've been watching me it's not like i've been mvp contender gameplay over here what is this tunnel vision rangefinder you know i i mean that's a perk made for me tunnel vision yeah irl and in-game must not turn in bodies what level am i i'm 126 apologies in 126. i disgust myself which is why i'm headed into rumble pray for me you know the prediction okay we're both terrible but soul drinker got me like no health back that's incredible why are you crouching good sir hello who spawned here hey actually wait what are you afk i don't think you're afk i should approach it as if you're not frankly i don't know what you're doing yeah i don't know what that was all right mothman out here is out here smurfing on some people come on guys um he's gonna challenge me on a five kill spree he challenges he he appears to not be challenging and uh an interesting twist turn of events there he is oh and there's that pulse out of range you hit the head you're gonna profit uh well i mean and it was mock man okay how close are you because you're more of a range kind of guy ooh an overweight unicorn i'm not gonna i'm not gonna body shame weight shame the unicorn you know unicorn can do whatever it wants don't let me stop you mr unicorn big fan like i said hey if you're happy i'm happy buddy dude look at that shield man like just no tracking it doesn't it's still late it doesn't even try man all i'm asking for is you to try bro come on where you at okay but actually like what what oh yes all according to plan isn't it uh lobby where why am i having such a hard time finding anyone is that what are we doing here there are other people in this game yes okay all right that dudes afk xp farming i guess is that who you've been farming mothman honest with me you can be honest it's okay look you're gonna throw that nade you think you have the advantage i have overshield and i'm in pain outgunned outplayed outskilled outmaneuvered out mechanic out outed outback steakhouse oh my goodness i'll be here all day nice take that come sail away come sail away hey yo what up okay see you see how that okay well i don't need my melee to track that aggressively i mean that's a little agreed just you know it is a super so okay this guy is afk and he just is this the dude that's afk for me wait what this is beautiful wait what we wait what i was on a 20 kill spree uh i definitely forgot about that part what do you know okay it's a good thing i guess i didn't completely troll well i did completely troll frankly but i didn't die while trolling yeah i guess uh some of all tears we ran out of metals free-for-all game ah it's a pretty good testament to farming afk let's not reap the script after the uh a testament to the new raid pulse insidious pvp power even though none of these perks matter at all and like none of them activated it's just here's the here's the thing about destiny okay and i think some people forget this perks enhance a weapon but sometimes just having the weapon is good enough because it's just good and then some of the perks will help but sometimes only marginally they help you know push that little bit but this is just this is just good okay you know maybe it's the gun maybe it's me maybe it's maybelline you know who i don't know who's to say i should have gotten a pinnacle wow great stuff yep that's the pinnacle grind is just atrocious like this this is my life just the same ones over and over and over anyway that's the video we'll do some more raid weapons later on specifically to the smg uh i'll show off that we don't have many kinetic fusion rifles this one's stasis show this off the linear is a linear yeah show off the glaive too though huh huh yeah all right yeah sounds good see you guys in the next one very well [Music] [Music] you
