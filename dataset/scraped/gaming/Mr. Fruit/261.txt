heidi everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell i'm so excited to have you all here today as we embark on a grand adventure one that has you know fingers crossed been going pretty well so let's hopefully keep this going shall we let's just get into it yeah where we left off we spent all of our gold we um well we went with five here instead of six we're gonna see if that um pans out or not hopefully it'll be okay we have a lot of materials to be using we're getting attacked by three sides now but we know we only have to put one person over here so i kind of need to figure out who is that the person is going to be i think i just keep these fellas over here right probably you my new short bow fiend could probably just go like right here probably right man i don't know or um well i'm trying to think so this can't be alone this is definitely support actually that's not true he has support but druid honestly at this point could just straight up take on everybody by himself doing 84 poison damage for four turns it's pretty good pretty good nine propagation yeah however maybe the blaze single-handedly taking people on is to play as long as they group up a good bit we should be okay but the problem is if they don't group up uh we're not really one shot in anybody how big of an issue is that i didn't look man wise man wise i think we're okay it might be hard for us to single aside with the crossbow if that's the case because we'd be using like at least three mana every turn and that's three turns so that's not great but you're just default short bow you know i believe in yeah no no do i not right i don't know maybe you've got crazy crit you know screw it monica go on with your bad self show them what you got girl do your chain hang on do it bubble to the floor do it shine in the light is it platinum is it gold you got it girl so screw it yeah i think this will uh tentatively be our go-to and then if somebody needs to help they can maybe possibly i'm not entirely sure we're gonna upgrade we're gonna upgrade we're gonna upgrade we're gonna help you out here girl trust let's uh improve our defenses give you the best fighting chance gonna have to start putting up watch towers everywhere um and then let's repair okay now let's build some defenses all right for worst case scenarios we'll have it like this you're gonna need a gate and they put one over there maybe yeah a little they're a little weak but just in case i don't know like where they're gonna be coming from you know which side we're gonna have to be pivoting towards so just in case um i'm you know i'll just give the free mana regen to you now you can blaze your hearts away friend aside from that we should probably build more stonewalls here we don't need any walls now well everything's a little weak over here we might just want to oh yeah yeah yeah yeah why does it take so much to repair all these fillers well this might be like all of our thing at this point with the food okay so we could make them even greater walls or i could add some defense but it's just that the ballistas and stuff have never ah they haven't blown me away is there any point to them i wonder these warp gates are an interesting idea though i might mess around with these warp gates right now do a warp gate like right here and put another one over here sure in case we need the skirt skirt and go help somebody i don't know if that's the best choice but it's a little late for that there's nothing to upgrade there blisters i can't afford anymore anyway so let's just start upgrading these walls i reckon they look so nice when they're not all rusted out oh that's beautiful that's all my materials though so godspeed god shave the queen you're gonna stay right there i don't think they can get to you that could be a dirty filthy lie and it probably is but i think we got enough watchtowers excuse me i think we're ready to go oh gosh excuse me again all right army you guys up for no particular reason you might actually need it but i really want to try and get another perfect night so here's to hoping position your heroes heroes better now everybody's in there watchtower see i would put you in a watchtower but we need to give you more skill range which you have none of so you're gonna kind of duke it out man see come on give me your best put your dukes up oh my god with the mist push back look at this ladies and gentlemen oh my god this is crazy actually i've never had it back this far i don't know where you're going you're going that way i guess we could blaze right now and um kill absolutely nobody due to uh the fact that no one's cooked up there's no propagation to be had here but it should still be a decent amount of damage so screw it pop pop oh my the grinch all right i'm not worried about you you got that side girl get on with your bad self um they're they're out there pretty far chief not gonna lie uh that's i can't target that so maybe like this easy now look at us creating everything left and right you'll love to see it boots dodged you don't like to see that fifteen percent oh jesus i even threw on some accuracy if i'm not mistaken at least i thought i had do i have oh yeah i have line of sight because i'm in a watchtower dude um you want to take that out thanks pal you can't hit anything else well we could then i'll just save your mana even though i don't really need to save much um he's glad all right so far so good doing a good job of staving off the devils oh that's four of them that's pretty good can we we can hit you normally yeah let's do that take that tree you menace okay wow okay wow wow i don't know let's go out of here but wow um you know if they only bunch up over here the druid's gonna have a bit of a hard time doing anything thanks to this watchtower maybe i should just literally line the back of the watchtower apparently i don't know all right so i guess it's up to you do anything um to do this again not really necessary so i think i'll just do this and then uh kill you before you get your armor back you are unable to do well you could do that less armor and less dodge is what are the only thing i can reach so why not they'll take one mana but i think with our 36 remaining will be just fine all right nine action points remaining yeah well that's not my fault turns out when they're out that far yeah it's hard to do much i i don't have things that reach that oh shoot oh we got exploders and the oh shoot and the ghouls got freaking whatever gobble goops those guys you barely see them the ones that debuff everyone and their mom um i could debuff everybody here i still can't reach anyone oh yeah can we i don't know scooch our boots that way a little bit that would be fantastic um you know he could jump the wall i might do that i might do that all right let's look at that in a second because first i'll do here here here here get that to propagate twice ah fudge but it crit of course it did absolute fragger um how far can these guys move so i might not have to worry about exploding them yet although they require so much raw a damage that might be our issue um just kill you i guess how much poison damage we're doing 52 not quite enough so let's focus this guy give me the crits big all right so i can actually use you to explode on somebody next turn that's high you chill out right there there's a giant horde of them whatever will we do perhaps we'll absolutely poop on them all years oh that's good that's looking good oh baby you're dead that doesn't one shot but that does god you need much damage and literally no one is um wait this has no dodge oh it does oh i did not know that wow what the fudge when did that happen the short ball always had no dodge it's nuts paper nice that means we could snipe this guy for once oh but i kind of want to snipe that feller um but i would have to isolate him which i cannot successfully do oh if i could just do one more let me acting up tell you what [Music] yeah no good targets here so i'll just do this and tell that then you my friend what do you want to do how much damage are we talking you're gonna do a good amount we could disable everybody not that we really need to though i wish i could hit that guy whatever take out the big the big and then hurt you a little bit hurt you a little bit and then next turn through armor i should be able to finish you guys off one man at each one a piece uh screw it we're doing it i'm here to help do not fear oh yeah yeah we got a lot coming in here i tell you what ideally i leave this side to our friend right here let's see what shenanigans we can get up to how about some bees yeah that's that uh that'll do it chief it's pretty good um i'll just do that so we get the extra damage on the debuff because we're opportunistic the poison will kill him uh so what else do we want to do yeah we're kind of chill we don't have to do anything well unless i can do that there we go uh that looks pretty good then i need that thing to get a little bit closer because in four shots i don't think i could kill it actually it's possible i just don't know that's what i want to rely on um that's only bad sure finish you off and uh we'll maim you some more so you can only move two so you should be better bunched with everybody so i can punish uh one thing i did not think about though is this debuffer might get close enough to debuff him which would be annoying hopefully that's not the case only one way to find out survey says yes yes you did okay if it was action points i'm gonna be pushed and of course it was because he can choose to give less resistance less action points or damage and they always do less action points than boners what's the big idea holy jesus what the fudge one two three four splitters two exploders good lord all right well who peed in your cornflakes chase so 100 i um reach all right yeah i'm just going to uh deal as much damage to this as possible high roll with that reliability pog good damage we'll take it take it or leave it and uh yeah we take it all right i'll chill on our mana now for a little bit uh just one shot you and one shot you you gotta clean that guy and that guy up uh kill that guy and i can't reach him with our solo shot but i can with him and i can guarantee a kill or now i can just i'm worried this runner might be a boner and go to the left but even if he does do i care that much i could just debuff them all too yeah i think i'll just kill um just let's just kill the left right and maybe i should oh they only have 20 armor it's not a big deal all right propagation looks pretty decent here although oh i for oh yeah he's omega i forgot minus movement points i apply that every time poor guy ain't going anywhere um could probably get here here and twice here oh he looked just in time oh that's perfect kill you kill you kill you or not kill you rude not bad uh let me go one closer kill you and then work towards killing you which we did successfully dude the crits man monica with her creatine ability is insane in the membrane we want to propagate everywhere here of course let's start over here stupid oh my god yeah you're dead uh poison kills you too jesus bro dude staff is nuts when you get that poison go like literally the poison is so much everyone just gets one shot it's incredible we are out of uh action points though so i'm just i think i can chill right here uh i'm going to i'm debating that looks well that looks pretty good i don't need to debate that uh finish you well let's wrassle that fell up i can't reach any of these guys without using more mana which i guess i have plenty what am i worried about i could just kill him um because everyone else over here is dead yeah i might as well right sure god i'm telling you this is the run and if it's not then god speed because i don't know how i'm ever gonna like if i can't win with this what the fudge am i gonna win with uh but it's time for bees oh my god it's so good i can bees over here just won't do much a bee's right here though looks pretty saucy don't mind if i do so oh you're not quite dead well we'll just have to do something about that now won't we let's kill you uh and we'll just finish you up that guy won't get that close um i don't know what the deal is over here with all these people running up like hello i don't know but i'm not okay with it i can't can't get many of them whatever that'll do they'll have to get closer eventually right and when they do i'll smite them explode shoe damage you and then actually i think i think i'll just wrestle my druid this way and he can take care of these pipes why not now you my friend oh we got some good blaze targets we got to be careful though because always seems like i have to be careful about where i put my thing because we always kill so here here this guy probably won't die and then damage you yeah see ah fudge i already killed that thing we're just too good okay i should crit those and i think that'll kill them okay i did not crit that guy's incredible uh let's go like that make sure i kill you overkill but not going to complain and then that should take care of you holy monica this dual crossbow you're nutty armor up girl you deserve it all right well i don't really like what i'm looking at here but we got to do what we got to do hope i kill this thing 19 hell that's fine cubby's got so many freaking people man i need to like hurt these people but then i just gotta take care of these people wait that one shot the boomer thing wait oh we must have critic good low okay let's just take care of you oh my all right nevermind i figured out how i'll take care of these good golly mrs molly oh my god i don't know what's going on i just know that it's going rather well screw you dodger no dodge for you uh yeah okay it's freaking go i'm feeling good they've hit the wall for the first time oh wait wait wait wait if that's minus action points they just come out of left field though like how am i it is it is but we still got five i think we're still fine okay so if i blaze here blaze here blazing okay yeah it's looking pretty good to me huh not bad yeah all right let's go and armor up you're done next we're almost on the last wave too let's uh hit this oh out of range oh just barely that would have been what jet nails we'll just do this crit the booming oh my god we did if we click these things man it's not even fair let's see if i crit this oh i did but it survived that's unclear well i'll just explode uh and then let's see if we can two-shot you or okay we'll just create you yeah this um freaking critting when they're max health or whatever is extra crit it's yeah that's paying off rather well let me tell you paying off in the dense uh let's just kill you you're good you're good all right we'll take care of this let's start with some sauce over here um kill this and see how much aoe does decent amount let's propagate the bees the birds and the bees they propagate the bees propagate over here they're practically all dead oh my gosh so then he's yeah he's actually dead okay easy enough so what can you hit you can hit this guy so then i'll take care of this guy it'll take two hits but uh is there anything really threatening not really all just taking care of business everywhere taking care of business i'm working overtime wow make sure yeah holy night a i hardly knew her wait quit hitting the walls though what's my favorite wall you know i was worried there's gonna be another one of them rascals all right but that that's it as far as uh people the very few i see left in the mist is all there is so let's see if we can't blaze it up this should one shot all of you guys that's value if i've ever seen it um there there there okay i'm not much damage to him but uh wow yeah okay this is going pretty well let's just make sure the guy in the front can't get to me but they can also literally just reduce all their movements so poorly that they just can't do anything so actually i'm gonna make sure i kill this guy perfect we're at a man because of the minus two but he can't move and then there's like one more on the way so we're fine just some more mana here um that's pretty good uh we can save the exploders not uh exactly worried about them right now that's more value uh kill you anybody that dares approach too close you're dead you're already dead i'll snipe this guy well or do i even need to ah fudge well now i must make a choice i don't want you to hit my wall that is the choice i make oh but then i can yeah okay great so over here we have to decide what we want to do you're gonna die to poison next turn and poop all over your teammates so that's nice so let's see let's let's start propagating first can't quite reach propagate here oh i thought you would probably oh that was my bad um i'm worried if i propagate here it'll go to the left and i'm worried if i propagate here it'll go here i'm going to start in the back but i don't have a line of sight i'll fudge okay don't have a choice let's hope it goes like that it did okay nice nice um then i'll just kill that and you won't die to poison so i'll just make sure you did now let this guy take care of that um let's see let's just do that pop you pop you and hurt you because i hate you and you're minus jp nonsense and that's practically it holy breath i think my mistake was always not upgrading getting to the point where i was able to upgrade the shop and get hired to your items because that is yeah definitely making a difference let me tell you let me tell you something let me tell you something you're all dead drop a gate there they're all dead got one guy away in the back here he did now you did now you did um i'll just armor pierce you for the fun of it okay seven left one two three four five six seven they're all right here what do you know let's get you to snipe this one it lives but barely please some more of our [Music] mana maybe crit nope one luckers might as well resign pop the weasel okay well pop the weasel uh let's see if we can it's so weak i think we can finish everything off here though we're just about be one and uh short one action point rip rip feeling good man uh let me just absolutely disrespect this man with the snipe overkill what are you talking about a perfect knight seven in fact probably one of the least damages to the wall i've ever had during the night as well miguel leveled level night level zero hp lost oh give it to me oh yeah keep going i don't know why i don't get a bonus for that but another the night reward for this better be sick but we're at over four thousand essence brother that's pretty good hey that's pretty good oh night eight well that was easy okay you dare push the fog back against me i'll push it back further get all of our production stuff now let's see what we can get here give me an epic no okay only tier twos though wait what is this what do i look like to you guys is that a short bow oh that's a short ball with extra accuracy and reliability radbert that looks like a fine bow and arrow for you yeah better damage yeah that's freaking sick what does this give magic dodge armor armor magic man this gives dodge nine percent range damage ten percent accuracy hold up and but i still think just right yeah i feel like that's that this is just better we'll take that and i'll go ahead and give this to red because you deserve it buddy do you want to give it a cal wait should i give this to calm why does this do so much oh because it's a plus three never mind we'll keep that how it is we carry on carry on my way works [Music] i forget what i was using my tanted essence towards but i think i was just unlocking things that i could right away right sheesh or action points not just plus seven on everybody from the get-go oh here we go more heavy armors done more cloth pants i love cloth pants whatever i'm just buying the things i can buy in one go cause it makes me feel bougie more hammers that's a big i only want more weapons for things that are actually good i should point to wealthy you know i'll go for wealthy haven this gives us an even better start you know it helps our economy even more have a here reach level 10. commander armor and commander boots heck yeah brother well you know what time it is it's time to let it level up all right i still haven't given you better range damage but maybe it's time or ah yeah why not i'm gonna say maybe i could get you some more crit that'd be nice let's just go accuracy oh now you get the last level oh ho ho five percent chance for generating an action point i have to what did wait that's like that's really good oh my god yeah uh no brainer there miguel leveled up of course he did with his 175 experience gain you want more mana i think you have enough or does he because have i i haven't taken magic fuel yet i could double cheek up this boy with some magic damage i'll tell you what i'm gonna do that now where's my where's my um i have to take this accuracy all my freaking extra poison damage mean x is good energized is good laying the critical hit regenerates mana that's pretty freaking good but uh screw it i'm doing it what are we gonna get 22 percent holy breath that's that seems pretty good 69 holy bro jesus man ain't playing around what are what are you durand you could you could get specialist and actually i think that's what i'm going to do because i never use your crossbow anyway yep good old specialist let's level you up that's a lot of range damage chief you're almost at 50. wait what the have you cr have you passed called stun chance wait no this is just move and damage could just go with flat damage critical power reliability let's go critical power i guess all right that's that there's 720 gold um not for long yes yes yes yes 1200 gold all right push the fog back at this point it almost seems excessive and i'm here for it all right i have five more workers now i got to be careful with how i use my workers because i could like i'm probably gonna need to give at least you some mana upgrades benediction that's pretty good there you go all right well for now that should be plenty for you do i am i missing what do we miss in here i can build another scavenger's camp i think i will but where should i put it um to put it here i think i'll put it there um i think it's gonna get a little claustrophobic and we do have only people coming from this side now our weakest side unlockers i'm just thinking about maybe not doing it here because i could put a big building here i just don't know if there's any big building i need to put there whatever too late i did it well done okay we did that i'm not gonna bother to upgrade the guess who thing because whatever right you know i just kind of roll with whatever we get anyway what are the other structures magic shop bower blacksmith armor maker i already have one armor maker could go with a bower i should [Music] well before anything selling ratio sure all right shops fully upgraded uh what do we have here oh look at this adapts druidic staff extra opportunity uh but nah the mana daily main region extra magic damage here we like too much although it's not bad um okay we got a long bow which no one has this wooden rifle um could be better than this gives ten percent reliability but this just more damage because of the higher tier oh tier four oh shut up mr fruit yeah that's way better probably gonna swoop that thirty percent healing received but minus twenty percent experience uh a simple amount no eleven percent extra critical what are you wearing brad bert you got just plus three mana oh we might fix that we're not gonna change that durander radburt wants the warren greaves i think oh shoot more critical greater accuracy too this gives a lot of everyone everyone's armors kind of sucks butts so this 25 reliability and nine percent critical holy bran hold up makes me think before i do anything let's upgrade the level i'm trying to think how much let's improve passive production and then let's do this this this okay i'm maxed out now okay this should be edge right let's do that we're gonna get tier fives all across the board well for the most part this for tier five what the fudge i guess you get a movement point and nine mana but that's kind of lame what the fudge all this is butts fat well that one it doesn't really seem to be a question uh i could use more workers here if i want but i could also just get some materials here any other structures i want i don't think so i could make another manual but i need that temple uh i don't need at all nobody's hurting call my s is missing somehow why is called missing somehow wait maybe i should because did i give him what full health extra liability yes okay well never mind give me a second we're gonna make the temple the gods have spoken where do i want to put it oh my god oh wait what the why is it so what oh i thought it was going to be like the man a while what the fudge is this atrocity the heck only one place i can put it uh i think i'm just gonna get rid of this right i think so just just as strong just demolishing in with you whatever i've got better uses for my workers now get a daddy get rid of all your nonsense okay like i was saying oh now that frees up a lot oh yeah here we go unlocks our from belly and it's free oh perfect that's what we're looking for oh wait you're weak oh well how weak oh well you're fine all right use that on you all right now everybody's full health because do you have cherry picking too you do now everybody's got double cheeked up reliability all right so now i think that's that's it for buildings unless i want to do another armor or a bower i think we're kind of chilling i think i'll spend the rest of my money in the shop and whatnot um let's do this see what else we get now we're talking 13 magic damage and 10 experience pretty good resistance dodge block resist okay so i guess this is what we're going with well the only person with magic damage would be you but see you already at poison damage well then i guess i can just sell this looks like this will give me the most amount of money so if i buy new gear wait jesus i can sell this bag for 50 is that right what oh my god yeah whoa wait i could just play the economy this way hello let me just make sure there's no one that wants this right i mean we literally have one magic user and i would rather give him poison he's got plenty of magic damage as is this would put him at 82 percent which is kind of hilarious but nah oh but wait wait wait wait what the fudge am i doing wait buy another hero you boner holy brap totally forgot well that was plus okay level nine what is this a cell you come with trinket slot magic damage resistance -10 armor and you have a druid staff yo i mean i'm down for another druid user i'ma be honest chief you have moving point range damage dodge magic damage resistance dodge um you have everything daily mana okay eight percent magic damage moves holy cow but you're only level four but that arc mage stats nuts thirty experience i think we go with this guy it was like the worst stats but he comes level 9 which is nice um yeah and then see that's why i didn't sell the trinket because now i'll just give it to him because he comes with a poopoo trinket but now he has great trinket and who needs this and i'm going to hold on well let's get to work here uh avid learner uh initiator of course what uh where is where did i go with you oh right poison damage um thrifty of course uh cherry picking uh specialist first blood right yep and then x big pog and we're going to go buy use new gear because we're going to give you the new druid staff that was in the store bop now you're fragging my son suddenly he's killing it all right now maybe we'll get like omega rolls on this dude yeah none of which are here yet but you know in time i mean sure i mean yeah i guess oh my god extra action point don't mind if i do oh uh gamer alert what the fudge holy cow we're not rolling poise or anything but i mean i think you're doing all right oh okay that's not bad one more attribute amber get cam gamba ah fudge gamba gambo man of this actually wait this is your last one oh oh all right we'll take it oh wait what oh we get to pick eight oh fudge oh i oh my god propagation bounces i know he could get poison damage but i think propagation better right now okay whoops yeah i would not have um done all those refreshes that's embarrassing you give you even more opportunistic but accuracy is just fine with me amber opportunistic propagation damage yes please 20 actually opportunistic why not because your thing gives you another 19. another propagation bounce okay ah and if you oh poison damage yo a cells freaking cracked with 49 opportunistic as well okay okay mr mana movement let's see we currently have that whereas monica has this an extra movement more block and dodge might not be bad because you actually have to be in the frame we're gonna do that so then we're selling all the rest here we're maxed on heroes things are looking pretty pretty good gonna be honest i got one more worker what do i want to do with you ebd uh some more gear so thinking we'll just grab oh wait wait i didn't grab this today yeah i think we're gonna grab this give you this rifle and then sell all this we don't need that uh trinket sucks pee pee poo poo i might actually just start getting potions now because i got nothing better to do with my money is pog um let's get you let's get you you and we're almost out of money uh maybe i should hold off on the uh ocean idea but i definitely think it's worth it uh let's focus uh pants who doesn't have any good pants you have good pants you have to pay and see if the pants you guys not so extra critical wasn't there accuracy yeah here we go yeah we're going to give you the extra accuracy then who wants extra crate you already have 22 so let's give you 33 it looks pretty solid to me then we have crit and reliability with someone who doesn't have a good torso you definitely don't and extra reliability which would put you at 85. yes please and sell all that back okay i can buy some potions or i could buy upgrades are there any upgrades i want i can't really buy many upgrades but i don't really want that i don't want that oh wait wait wait my last worker i should do this okay so this is the weak side good to know that was a close call wasn't it so who 80 extra damage for a turn that's kind of nuts 10 mana everybody has plenty of mana let me like let me just scroll real quick i guess monica's lacking like literally everyone else okay so i'll give you uh forgetting this thing there you go and then go for raw damage yeah who's just pooping out damage right now i think our best raw damage is called the money wrong just throw that on him i go looking pretty freaking good if i have to say so myself now let's fortify this wall does that yeah defense over here ain't looking quite as up the snuff um yeah i didn't realize but if i'm gonna upgrade a wall i should repair it at its early stages first because it gets a lot more expensive so i'm actually just gonna destroy these because i can't repair them there health-wise i mean most these walls are looking okay so then let's make some more watch towers one right here one right here one right there a little excessive maybe screw it nobody's getting past this all right look at those yeah that's what i call excessive let's get it nobody should be coming from over here uh i think we're all right maybe a little too many there but that's okay do rune or uh another warp gate just in case right there and then as far as other defenses i think we're doing all right we can just let's repair some notably weak walls that looks like that'll just about do yep all right i think we're ready at this point it almost takes more time just to get everything prepared in between turns because you got so much to do i used all that you saw that okay well let's get it so the interesting thing is now that i have six i can kind of throw people whoever the fudge i want right i could do two two two or three two two but it might be a little bit safer i i mean you're kind of cracked i'm right just going to keep you out here because i mean you work best with big blobs of things we'll have our new druid over here our veteran druid can go over here let me destroy this oh fudge i can't moving around that to get to this watch tower is gonna be annoying because it'll take two three four five six seven eight i think yeah i'm not gonna risk it we'll put you up in this one uh durand i don't want to split up this this uh dream team duo you know but it looks like i'm gonna have to who needs like the biggest well here's what duran do durand could flex put him over here because with his range he can kind of go hop on whatever watchtower and help out whoever he needs which means cobb um we can put you with our crossbow fiend phenom um and then rad bert um well no i need two over here for sure don't i yeah maybe rampard over here there you go redner and then and but could have drew it really solo maybe he can't maybe monica should be the one to solve this and he could potentially do three or he could warp obviously i didn't put a warp over there i think he'll be all right enter here well uh fudge but you don't have any gates here if you have to i mean you can jump i don't know why i forgot you know you can just jump walls that's a thing that can happen i don't know there's so much planning to do maybe maybe asl should be the one to flex and durand could go back with his dynamic duo and i don't know this is a really good spot for him i feel like i wish i put a warp gate here dad oh i feel like it probably doesn't require this much thinking but i'm overthinking it that much anyway all right we're gonna do this see where everyone ends up worst case actually i'll have you flex over here because you can get a watchtower and help and then this side if you have to help you warp too i think that's what we'll do all right let's use all of our armor abilities because you never know night is this going to be 99 monkeys we fear nothing right man what do we got here um [Music] well this is already a problem we have approximately 20 million runners and crawlers what the fudge and these boners are going over here oh jesus all right let's start on the solo ish side uh propagate here how many times does it propagate go like that in fact come on let's get it to a better position so you can propagate to your heart's content friend get back there propagate here okay there probably get there yeah one you can easily solo what was i thinking me of little faith dodged you can suck my pp the crate monica use sashiminx give you a little bit of a dodge why not all right druid friend looks like you're not needed anywhere over here you're gonna have to hop on down and you don't have enough you know maybe we might just make you jump over for now i can't undo that action okay oh that's a bit of a problem let's see we can do here just all these runner things are going to just get on me so fast going to prove quite problematic no crit sad okay yeah let's just get you in position not much else i can do there's not yeah none of you none of those give you vision so you just chill out uh i might decide to come over here because i'm gonna have to pick up all these stragglers i don't have a this is the only watchtower that can really cover that area um you're not in position at all for this either and i have to get you to come down so maybe [Music] for now just touch me i could get him to come out this way but then i risk getting snuck up on i'm gonna do it anyway because that yeah because that could anyone reach me here the crawlers could but i can do that i'm making myself super useful holy breath kill you by the magic power invested in me i say be gone thought be gone that's pretty solid but see i can't reach any of those boners you back here you darn oh my jesus i really can't what the fudge okay yeah we're gonna warp you over here and then i'll get you prepared to hop on this thing cuz that's about oh we can do [Music] i could get him to come off and choose some things but poison will kill you in two turns so i'll just make sure it kills you now or if i kill you now yellow i'll just take care of these and then i can go back to hiding in fact i can even climb back up if i want to which i think i will all right that didn't go so poorly all right wait 10 action all right because i know i know puppy what am i doing boy arches get off of that eh um how much movement you got broseph oh you only got five move oh what the fudge is your movement dude all right i guess we gotta get up here then all right take the shot you're doing great now speaking of doing great that looks pretty juicy to me uh is that necessary no okay the mana oh because we're gonna crit anyway hi oh [Music] sheesh sheesh she's sorry my apologies i'll just be you whatever that should kill you you know and i can't do anything so we'll just increase your dodge increase your dodge right there you're good to go you're done you're absolutely vibing because the blaze is broken i don't even know if i need to do anything else this might just kill everything yeah just two unneeded shots dang go on monica you really need to get up here though all right but now everything dies bees oh my god the propagation wait i forget how much do you propagate brother freaking nine times i i think we've just so rarely actually had a thing where we could actually propagate that much that is darn good i tell you what um i can be again it seems a bit excessive um i'll take care of these guys real quick okay maybe i won't keep up the good work that's pretty good keep up the good work wow monica you're so oh so supportive um these bonaires need to well a lot of these bone areas need to die i can't fudge one off i thought i was gonna do that you only have 20 armor i'm not worried about it we'll just wound you maybe crit you we i think we did and you just didn't die all right all right maybe i was worried for nothing we're almost halfway yeah but there's still just so many runners and crawlers man dodged stupid but i still get the debuff but you're stupid uh yeah this blaze is just like what the fudge out of range i'll be the judge of that there there there there pop go on do i need to use more mana maybe i'll do it again [Music] just want to make sure we kill these rascals oh wait wait to that let me just go here so i can throw you guys in the mix easy very nice very nice all right let's just start over here why not uh this side is seem to have the most difficulty let's uh get you to propagate everything should get like all of them yeah yeah there's a lot more of you than i thought [Music] the heck the best way to do this like most let's see like you're gonna die to poison your individual poison not quite not quite okay not quite okay so cleaning up some of these isn't a bad idea there's just so many runners and stuff man really that sucks what fudge that's not good i might have to decrease movement here or something let's just be you guys can't reach anything else unfortunately uh you'll die to poison at least [Music] i can kill you and i can at least maim you or we'll crit let's go they're all dead all right looks like you might have to go help out the other side here soon by soon i mean honestly looking like probably right now i think we've got it mainly handled you have one movement spot left supposed all right you'll get help next turn oh wait oh i thought that didn't need vision but it didn't let's propagate uh we can kind of choose a poison it's gonna go anywhere sure why not so good what the i now just need to make sure i get these guys before they run away because i left our other watch uh yeah i might just have you exit now let's see yield out a poison a poison not quite not quite but i don't have to worry about you guys hitting anything you don't have to worry about you you'll die you'll die so then reliability fog all right build fog hurt you [Music] and then yeah we'll just make sure the poison will just kill them quicker because well now they're dead i won't should be able to reach us all right so aside from this top we're all right a little dicey up here just because of all these runners but they're not doing excessive damage what calm down poopy can i get you okay we can barely get you up in time pog oh no whatever what we do well let me tell you monica hand crossbow dude i'm tell wait oh wait i missed that what the how i must oh my god i just missed that oh my god that was almost absolutely tragic what the fudge am i doing monka yo i'm killing you specifically boner screw all of you poison's gonna destroy each and every one of you and i'm here for it let's see poison will kill you you you you no not you all right now i should be able to watch all of you suffer just in case i cannot i'm going to back up but i think that's that and i'll go over here just in case i need to warp you're good here all right now let's see how i can be of i'm assistance a 76 dodge what the fudge is wrong with this thing stupid crawlers man good lord um get you to propagate everybody propagates let's just go back there i guess see what happens roll the dice nice all right we need to kill this bunch up here fudge me all right no dodge for you uh son you're the worst all right well i gotta kill this thing in the back before it gets out of hand can't hit these things man freaking nutty dodge all right these walls are going to take a bit of a beating uh i don't think anyone else is coming so i'll go try and be of assistance looks like this is mainly the last of them all right oh it's not too bad we're doing all right let's make sure no one else showed up nope this should just be it i'm gonna take a chance just die die die no dodge do that we'll do that and then propagate that'll kill all those uh if we come around here yeah yeah you can do it all night i know i know crits too strong can't do anything else uh no one else can reach but that's okay because it shouldn't be able to do anything all right holy brap a perfect night nine let's go holy ladies and gentlemen i'm telling you we are on the cusp of greatness level 9 overlay we lost 80 hell only because that one stupid placement i had that was my bad i don't know why i don't get a little bit more there but it's a lot a lot of materials chief how much essence i didn't even pay attention probably nearly five thousand huh oh we eating today baby oh oh my god wait now they're coming from each side what oh so oh my god all right that happened fashion i thought it would all right give me something good armor maker what the fudge i mean the tears are good i paid for that but where's the rarity the butts absolute butts a little bit better but not great uh this fetches us the most coin so i'll just sell it and survey says wow these suck man well actually most people don't have a helmet though i think i'm just gonna take a helmet literally out of principle hole oh minus one scale range no it's not worth a lot of dodge but yeah we're gonna go with this propagation damage critical and dodge so which one of you rascals wants the propagation damage oh you yes you look fine in your mail cover i know i have enough but i'm probably gonna put it toward the wealthy haven again i'm investing in my future runs right now oh so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the backstage only three more nights can he do it storage 75 health how much are you missing that much perfect oh i need to heal kalb i'll give you the free one i don't know how you lost health rad burn how did you lose health ah whatever if i have to mana wise honestly oh two free uses of benediction don't mind if i do because then bob and let's see should give it a rapper calm we'll give it a call oh i can get crack ton more gold we know that by now so i think i should probably start completely maxing my scavengers games i don't know if i need to get this much gold anymore but at this point like my my workers are a more valuable asset as you can see i'm missing one house upgrade okay perfect um i can't even use all of these but it's a lot more waiting for us there if we need to obviously push back the mesh i'm almost back to the border baby i gotta do this let's see okay so we're gonna do one person here one person here two person here two person here two people i don't know why i said it weird like that you know what i meant recruit new heroes i can't even if i wanted to armor what are we doing i'll make it so that oh my god in between night they produce three holy jesus that's that's pretty good um uh i don't know yeah i'm at this weird spot where it's like dang i'm just kind of kind of stacked so at this point i might as well get like a bower right i think so because we use plenty of bows i'll tell you that much uh before i grab this let me see if this works upgrade tier upgrades here so should be tier three to tier four yeah it didn't work i could sell you for 23 gold sick l cell oh i didn't even check the shop magic scepter suck priest helmet daily managing man and dodge not bad cause i have no helmets um oh extra multi-hit and damage that's what monica has but this one gives us eight percent extra damage uh hold on i'm thinking because if i thinking if how i can make like extra money potentially but i don't think i can if i just do that how much gear do i want to buy here um it's not bad that's pretty much all i want though death ray scroll probably pretty good but what is this plus three move points there's not that much okay let's let's see what i can get up to here upgrade this use my workers to get another bower item okay unfortunately it's all butts well like let me see well okay so the damage on this is actually way better yeah look at the blaze difference we lose out on the 30 reliability which shouldn't be scoffed at but i'm not using the pistol i'm gonna grab that um i think i just give this to you what's your reliability right now 80 it'll go down to 50 but wait what the fudge holy cow wait a second if i'm reading this right wait oh wait what was i just looking at that was that was weird i know what i'm doing um yeah reliability doesn't matter when we just be doing boo-koodles more damage anyway so there we go uh we'll sell that ah but that means i can't oh but i can wait a second this is monica the saucy minx come over here sell that that gives me just enough [Music] eight percent extra damage um now are blazing 178 to 201 whoo carry me harder all right let's see what you got for us let's get you some range gaming um i guess just wait do you really have no reliability really oh let's give you five percent extra games whatever noise okay give you transfer generating action point after killing an enemy uh something tells me that's what we're gonna pick yeah right yeah that's pretty good and then we need to give you something i want some more mana that gamba all right that didn't work out dodge it is you don't do propagation damage accuracy i guess all right demand am i probably just gonna be the right play but too late what do i want to give you here first blood that's 48 crit on full health people i like that um we can use one more worker for something but the only thing that'll actually give us a return would be on production here let's do that over 1200 material that's pretty good so let's build some defenses i'm gonna do this warp pad over here so now there's one everywhere um let me repair walls because now we're going to be getting hit from everywhere we don't have a choice but will you kind of stupid thing i gotta demolish this build something better there uh well i don't need to now you guys are chum actually at this point that cost me like 48 wouldn't have just been cheaper to just like the mall shouldn't put a new one probably out [Music] the more you know [Music] um there yeah i definitely think that comes out to be a bit cheaper i thought i wouldn't notice all right let's see our blind spots for the most part i can't fit anything here put a watchtower here [Music] maybe not even here hmm i don't know i'll just say here uh we got good coverage around there good coverage there i guess i could do this well okay so at this point do i want to do like i can do catapults but i don't think i can upgrade them at this point they do like no damage i really like it seems like it's just like upgrade walls or not i get upgrade mounted ballistas will they do that much damage i really don't know i can try and find out i guess i put one here oh you need gold not materials to upgrade that though okay so right now no point putting those so then probably just upgrade walls i'll put them on the sides that are gonna be getting the most currently here and here hog um well now what do i do with my extra stuff i guess i could just put it on all the other sides too could also just start putting traps everywhere if i wanted to [Music] but maybe we just get uh all fully upgraded walls first make our defense impregnable [Music] so this is looking legit you know what i could have done too at this point i should do it but i could even um gonna like push my walls out farther because i pushed it back so much i don't think that's the right play anymore but um yeah dang it's pretty good i i think we're in a pretty good situation where we're often like uh we have so much gold and resources like what the fudge do we use them on i think we can also start putting more like next i could put teleporting things in each corner too to make it easier for everyone to get to them oh let me get rid of that though this is kind of annoying but whatever hindsight's 50 50. 20 50 50. what the 2020 mr fruit and with that we head into night 10 potentially three more nights we're so far nine for nine on perfect nights there's been no panic we're freaking killing it and hopefully it stays this way please god so i think next up yeah we um would you start working on buildings get high tier stuff make sure everyone gets pimped out uh start selling a whole bunch of stuff i guess that's next up on the list so then that way for night like 11 and 12 if we get there hopefully we have about as good as gear as possible or everyone has as high tier as possible we're doing a little bit better everyone's getting some higher tier stuff oh i didn't even realize i could have put the shield on you i didn't realize you just kind of revive and i forget we have somebody with one hand i need the hatch too man where the fudge do you get more hats and no epic items but anyway uh i'm telling you guys this is feeling good if i don't make it this time i'll probably just cry and die simultaneously so with that said thank you much for your support i want to thank all much for watching abs or what i think for watching this video have yourself a fantastic day i've said this thousands of time with that said i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music] so you
