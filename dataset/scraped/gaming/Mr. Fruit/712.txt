hi everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to curse of the dead gods we had a little confirmation bias I just read the comments where but he's like this game is sick and then I do another video and I said I wanted to do another one so it doesn't matter who cares how it performed its least don't kill my channel but I'm gonna go add whenever in any other set on fire is a better chance be weakened gear friend and chest to drop anything says the trains are being higher quality and what the Greek kill the timer is active my damage is increased by 3% per kill now we're gonna try and be some epic gamers we did the short explanation so now we're gonna do the medium we're going balls to the wall here we're starting with a weapon now you know take note here we have no gold so we will be paying for blood here but that's just how metal we are get parry like that okay well how are you attacking so fast immediately after I destroy you huh that's not fair you're not supposed to be able to do that you're a cheater Doge just ah there we go finally okay all right you all stay back yeah oh okay I barely avoided that don't ask goosh all right who's up next huh no so this huh oh Jesus watch this ready balls actually that's incredible I didn't you realize though as possible we barely killed him in time all right we don't have a choice oh we want it jagwire hammer a whole week 54 damage well is the heavy what is this thing blazing shield wow fire attacks okay but up oh I like this kills increased movement speed yeah bonus damage poor dexterity attacks from behind a lecture there there was some damage well you know honestly not that I you know I'm not it's not I'm gonna use a favor so I purchased this two times in a run I can reroll what we got here Titans Leia do those critical damage against elites champions of bosses like that chance to inflict fire damage like that critical check restores 1% of max health for each enemy killed take my blood it's 60 so it's a it ain't cheap which means we're literally first room first curse was that a smart idea and probably now oh whatever did I throw that what's what's the what how bad could it be you know Kay go ahead show me fools bounty is this the chest thing opening the gold chest now Felix corruption girl Jess good Taymor gold yeah whatever I just won't open chests maybe no I probably still will wait what is it Oh random encounter happens to be the Fountain of Youth but I'm not gonna bother healing I guess a free room ish kind of not really I wouldn't mind a relic but then next up is a weapon we were to get a weapon and I'd rather go here and then mmm move our way over here somehow I don't really know let's just use this new weapon we got here the good news about these giant ones these heavy weapons is they can stagger which is realizing oh and if it applies the fire I already have a chance to weaken with it oh my Oh the synergy it's oh it is here and it is alive Pitters and damage against weakened enemies this this energy you get you guys see what's happening here it's all coming together I hope you burn alive oh and you did goosh goosh this weapon is insane I didn't need that blood anyway bro got put mmm mmm I said I wouldn't know how much corruption is it ten how much two-handed weapon no that's not better than that it's ten really worth it I didn't see how much gold we got and I mean it's probably worth alright I don't need a weapon we'll take some more but then I'm gonna have to open the golden chest I want the relics now we just gotta go this way we'll get stats or something i yeah i don't know we're making it up as I go all right we're doing it live as long as I can keep using this and not take much damage you can see here the 1% healing it's technically white like 10 health doesn't seem like a lot but if I don't take damage suddenly we can uh we can heal up kinda rather nicely you know what I'm saying those bows boom just freakin yeah this thing is insane I am in love wow that's a lot of gold maybe I don't have to open a chest hog maybe it'll just all be lying here for me consider it give me that gold I want the gold yeah okay cool I didn't have to open a chest for this one thank God no corruption to be taken thirteen hundred gold that's not bad how that could buy some stats yeah let's go see let's go check out some sass it should mean we can buy two stats for one with our golden it'll be like all of our gold dough so we'll have to see what it is if we if we want to invest this is just yeah that's a trap not falling for it you selling is take this charger oh god nobody killed me there was all this stuff though alright oh oh it's no witch doctor so he can heal and res people we don't like him so we just kill him oh my God look at all this gold don't a dagger huh excuse me secondary weapon just critical damage against weakened animes that's pretty good I don't have a ranged weapon but screw it we'll figure it out later it's a dagger why not you know we're all melee baby we don't worry about it I feel like I'm finding a lot more gold on the ground than usual all right go my fire things all right now check this out god I couldn't stop it in time I took some corruption dodgem I'm actually gonna get another curse already Geetha's crafts mr. fruit what you doing we can get extra health and gold fine I mean is gold find worth in probably it's only 750 I might as well certainly can't take more curses though these Louise let's hope it's not bad go get us some more gold though and then some more stats and then it's balls time come on please don't please don't be bad please mortal hardness earns no longer contained gold but are filled with blood blood heals but inflicts corruption oh well just dandy yeah so glad I worked for all that gold fine just mmm whatever I mean I guess I can heal my my health now right but what did chip be but I'm not falling for it you you you you oh I ran out of a charge there that was a close one I don't think I need to go back oh my god what is happening here yeah look at that it even staggers that big dudes I can't move I can't what just happened I just took so much screwed not more corruption I've had enough of your and on fire shenanigans why am I on fire Oh interesting okay so it heals me for a little bit but one corruption extra crit damage sure I mean at this point I'm just I'm fly-in on this whole corrupting thing I guess yeah well this is bad very bad oh my god I've never buried him before that's incredible balls how can I parry that dude almost every time but everyone else me that's like super dangerous if I don't area I think that thing hurts whatever dude I said I'm all in on my curses you know I'm saying give it to me that's a lot of gold finishers cost no stamina well I mean it's better than our default sword it's nothing crazy but okay let's get ourselves some stats we don't have any friggin what is this one called I don't know the blue and we have no extra damage so that's um yeah that's it feels bad but I'm gonna go on this girl first cuz I hate you inflicting I hate you too I'm coming for you now bomb but I'm slowly heal and it's fine it's fine it's fine it's good if - if qu it don't matter that much it's a little bit I'm not that upset it's for you and you there we go Oh Jefferson base damage per thousand gold carried wow I almost do plus twenty
