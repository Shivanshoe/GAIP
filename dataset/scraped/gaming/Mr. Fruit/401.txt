hi there everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to another day another video i hope you're all doing how are you has anybody asked you that recently how are you are you holding up you're doing well i certainly hope you are but if you're not hopefully this video can help you escape for a while and if you're doing well that's great that's awesome to hear today we're playing a brand new fps roguelike so automatically you guys should be like oh shoot fps check roguelike check that's everything i love so let's get into it welcome to roboquest there's a main menu i guess i could have put i'm just starting in the hub so if you guys don't know what a roguelike is well you guys are missing out but that's a long story i'm gonna go ahead and equip the mini vacuum because the only artifact that i have anyway this is the hub where you can start the game obviously and on top of that this is a little base camp i just actually did it you can upgrade things buy things so this is where the i guess is more of a roguelite aspect because in between runs you can slowly upgrade things to make future runs a little easier or different varied whatnot there are different robots as loadouts i just unlocked the recon we're gonna be using them for this video never used them before and on top of that multiplayer it can be a co-op roguelike fps game that's incredible of course i'm a loner so i won't be playing with anybody except me myself and i and you guys you guys are here with me and that's what matters we have um i don't remember her name but we're just gonna go ahead and start the game and i hope you guys do enjoy i have to say it was a pleasant surprise very fun love the art style reminds me a whole bunch of borderlands um even the boss brother you'll see but i don't think that's a bad thing so we start the game i should have different artifacts but i only have one right now so i chose it then we get to start with some weapons i just actually upgraded so we get to start with two we have the dual crossbows oh or the dual uzis um extra speed in hand weapons rebound or extra speed i mean i kind of want to act up and use crossbows at the same time oozies look at these things the art style is so clean and it's it's early in development so anyway then we get some upgrades so we can get gra grab some cores this one gives us plus two assault plus your demolition which if you look over on the left side of the screen they'll tell you assault gives us assault damage and speed which is good as you'll see bottom right our current weapons are uzis which are assault and demolition which gives us extra damage and fire rate let's go ahead and equip these we have two guns but we're gonna be using these and we're just gonna go ahead and start at fast pace and the way i actually like how this game works so fudge all right maybe i should talk a little less so when you see me kill something they drop little purple orbs that's how you get xp if you don't collect them you don't get xp from the kill and they disappear rather quickly so it ensures that the game stays fast paced and frantic at least if you want to actually you know advance at all oh i got to kill this dude so if you kill that little guy he gives you a little extra xp believe this look how many these are there's already so much going on and i have my special ability which boom i get to go invisible and then when i come out of it extra damage the ambush they did not see it coming and it leaves a little decoy too they're busy shooting at that stupid couldn't be me and of course we're out here fighting evil tin cans uh we're currently trying to figure out why we're fighting tin cans and and what exactly is going on here but i hope it spawns another little guy for me to shoot i don't think it's going to sometimes respond to a guy and you only have a set amount of time to kill him but he'll give you a whole bunch of xp if you do that's what you saw me doing earlier when i freaked out for absolutely no reason because clearly you've never seen this game before and i didn't explain much to you so you're like why are you freaking out it doesn't matter because i leveled up so now levels oh you gotta love it we get extra help and we get to choose a perk so we go ambush further increases dagger damage which is my melee and each melee attack hit increases ambush duration critical shots have a chance to mark a nearby target i don't know what marking does i'm gonna be honest and critical damage has a chance to become shock damage i like that i don't i don't we probably don't even have high crit chance if at all they have 50 crit chance that's not terrible or at least base wise okay so here's the map there's all these little puzzle rooms um i didn't even know okay we made it that's super hard right so we get technology okay we're going assault precision that's what i have we can choose a junk beam which looks pretty cool or ooh throwing knife interesting screw it i don't know if that's very good but it looks fine with me and then wow and then we exit there's all these little hidden rooms there are literally hidden rooms mind you there's like waterfalls later on and some of them you can walk behind without the game telling you so so there's probably more hidden ones on this level in future worlds so i don't really know it'd be interesting to find all that out but i mean for a game so early on in development it's currently enclosed alpha i don't even think it's beta uh this is clean you gotta be honest if you wanna check it out it is on steam i'm not sure if it's coming to other consoles and stuff you can look them up i literally this morning i just found them on twitter rebel quest i was like oh shoot and they're already following me i was like this is great so i asked him for a key and they hooked us up in fact i have some quiche to give away so if you comment down below i have two keys i can give away to so many people so you can try it yourselves okay now we start now in this level this is as far as i got um these guys get annoying little shields i'll leave it at that but go i have to avoid the laser thing and as you can see they're getting tankier obviously as time goes by they don't stay the same may scale as well as i do which is why you always want to stay up on your upgrades your weapons oh get that thing your levels yes sir yeah fudge what you shot me you screw you now i'm so fast yeah okay okay all right maybe not fast enough though you can't track me i'm so fast dude all right this is going well this is a lot different than the last build i did like i said i pretty much had a grenade launcher just did a whole bunch of splash damage from afar now i'm up close and personal baby i want to get to know your name girl let's see what we got going on over here oh oh wait oh no oh i killed him just in time uh i took a good bit of damage though for it so was it worth it to be seen oh jesus just these guys man all right you know what it's time for you all to burn yeah there we go should open with that more often all right so we got a little trial room thing oh what the fudge is going on here i don't quite like this i need to go that way wow all right somehow i did that plus three assault precision plus three precision demotion okay we want a soul assault sentry very good uh deploys a turret in front of you wow that's pretty good and then heavy sniper i have no precision really so that's probably not a good idea let me see what this is all about though real quick oh it has like a special what bro that's like nuts this is this slow but like if this works how i think it does yeah look i enter a battle throw turrets down then i come back when they're done place another turret switch back but if i have nine plus 45 should assault damage all right fine i think we just got too lucky with this roll man the plus two assault is too good and on to the next fun oh heavens just getting it started right away okay all right for you mr laser bop now let not let you oh wait wait come back thank you oh my okay all right little little little in over our heads hold two enemies at once okay all right this is fine yeah i'm super speedy damn yeah all right going busy blair so that i may melee you and then yeah melee you and then of course that means i gotta come over this stupid dude ow i gotta hurt so much all right though i'm fine ah i'm alive ugh i'm mailing everything oh you can't stop me look at this pace come back here thank you huh go invisible screw you yeah merely you oh there's turrets so many things happening at once oh god this is a splash damage it's so easy for them to hit me ddr no okay i'm getting a little low right now captain not gonna lie to you yeah i'm stunned again they just punch me in this it's painful ah come on i'm almost done i've almost died okay i can go but i'll kill the rest anyway send a message you think you can best me no all right and no no respite just right back in it oh all right i don't like this i'm kind of stuck here just avoid the lasers shoot everything else yeah yeah you're so weak i will kill you all right failed it even with all my assault man they're still so tanky even with all of my specking oh lose the energy center all right next one ass three gears for that okay this is uncharted territory for me never been here i could get the fire fire oh that's two stars away i've never seen that before instantly destroys fully burned targets plus 20 damage with minus 50 radius damage type explosion and burn that's dope oh that is dope it's just that you don't give me my assault damage but you know at this point maybe it's time to change you know if this is the downfall of me so be it i'll accept my fate what is what am i looking at right now all right hold on just lobbing these things apparently they lob a lot more than i thought they would i'm just hating them but see i can play a lot safer but the prop oh the problem there is i don't get any xp it's a bit of a bit of a dual edge blade you know okay non-elemental weapons do increase damage does explosion count as elemental i feel like it might we could do big bullets another swift hand that's not your temperature damage i'm doing it i'm sorry but i have to i like this thing but i also really like my uzis at the end of the day while this is fun these are still i think my go-to definitely from the way i've spent things going visibly all right who do i need to kill ah so these guys have shields annoying they have to take out the little drone above them if i want to hit them at all like that don't hit me okay do another don't get melee range of those guys because then they just make you play ddr in the middle of a giant gun fight who wants to do that i mean it does sound kind of fun but in all reality it just makes things far more difficult than they need to be i think this will have health or something at the end of it oh oh that's what that sound was i missed a little little roomba dude could have given me some extra xp that would have been nice why that thing is the biggest radius i've seen in my entire life dude the fudge ah everything's not awesome everything hurts when they have splash damage okay so it is a hidden room those enemies i have to hope they're not oh they what the [ __ ] okay i just gotta run fast i guess god jesus holy yeah no please yeah yeah all right you should be safe over here a little ridiculous if they kept shooting okay we can get plus four assault plus four demolition yes please we can get a barrel cannon i guess extra damage marksman critical bonus damage all right i gotta do it i i just have to i'm sorry yep i'm here for it you need to die sir thank you give me all your xp appreciate that okay these things definitely hit hard all right i gotta go for this stupid thing first yeah oh okay hello get away don't melee me please i have so much to live for just try not take any damage this room mr fruit i'll be looking a lot better if that's the case oh my god quit skating around don't skirt skirt not on my watch ambush damage oh i didn't realize i haven't killed you oh we missed their aoe though we're nuts come up there we go hey these things kind of are nuts dude they do so much damage boosh boosh but so does my sniper wow i cleared that without taking any damage i think i did it i didn't think i would you know i had no faith in myself i'ma be honest chief that was my downfall yeah you son of a all right we are we're uh we're almost dead oh no we're almost dead all i have to say about that i'll say on that matter okay oh that's not good i have to not hit these fences because i think that's what's also stunning me getting stunned by quite literally everything right now so okay all right just keep going oh kill that thing though that's a lot of xp we'll have to see that now come behind you all right that's big don't let you get too close i can snipe the rest these guys all and the crit of the [ __ ] and i think that's okay oh and there's health up here okay it's oh there's more enemies screw it i'm out of here oh your progress must be terminated now the heck plus four are you the one sending these dumb tin cans unreal gun precision weapons hits pierce fully charged explosion size and it has plasma orb wow that's pretty cool but again extra assault dude that's my plan i don't have nearly as much health as i would like to right now and i've never made it here so pray for me dr turret yeah okay that's a new thing oh ow ow i don't like you oh okay let's just stay away from all that oh here we go again okay i think the other ones i have to i can't tell if i oh what the i have to double jump or what are you saying i'm kind of running out of running out of stuff to use here bro you're still doing good damage okay that's not fair oh jesus okay this is annoying sir please okay ah fudge okay but all of his goo as soon as i say that he places more gear thanks all right shoot my decoy extra damage he didn't fall for that very long ah fudge ah no he was like he was one per uh well that though my friends is uh roboquest highly suggest you look into it and
