before we get rolling into today's among us video i thought you should all know about our brand new limited edition merch collection introducing the sus collection don't know what to get your loved ones for the holidays well eject your worries and get some of this merch it's available until december 5th ships worldwide and domestic orders are slated to arrive before christmas international is

t-shirt the sus sweatshirt the sus lineup the sus shadow and the ejected sus not only that but you can get individual stickers of each one of the characters those being from left to right sonic bless shark blue myself rob versus dork and ariels so if this interests you at all there will be a link down in the description box below you've got a little less than two weeks to grab it so don't doddle and with that let's get into the video hi eddie hold everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to among us okay you know what bryce can usually smooth talk i believe him god i want to stat kill so hard right now okay why did don and um go to the wrong one that's kind of weird don and home what's the big idea all right so i'm gonna and then i'm gonna go back to the engine [Music] i'm gonna try and snipe lights nicely done i was worried someone was gonna try and snipe those and they did it is what it is open i catch someone cause someone's sleeping i don't know what else to call right now maybe i'll close that door you know i'm feeling crazy i'll close weapons why not oh price just came from a kill holy office what the fudge okay so there's no one okay so they can be going from lights right now a few moments later okay real quick there were five people in office i didn't know who those five people were i was in office i saw both shady and home i did my card swipe i left there was five people i was on i'm trying to snipe lights i'm trying to pretend like i'm sniping lights that's i swear i walked through there but i'm up top and in the uh telescopes okay because i'm going into weapons someone also came out of weapons they're very close here because i very much saw both of them yeah some did you see anyone else bridge uh my brain wasn't you know registering brothers pretty good excuse there what was that were you a weapon it's a good excuse in that was that if i was lying at weapons no bridge who was who came out of weapons i did weapons first i think i was in weapons at one point it's weird that everybody responds to wears weapons and then but nobody responds to who was in office weapons but who is in o2 who is so all i know is there are two people who aren't saying that they were in office which makes sense because there was a double kill in office so whoever the two people out of that five that aren't talking so i it can't be bridge i don't think he would incriminate himself like that okay it can't be bridge it can't be mr fruit and it can't be much why can't it be mr fruit way too hard yeah i was sitting on admin this whole time watching the numbers and that's why i know there was five i said i'm not dying on hills anymore so dawn why were you you're gonna buy it because then i i saw everyone in there because when the lights went out i checked vitals and no one died i'm a better liar too much in high school you know let's go it was good because rush he didn't see bryce nobody said anything like this is good this is very good this is very good i'm going to sit on that but i'm going to play detective which i did and if i was a crew man in that situation i'd be pissed i'm like who isn't telling me so i'll just uh i'll just you know i'll just i'll die on the hill that i unsuss rice um aside from him i don't know he was the only one that said i mean so maybe but that's the only one we can place there birds flying high you know how i feel sun in the sky high you know how i feel breeze drifting on by you hey it's price why do i think it's price because that's where i last saw him and i saw donkey dick doing tasks in office and i got scared because i was downloading in admin what do you mean what do you mean where where does specimen come out of because that's where i can go yeah yeah top right or you can go into admin what do you mean shark i saw you in med bay are you driving through vote at me no you know why i think this is bryce is because it's too clean it is very good kevin because last time i saw him was med like around manchester united i haven't seen you the entire year you know what i wanted to see me bryce because i saw the little tiny well then how would i see on my outer circle all i know is i am only trusting british examination and bridge is the only person who's vouching for you i think it's bridge shark i'm not vouching for shark at all oh no no no no saying that you you said it was me because of the clean sorry oh here's what i know i don't think it's bridge because while he may have a smooth brain sometimes like us i don't think he would be the only one to say he was in office when the other two people didn't i agree okay so i trust bridge everybody else wild wes i don't have anything this round said he's seen me two places no we can't weapons first round two and i didn't it's sharp [Music] i don't know how to feel [Music] i was gonna vote for him but then i was like i think we're gonna be the only ones and that's gonna look real bad so maybe i can still play it off that that wasn't the case but um this is gonna be a little tough i have to keep bridge alive right i have to keep him alive or do i kill him because we know he was yeah i should probably kill him right because he's the only one we know is innocent well bobby so only one other person so are we sure that it was bryce because only one person voted for anyone other than bryce if there's two imposters left yeah well then we voted wrong well it was kind of a 50 50 between shark i voted bryce i'm gonna be for real it can't be a 50 50. it was a hundred hundred meaning it was bright bridge because they're the ones that are defending each other like this whole time has anyone else cleared them well that would be a mega brain but no i only trust bridge that's all i'm saying if you think that's us go for it but i'm telling you it was wario in here off that first double kill it would make no sense for him to do that yeah and that's the only thing i've been near whatever happened that last round mr fruit are you containing a son of a and being a double killing like the only the only defense bridges he's better liar the double killing son of a guy that's pretty much all i got what are you talking about self-reporting double killing son of a gun oh i would never do that i don't know if i want to be rob and die on a hill but i like it's been weird listening to fruit i'll tell you this it sucks all right because when you die on a hill everybody just goes like this i feel like when you're done okay okay here's the thing if it's not bryce then it's we have to vote why do i think this because donkey dick i saw her like not long ago and i saw the vitals that she was dead and then bridge found the bodies and i feel like i feel like how come i was the only one who called a meeting because we do have to vote and i know the least about this game also i just got that uh donkey dick's name is donkey [Music] yep that's us that's great oh my god what the fudge they voted out my boy so it was but now and but now they think that i am such because i trusted bridge it's like i was trying to set up now and somehow that makes me suss i really don't know how i do this i'm being honest with you all it ain't a good look i have to get the kills without them finding out because i think if we get to a report screen i'm screwed and i i don't know i gotta hope who is it bryce bryce help me out with sabotage or something or let me know talk to me black lovers no one died no one died no one died no one died no one okay what task score was left because i i had all my not many i [ __ ] literally finishing my o2 and then shark push the button oh okay i i was trying to reset cooldown but i i saw you with me in the same room which was locked out though you're going to kill him kill me as i was done downloading but i think you're innocent who rob rob see i feel like i feel like if my girl's right it was right well i don't think it was but i mean i'm telling you it doesn't make any sense bridge we would have lost already well what if we were right about bryce i don't think we were but we don't know about that yeah i'm sorry bryce if it wasn't you forgive me but it it was either bryce because we have a lot of people but someone else gets a lot of time someone what short nevermind i lost track that's all the energy i had from the button you sound like a kid who like broke something and it's like in trouble and i could hear the dial up like yo just talk just like sorry i'm on cool down i'm on cooldown i can't hold on you gotta wait i don't know how i um i don't know how i play this i gotta kill i gotta kill rob i think right but if i'm the only one that ends up doing that ah jimmy and this unfortunately this kind of puts everyone in the same spot which way did robbie go kevin kevin it was fruit awesome it doesn't matter what what's going on whose fingers are pointing i am on the hot seat i witness let me tell nothing what happened this whole game give me my ten seconds no i'm not giving you your ten seconds stop the account we're in on it from the start they were the two people out there that's why we keep saying that i'm telling you it wasn't bridge it was bryce left pillar kevin comes up kills him and i immediately report it no rob followed me um video please don't let him do the biggest lego brain of all times right here no i am not this aggressive at defending myself if it's a mega brain for him to fix the left tower then holy crap i hope you get a bunch of views but kevin you use the portal in front of me i swear i called it from the beginning it was you're done i don't want you dark no please for the horde don't do this brother for the horde you can't do that no [ __ ] the horde on the horde bro i would not let that happen never for the alliance no for azeroth hopefully all right time to be a crewmate all right now i noticed a certain branch went way ahead and i see his little puppy dog darn it i was hoping to catch him in the act because i saw his little halo hello talking about my halo hello i kind of wanted to get imposter now just vent in front of me so then i have to carry that secret with me the rest of the game you know well i told him i wouldn't you know i was about to say how they don't get i was like man i'm here early on why no one's found you let me finish my asteroid yo what the that lights thing like yeah wait yo crafty did you see that blood through the wall like i did in med bay uh-uh okay the kill probably wasn't weapons because i saw fruit go to cafeteria it literally like happened like right where the wire wall is like right across from med bay and i literally saw blood in med bay and i thought somebody like vented and killed crafty while he was scanning and then it was on the other side in fruit's dead body how long ago was that it was probably from when i saw the blood to when i got there 20. i don't think they're going to get anywhere here you said it was in cafeteria i i saw him go to cafeteria because he ran that way shark did you go left or right when you were going down i went right right i had wires like right on top of cabinets how do you know that fruit was dead in cafeteria uh because that's the way he went and uh they said they saw it through the wall which means most likely the only way they could have seen it through the wall that would place it in weapons which is in cafeteria which places him where i know he went where were you uh admin i did my three tasks in that room uh then i went over to lights and there were three people there doing god knows what turning it on and off again over and over again no no okay right went to lights and then like didn't like it finished kevin kevin why are you blaming me because when the lights came back on right at the end you were in cafeteria with me i was doing the vending machine and your body was a capitalization kevin then it is kevin i don't guarantee people i die on a hill kevin and bryce both gone the same way i said it last game i voted i did see bryce at lights what should we call i leave because i didn't think they'd get anywhere and they voted kevin what in the world did i just miss holy papaya i mean maybe it was kevin i don't even know how did where kevin i just come in i see kevin oh look he's doing asteroids yep we're kevin what [Music] oh thank god i thought i was gonna die yo it's a bryce it is a bryce yeah what because you freudian slipped when you knew that where fruit was i know you had a logic train to follow but that was too natural the first time shady i think it's great because he hesitated running to react bryce flipped the switch when what's kevin's success in here bryce i can tell you my mom laughs i watched this thing flies and then i did the shields right did though but that's why i voted for kevin before oh oh oh three people saw me in electrical why would i go vent and then run to the vending machine which is killed come and came back five i'm gonna skip i i don't know why he said it's me what's really weird what's really weird is that no one died and it was me ohm and shady up in uh reactor and then you came in i did come in with rob and don was gonna be right behind us i was trying to make sure we had at least two people rob said over the coms to everyone nobody's going to reactor so i started heading to react well you came in late meaning you didn't find anybody around i was there with rob and don i could have grabbed the kill i absolutely could have bridge was in the bottom right at weather balloons i could have killed him i didn't skip vote no i'm voting bryce are making me talk an awful lot i'm sorry bryce i think it's you i skipped it's oh my god and you'll feel badly in about seven minutes i think we gotta cut it though uh i think i go the bathroom once and apparently i i miss a congress meeting like what in the world was it coming because i called bryce out oh they all don't even know okay they're just pointing fingers at all the wrong people okay yeah that makes sense i hope the crew mates are gonna go because they vote each other off the imposters have the ease game ever [Music] am i done um close close all right we were all in reactor except for don so did only one person died no i was there it's yeah no i'd yeah robbie he'd scanned yo i just finished numbers i see shark and robbie okay okay so there was only one kill which means we did get an imposter so there's one left i think it's vicky i think vicky was about to kill me and decon and then the body got called yeah but she called the body is it who's not no i'm not okay we gotta gather okay who was in react it was me me me shark bridge shark rob and it was wait is beautiful i was there i came in with rob boner was there okay so dawn so don is the only one who's not in reactor right now it's in greenhouse is there any chance that somebody could have vented over there did everybody walk in like way together okay did anyone see the right side near the vent no i could vouch for bob because he was doing bridges no i'm asking rob a question no it's rob was doing the uh simon says making sure when i walked in over to the laboratory thank you very much for the raid my dude so the evidence points towards hopefully you're having a good i think we got one and i'm going to skip among us i'm down for that let don talk ggg he doesn't know if his other person got a kill so he has to wait i'm trying i think he got him yeah oh maybe not yet who's the other imposter why am i killed is it rob i legitimately have no idea what's going on oh my god sharks you weren't kidding i had to get both kills oh i was freaking the hell out how did you not murder me i was trying to make it seem like there was still one imposter yeah that was big brain i'm so sorry right i swear my game bro because i yeah but i didn't vote on don i could have gotten don out i skipped [Music] you
