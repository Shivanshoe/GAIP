i love what blast is done with the place it's applebee's fine wood i can make it tankered okay wow where did all you guys come from i regret everything i regret everything oh man are you kidding me wait this one's had six there we go oh nice oh now what now the world feels like our oyster all right so definitely want to make a portal we could make more smelters in the kilns yeah and maybe we can make more of the stuff we need at the house and then maybe keep enough for two portals so once we go far maybe like when we go on the boat we can do a portal to wherever our boat takes us and a boat from home portal from home maybe with that second house he made since that's like the we're keeping all the oars and stuff we can make chests put all the oars and rocks that's a good idea so i have on this side tin copper bronze iron and what other ore is there that you think we can have this chest for as of now i have no idea but i guess we'll need a couple of wood variants or even just one final one wood wood let there be lights this place looks good we're all boozing out i'm gonna go get more wood yeah that's not a bad idea i need to figure out how to do a fence thing can you fix the cart like is there a way to fix it repair it i yes yeah i just repaired it which is a good thing because apparently it was practically dead we need to figure out how planting oh i wonder if i can use the hoe to get rid of land and plant a tree there oh she do be getting foggy how do you make the the logs the log standing on top of each other um what do you mean like to stack them outside do you use the hammer oh yeah if you have 50 in your inventory it's under a miscellaneous and supposedly there's a the cultivator tool lets us craft for farming and planting oh that makes sense why can't i level this ground anymore i feel cold now you wanna go sleep yep i can't see nothing oh it's super dark what though that's what i'm saying look like you lost how i feel cold i'm resting i'm getting warmer what is it alright to the west we go right yeah all right stop by the troll cave first yeah ye oh yeah have we missed this i've been here before too unless it respawns all right hopefully the better bowl will help us here somebody's already oh no oh it's like one star fudge okay he doesn't have a he doesn't have a thingy though the uh club that is nice oh my god oh my god he parked me out of the cave that's okay it's okay that's good i'm just getting my health back and i'll be back in he literally punched me out of the cage i need to get my health back hey hi how are you drop your character do we have oh no i was like we have a fire he stalked me once i had five hp yeah that man slapped me brother all right i'm picking up i'm using the flint head arrows you're rejetting like 17 health or something i'm rejecting four i should probably start making better arrows i really only ever use like normal ones i use the the flint heads on those like the big guys and i switch it for the other ones for hunting wish me luck how did you get you're getting 7.5 health each time stupid that's 126 damage oh my god [ __ ] looks like it depends on what you eat yeah what did you eat [Laughter] you're so quiet dude i keep trying to roll and instead of roll i jump and i just right into his fist every time dude he's not in here anymore he's not spawning oh it's because i keep clicking mouse 4 instead of mouse 2. oh okay i'm gonna try to go for her chest really quick before he spawns maybe he slapped me a few two times like i'm head out dude if he spawns right behind me i'm going to cry no he took my little dip that's so weird he's like not even here because he came out to chase me no do you have another torch i forgot to make one oh my god i'm not i'm not trolling he's actually here wait really he's actually come for me ah come in the cave can he come out of the cave oh i really think him out of the cave he actually went for before he can leave the cave he was actually looking for me dude he's like i'm going to capture my free spawn he said hold up i'm on the spunk hole up that is crazy i wonder if this is where they spawn and they just come out of their caves yo it's me where'd you shoot it to do so much damage i don't know i think it was just a random lucky crit uh i'm putting on armor i shot him i want to go home i'm all out of flint heads it doesn't seem like um you holding like the holding left click does more damage oh yeah it does i did ten nine anymore oh wait hold up shoot him in the butt word oh my god i'm out there oh that's because i'm understanding whoa [Music] you just do a rock and a rock idiot [Music] stupid i'm going in for the butt let me get it let me get it let me get it right the gooch got him like he just falls like crumbles what did he

more 10. let's get more tin and copper then we can make all the bronze things yeah we need more ore more of the ore stuff and next time we play if it's with people or not we can either make the new boat and sail or uh make a teleporter thing see where that goes mm-hmm also i wanna re-fight the the first boss oh and then probably take on the second boss soon yeah yeah easy i like that how you guys doing doing good now that you're here how you doing yeah way better now that you're here hey hey good to have you back bryce yeah good to be uh good to be playing glad you're here the village has grown a little bit i i see that have you guys uh you guys been working on it a little bit uh by us ab and i yes [Laughter] i don't think anyone is as addicted to this as abbot so we're grinding so you guys are like super professional now and you're just going to take us to the boss and we're just going to clear it easy mode yeah pretty much oh [ __ ] well yeah easy mode is i got my rags you got your threads i got rags on too i i don't even know how to make them but bless gave me something so forget about it [ __ ] me i'm on fire again i just bought a troll that was coming towards our village you fended them off big old folks hunting burbs and stuff what's up let me uh i'll get you some gear so that you maybe stand a little better of a chance um well last boss we fought i was naked and somehow i turned into the baits and i don't i don't want to have that happen again well the good news is this can only be better so all right i'm looking forward to it here's a level two bow that's probably better than one you have it is a level three flint axe nice leather helmet leather pants and a level two shield dude okay can rob get that hookup i am geared out of my mind now uh i just gave him most of my hookup i think i think i can i can give you half the yeah what kind of oh i got rags wait i got some for rob i got some axes for rob wait do you have a level two actually i love the haircut rob thank you good to have you i have a what no i i only got level dropped myself but definitely definitely let me know if you guys are just hopping on this randomly because oh i just i just didn't want to be the only one on the server because i was worried i'd like progress things and accidentally screwed things up for us well see that's why abby and i have had trouble because we want to we've been grinding we want to do things we're like we have to save that oh okay uh should i swap out of rag and wear i i should wear the leather that you gave me yes yeah leather is better also i'd like you to point you all to the new town hall yeah i saw that what is up with that rob are you a cape guy or are you a hood guy i'm a hood guy it's beautiful we've got three-headed dragon it's called jedora so uh abb and i hired out a contractor yeah wait who did this look good okay uh the contractor we uh we hailed from faraway lands what does that mean did you actually build this or did you have somebody come in here and build this uh aka breaking the fourth wall here my older brother but uh we didn't hear that wait really yeah he taught us how to tame boris too so if you come over here we have like four boys oh there's one walking around though we have four in there and there's one just walking around the village oh we gotta fix that yeah i think it's cute i think i think it's funny there just walking around he's like you can pet him yeah everyone could just oh boar loves you i love you too you can pet all the boards boar loves you see i need to make the i need to make the fence bigger and then we can start slaughtering them but keeping some alive of course but he loves us we can't kill him what whatever i want what i want to do also is i want to put like a like a watch tower here like something like near each gate well eventually i want to get like a dummy thick okay but in good time and good time the stone gate oh i've only been given two pairs of leather pants i'll trade leather pants for a leather shirt oh yeah give give one of those you probably i have a leather tunic do you need paint i don't have leather paint no no no no i'm wearing the tuna oh okay okay okay i see how it is yeah i'll just have you know we've uh we've fought many a trolls we've ventured far we've smelted plenty and uh we're ready to go okay and then the good news is because i've been waiting for this once we defeat the second boss we get to go sailing with a bigger ship like true viking and then probably die in the open seas but that sounds very exciting okay i should not be attacking my own house that's a that seems like a bad call okay so uh i got i've got the pants i'm gonna hook you up with some meat the only reason why arby's exists is because they looked through the norse books and they saw that i had the meat boy uh i am in the applebee's jack applebee's applebee's there you go look i'm gonna toss through the window was this the first drive through oh you gave me a bunch of meat hell yes dude you're a legend also fruit i wanna um i wanna take bryce and rob to their first troll cave and we just sit outside and listen to him i'm down who paid i have a new cave we can bring him to yeah they can't leave until they kill it oh yeah i believe i have pants for you by the way oh i can't light this because it's raining five heads yep here you go you need some food um i've just gave me a ton so there you are no all right i'm working on that no no literally everything i took was on that island well to be fair everything you lost wasn't that wasn't that important wait oh you never went back to it we should just go back and cop it uh well i have a level two bow for you rob why are you angrily attacking cause he's being mean the door is being mean no mr fruit is being mean just be realistic like what you lost like it wasn't that big of a deal all right i need it was a big deal to me all right so bryce if uh if you weren't here we went to an island after sailing uh rob said hey we should probably shouldn't die because we're really far and then literally two seconds later i don't even i couldn't see what happened to i just remember there's like a brute and rob's like you've gotta run i just look back and rock dead i just see a stone flower that sounds about right i love the stones it's very sad okay here you go rob so these are fire arrows they are very effective and bryce you are are you don't like that did you just light his bed on fire it's not a big deal dude it's just a bed it's just a bed dude it's not a big deal it's just you can make another bed it's not a big deal yeah but this is my property yeah but it but it's just it's not a big deal it's just a bed see that's point proven i'm starting to feel a little bit bit of resentment oh ab so like it's harder for everyone to find me where did that go i'm gonna get on the server later and just crouch around slowly right next to me and he's gone like lightning i just assume we all know i'm right here hey boys even better news coming can we sleep um i guess we can hold on i gotta get stones you know i'm midnight snacking give me something can't use wood on a cooking station how do i turn on a cooking station well the cooking the the fire as long as you put wood in there you should be fine yeah like the fire not the cooking station oh i see now that makes

getting paid oh god now i'm on fire how do i get unwet just stand next to a fire don't go in the fire i am that's one way to stop being wet i suppose [Laughter] all right i'm sleeping nah sure for
