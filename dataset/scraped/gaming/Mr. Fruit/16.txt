here we go i'm in fizzy bay heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 and let's address the hunter in the room i know i know what is this in this disgusting ornament the eyeballs bro that's right i'm a hunter or rather sig josh is a hunter not on your account mr fruit i know sounds like great years past when i didn't really grind the game or i had terrible luck so i used other people's accounts everyone flamed me you can't even get the for yourself well in this case i'm checking out the brand new exotic dungeon sword heart shadow and guess what i did the dungeon right on release and guess what my loot was in order helmet chest helmet helmet yep that was my dungeon loot did yourself yeah well that's why i did it and i got nothing certainly not not even a weapon much less the exotic sword but joshua's helping us out a lovely looking sword this thing is incredible gameplay-wise though well let's find out heavy attacks made with full sword energy turn you invisible and fire exploiting void projectiles sounds pretty cool to me jagged edge more like curvy edge but i dig it burst guard and shot in the dark remaining visible grants this weapon increased damage for a brief duration hitting the target with his weapons projectiles while shot in the dark is active weakens them yeah so you're gonna be all stealthy all sneaky extra damage ooh ah but ironically it also just seems like it's it's gonna be better for hunters by default if i'm not mistaken as long as you're invisible you don't have to do it through the intrinsic trait you'll have increased damage and obviously void hunters can make themselves go invisible practically on command all the time so that could have some interesting applications now bear with me here okay cause i'm finna act up you know lord please forgive me for what i'm about to do that's right that's right it's gambit time baby look typically you know the drill we take a weapon whether it's pve or pvp oriented into pvp and only ever use that thing in the video at all times well here's the little caveat about heavy weapons for power weapons to go whole match without ever getting power so that makes it a little difficult to do that gambit however different story and we might get some pvp in there could be a nice harmonious mix may jump into a pvp game at the end and struggle to just get one brick of power and show you guys but who knows so don't say i never did nothing for the content because here i am queuing up gambit also side note here's like the grenade launcher the new dungeon weapon aesthetics oh my god dude undefeated they look so sick just wish wish i had my own to show you guys i will be doing the dungeon on all three characters so here's the hope i swear to god i gotta get one weapon and all that right right okay oh a red ridicule okay i i like it's that's yup i look so sick but here's the sword you can see the ghostly outline of what it would look like if i had ammo this is gonna be a doozy though because oh my god hunter not on the ah different everything okay i don't really need to grab the moats modes ain't gonna get me ammo brothers but i can go oh god okay yeah i can go invisible i can jump like like this i can uh i can die how do i dodge what's my that's what that that would help what what is it class ability is unbound okay well that would that would oh wait power oh it's a good thing i got out of my menus when i did because here we go ready swing oh it's even a little purple flames i don't remember seeing that and it does have a spot for a catalyst i wonder if you get that from master that'll unlock later who knows but i'm curious what they mean by full sword energy so let's see i throw that i am indeed invisible and then if i just okay so that's just the wired attack okay okay now we gotta see what it looks like when i go heavy to heavy speaking of heavy to heavy give me the uh heavy ammo oh there's a little throw i guess it's power now i'm gonna be honest i don't know if it's just me but i still just call it heavy all the time and then it's kind of like oh right it's called power but then i also really don't do anything about it it's not just me right it's a little different than on when i was playing overwatch 2 and i kept calling out mccree even though he's cassidy now haven't played that game forever that's just muscle memory and also need to call him the other name for well you know okay let's uh i'm gonna do this i'm gonna go invisible oh i didn't realize it kind of like fans out like that okay now unfortunately i wanted to try and get a dps oh here we go oh the projectiles are kind of like actually where did it go okay so interesting enough i heavied without full sword energy which i'm not entirely sure why that is oh wait i know why it is never mind okay we're getting invaded which is unfortunate however if i can just grab this heavy brother and then invade i got it okay please don't hurt me please don't hurt me look bro bro it doesn't have to be like this okay come on no why am i who's got stasis you're so cringe he's trying to get me he's trying to get me i'm invading okay okay this is perfect this is probably i can go invisible and go visible okay i'm invisible i'm gonna come over here i'm gonna kill his invisible boner friend right check it out wait what actually what why what is happening right now okay strength wow i'm dead so one of those had to have full sword energy right at no point did it seem like i sent out a projectile i was like oh he's dead and then never sent anything out there so user error in there somewhere i'ma try it again yellow yeah i could go poorly all right i just gotta go invisible and then hope we can kind of build on the success of you know what i'm saying i'm up okay there goes my invis but here goes my sword okay we killed him and i'm invisible yeah wait and i okay okay um yeah i was invisible which gives me bonus damage and i hit him i hit him with the sword you could hear the contact zero damage it's not even like oh you didn't do enough to kill him zero it just like is that hit wrench is you know ping latency packet loss i don't i don't know what oh i can go again though that's because they always have the primeval up so because we're bad i guess what that's trying to say all right we're invisible and i'm running i'm running and i'm visible he doesn't know that i'm here how far will this reach um well i went invisible yep okay can we okay we're just not really throwing throwing the stuff that's right that's unnecessary that's do we need to do that really hmm okay okay maybe i should stick to using this thing on some pv you know i'm sorry i mean it's not it's it's clearly not a pvp sword but you guys know me i just how does it how does it go against pvp that's always the answer so did i say pv i'm at pvp yeah whatever okay wait we can summon a thing sick all right let's let's do this boom here's the envoy i'm invisible that's a lot of damage hit him with a light that seems it seems pretty good i like that enough and i didn't go invisible okay and now i went invisible and now he's dead yeah okay so okay so even if i only had one bullets as long as you have the sword energy bob and actually i think even without ammo that might have just been an extra damage melee that's cool i like that okay i don't like that [Music] i didn't what i didn't kill him i ain't even tethered him hello how's that work i mean deadfall nope that's not i thought that would work oh he was about to die yo cool grenade launcher go didn't do anything okay all right i'm throwing i should let someone else go all right yeah uh who's next yeah that's old embarrassing let's leave that to the pros maybe okay it's it's not a wave launcher that's obvious ah activate quick fall oh it's an n air button which is just lost on it you know how many n air buttons titans need to use i'm no i'm you could it's not rhetorical you can that's right none none so yeah of apologies you know ever since we lost our twilight dash whatever the fudge god i missed that chess piece yeah that was that was like the only time we really had an air movement and the last time we did and you know destiny one thing been a long time since that so um yeah i don't really have a choice here kind of have to invade nobody else did they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna do the thing i just need a kill we can count it as a dub there we go okay death heals primeval don't know why i list there what what is what it what is this what is this button why can't i how do i i'm so confused go photo okay what is what is my melee why can't i have to hit somebody with so could be is this deadpool what is that oh it does use a melee charge okay so maybe that's what that's supposed to also no more power oh wait no power's over there i'm just bad why did you spawn there more importantly why is this game still going oh my god no i think they're going to kill it now jesus yeah there we go oh my god gambit memento what the fudge where's my gambit memento this point is i didn't even like have to do one game really i mean i just want to throw a cool shader on a crafted weapon okay well there you go josh that's what you get let me use your account appreciate you we're going to run this back uh uh uno mas time in gambit we might actually not even need to do pvp funnily enough we pvp more in that match than pve anyway it see it's the fire exploding void projectiles i just kind of think of that like you know the black talon and stuff that just kind of like but i think that's not quite what it does it's a little unclear but it almost looks like knife trick you know a bunch of little things it kind of seems like that but void projectiles oh look at this guy on his throne too bad i'll have to dethrone him yeah using my phone no exotic sword that is okay is it me but am i really the only one who's never really used an exotic sword i know what meant at its time a little bit um during like deep stone crypt and stuff unfortunately i did not have it at that time so really and then aside from that i have exotic swords never never really never really used him like is that just me i don't know like i'm almost okay i would actually i prefer this to be like the raid exotic because then i i would really be okay missing out because i just watched like never use grenades anyway um i don't know i just kind of want to get just another there we go there's ten modes to bank should i save all my ammo for the boss decisions decisions yes okay see let's can we get it like can i hit you from here okay the void projectiles is weird they almost seem like invisible to all of us to the enemy to myself i don't know that's why i was like fighting that guy the very first time and i was so confused i was like did it did projectiles even get sent out did they not it's not very clear not a very clear indicator you know oh we're losing notes can't bank those moats brother if the if the most bank thing is blocked brother we also have just not enough to even freaking invade okay all right here's a good test can i hit you from here yeah no okay so it's it's it's close it's how about this yeah okay i don't even does it have verticality it's a better qu let's try this yeah okay that one yeah okay i can't i'm so confused am i doing anything so many questions um no that's still not the here we go i'm invisible and i must find the invader and i must kill z invalidate although i don't think that's i don't think it's gonna happen with me running around with my sword i aim and they cannot see me fire me fizzy play huh oh my god you didn't why didn't it do anything i know it didn't send up projectiles because they didn't go invisible does it not work when you're in the air i swear it works in there well let's see well maybe maybe it doesn't work in there [Music] okay a little technicality there you gotta pull out y'all ready glasses get to the legal lease the legal terms and conditions oh shoot yeah typically they're like uh read the terms and agreements and i'm like uh something something i don't know i see somebody selling my soul well what's the worst that could happen well that looks like you gotta read you gotta read that this time and uh well oops i'm illiterate so i don't know how to holy hold on i'm almost at 15. i know this guy's gonna kill me if i do anything but yay but i'm invisible again you can't kill me if i stay invisible we're no longer getting a video i'm gonna like annihilate watch it that actually went it actually went pretty well is it what what what's left what let me break the mouse who's the what hello who's who is here who's been who's where were you what that is so this am i am i getting hello hello who is blocking where what i'm i'm getting troll i'm getting trolled this is what he's not even showing up on the radar okay i said i wouldn't invade oh my god they're about to win maybe i should invade okay okay so i gotta do it on the ground if i'm gonna do anything otherwise no seeking projectiles and we want seeking projectiles okay and that dude's just dead jesus okay well then what if i do this go invisible i'm running around okay now check this out ready i'm invisible oh my god well radiance ah yeah i wanted to kill him through well it was gonna be sick i was literally mid animation man i was gonna be i was like yeah we'll kill him through i mean ah look at it look at this pvp pb evp pro reviewer ins how does he do it how does he really do it i don't know i don't know it's incredible i'm trying to think how do i how do i show this sword off more i also don't know the answer to that frankly i think we've seen all we need you know i don't need to artificially inflate this video i think we're good we saw it exhibition do it on the ground you can't do it in the air it doesn't say that but remember do it do it on the ground and fire exploding fires exploding void projectiles can it beat the lament though like that's the other thing too can it really be a better boss dps like single dps moment i don't know and also if you're not a void hunter you're not gonna be able to proc the uh the the extra damage for free you could finish to go invisible if you but whatever i give this rating an invisible out of invisible rating can't even see the rating it goes deep [Music] [Music] foreign
