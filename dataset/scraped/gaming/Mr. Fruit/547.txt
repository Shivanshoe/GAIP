hi eddie hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to risk of rain 2. it's been a while but the game is now officially released it is version 1.0 i played one game because it apparently reset a lot of my stuff i swear i had like some more people unlocked but today we'll be playing the huntress i guess you can't see it but the only people i have unlocked is uh shooting mcdude and huntress welcome to titanic planes we landed and for those unawa oh jesus all right i'm gonna have to get used to that for those unaware with what the heck this game is well i'm so happy to tell you exactly what it is oh look at those rain of arrows okay i'm gonna have to get used to this because like i said i have only been using shooting mcshoot dude oh my god get absolutely destroyed though but i'm pretty sure yeah we essentially have auto aim so that's kind of cool i just realized there's a dedicated sprint button the whole oh my god i almost just died the whole time i was playing shooty mcshoot dude i was like oh my god why like how do i i have to use my dodge ability to run that's ridiculous no turns out i didn't turns out i'm just stupid but i think this is a moon buck or something a lunar coin ooh not entirely sure what that does but yeah look at this auto aim dude i'm never going to miss a shot because i'm correct obviously i got homing glaives i got homing arrows of course i like this chick because uh duh she's got a bow and arrow and you guys know me i love my bow and arrow so anyway if you don't know what risk of rain it risk of ring two is it is a roguelike game there was one previously obviously it's the second in the series so clearly that's how that works but it was sides growing and so instead they decided to go with this third person action idea and honestly i think it works really well it's really polished and quite frankly it's uh it's addicting but let's get a random item here so you're gonna see these items we're picking up like in most roguelikes this is the artifacts and stuff that we get that affect the run and how we interact with said run in enemies while we go and then like most rogue this is technically a rogue light like most rug lights and rogue likes once you die that's it bada bing bada boom you're dead you gotta restart however you obviously can carry some stuff over like you can find certain artifacts and bring those with you or you can unlock new characters obviously to use in your future runs like this with my huntress i forget exactly how i did it i think you have to like beat the first three teleporter things without ever dying something like that i'm not entirely sure i do like that little teleport arrow thing so anyway we're just gonna go around i need to i don't know the meta i don't know if just like bum rushing to find the teleporter and then doing it is the play because you'll see top right the longer the game goes on the more difficult your foes become so yeah i'm not part of it is rush the teleporter obviously but then i think another part of it is take your time so that you can get all the goodies that the level has to offer so it's this weird in between and i don't really know what to do with it but get absolutely embarrassed bruh and just like that we're doing great folks i'm looking everywhere to try and find things to buy because you'll see actually you can't see because my face is covering it uh i am a paper but essentially we have gold and some moon coins and i'm gonna move my face came right now like i said we have some gold and moon coins up there you only acquire gold oh jesus christ i need to stop doing that i'm going to kill myself 100 doing that here pretty soon but you get gold coins by obviously opening up certain containers or killing enemies and then you use those to open up containers on the levels and those are all randomly generated so what will you get you never know and i don't really know what's good or bad again i haven't played a lot so it's just kind of shoot some dudes and have fun and i can do that we have a lot of money now ooh this should give us an uncommon oh yeah chance on kill to drop an ammo pack that resets all kill cooldowns don't mind if i do i don't know what any of this stuff is oh heavens kill all nearby allies after standing still oh jesus for two seconds maybe i should worry about myself first well i guess that's fine um i don't have any allies so i'm all alone oh and here's the teleporter okay so this is how you activate the teleporter and move on to the next realm you summon a boss and it's going to summon a whole bunch of enemies you have to stand in the teleporter zone long enough for you to complete the cooldown and once you do that you can move on however like i said they're going to be oh god okay maybe don't jump right into them they'll be spawning plenty dudes we're on easy though earlier in the run so it's probably not going to be too crazy if i die here you can actually make fun of me for the rest of your life because i will deserve it although it's you know to be fair i'm i don't use the huntress you know first game huntress don't mind me just teleport up shoot those things and keep dodging ideally what i what i normally try and do is focus the boss once the boss is dead kill everything else because then i'll worry about it but until that happens oh jesus and just throw all of our abilities on cooldown what the fudge was that okay that almost just one shot it's duly noted when it starts doing that uh panic yeah that's uh apparently all i can really do with that the boss is almost down though it's gonna do that okay i was about to do its crazy thing so cool down you'll see to the right we're almost at 80 so once that's full we'll be able to live our life however we would like to and i don't have to leave the area i'm probably not going to oh but we got the ukulele which says and his music was electric which just means my basic attacks have a chance to chain electric like you just saw right there i did get that in my last run and the teleporter is ready to go so i can skip scat and skadoodle on out of here but first i want to see if there's anything i can buy here real quick because i think once you move levels you'll lose all your gold so i'm either going to use it or lose it and if i could get another relic or two or artifact i don't know the the correct term uh they use here but yes i would i would like that like this i was hoping it was an uncommon but what are you gonna do we got drop a healing orb on kill that's great we love that well in fact i'm not picky like i said i'll take literally anything so these little canisters i can't buy anything from but they give me gold which would normally be great but i don't have that much stuff to buy so unless i see another container this will probably be the last one okay i didn't even pick it up that's great uh rapidly heal outside of danger oh that's nice i don't really see any more containers there is this thing oh wait is that a drone pog okay so we got a healing drone and then this is offer shrine of chance every time you do it you have a chance of it succeeding but if it doesn't oh my god you'll get an item just like me i was lucky enough to fail three times in a row and it actually got me an achievement because they're like oh my god i can't believe you did that nobody nobody is that bad that's incredible now we head into the next realm now we awake in the wetland aspect yep and as you see no more gold to our name however i do carry over my healing drone so it'll be nice to have him join us on our ride and well i mean really this is the gist of the game you want to see how far you can get there are secrets you can disc oh what is this wait what did i actually just get i have no idea there are secrets you can discover and activate as you go i obviously don't know any of those but i can buy this which gives me an equipment i believe fire a black hole that draws enemies in oh yeah i'll use this when it seems fitting what does this do oh i can lose 50 my hp and oh it gives me gold how interesting okay well i regen health so that really doesn't seem like that big of a deal i guess it is if oh you know what that stuff i'm picking up is that's the item from my artifact that if i pick that up i just got a lot of gold it um it refreshes all my cooldowns so that's good to know so with that i should keep looking around though and i mean we already have a good amount of money so find something that i can buy i want to go shopping so far though it's pretty barren no luck so far chief but i'm sure i'll find some eventually my healing drone is getting attacked that's not really cool but i'm also not going to do much to help it so can't really complain god these guys are tanky you know we do have auto aim but it kind of means we don't do much damage understandably but you hate to see it oh you like that little teleport yeah i know these little jellyfish want to come up give you the good suck give you ligma they explode on contact and it's not really cool boom i completely missed that it's really hard to hit floating characters with that thing oh but you can't you can't hit me dude i'm impossible oh god there's so many of them sex the sack i have to be missing rates like i sh i should be finding things i have money i don't need more money currently i want to spend my money i am actively trying to stimulate our economy but they're not having any of it what does this do in a temporary barrier on kill that's pretty good i kill a lot of people so we'll take that you also level up as you can see bottom i'm currently level seven as you level up you get stronger and stuff i don't actually know exactly what happens when you level up but yeah i'm i'm sure that's not too far from the truth there i'm on the hunt for the teleporter and something to buy at this point i guess i just don't really care oh i think i found the teleporter and i found something to buy oh what a oh wait what is that we can buy that and that looks pretty cool let me uh get you out of my face open chest utility uh it just kind of seems normal all right after the shrine failed after the shrine succeeded oh what is this hold on so this is my black hole that's pretty cool but this toggle the fire costs gold per bullet uh actually you know what that's not bad i feel like i usually have a lot of gold left over so we'll save that and for like a boss fight i don't know maybe that's and that's pretty good the hunt for something to purchase continues oh oh we found something give it to me oh it's uncommon too oh get an extra jump that's pog definitely i think is my favorite one just too much fun and i mean what's not to like about getting to jump more if that's like useful at all times look at this oh and i get to sacrifice some more gold oh and we got it first try increases attack speed where do i get a million more of those oh i quite like that oh i can keep sacrificing uh it didn't work hold on let me get rid of these plebs try again what is this fire is swarming missiles that does seem pretty good but again you know if i'm paying gold for these bullets odds are that's pretty good anyway we've almost gotten hard i think i've spent too much time chili dickin so like that's that's just where like you know i don't know like it at what point do i give up i'm trying to find new stuff and do i just you know activate the teleporter which i'm doing right now which means it's boss time which means i don't think i'm ready for this however i'm gonna use this and at the cost of gold per shooting look at how much damage we're doing oh my god and it's speeding up holy oh it just doesn't stop oh my god it just keeps going it just keeps going okay we're out of ammo but i would say that worked out pretty well that was a lot of damage i am certainly all right with that oh i did not mean to teleport right into it oh no heavens what if it does the explody thing again there there is a variety of bosses you can get i just it just so happens to be that i just keep getting this one don't hate the player hate the game oh oh it's gonna explode it's gonna oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i think i'm about to die this is okay okay plus i'm outside the circle so i can't even hurt the things right now god i'm just trying to kill everything okay okay okay good news i can activate my coin gun i'm again try and go for the boss and i'm dead i've never died that early that's incredible that was a pathetic showcase but a showcase nonetheless i just i i'm trying to think of excuses as to why i did that bad but honestly i'm coming up blank anyway with that said i want to thank all much for watching absolutely i'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
