heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell and if you've been keeping up with the series you know today's episode is a very exciting episode this might be the day we win the day we beat the last spell or nightberg city i don't know what else there is i just know we i don't want to get ahead of ourselves in fact let's just get into it because i'm like a little kid at a candy store i can't wait i'm just so excited we're headed into night 10. oh well i guess slightly excited slightly nervous it's a good it's a healthy mix of both i'd say um apologies if at any point during this video i sound like a pre-pubescent teen um voice has been going out so i'll do my best but let's not rest on our laurels here shall we we're getting attacked from each side i'm frightened but that's no excuse we're headed into it let's go to deployment we got all prepared in the last episode so we only need one person over here this one even has gates so why not we'll throw uh monica over here two people being here is nice because there's already kind of a bit of a choke thanks to the agua agua over her you're just pushed so far back yeah i'm generally i'm thinking about maybe just posting some people up here getting a few shots in then when it gets overwhelming jump over the wall and into a watchtower uh but anywho one person there we need one person over here who do i think should be soloing this i me thinks uh first off exit the watchtower i'm gonna put a druid over here yeah i'm going to put druid over here i'm going to put cobalt by his lone swain kob i think is our better archer could be mistaken i'm not sure but because of that we'll have him solo solo bolo rad bert will come over here um duran will come over here and assist miguel so call will be up here doing his thing uh where do i think they're gonna come from see like the errors are a bit of a debate i don't think they're gonna specifically appear on the arrows uh but we'll throw you guys out there a little bit i mean i think we're safe right like what's gonna what's the worst that could happen um if they all get pooped on well shame on me i'll put everybody two units out how about that living on the edge all right we got two two one one let me make sure they're all in the right yeah as far as i can tell ladies and gentlemen let night in me get excuse me begin all right why am i guessing oh the enemy is here they're upon us oh jesus what the fudge is this why else spread out and on the one side i'm not prepared for okay i should have prepared for runners and crawlers knowing that because god ah we're gonna be overwhelmed so fast let's start with the uno sides cause i would argue those are easier we still got four movement after this so where do we want to propagate probably here here here probably there again pew pew that's pretty good that's pretty good hey that's pretty good you're not man but can we kill them all uh possibly if i didn't have to worry about prop the whatever requires line to say i'll use sonova okay well let's try that then here here maybe there again all right and already killed so ah but of course we crit i forgot i'm a bit of a fragger darn it let me see how much damage we do here we should be crit and pretty solid here dodge fudge wait a second 68 poison damage it's not going to do enough uh badge five don't dodge don't dodge all right wasn't pretty but it did the job uh i mean i'm not i guess the archer can kind of hit me but aside from that i'm not worried about much this is inopportune i was hoping they would funnel not like that okay it's fine they're just testing me and i will pass make no mistake die your stupid fool you've all but written away your life i fear look at that go on call oh my oh i'm sorry what were you trying to do um we gotta oh there's a rippers so i'm you know i'll just wait for them to come around here then cobb will do something about it i mean i'll kill however many i can right now but i don't think we're going to be able to get get over there i tell you what though we got our pick at propagating that's for sure [Music] keep up the good work all right it's pretty good let's propagate over here maybe go over that way all pr literally everybody's getting propagated all right by the time i think they get close to the walls they should in theory all be dead so normally that'd be great but fat yeah i won't be able to capitalize well that's all my movements i don't really want to do that nerf that's all i could do forgive me who's not poisoned you but i can't reach you uh so poison won't kill you so but i don't have line of sight okay cool uh poison will practically get you're useless for the most part crawler i don't like you and you're not gonna die so and then let's uh do i run up here can i get hit by anything i don't think so uh and then who else sure uh i'll have three more movement after this could take care of him poison will eventually kill him so i don't really have to worry about you as much i'll just take you out run back the only person that should be able to no crawler will die actually nobody should be able to get to us should be all right okay we need to reposition you and all of you i mean god there's just so many jesus oh it's a mess oh low there's a fire oh this guy only has five movement too i'm gonna have to get him over the wall a fan in fact that's probably what i'm gonna do this turn so again fudge man let's see what we can propagate here unfortunately they're not bunched up as well as i would like them to be admittedly that's good though propagated the wrong way but that's fine actually yeah that works perfectly fine what am i talking about now my single target damage like this is nothing to write home about so uh not entirely sure what i should do maybe i'll throw off some attacks because then wait if i go here then i can jump the wall so let me just take care of you take care of you and jump the wall prepare these shelves for wall uh i can't use snipe because then i won't have any any movement left nice crit buddy oh wait i'll fudge it you need to all right we gotta do it here good golly mrs molly how am i gonna get him up low key i don't know maybe i can't go here i mean because like in one turn you would need three movement to jump over wall and two to go up a watchtower so if i go here i guess that would be three and then that would be two so technically that should work i believe so all right pray for me one action point from who oh there you go give me some armor good work boys and yes hey way to go crossbow oh they're already hitting the walls oh wait no no no he gives minus movement doesn't he ah fudge he does no we're getting trolled screwy bonus i don't care let's drop again over here why don't we yeah should go perfect i can't reach you guys oh there we go get done fall kid stupid uh and then while i'm at it why don't we just go ahead and propagate there uh yeah you're dead you're gonna die you're gonna die almost almost almost no yes i don't have to worry about you no all right well i lied i don't know looks like druids can practically handle everything on their own as long as they bunch up because here we see where druid cannot really do that uh propagate away and then yeah this is where the next problem comes in uh i can't really finish anyone up here all right i'm going to need you to get that reliability oh wait you have to like oh mega okay so just crit you just crit for me that'd be great oh you're the best oh wait maybe that wasn't a crate it's just a high roll well that was so great stuff i guess you're never getting over the wall at this point um poison will kill you should take care of you okay maybe not okay well i'm gonna snipe you screw you now i think we jump the wall next turn i'll be able to actually do something there's too many of them captain little boners man like what you guys just like i don't bunch up is that too much to ask i guess so see that seems like our best choice holy shabbat jesus freaking pooped all over those dudes let's screw you guys screw you screw you and you um and i'll help over here that means like this guy's look he's got to clean up everybody i got to get your runners and crawls your runners and crawlers and i gotta get my own i know i know but i'm giving you all this work because i know you can handle it okay because i know you're uh a ragger right we'll just do that kill you well then what is the nature of my existence i don't know what are you good for uh i guess that is the answer there you go buddy all right so who's not dying from stuff you you you're dying you're dying you're dying you're not but i'm not in range all right perfect run you back a little bit uh and then you can i mean well do we even need to run you guys back because not really no they're all chill let me just double check before i get somebody killed for absolutely no reason yeah there's no way they should be it they should all die minus one movement not a problemo blaze blaze blaze and scrub dead not dead not quite dead not not not dead either but that's okay dead dead dead dead if we crit which we did not oh that but then of course we quit when i don't account for it right yeah monica's like this the best you got come on i'm insulted give me something better why don't i just minus moving speech walls i can uh high roll this because i know i will that's that reliability i think we're done one action points little reaction why don't you just go ahead but you know what just because i'm paranoid i'll shoot you all right yeah see they're all dating just how many are there holy suck too many is the answer they're upon the walls quicker than i thought they'd be wait a second dodged stupid dodge stupid that's not good hmm i really thought okay to the walls man back i don't think they can take down the walls though before i'll be able to get back um yeah wow just so many more people showed up well it's everybody's favorite time propagation time you're dead where do i want to prop gate let's go i don't know i got many options let's hope it goes this way hog that's what we love to see spread it in there spread some bees and then you just do a giant debuff if you want to uh let's let's see what you're what what you're cooking up here buddy not bad not bad not bad not bad let's do that perfect all right now i need you to get back and prepare for war friend die die now we'll back up might have to jump the wall that looks pretty good to me we'll have plenty of time to assess and manage the threat uh we got we go either way we'll just do that but you're supposed to be the accurate one if you're inaccurate we're all done for you all right this crawler will get a hit in but whatever oh wait well i'll maim him nevermind i'll crit him let's go all right friend it's time to get up yes no more time left to dilly dally everything must die yeah so many of them this wall this wall this side sucks i hate it over here i hate everything about this i have to hope we get the high rolls okay we're ballers so of course we did should i delay their approach yeah it sounds pretty good to me chief um yeah i think that's better than maybe getting one kill here all right you did your best kid i'm so proud here i can't even propagate what the heck all right well then i'll propagate here propagate over there propagate over here uh we're oh we're at action points all right fine though time to blaze he wasn't able to kill us oh really i'll be the judge of that yeah no survivors as i always say you know out of range shot my anus okay easy enough let's go monica let's prepare yourself because i don't know if we have any more people left i assume we do do we probably i know i'm tempted to start slowly making my way over here though i can use the warp gate next turn hopefully tbd i think that's good never mind someone has an action point oh it's you now we go oh there's a couple people at the core store yeah get him hey wait oh wait barely break their armor let's go baby ah savage is it broken oh oh they don't want to wait a second wait a minute no more time to meme we're kind of in trouble ah or are we who can i hit again well i'll wait because i get a proper gate oh bars uh can't quite reach hold on propagate over here why don't you go that way that'd be it's great i can control it practically screw you guys bop bop and that in turn means that you get to shoot nothing you're useless you make me sick you might take a shot from an arrow but that's fine i don't have to kill you the poison was gonna eventually do it but we have an extra point so today's not your lucky day uh don't hate propagate oh wait no you're not druid what am i what spitting bars for no reason calm down mr fruit oh my god there goes them i think three's the best we're gonna do here uh poison will kill that guy he's gonna take care of you in fact they can barely even reach me so i'm gonna help with these and i'll back up because we're not under threat of an attack very good you need to get to work with your bees bees okay um bees oh you killed them uh there we go just chicken all right a little reliability you're gonna have to snipe this guy right yep this guy is too slowed i might need to do it again frankly yeah i'm doing it just gotta buy a little bit of time then we're gonna be fine over here we're fine over there let me just clean up these scrub a dub dubs real quick oh almost a one shot clean that up oh what line of sight but i hardly knew her okay way to go my lad you're killing it we'll just give you some dodge some dodge the other one with anyone left okay yes we should get a perfect night turn oh look at that freaking a cell's like bro leave some for me man let me get in on this i have no i can't see anything i'll help you when i'm able to climb up next turn let's kill some boners then i come over to give you assistance the boners there we go dodge that you pleb now you don't have any more ap left uh let's beat up can i propagate here hi of course i can um that's really all i need to do at that point uh i'll just snipe this guy that you poison will kill you i'm gonna hyrule i'm not worried about bob of course poison's gonna kill you kill you kill you not you you not you you're the only one currently threatening damage that and that all right perfect never mind we might not have even needed a cell just got ahead of myself i'll just give you some dodge one two three four five six seven easy enough now one last remains who wants the final blow how about uh she will snipe him for the overkill [Music] 1259. that's a lot of damage a perfect night 10 level 11. i don't even know how high you can level people but i feel like we're getting there oh give me that cash yes and give me what is probably going to be another underwhelming night reward at this point they insult me holy essence holy essence indeed the power of christ compels you darkness every night has been easy what can i say you should try this out you should try this out look at the look at this holy the three armors that's gonna be clutch yes yes yes yes yes knight reward give us an epic  only tier two into tier three man what's gonna sell for the most you were the pistol always saying this is an offhand pistol wait that's big you might be like mr fruit i don't comprehend well let me show you cause she's chilling with a stupid freaking shoe look get rid of this block now she gets extra crit power three percent damage four percent dodge boom and if i need it i can use the grape shot now that's huge i've unlocked a prowess hopefully it's like do 8 bajillion damage in one shot because that's what i just did no oh survive night 10 the lone wolf armor i quite like that cheese geez come on change it don't be shy oh black better blah blah blah have i liked anything new this says new but i've had these for a while uh more light pants experience game oh here's a generator plus 15 experience again that's pretty good uh i'm actually gonna cop that right now and i'll put the rest towards wealthy haven all right decisions decisions what do we have in the shop some decent stuff i'll make up my mind later first out here comes the fun part let's see what we get a craft for free [Music] the rarity makes me sick it's so hard to get on comments and rings and stuff but this is tier five i mean movement points dodge resistance i mean i just put this on and like sell it sure come on give me a helmet what the extra range damage but one less movement speed or 15 block i guess i'll grab that another oh there we go nasal helmet dodge health resistance i mean it doesn't matter the stats like thrown on anyone is an upgrade essentially so tier four of all the stuff i don't care about sick grab a long bow i reckon i need a short bow brother that's what i'm working with let's love everybody up all right girl get on with your bad self you're pretty decked out so definitely selling we need to equip these on people you're not going to grab that you already have armor uh yeah okay so what do we want to give you all that physical power put on you wasted wasted away let's give you more crit chance 48 percent let's get it [Music] and eight percent extra damage why not go crazy go crazy go stupid ah and then explore after killing enemy dodging grants action point extra damage for each hit taken no any applied debuff last that is interesting because i'd be applying movement penalty for three turns poison for four i don't know maybe that's a bit overkill by landing a critical hit regenerates mana you do crit a lot that's hold up now uh yeah let's do that seems good feels good all right miguel let's get you even more magic damage because why not 75 sure experience gain at this point is probably a little useless but i will give you poison damage we like that and for perks i don't actually know you go energized well see problem is you don't really kill people you do but not immediately if that makes sense i think about doing mana collector but you literally have so much mana like i don't think running out of mana is something you're worried about so i feel like maybe reliability on isolated enemies or energized let's let's try energize whatever maybe if i mean if it does proc then it'll be worth it let's give you some more range damage putting you at 53 holy hackers and it's better accuracy for perks um yeah probably next to crit uh and we just unlocked the prowess because we got somebody to 50 range damage so heroes with range droppings have generated with an extra 3 range damage now hog all of the damage all of that light i'll have that light uh we could give you some more mana it's not make or break but oh see what the heck is this stuff i guess i'll just give you reliability perks what did i give miguel for level 10. i think i gave him magic fuel but you don't have nearly as much magic you could get 66 magic damage i mean that's not bad i mean yeah what else i feel like that's probably the best we could do or maybe cherry picking we'll do magic fuel well because right now i get 11. if i restore his mana he would get 14 i mean it's not that big of a difference whatever there we go 1500 resources to build with oh my i haven't let me check the gear what are we working with eh what do we got over here we've got some crit some reliability a lot of reliability we got a helmet with dodge daily main region probably gonna get it just because we don't have any this gives armor critical block stun chance no one uses stun chains i don't think although we do have a longbow now so we could go for because it has arctic blast potentially stunned nine people pretty good snipe shot see snipe shot does three to 500 whereas assassinate does 4 to 490 but see i think that's base damage that's not even applying isolated ring excessive snipe shot but that's not with i don't know because i think if i was gonna replace anyone's weapon it would probably be the uh the rifle oh maybe i do it in which case i think that would prove useful dodge an opportunistic man of regen armor and isolated crit power nothing crazy frankly nothing too crazy that's what i'm saying i know i know let's make so much noise that's what i was thinking yeah yeah thanks for that thank you puppy yeah yeah uh-huh you don't say who needs this i mean this water is just whatever right uh so many people don't have a thing just give you extra dodges sure there you go nice helmet looking good a stud extra range damage here but we give up you gain a lot of armor and block but we give up nine quick chance and 25 percent liability i don't think so no next okay we'll replace this oh now you got 60 range damage oh shoot girl uh we can give this just a rad bird uh takes one movement away so let's go someone that doesn't need to move which would be you quiet pooper um i haven't been paying attention i kind of just tuned them out if they've continued to mark my apologies i've just gotten really good at ignoring them i mean that in the best way possible [Music] wait did i just get the longboat too oh didn't i just give you this gives you extra range damage but maybe that's the play extra stunt oh the only problem is i i didn't spec in like the other stun chains thing either like you have no extra stun chance possibility kind of your problem right now i'm probably gonna buy all the potions they have though because yeah we're at the point where uh let's see here improves passive not gonna help right now let's do that upgrades help bower production five oh jesus oh shoot yo i get i get four free items here okay and they all seem to suck incredible is this an upgrade i think so [Music] it doesn't give dodge actually it does one less damage on them i don't know how that works because it's a higher tier but it sells for the most so um again uh one one more time for the road it's gonna give me an epic okay just all comments short bow four though wait gives me a trinket i feel betrayed where's everybody short bows short bow plus two yeah yeah actually reliability's nice but it don't do this much damage all right radbert there you go uh i don't know if we're keeping that i don't think so what do i do so i guess it's just free things to sell don't need that don't need that don't need that don't need that don't need that don't need that i'll hold on to that tentatively okay so that that was that i guess i could do the same thing to our armor if i wanted to why not see if we can get some better armor here ideally some hats which just give us dodge but whatever seems like it's almost impossible to get rarity things here block propagation bounce um so yeah i'm pretty sure i'm at the point where [Music] any other shops or anything are useless uh so i don't need gold really unless i wanted to do this but even then i still have too much so let's just do each real quick let's get all the materials oh we got 2 000 holy heckers make sure to push this back and determine where they're coming from same weak side same strong sides okay then we're practically ready dude freaking bring it rither i could upgrade this that's true does anyone need healing you're weak you're weak okay so let's go to temple i could just also go with the free offering things yeah see there we go yeah let me have to use my workers dude easy um no one's really hurting on mana hey i'll do there you go topped off give you some more how much you got 13 versus 22 okay so give you some we got two more workers i could get more items here but that just doesn't seem to be worth it yeah gosh dang it's dangerous i don't even know what to do with my i don't know what to do with my hands i can get another mage what does that do yeah never mind i'm full on mages might be silly me yeah i would okay that's it that's pretty much it for gold cool duh is there anything left to spin gold on really no no passive production but i don't have enough for it to make a difference [Music] sure i guess okay all right so yeah i don't need to get more man we'll just go for scavenging them all right 2100 materials to work with that's pretty good so yeah i don't think we're going to take any of this gear well i did say we could use the hat right because we just don't have one and that's pretty much it okay we got a hat we got a hat we got this propagation this is good for you isn't it where's our other druid friend he has extra poison damage so we'll give a cell a cell i'm not really sure that one who wants dodge um i guess a cell and who wants the other dodge well you have the longbow so you're probably the last person that's going to be out oh we're missing a couple don't have a trinket that one well let's see is there a trinket you want brother that gives minus reliability no thank you that you know what screw it you don't need to drink it you're fine get that out of here get that trash yeah all right it's defense time i need to make sure i don't am i gonna go with this a little bit at this a little bit of that a little bit this little bit of that we have snipe shot arctic blast is that better than yeah i think so it also has the superior range so all right what fudge do we do with our defenses we're gonna destroy you we're gonna build a new one go ahead repair repair destroy you you fake wall destroy you because i can't repair you uh same here [Music] get daddy get daddy get daddy i might have destroyed some whatever going crazy repair repair [Music] destroy that build you prepare but there's another one look at that oh i guess i didn't have to that whatever all right okay all the walls are healed oh my god i didn't fully upgrade over here what am i doing all right i think every wall is fully upgraded right i do believe so i'm gonna get rid of one of our gates [Music] all right yeah now it's a matter of what fudge do i spend the rest of my goodies on i just lay everywhere with traps i guess all right i could have upgraded i could use the gold upgrade ballistas cat limited to 12 crimes here like i just don't think catapults are good anymore like the damage still do is literally nothing so get some warp gates going in case of danger use warp gates perfect and then yeah i guess just traps everywhere i could line the city walls with stun traps oh it's big brain time i don't know if that's the best used to your i don't even know if this how this will work for all i know this will backfire but i'm doing it they said it couldn't be done and i said nonsense get stunned stupid yeah i'm pretty sure it doesn't backfire enough right let me let me just check let's just you exit the watchtower you can stand right there right you're fine right i hope so if not we got a problem but i don't know how he would have a problem i think we're fine all right um i think the way we had the oh i didn't buy any potions still always blow my gold whatever yeah i think we're done all right we're going to position you here position youtube um here no no i gotta get chad here first uh like here and the only problem is wait a second you okay thanks to your newfound longboat you might not actually have to move okay your movement speed sucks anyway so we'll keep you there a cell acell whatever you come back over here you guys vibe right there you can vibe right there like right there all right so we got one two one one two one and on the weak and strong sides everything's looking good night eleven begins i'm scared wait what the fudge is that thing way way whoa what the fudge you see this thing it's the size of your mom oh my sorry seriously what is that thing i guess we're about to find out yikes and that's on our solo side two of them too oh okay that's right we're we're fraggers uh not great uh what's that plan of attack here chief i don't know i'll do that uh that does not one child tragic well i hate lancers jesus saves so much armor oh but not when we crit hi uh let's see why must you be like this easy never mind continue on we have to do the same thing and look at this giant side and they always decide to come like this freaking boners come like this we'll go on the other solo side the other side the other side the other side of me let's get up a little bit so we can just kind of propagate everywhere a little bit over here a little bit over here i'm thinking we go crazy maybe uh yeah overheat i thought i already clicked you i don't know what happened you're dead you guys are dead holy jesus you're dead oh my god let's see does it take okay it takes a lot to kill you so we'll just blaze hey lights you up you just gave my life light you up i'll repeat eat this game my life dodge all right so many of them let's propagate first and see what comes up i hate you lancers i could just take away all their armor immediately but poison ignores it anyway right so doesn't matter uh let's poison over there yeah god and for the sake of it let's do it again see where we go all right i'm not even going to bother running the numbers because i'm pretty sure that's just going to hurt all of them a lot let me check your moves what'd he do okay that's all you do ah snipe shot don't care holy that we can even kill people with this then i just do this um like how much poison damage you guys you're not taking enough let's try and stop you guys that didn't work oh okay this only takes wait there we go this only takes one action point so i can do two of these it just takes two movement but i'm never moving anyway stupid stupid that was pretty good i'm not gonna lie now let's get go let's get going over ye when will you learn your actions have concept wayne says 100 get the lancers all those lancers can suck my booty respectfully of course yeah it looks like i gotta go run tail again run forest run can i hit any of you no i cannot fudge i can't hit you and that's it yeah we'll have to get you over next turn so debuff you all so i can just poop on you oh and uh yeah oh and oh i don't i'll poop on you perfect have you chill right there you can do that i guess you're the only one perfect okay well at least the lancers seem to come back oh jesus the bulky okay it cannot be stunned 80 stun resistance 50 block 75 armor what mutations caused by the mist can be really monstrous and powerful and bulky is a perfect example their attacks are devastating and they can use their strength to hurl bowlers at heroes thankfully they're pretty rare uh there's two back to backs so i'd argue that oh my god okay effects oh my god they could stun my here oh my god if that ever happens okay it's a good thing i read that all right we're gonna stay very far away from you what the that's no good that's no good at home well that just won't do jesus not panicking you're panicking um freaking hate lancers man my pp alright let's do that oh the grit see you bulky l-o-l never stood a chance um i really don't like you but do that oh oh my god i had a five percent chance on both those to regen action points and i did for both of them holy cow that's like huge no means holy brap indeed [Music] wow i thought that might go jesus suck my pp okay i don't have to worry about that because i'm going to go aid right now oh look at that saucy don't mind if i do wait what you all tanked it so well then i'll do it again stupids check me out okay now i jump over there and should i even should i hop on this maybe nah i think we're good here right that's too late i don't think i can take back so okay i'm thinking we shred armor here so that uh these lancers don't have armor for you guys minus 100 armor but it it didn't really okay i don't understand that but that's okay i don't know how that works stupid get this to propagate whoo saucy sassy you're debuffed i can hit you pretty hard oh hard enough and i want to kill you and that's all i can do for now pretty sure yeah you will be able to skewer me that's not cool that should be safe here all right back over here monica's just vibing let me tell you monica's having a good time like it's all it almost feels like a waste this is too easy for monica he's like please stop i'm already cemented to the ground what more do you want propagate propagate and appreciate just stack and poison on these plebs man that three poise oh yeah you ain't lifting not on my watch let's get you oh requires my side uh and we'll just do this again see where it goes all right so yeah i'm not gonna about to do the math again but i assume next turn there's gonna be a lot of dead things you're gonna die i guess i'll do some math just so i know who to shoot you're gonna okay you're gonna die practically dead dead dead very very omega dead super dead not dead these guys right here aren't uh by the time you get to the wall dead so so very dead dead oh we got a bulky coming uh okay so which one back here wasn't i mean i'm not worried about you right now like i said you're gonna die you're gonna die all right so i'll just hit the people not oh well you ethical hyrule oh my god we're nuts and then we're just oh you're so weak will this break armor probably not okay great oh and it does extra damage when isolated but it's still not enough ah the bees man they're too strong make sure they give you dodge everyone's done your hairs didn't move oh i wanted to see the poison take off oh my god i'm salivating at that propagation holy bulk what three bulkies at least here we got another bulky here bulky shows up here monka start the easy side that's right it's called you easy plebs what do you do about it oh that's right nothing because i'm going to poop all over you look at that oh my god it's so easy i hit nothing no fudge now those guys aren't so easy i'll admit they're a little bit more of a nuisance but take that rewind it back just in case we don't create which of course i did um the last bit of action points crit again you're nuts nothing fazes you over here we get a property all i'm gonna do is propagate i'm gonna propagate you and i'm gonna propagate yeah and i'm gonna propagate yeah and then not all of you are dead you're gonna die you guys aren't it's annoying until now that is duh okay he's not ready for this what i guess uh we'll do it again then again i can't it's literally just comes down to the fact that i can't really do anything else so there we go poison will kill you you're welcome i know really carrying the team here um let's whack this dude not quite a crit but it might as well open let's be honest i'll just kill all you don't mind if i do this guy's not going to die unless we crit which we did not i don't want him to shish kebab me uh which he can if he goes here i don't know if he's going to that thing's practically mobile so we're fine [Music] let's get back to propagating somehow we didn't hit the bulky hit the bulk there we go wait what did we not hit the bulky go propagate to the bulky boner whatever dude um okay this is getting a little worse there's just a lot of them you know uh how far can you move you you can move in general so too much um i don't need to do any of that though okay we're getting a little overwhelmed i guess i know any line of sight i thought maybe let me this time uh let me propagate over there uh and then i'll just slow movement here back it on up need to kill this guy or at least try and fail right stun over here okay rip then i'm just gonna hurt you to be fair we did a pretty good job yeah i'll just finish it the hardest thing he might be able to hit my wall i think that's it it is good work poison holy bulkies you can't quite hit it these freaking lancers man they just have a bajillion armor screw you in particular the stupid over kill you all right dodge oh wait a second wait wait that's it right wait i think you're done okay we must go assist i'll hop on uh one of the freaking things next turn to help you guys extra mana you certainly don't need that why why are you doing this why are you going that way i just don't understand not part of the plan screw you and [Music] the i don't know what you're thinking uh i don't know what you're thinking or you're thinking you are useless up here i want to remind you of that you suck absolute kaka but it's okay i still love you don't even know what i'm having you hit just i see skulls and i shoot this your range is limited i just want to feel like i'm helping i'm helping smile but are you and i am so sorry okay i might have backed up a little too much because now the proper oh we can still propagate never mind as long as you don't die don't kill anything perfect we get maximum propagation and then i'm gonna propagate here you guys should die to poison holy wait i might have applied a little look at that look at the poison snacks they're like oh my god why what what have we done to deserve this screw you mean and uh i won't even break armor on you so then i'll just debuff you blabs and then run back rewind it actually do i need to run back at all maybe not because you're gonna die you're gonna die you're gonna die these two are most certainly going to die uh you will not you will you will okay so i have to worry about this guy but this guy's dead this guy's dead dead not dead but debuffed so i have to be a little careful here but i think if i go like right here can't get hit can't get hit you can't reach me okay kind of ballsy because like looking at this it seems like a death like i'm just asking to die but i think i'm okay god hopes well we're good everywhere else that's actually terrifying you sit right there all right so then over here a lot of these rascals lots of these rascals everywhere i tell you whoop prop get away uh how about another and then propagate over here that's fine very fun okay well you're done pack it up that's about all you can do uh some kind of thing might not have to be done but just to be safe we're gonna hop up there for now this fella needs to die i'm not gonna be able to kill unless we crit hog i'll just shoot um this lancer okay so i need to shoot here so i get isolated damage here because then i'll crit or not but then i can finish them up this guy's not going to die to poison but you know i'll help i'll help convince him he should pew i i thought we'd get through more armor nevermind uh all right that's it okay come on hey i was on small brain i felt pretty small brain i was like i'm literally just kidding myself but we're fine now the propagation begins you are already dead good propagate propagate everywhere that's a lot of poison sacks that should help us immensely hurt you a whole bunch and by that i mean like you didn't even know i was here you died you do not die to poison okay that's important to note now i'm just gonna hide over here and i'll rotate where i'm needed i guess all right i'm helping i swear it by the old gods and the new uh here we go that's about all i can do so i'll just tickle his pickle don't make it weird uh probably the best value we're gonna get aside from no i think that's yeah that's about okay bye oh it's a lancer of course it is boy you're not gonna hit me are you you're thinking about it rude what the fudge get away from me away says the snake yes all right it's a battle man we'll pick people off where we can uh am i just jumping back over i kind of feel like it might yeah all right propagate here pretty good let's propagate here pretty good is anyone not dying to poison you're dying you're dying you are not poisoned you're dying you are not you are you are you yeah a lot you guys definitely are no no yes almost all right so we need to get rid of or at rarely halt wait but i'm gonna need vision one time what can you do make yourself useful that's pretty good all right but there you go then everything else here should be dead you're all dead okay great just start picking these guys up get that reliability good to see it okay well that worked out um poison kills you now all right they're practically all dead i think let me back up just in case even though i don't know what would be hitting me you've used all of your stuff you have not touched anything because you can't touch anything i might have overreacted okay i think we've already pretty much got this in the bag but whatever i'm coming actually that can be useful yeah we'll do that next turn all right seven action points oh right it's all you and enter i'll get him crossbow you're nuts my wall i think it's the only damage our walls have taken actually on night 11. come on are you not entertained um yeah we'll just do that and then that and then that and just screw that dude in particular boom god ladies and gentlemen that's all i can touch so good luck although i did get grape shot and that can't reach anything either okay the thought that counts i feel like there should be a way i can kill three here but nerve hey you stop right there all right that's pretty much that you guys are dying to poison dino poison dying to poison dying to poison and i just got to come around here [Music] convince them to die to poison all right consider themselves convinced i'm bored so i'll just kill you guys pop not kill you i'll know kill you now you get a pick off these guys have fun pretty much just leaves that dude um dead dead yeah four left one two three four all right he's sure [Music] let's do that and then and then old oh i was gonna let the poison kill him let's go night 11 perfect 11 perfect nights in a row level 11 level 12. the final night is upon us and frankly i'm ready to poop myself i don't know why we get a bonus for that night i'm nervous oh no it's almost 7 000 essence cheese you know it's the game's just finally clicking you know it took us a little while but we did it they're coming from everywhere all corners of the city so now i'm scared what's going to happen night 12 you gotta think it's gonna be something spoopy right oh a rare pendant okay yeah sure don't mind if i do uh what i mean that's a lot of magic games don't get me where is where's our sorcerer you have poison damage you're probably yeah it's not worth it okay let's grab this thing another oh warrior armor oh yeah that's definitely for uh for melee look you get 10 damage effect for two turns from the armor if you want 50 physical 11 critical block and armor that's kind of crazy i don't have any melee you might be like stupid uh i would like to think that's probably the only reason i made it this far um accuracy is real nice there accuracy opportunistic's nice here but the only people that use that are the druids let's just go with this for now yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes the bower gave us this one oh is a better one and it comes with extra range damage don't mind if i do and the nightly reward what the fudge never got an epic this run we're not grab now we're not grabbing that a trinket oh plus one multi hit oh a prowess has been accomplished but what prowess i wonder your 500 magic damage in a single hand when did i do that i don't know the devil set though let's go cultist set kill one bulky we did it look at us have a hero reach 400 health loss nah i prefer you just never get hit have a hero reach 15 critical rhonian set i need to do that we're so close uh this must happen this is the way all right anything new oh ranged heroes two heroes with ranged weapons are general with plus one skill range heroes with magi weapons generate plus three daily mana regen i guess i need to keep getting this uncommon item production thing but wealthy haven is tempting but like what this this is too good that's nuts um all right monica we need crit oh my god there we go we did it more than 50 crit let's go what else you want girl okay well all right rip that's completely wasted on you now what do you want for an extra one energized is obvious dodging an enemy attack killing something something i don't know i have to go pee here's what i'm thinking where was it one wolf when there's no other hero then 10 tiles just 10 extra damage that's literally what we've been doing that's tempting but then um where was it where was it [Music] okay wait maybe i just forgot wasn't there something about like oh right i already gave her man a collector that's what i was thinking okay i bet i might go lone wolf i'm thinking about it all right i'm not thinking about it anymore we did it bop frickin let's go now let me unlock the ronin armor pogba very bug oh wait another prowess wait what is it like unlocking process over here perform 150 critical hits holy step hunter set let's go monica that's monaco um okay wait let me see what we're dealing with before i start this we're going to push this back of course and now let me see is there two skulls everywhere budge there is okay well i might just keep our solar is as are because they've been pretty good at that which means kalb has to level up [Music] well we might just give you lone wolf too then huh don't don't done dodging an enemy attack you have something that happened yeah one more for this hold the four down i know you can do it increase your critical and more accuracy yes please all right godspeed miguel mcgill hey what what what the fudge adamantium hand crossbow looks like a freaking looks like um the hanukkah thing you know with all the candles um okay interesting uh doesn't do as much damage but an extra multi-hit so we could do five multi-hits with the crossbow no six foot five i don't know yeah yeah it would be five if we got that so a little less damage but another multihit which i think makes up for it maybe [Music] um a decent looking helmet none of the other weapons i'm interested in [Music] um this gives an extra movement that's nice minus one propagation the boy's name is nice but not the rest reign of arrow scroll i might actually buy that oh wait fudge i forgot i had all these did i get these last time i forget to do something with or did i take these off people i don't remember oh okay well nothing's nothing's jumping out of me yet another action point miguel oh you want to pop off at the end do ya go on then let's see propagation isolated no wait you don't have that opportunistic hey you do have that sure but perks yeah i don't know oh 12 dude you're freaking popping off i don't know what what do you want you can have it all right i'll get you anything you want anything to critical it regenerates mana again we don't need that you got plenty of mana uh armor master's not gonna i wish i could take magic feel again that'd be pretty funny as long as you hear it didn't move this turn maybe that yeah [Music] sure probably your best bet yeah why not okay last but not least radbird ranbir and ranbir radbro let's get you some more crit buddy and 12 extra accuracy i'm not gonna say no to that that won't i think we do energized for show let me look at this okay so you don't have a trinket but you don't use multi-hit at all you could take this you don't use magic damage but you would get an extra action point but to be fair i don't think oh wait wait a second this gives less magic damage but an extra action point didn't make me act up nine action points good lord that's pretty good sure we need to get to a better bearing cape although but this gives you an extra extra point maybe not what do we wanted to turn off you had the wait what that's all you got this gives you extra multi-hit for less damage yeah it's not worth it um considering you don't do anything this just gives you seven percent extra damage essentially so have out hit son does anyone have bad chest armor pretty much just you what is it equipped but it gives reliability critical [Music] so well this gives that but not the reliability this gives a whole bunch of accuracy dodge but again reliability what's your reliability right now 85 well you know what maybe we can spare it a little bit because what's your accuracy 50 63 accuracy sounds pretty good to me why not we don't need that i don't think we need that i don't know what to do with this which is a shame but because i mean look we could 87 magic damage that's nuts but i think the poison damage is more worth it that's what we're using most of the time so rip yeah i think we sell all this 1200 gold that's not bad um lightning strike scroll as propagation stuff might use that range two to twelve one target but it propagates for a lot of damage great we're buying that we're buying i'm we're buying everything no more time to dilly dally this is it men buy the helmet why not uh i can i can upgrade a whole bunch of ballistas now if i want because let's see i think this is the only wall i got hit lol everybody says yeah it was um let's go let's finish our stun traps there we go beautiful let's go with more mounted ballistas because yeah upgrade you i really don't think they're that big of a deal but it'll be just nice to have them and again i just don't know what to do with all of this cash with all this power upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade all right yeah uh what else i i mean at this point i can do catapults for the fun of it if i really wanted to um all the walls are good at this point let's just we don't even need that it's just a weakness uh watch towers good we have all of our teleporting we can yeah i think it just lay traps everywhere now i guess and i could double wall if i wanted to right i could like but then i think that kind of makes it harder for myself so probably not it's funny to think about though so let's do some traps slow traps because like damage trap sounds nice but something tells me this late into the game oh traps have five uses i'm just saying that this late in the game it might not do anything so let me put them one two three four five pixels out because in case they get here i'll probably want them to be slowed more than anything right yeah something like this they come through here screw them something like that i guess then if they want to be boners and come over here like they keep going i think i'm just going to lace it with damage because i hate it sure um i just throw damage things out here randomly green pop you want something here there you go sure at this point i don't really have enough for catapult so i'll figure out what i'm doing with the rest i need to figure out what i'm doing my workers does anyone need healing you shouldn't how'd you hurt yourself what when did you get hurt i swear to god no one gets hurt but then somehow okay everyone's okay so now let's top up the mana uh you get topped up you get topped up you get topped up and you get topped up all right yeah i think every everyone's full health everyone's full mana um i already did that with my workers i guess i could work on this if i wanted to to get a couple last minute things but i don't even know what we would do uh you know i'll just use my workers i guess that's what i'm using my workers on now i'll get some catapults why not we'll get uh one here one here here here here here here that's what i like for and i don't think yeah you can't upgrade them how much damage are they doing 50 to 130 see but you don't need vision and they can't dodge so i'm thinking that's more like a last resort kind of thing uh kind of like if we're already using this then we're already in trouble kind of deal is there any last place i'd want to put like one more watch tower maybe if i could do it in the middle of city actually that can be big brain yeah maybe we're gonna put it there just in case something goes horribly awry then i'll be prepared so anything else i want my workers to be doing don't need structures everyone's healed everyone's freaking man is good i guess i'll get an item what's our other short bow look like oh wait oh yeah it wings plus four [Music] there you go buddy got one son pop off finn let me equip everybody here okay so who has our best magic damage you do you're gonna take the lightning scroll rain of arrows we need our best range damage that goes to durand then you already have mana you have damage let's give you health give you mana give you mana give you health and then who doesn't have a helmet you don't have a helmet congrats i'm like oh i'm kind of nervous okay just making sure nothing else i want my worker to do sign them to buildings nothing i want them okay yellow let's see if we get a better thing here oh too bad i don't need that but that'll fetch a nice penny double check i don't think we want any of this the multi-hit was i still can't decide [Music] you gotta think it's better right lose that on eight maximum potential damage for another hit yeah pretty sure that right am i crazy i'm trying to think if i'm crazy because like you get the biggest damage discrepancy here i don't know i don't know we'll just keep what we got let's not break it which means i guess i'm just gonna sit on all this cash but what else would i do it let's just upgrade some shenanigans for sure maxed out why not i'm pimping everything out does anyone want some free health let me double check because everybody has the like oh see everybody has the if at max health extra reliability all right i don't even know how you took damage that doesn't make any sense holy jesus look at the lightning strike scroll on miguel 379 to 445 damage and it propagates 13 times what does this look like reign of aeroscroll 356 to 532 [Music] all right those should be pretty handy all right i think i'm good to go and it makes me nervous but i i don't know what else we'll do all right you need to hop off here you're gonna you're gonna go to solo duty you're on soul duty over here um you need to hop down as annoying as it is and then i see like if they start coming over here but we'll worry about that if that becomes a reality we shouldn't get hit from where we are but i have no idea what's coming so i'm gonna be a little hesitant i'm going to put you guys over here over here uh prepare you guys like this [Music] remember this guy's butt's mobility he thinks it was long about he can do whatever he wants now so you chill here you're chilling there you guys are chilling there oh i'm so nervous and i don't know what's like i don't know if there's going to be some left thing on the left field but the longer i wait the worse it's gonna get my friends equip i have no gear stupid [Music] let it begin [Music] what's what okay that's what i was worried about what the fudge 15 half woman half plant fully tainted giants have always been very sensitive to magic but they are now so gorgeous corruption that they are addicted to it as such they are not really found of the whole end of magic thing what [Music] stunt resistance a thousand percent okay i guess i'm not it's like what are these things hatchery these plants grow steadily feed on mist this energy allows them to breed various nope killing that thing seed mortar aggressive plant shoot high velocity projectiles at everything within a somewhat medium range another hatchery the sprayer it looks like it buffs people around it another seed mortar this hatchery is so far out there fudge thankfully that's not too far i can get to that and thankfully whatever spawned in here we immediately killed that's done that way to go stun things all right yeah again that's what i was afraid of it's gonna be fine it's just fine just start propagating i'm not panicking you're panicking okay maybe i'm panicking um propagate some more i'm doing great kid propagate over this way no yeah whatever slow all you plebs oh i can't um [Music] watch i don't want to get close okay i'm just going to debuff because i want to kill this thing oh okay yeah you guys will die to poison soon so instead come over here and weaken you stupid thing no one can reach me i don't think over here okay this is fine this is fine everything's i die all of you plebs okay well i can kill the hatchery that's gross uh yeah i guess i'll 100 just use that to kill you and everyone else will be dying here but i'll just go ahead and you know help him out help him out a little bit okay you just got to do this by yourself it's fine so many of them [Music] okay here here here and here oh just let me see those damage numbers you're nuts monica you're nuts holy let's freaking go buttercup uh okay hold on okay hit here here and here nuts literally cracked kill kill kill okay didn't die but i'll fix that okay that is a bit of a problem you have a lot of health i don't do that much poison damage oh grape shot certainly not gonna do that much i'll just kill you oh okay super omega overkill my bad shoot as many times as i can that will hopefully kill him hog uh oh jesus christ i might have just boned ourselves because i don't know where it's gonna be coming from i mean i don't see more monsters but that could be a bait what's her dodge percentage thirty holy i didn't realize we were such high dodge okay well let's hope we dodge wonka uh i think i'm just gonna yeah i'll choose this guy to take these out oh you can reach there you're not dude i'm just gonna use him to do this right now okay the fact that he was able to hit all those is huge huge now i just need someone to get there all right unfortunately that's going to be breeding a whole bunch up but all right propagate away friend your heart's content nervous go this way okay that's not worst case stupid poison should kill you but it's not going to now back on up yeah who's gonna get the hatchery that is not my job well you have a job though so when do i start shooting her i should probably get rid of all the ads huh but like i don't know what her attack is i don't like that i don't like that one bit we're so close to greatness just hold the line by yourself friend if anyone can do it i know it's you no dodge stupid oh and we refreshed our mana with the ap thing huge dodge not now that's a lot of damage no i need you to high roll here buddy all right now back up because i don't know what this chick is going to do you have a point left nothing you can shoot no all right oh what oh houston we got a problem so just happening over there oh no stupid hatchery wait the night's never ending wait what is protective layer comprised of okay so now i have to get through this to what i i just i'm not entirely sure what i'm supposed to be doing okay i think i i'm gonna take duran and put him over here and put him on like exclusive hold on hold on hold on can i reach oh this one can yo screw you and uh screw you i got rid of some of it um i didn't even break through the armor for the turn though jesus i guess i could have saved that all right uh miguel surprise you're on solo duty red i think radbert and and durand have to go try and kill this thing because i think waves will just not stop coming i think we have to go stop it ourselves all right such me man so as i knew there was gonna be some kind of a twist and it was so much worse than i thought it would be stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid i got to get you up on this this thing next it's gonna take you so long to get over there oh all right what the fudge here here i feel like that should kill them all but you never know instead hold it there there there there you're nutty [Music] um now stop critting when i don't account for it okay i could have that was a waste that feller's not welcome boy screw you all right getting out of hand i'm losing control [Music] okay hold on i'm gonna clear out who i can for you right now and then yeah i think the rest is up to you friends sorry um oh wait i shouldn't use snipe shot takes movement is this guy who [Music] uh everything that could be around going around but that's okay bees bees as long as i stay like this so i can propagate them we'll be okay but if they stop well then we're not okay screw you mates oh wreck your mums you hear me i should just find a way to take care of that like so i could get damage on it right now but then i'm just getting overrun but to be fair how much movement do you have you typically have six so one two three four it'll take like everything you might not even be able to teleport but you're not helpful you have six movement one two three four you won't be able to do anything yet let's just said these are all going to get on top of us real fast but maybe we worry about that when that happens i don't know i think what what's our best damage this for sure out of range cause my sight what do you mean okay we got it oh jesus leave that damage wait wait second wait a second oh my god you're nuts dude wait but but now what wait wait it's not over i'm i'm fine with the twist now i've had enough for the twist i think i'm okay we can stop with the twists two action points where if you oh don't know what to do whatever kill you and then just arm [Music] great job poison all right okay all right okay all right i don't i don't know what's going on the night meter has yet to move i really need to kill that hatchery okay yeah i don't i don't know what's happening i don't know just like everything took a pause do i just kill the rest the edge now but see it's not telling me that i'm like any close or anything like i'm being baited man and generally if i feel like i'm being baited then that problem means i'm i'm getting baited sure you're not a poison you're united poison you are dead okay yeah here here's the plan wait what what i can't see wait did i block myself off with this stupid thing oh my god okay well that makes things even more difficult [Music] um wait is that just i can't that's just like the look of the hatchery about to poop something out right i can't tell uh do that do that kill you now i'm gonna come over here can't reach but i'm on my way to help [Music] now i feel like i should come over here to help right could go over there now let me figure it out let me undo that just in case uh thankfully you're all lining up to be blazed just in case layer it up big mine all right well for now i'm done so maybe i'll go help with the hatchery you're you're done wait let me just apply some dodge here what's that put you at right now your current dodge is 55 i think pretty good um everything's dead over there it's just this is a mess you see i think radbird's gonna go help although you guys this movement is so bad that i have no idea what i'm supposed to be doing i don't know i might just sit here so that next turn i can figure out what we're doing because rad bert should be able to eventually help that's good all right we're doing okay right now [Music] that would put him in perfect position to hit me so no thanks uh i know you guys have so much left to do but you guys your movement is absolute buns so i can't do anything [Music] all right oh you can you gotta be kidding me uh wait whoa wait what no not again again oh you got uh oh man this is a wendy's holy jesus stop it just what the [Music] and now there's more of them holy shack oh we're in trouble aren't we and do the blur i don't even know where to begin holy jesus this was like literally like a clear board two seconds ago what the oh my god stop are we done there's a ripper over there of course holy a good thing we didn't leave if i get back up can i even reach i can't reach that or wait wait wait wait wait a minute okay suddenly we're in it okay i can only do one of these because i use too much movement um all right not as much damage i was hoping i need to kill you out of range oh my gosh okay am i about to pull this thing up maybe yeah screw it the worst part is like the hatchery's like the thing i'm scared about the most [Music] whatever then we're just gonna keep doing damage i probably could have shot that thing holy shack jesus my lord we're under attack i can't get anywhere to help fudge how much movement is this five five you don't need vision for this okay yeah i don't want to hit my wall though all right we're gonna do that [Music] i guess that's all i can help with okay then i'm going to come over here use this two mana dodge whatever give a man push you'll be fine next turn we'll get you up you'll actually be helpful put you on dodge dodge [Music] oh ever happens oh no we gotta go there there there there don't kill i could use it on the shrimp nevermind we killed the shrimp too okay what am i doing though i must ensure this hatchery dies okay i'm coming to help okay besides looking okay prop gate over here um i can't kill any of this stuff i could propagate her lol um propagate again all right most of those are dead now uh damage damage see i don't think ice opportunistic will even do enough damage to kill this thing oh only one way to find out no um jesus all right you just gotta hold the fort down here friend kill all these stupid plants right you're nuts make sure we kill this one too and that one all right we weren't able to get all of them we're able to get enough for now i can kill that one's gonna be over here to stop these clubs and clubs there i gotta do this what oh okay we crit thank god i guess i didn't really have to kill him because he just buffs but propagate wherever he can stupid hatchery i gotta get that next turn oh sweet noses not the walls oh wait it killed the hatchery next to it that works for us it was not

you up here and then you are going to [Music] come right over here you're going to hop up here you'll have one snipe but we're gonna use it and fudge okay so we could have swapped that because of range issues but just light them up screw you come on or go on oh my god ladies and gentlemen we did it we beat it 12 perfect nights wouldn't even lose an hp that one city protection not even one panic ever literally perfect run let's go we never washed anyone that's a lot of essence like a what we did it [Music] we did it that freaking my strategy is down good job everyone hey what's going on with the magic circle oh what the fudge an overwhelming surge of power is coming wait wait wait right wait now wait wait i thought it was over uh is this seal broken we get it right right no the seal is damaged but still not broken we need more time give us more time brother i can't what fudge ah unlocks apocalypse one sorry what now run that bradley one more time look at kolb look at monica the freaking monster 481 kills we did it victory look look at what lakeberg should look like normally it looks so quaint there oh my gosh i can't believe we've done it breaking the seal of magic would only mean oblivion for me and my sister in this reality a fate that is most unacceptable i will now have to send thee to yet another undefiled reality so that thou have to start again your righteous fight what the fudge a word of caution the forces of darkness thou fights against have strengthened in this world the apocalypse is upon the anti-people is there no hope at all there is and there ever will be hope as long as you play by the rules screw you fruit free whatever your name is complete runs the profit sat oh uh but yeah what fudge i'm just stuck here you flew too close to the sun little bird my dear sister sure wants to help you fight another day but not to the point of succeeding in your glorious quest this little point of yours are banishing all magic it's not really in the best interest for us magic beans of course we still have plenty of other realities to send you to but mosquito bites are not pleasant even for us i know i know disappointing isn't it but don't despair i will still help you as best as i can as long as you provide me with essence and maybe someday what the fudge what new stuff do we get guess again the guess again ability for the seer building that can be used to re-roll the upcoming wave wait what that's interesting oh yeah let me get this that's really interesting heavy pants mini pants light pants magic heroes go towards wealthy haven still oh well none you can put your first run the last spell this is no small feat oh oh i know but this doesn't mean you're finished as you probably guessed from the ending this is not yet where we see the run ending in the finale final finale product final product in the meantime keep experimenting with different belgian strategies you can use to oppose the monster hordes and seek out more favors to be obtained from shadow and fruit and if you're up for a fresh challenge the newly unlocked apocalypse mode is waiting for you all right oh see i thought they were going to be like more oh is lake berg supposed to be like the last city what the fudge i could do apocalypse one enemies have 15 more health how about nare what okay well we did it yes this game is so sick so i'm really interested to see then what they have planned i'm gonna keep my eyes out for future like content releases um and then if you guys are down with us come out obviously i'm all in it to play some more we freaking did it thank you to everybody who watched this series it was a pretty long one went on for what like 12 13 episodes or something all of them like hour to two hours so i appreciate you i know on the the main channel that doesn't really happen anymore uh so appreciate you all i hope you all enjoyed this just a little bit if you enjoyed it just a fraction as much as i did then that's you must have had a great time because this is a fantastic game happy to have beaten it um there definitely seems to be a meta like just ignore melee get bows and druid staff at least that's how it worked for me that was awesome that was sick and there's still even more upgrades so with that said i want to thank you all much for watching have yourselves a fantastic day and i'll talk to you in the next one very well
