heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to guardtek phone and i have a question for you do you believe in magic because it actually exists that's right we did another video where among us was banned will the party have enough self-restraint to follow through let's find out what sandwich uh i can't exactly remember but i think it's where you basically stack like one giant image so it's like you just keep writing and drawing and then you describe the last drawing yeah i don't know it sounds good to me all right here we go okay we'll figure that together i don't know starting a story yeah so you just write like a prompt like normal sure you know you're an all-star five seconds ladies and gentlemen i have come up with a great sandwich prompt what the so how does the sandwich i don't even oh no like normal whoever did this has done it in the hopes of getting me hated by a certain community and i'm not happy who knew any of this people jill valentine sounds remotely familiar it's yeah from resident evil i'm looking it up um i don't know uh let's see what the okay so she has a beret i feel like that'll probably be one of her main ways to identify her i don't know why she looks like some paorno person oh my god why are you eating my thing and then her hair is all like this clearly yeah so she has like her hair over her eyes she's one of those girl her mouth's like i remember why are we done nurse and then she has these like things on her shoulders booba uh and then arms and then there's like this gross looking penis dude and his face is all jacked up oh this shirt which is so yummy the sandwich is coming in like this coming in real hot that is hot i got a race there's no way i can drive all this stuff um no no lettuce tomato bread and then um [Music] nemesis yeah um i don't know i do my best okay so wait memorize drawing what the what is this wait how is this different than the other one we're replicating uh oh we're drawing it so replication you just draw this yeah okay sure so memorize it that's not gonna happen i kinda already forgot uh i know it's like peppa the pig and her dad or something but she's like oh my god yeah what are you doing except i guess she's happy he's like oh what am i doing and for some reason all this is just super messed up uh don't ask and then like you're the best father was like i know i am and he's got like a big little belly i think and i don't know if they were doing anything else um did she have anything i don't know this is cursed i feel like i should take out yeah it makes it a lot better okay yeah we're going to roll with that but i did my best and that's what counts right i think it was fair i looked up nemesis and jill valentine's i literally had no idea what i was doing i i realize how bad i am at memorizing ground yeah dude me too i never give it enough time like all right i've nailed it down immediately after i have no idea what yeah it disappears i'm like i forgot everything no yeah oh we draw again okay okay so we just stopped replicating until it gets worse um it's me versus two i don't know i have no clue what i'm drawing it was so [Music] interesting something like that gotta add in some of that gotta throw on some glasses for some reason i'm like fight me well i kind of just wanted to have they drew me they only used stick figures so and then there was some ninja dude maybe i'm supposed to be fighting like a vegetable maybe i'll make him i'm going a little creative liberty here i'll make him a tomato fighting the tomato and then he's like put him up shame yeah he's got big old gloves all right i think i think i i don't really remember i don't like that anymore i forgot what the eyes look like in the face but i'm going off memory these yeah it's disgusting oh no only only three more rounds of this boys we're fine that's beautiful if it's just like lines for eyes or if it's like alligator mouth for eyes or everyone does their eyes different it's your artistic flair but no but it's there's a right answer though are you saying that you're trying to you are yeah there's like a right way to making the face like see i don't know like to replicate or to make oh jesus what [Laughter] i feel like i should be should i literally just be trying to recreate it one for one maybe that's why i should do he used this thing and i can't remember for life me how he drew i instantly forget what they looked like like this um because yeah i don't know like what to improve upon and what to just try and keep the same you know um but i know something like this and it's like this it's beautiful i know okay well i'm not doing poor banjo any justice here we're guys i think that's what they look like i think that's pretty pretty oh i didn't realize i wasn't mean to my bad guys it's like this gold it's mine jesus christ and then didn't they do like a three or something i couldn't decide i feel like i need to recreate instead of improve upon where i think i could i feel like you just gotta try and recreate one for one i yeah i just i try to do exactly what's there even if it looks really weird like i'm trying to try you guys are able to actually think of doing it better i could just think i butchered whatever this is i mean it's a lot of these drawings it's hard not to do better whoa hey what are you trying to do oh this is beautiful all right i need to remember this is this is cute okay this guy is like whatever i need to remember to draw this okay so something like this and i forget i already forget what color he was i want to share something like this and i feel like his he was just kind of like like that and then the person over here was just a monstrosity and then they had like just bizarre here uh what like baby remember i remember pretty terribly but i don't remember anything else i'm i'm an artist yeah i like this one there's a lot of drawing i'm okay with that well i just want to see how progressively worse everything is the audience might not be okay with that i'm okay with it the audience is gonna love it isn't that right audience hello yes that's right we love it what the fudge okay not the comments we have a lot less time here i get to i get to write [Music] what is this don't know you know what i'm just gonna say it's this oh no no no no no that is something else i feel like i've never read oh let's go all right i started but you know something whale walks on land i never saw that i can tell you that right i think i did a great job yeah yeah what oh i'm looking at a wobba fat oh that's what you were talking about rob okay yeah i was like there's a right way to draw it and i could not figure out the way to draw it you gave him a unibrow i like it i couldn't remember i just remember it was like alligator or x's or lines it was like and then his eyes right yeah yeah i feel bad for why he's just getting less and less sand man doesn't even have water on a pile of sand well played yeah i mean yeah well i mean whale walks on land while they say insane no like i think that that like ended up better than it started banjo three announced on xbox game pass all right i got you blessed i see thank you look how bow legged my boy is okay he's ready i figured i could write three because like this is banjos well i saw see this is like where your memory trick shows like okay i need to draw this one for one and i was like how in the world did he drop andrew and uh jesus mister yeah it looks more like the little mole guy yeah it does well i was like i was like draw my own banjo but we'll see what it looks like trying to recreate it cute i don't know if we're going to get banjo out of that watches cardinal bird turtle and fly away oh hey everybody i mean that's pretty good i'm gonna pave the gif i'm saving the gift love transcends all right now who has the best banjo though who has the best banjo in my opinion it's uh uh joey joey's probably i mean i'll be honest my banjo's the only one actually holding up three fingers joey i think i would give mine to joey yes sir i'll take that fox mccloud break dances versus mr rogers i now understand which one was supposed to you make me sick i don't i dude i was like you get a fox out of that rhea i honestly how did you get a fox out of his drawing that's what i wanted to do it looks like a fox with a scouter goblin honestly it does look like a kangaroo oh and joe dirt okay yeah so i was like okay how do i recreate this [Music] i think i did pretty good [Laughter] yeah come on the cheese what's this guy cheetos what's that don't listen to him it's just stuff yeah see everyone took creative liberties but i was trying to just one for one [Music] what i said that's what i tried to do i did too i think i did great peppa pig lies to her father about eating his bacon this is so difficult why are you trying to pull peppa pig's family apart dude did you guys used to watch this i never did i never did no it was right it was right after me yeah i was like too cool yeah i was pretty young you were like 16. yeah we lost the bagel i never understood what that was lost you missed the bagel i didn't really know how to draw a bagel and make it look like a bagel you know oh yeah i mean yeah oh that's beautiful thank you see it was funny because i my inspiration for this is i looked over the ad that i was getting it was a peppa pig right after it was a bagel wait a second now you're shipping what the oh no yeah yeah yeah hey i'm not stupid hey i'll take responsibility for that it all went wrong after me all right the snouts the snouts after mine just got closer and closer and closer now that i see i did draw birdo can i tell you the ad i have right now it's charles barkley signing something at dick's sporting goods that's they also dream come true who doesn't get that one bts simpson characters oh you're an [Laughter] also i i'm pretty proud of mine beautiful see i think the bts was locked before it got to me yeah i was just writing bts [Music] no that was a pretty good one for joey's opponents i think i realized i kind of made marge look like a oh bryce bts twitter just started adding you a lot you should probably dance you know i can really see the bts coming through at the end 100 yeah there's mcdonald's fries at the end with bart ironically it looks like a deranged minion um a fork and then a confused like an old psyduck mr fruit fighting a fruit ninja [Music] see that's a straw okay see that didn't come across yeah see oh see where this might go wrong here yeah so i was like okay what is that supposed to be so i was like okay well i missed your fruit so i'm probably fighting mr vegetables so let's make it a tomato that's where i went yeah [Music] wow we lost this yeah there it goes well i have no green on mine there's no green exactly where was it lost yeah but then i was like okay he probably did that last so i was like i gotta figure it out instead of a [Music] a man that has watermelon head fights cherry popper what kind of a chariot it's an interesting interpretation but it is correct is playing his own version of this game like he's seeing completely different pictures what kind of cherries are you getting brother i think you're getting duped that looks like a cherry popper to me i love cherry tomatoes those are my favorite like my 90 favorite tomatoes the the prompt wasn't great but we still kept a fighting watermelon yeah and a fighting red thing so what do you mean the prompt are you talking about my prompt yeah it's not mr fighting for ninja what do you mean it wasn't great no why was your water nemesis eating jill valentine's sandwich  sad what okay yeah i gotta go ahead and tell you first off i was like who is eating who's sandwich oh okay i've never played resident evil resident evil so i did google it real quick but um those are some two pretty involved characters beating the sandwich in a small amount of time i'm sorry i'm so sorry i didn't draw this at all let's see where this goes completely honest this this is my fault way too early wait wait can i ask a question maria is this a reference to like i hope it's not a jill sandwich no no i hope he's not a jill or she's not a jill sandwich like that's a line from the original resident evil okay well somehow went from jill and nemesis to a stoner with a beanie and a living sandwich it's a story yeah we thought we thought nemesis would eat the sandwich but the sandwich ate nemesis just watch how this one devolves into just shapes wait what it's not even a sandwich anymore where's the sandwich yeah this is what i got nice are you always [Laughter] how do you just completely ignore the sandwich okay so this is the one where i realized that we weren't pressed for time yeah i took one look and i started drawing i'm like what's the other one [Music] you forgot sandwich yeah that's pretty funny yeah well no i i felt like i was really pressed for time and then when i finished the left guy i'm like what's the right guy and i had like like 75 percent of the time left i'm like i love the story this is telling though she's like oh my god he's going to eat the sandwich and then she turns into dudes like oh my god the sandwich ate him and then the sandwich transforms into him like a mirror image he's like oh my god and he's like wait you're kind of cute they get more quiet now you know what this ain't that bad it's beautiful [Music] you
