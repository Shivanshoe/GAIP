Pugh had an accident there you guys yeah I mean and then we answer some questions and stuff it's a it's the best podcast in the world rated nine stars and gang we're just moving up in the world so hope you guys enjoy this episode episode 27 we're hopping right into it because this time I'm not starting right after saying hidey-ho uh-huh the dudududududu with Hideo cuz already say at the beginning we're not doubling down but we are doubling down on the podcast because it's another week another episode another time where we upload it on time kinda be consistent audio and video was on time that's my fault have a video yeah I mean it was still came up soon yeah it was like two hours yeah it came out Sunday it's not that big oh the reason I actually had it done in a reasonable amount of time but my internet it was like was what's happening with Dropbox for no reason my upload is so yeah 800 megabytes and then - Blake two hours remaining I'm like what normally should be like did it used to do that no it hasn't done a sense just that thing so was like great and then I had to was it I had to go do an errand or something so I just had a schedule it for when I get back so I could finish it so you're so your Internet's getting throttled do you think or they your eyelid speed I mean it's been fine sense I don't know not like so I'm just that's gotta be such a cool feeling when you upload a video and you just see the bar go because it used to be like that's porn 20 minute video seriously 20 minute video and it'd be like 1% like upload will be done in 42 minutes and then once it uploads it says processing begun yeah then it has to process % uh-huh but now goes up winning and then you just have to wait for the process mm-hm which doesn't take too long which is that my car just go up your cycle yeah when I click a foot it's like done in like twenty three seconds I'm like this is this is amazing this is a miracle this is life but now it's broken just like my immune system I'm sick you should have brought a corona virus mask you're done for dude yeah we need to get updates on that too you know those don't actually protect you from it but they do prevent you from getting other people from gigs like wait so if I'm wearing a mask and somebody with corona is standing over there and they go so here's what happened through that corona virus is spread okay mask isn't gonna do anything healthy let's be like that's that's number one the bubble the corona virus is a viral transmission so it's through droplets so so sorry for derailing this so quickly before the podcast starts we still do reviews right right we're on the rails right now yeah so kyrov are transferred virally it transfers to droplets so that means if you touch something that like a corona virus person sneezed on or they contaminated and then like you touch your face then congratulations there's a high chance you have Pro virus they sneeze on you or if you touch something they touched and they happen to have their Corona on it they're Crone alignments you touch your face well congratulations so those mats don't do a lot I mean you're kind of freaking me out that's why Budweiser is okay because if you have a mask you're safe from Budweiser but Corona yeah they round yeah I think that will protect you from coronavirus is like a full face mask which you look very silly helmet okay yeah with like a mask in front of you you know what I mean if you if you are sick and you wear that mask then you are helping other people from getting sick from you because you'd be sneezing into your mat I wouldn't care if you listen to this and you have Corona please don't touch anything and just kind of chill out thanks for watching and tune in still like well if we're starting I guess with the corona yeah I'd love to see where the track is - I think it was yesterday that the World Health Organization's had for the first day since the outbreak more new cases have developed outside of the epidemic center then we're started there were new cases outside of China than are appearing in China no yes I saw it was like country 38 countries 38 and it's mostly that's mostly Korea and Italy right now because this is one of the biggest outbreaks Italy has liked Korea fourteen fifty thousand people South Korea is almost entering like a state of emergency dude it's cracking down how fast is loud I guess just how much humans travel I guess like people who were in Wuhan just went and then just all over the world I just never thought I'd I keep killing telling Claire like what are we booking the tickets to Greenland yes let's go we need to book those now I played enough playing ink man I'm just saying so you got to watch out for that it's even so bad that like the lck League of Legends Korea championship series all their games held more Stadium they're not allowing any viewers to attend so it's just empty stadiums now while they play stuff like that that's kind of like what's like that drone footage from Luhan or whatever we go just know it looks like an empty city lately no one in the streets no cars nothing happening it's just like dead that is so scary you know everyone's inside and spooky I saw that like Japan they like closed all their public schools to like mid-april like yeah the kids are like oh come on day two is if they weren't cracked enough at stuff to you that are just gonna like double down I'm gonna be so good at the game yeah Zachary right now is backed up about to go in a hyperbolic time chamber dude hang like could you imagine like in the United States if they had closed public schools for a month well it might be coming our way who knows how many confirmed cases are there in the United States do we know the US I don't know death toll so the infection rate - death toll it has a higher percentage of death toll then like flu and SARS and stuff but it's just not as widespread like technically the flu kills more people a year uh-huh oh yeah technically the flu is transmitted even easier but it also has a far less it's a being a cig technically when you think about it the flu and corona are essentially in the same basket it's just the corona right now and I think it's because we are in the quarantine state and we haven't really like come to the conclusion of how to treat it properly it has a higher death rate a virus updates Italy reports 650 cases and 17 deaths in the last 24 hours it's spiked by more than 50% new cases where it stands at 650 plus right now adding a 17 people have died more than 400 of the cases are in the hard-hit Lombardy region where sometimes are under a lockdown nearly 250 people infected are in hospitals 56 in intensive care but as far as total numbers okay I kinda have a stupid question as of Thursday morning there were more than three thousand four hundred seventy four cases in 44 countries outside of China so here's here's my question and like I don't want you guys to yell at me like if you do we do we like is there a cure like do we know like it's like do you just get you're better now like there's no cure for coal there's no cure for flu no but what I'm I get that so like you just get it and then you don't have it anymore right so like or is there an understand from what I understand it's really up to your immune system if you're gonna fight it or not that's so and that's why it but so again this is just like that the flu let's think about the flu kills half a million people a year we don't think about that at all because oh it's the flu we're just normal just used to it Lucas half million people year and it does the same thing the corona virus does right it targets people because it wants to spread but if you have a weak immune system or you like have I mean yeah but if you have a very weak immune system already then you know until our department access to like like a hospital or something a proper access like you know like probably like food and water and stuff like that then the flu is going it's you get your chance of fighting it goes down but in so are secure it's like you just have it and then you have to like fight it and then you just don't have it anymore but in our modern society the only people who naturally have weak immune systems if unless you have like you know like a like a disease that attacks your immune system are elderly and very young children which are just about all the people who have been fatalities from does that include mental image because then I'm done no mister fruit you're doing fantastic keep it up to Jack so like they are they looking for anything like a corona shot like or like a flu shot like you see that but what we're trying to go towards this has the difference with flu we know enough that we can help try and prevent we have like the flu vaccine mm-hmm or the flu shot rather mm-hmm the answer is yes they're trying to make a flu shot essentially for the virus okay but I just read interestingly enough and another new development Japanese health officials say a woman who had recovered from Cove in nineteen Crona Mars an R is released from care has been found to have virus again that would suck like I'm I'm past it and we're back well even though the sucky part about that specific case is she's a tour guide so she's literally always around below was she yeah yeah that does think so she of all people would be one of the ones to get reinfected which is shout out hermits we don't have to go outside outside world when they confirm a case case a oh my gosh we have one confirmed case okay when that person is a healthy do they unconformity you know I mean they'll put it in the list of people who've recovered okay so they just don't take it away from this so that person is still part of the cases that have been reported okay I know that now when did we like figure out what the flu was when the flu happened where people like holy [ __ ] this is crazy like we got to figure out what we're doing about this I don't know like it's like we're in like the 20s I'm really good I just I can't find a total number right now well I well I wanted to see was the the reddit comparison and like where cuz how long ago was that episode where we like really kind of broke down the coronavirus and you read over that list but I have to find it I don't think it's on track anymore oh is it too high or too high okay it's still been growing but but not at that like it was correct for a while but I think right now it's it's kind of falling off it's a lower yeah and I assumed to what that formula might not have taken into account was measures people would take her that might have been a variable they didn't account for couldn't account for was how what health organization in different countries were going to start counteracting the virus or trying to reduce the spreading um okay apparently there are 80 2785 cases in 2817 deaths currently Wow 82,000 people have corona boy in the bed net this happened to started about a month and a half ago if that sometime in like mid-december or no it's been longer than that or how does it I don't know it's gone by so fast time flies when you're having fun okay here here's the list so what so my dad always said what's today today is pokémon day the 27th you should know this okay so yeah this one's way off so it only went to the 21st of February I said by then there would be only 57 million cases could you [ __ ] imagine and 1 million 170 thousand deaths could you imagine like cuz the precautions people are taking now so the original prediction model had on the 21st of this plan so six days ago said there'd be 57 million cases and 1 million deaths that's obviously far off that would be then Gerald at that point I was really god today I'd be like but the reason and I think the variable they accounted for here and was going off it was based off the fact that it started in China obviously most populated place uh-huh and if they weren't able to contain it like if another Wuhan broke out in China yes in that case I do think that's very possible just because of the sheer amount of people in China mm-hmm and I think that's what it was accounting for but then again like I said it can't account for how one how people would react how governments would enact stuff bla bla bla like completely utterly quarantine entire cities yeah oh I think they're definitely doing it was crazy yeah they're doing the right thing I mean it better to be safe than sorry I would never want grow hey Corona if you're watching this video like can you please like Joe can you just like miss me with that and please dislike honestly I would be out of the Rob of all the people in this group that are probably chilled from faroan Authority get it it would be you why is that you're literally the healthiest of all of us now I mean system sucks no no you are fruit might be jacked but he gets sick a lot and I'm interested back problems blue over here as autoimmune disease is that I mean they're not like I'm gonna die from Corona but like I have [ __ ] arthritis and [ __ ] so I have been here for you bald alright Corona here's that looking at yeah yeah just wait just wait boy I'm taking that yeah so anyway that was a nice start to this podcast I'm just I'm glad it's not as bad as it was predicted that's a depressing start make sure you skip the corona part if you want to get to the fun parts of the podcast blue why don't you pick up the podcast with a nice review of the podcast oh that was good well I was really like I'm good I'm not kidding

no way there are people that can do that stop it I miss fixating hey guys for the full audio lessons are not there I'm currently choking mr. fruit with a felt because it's kind of it's hot and it's getting steamy on the video side you may want to tune into this part there are people that can do that though not important thank you for that review blue thank you for bringing this podcast up so I can bring it back down again oh oh press f to pay respects to left left right right up down up down be a start it's up down up down left foot no no oh my limit now I'm pretty treasured you try to fit right right up down up down be a star why are you trying to pay respects the Konami code you don't even know the Konami because I haven't made it past I well now i'm you said guess what i was like oh that's is that right what left right I can't does it I think my shirt left right right now down down because here is the Konami code left right left right up down be a star that's my guess you're wrong okay well I never played the ku Nami games may be a good Konami game please one just one hey up up down down left right left right B a start I was I did it had it backwards well game was that in um it first appeared in contra Oh consciously where it'll add the play to obtain 30 free lives keeping his conscious a tough game but the s5 I live G Kota so famous the Creator former Konami employee kazuhisa Hashimoto is died wait a sec Hashimoto we pay you rest that name of that disease I think I have I still unfortunately but what is your thing so mad it's that uh it's the problem with my lymph node I didn't know you had a problem with the lymph node Hashimoto's disease you know I'm getting blood work again to see if it is that but I really am the health yes here then I eat like fast food every night I eat one meal a day well there's like that one lady who lived like past hundred knowing what's your secret she's like I've smoked like two packs a day eaten horribly don't exercise drink I'll call the time it's like I'm just like I yeah like just get lucky there's some people who live the healthiest and die early the oldest man just turned 112 which was very cool and thank you for watching Barger you know um but so that was an unfortunate news headline to see yesterday as at the time we're recording this yeah the time is couple days ago that doesn't really matter but she we start out with a lull and then we come back up and then we go wall just like any good story and now we're about to hit it because that's the opposite of how a good story goes normally it escalates de-escalates escalates again at the end you know like a hero's journey yeah one to go in training learning has done something tragic happens and then they come back to fulfill their destiny but I think sometimes a good hero story is they start up and then go back down and they stay down and then there's there's always that's it that's it they're down actually there's a villain wins the dark side wins for this time also likely it's just a matter of perspective I saw Star Wars again trash once again even worse the second time just want you guys another thank you surprise it's still in theatres yeah I was really surprised we were able to still get tickets for it very weird hey blue what time is it mean o'clock it's every time hey who's that podcast it's Gigi over easy [Music] it's

god Wow yes you guys are like cyberpunk people cuz we have mind-reading video games nope I have a robot arm though i do play video games actually us notice guys only play pokemon that's nice you know i just can't play video games as much as I used to I named that I don't want to it's just like when I sit down to play 2 hours feels like what used to be like a whole night of gaming it's true even if I'm enjoying it I don't know I'll sit there and look at me it's women 2 hours I don't know what it is a couple months but I'm happy to say okay boomer maybe I don't know with you man like environment is like I can't play like a like a Skyrim or something like I have to sink my teeth into because I only can go like two hours from like whoo even if I have it's bizarre there are some games that are that are contrary and usually has to be like day one hide kind of thing Pokemon or like I'm grinding race yeah or you like @nm extreme yeah like Pokemon day one getting through that or like destiny expansion a lot of it like get through that but then I don't know I think I feel like it's more of a motivation issue because I'm the same way but it's because I'm not crazy into the game I'm playing like I'm it's yeah a lot of time I'm only playing games because there's nothing else to play like with I mean with most of the games I'm playing right now there's really nothing else to play so I'm just kind of and I'll play like an hour to before I'm like let me take a break go you know what I'm gonna snag E and then I come back and some dunkaroos I can't he just kind of leads into the story I wanted to tell them because I saw I said I had that story so yesterday I was buying a car and one of the questions is like whose regrets thank you I was they were like well who's your employer so I was like like Amazon because like I don't you can't say twitch because like it's like owned by Amazon and that's where like my normal primary and typically good say twitch yeah but like that's not as

probably so yeah my story that's a fortnight's ever don't know what I was playing okay same thing happened to you you got Kyle Jeff Bezos not caught like that but the same idea so the first year and like probably like the only year action would back south when I met fruit we fruit would take us to the to the TCG section of all you know the board games and that was back when they actually had Pokemon events and packs that was bad they don't have it anymore Pippen he knows cuz their boners so I don't think it was even I don't even think fruit was there the day that we did this cuz he was from out doing the grounds and so like me and Claire know I remember it was Jaguars playing the Pittsburgh Steelers in that oh yeah you an area yeah have you when they won that was tight what the Hooters food was garbage yeah and then during that they played Pokemon yeah so we went to go cuz cuz the day before they did like the pre-release tournament so like you put a bunch of like you open a couple packs you open a starter deck and you try to build the deck oh that's cool did that we did that I super rushed everybody with this super broken heracross card it was like flip a coin this card feels like super dick I win yeah yeah and it was dope and but I had to borrow fruits creator badge because I lost my creator badge so after the tournament is done due to I just played he's like the dad of these two kids he's like oh I see you have a creator badge what's your would you like do twitch or what's your channel name here's the internal sound of you like ya know me the name of the

destiny no I'm good well that was back probably what deal one that was like years that was like did you get recognized that like a food truck blew or something like that like they recognize your voice Crowdrise of iron yeah I an actual I love how we were gonna talk about Pokemon but now we've gone and then now we're talking about staying actually we'll get to it someone actually did meet me in the wilds and shout out shout out at John here cool dude I don't even know he watched this anymore John had go ahead he used to love our okay so it was the day that fruit hey 200,000 or not the day it was

I'm like oh the shirt are so tight I'm gonna wear it stupidest mistake I could ever make why would I wear my own stupid dream team shirt yeah I agrees to IRL you just fellow like but that's okay so I go to the so I go to this is back when I'm in Austin so I go to Stubb's BBQ shout out people who are you I figure myself it's just just a classic classic downtown spot in Austin and it's like it's like a middle of the day so like nobody's ad stub so I'll go to stubs I mean it's like four three or four so I go and I go to pick up from stubs and this dude is like he's going to pay his bill he's like oh I'll dream team shirt oh I just bought that and I got it like yesterday - you like them I'm just like oh [ __ ] my entire you gotta be [ __ ] kidding me only got 200 thousand subs is this really that big of a deal like he's not even like I'm not even that well-known and he's just like oh yeah I love them somebody did used to be somebody yeah it's actually crazy back in the day like you had like two dozen subs and you're like you're getting way more views and he had subs like that's how big destiny was it's not just hey look at me hey over here you do know you're doing amazing oh god mr. fruit I don't mean it like that I'm just saying okay we were like we were like we're like top zero zero zero zero point that's that like button to make mr. fruit happy anyways dude John's like I can't really hide my voice I'm like yeah I'm part of the dream team monkish shake and he's like oh blue was slow oh you're so cool he didn't even make a big deal of it he's like saying he was a really cool dude yeah that's a good experience man and and then he and then he was like oh yeah my kids watch you and I go and I see his kids and they're like these like six and seven year olds like oh my god what influence are being where we got my fare though that's when I used to censor it that is when he did sensing we drove crazy I try but yeah he was super cool just doesn't have the same tone I know when I say like man what the Freak I just can't there's no one these Frick it's not when you put an emphasis what free boy even they're like God man what the Freak I still had in me you know what the fudge maybe you just learn to scat Rob's angry you just sound like the wah wah wah wah wah wah - I beated okay okay that makes sense well shout out to John yeah and you know because his kids probably like watch for at night they don't watch us at wine lots of kids they probably saw the couple fortnight videos we didn't like yeah and then when I never did more than look forget about them alright so back to our Pokemon we got a long trip Pokemon this is a very important day for you to you guys this is what probably weird I have a little story that definitely takes precedent over Pokemon day room okay we'll get to put Pokemon we swear we'll get back you we're gonna get it back eighty second down okay hear me out here I want to bring this up just because we've talked about it before on the podcast and I thought it was pretty funny when it happened I pooped my pants yeah I think so on the podcast on Buffalo watling's homie maybe not that reason oh that's but go ahead you actually like okay dude big congrats egg thank you it actually happened I was sitting over there as I do when I work Hey and I just sit there chillin straight I don't feel like I have to poop Oh Micah nothing did I just get all fart coming oh so I'm like all right but just and immediately I go wait like you it wasn't like a had to fart again no and then it like immediately it's like a rapid fire and I just did not stop sob I'm what are we sitting there I like stop what I'm doing I just sit there like I think I just pooped myself and sure enough I like I stand up just up twice well I stand up and sure enough like this I feel something it ain't right so I mean I immediately just run to the bathroom taking pants off hop in the shower I can't I got it I just soiled myself now that well first off here's the thing well no I took myself my pants off when on the toilet and I had hot liquid soup coming out of my by minute no [ __ ] [ __ ] no pun intended you know there's a lot of it and like and the worst part too is like it wouldn't like it would really felt like someone dipped my butthole in like hot like in the Bob it felt like my butthole was distant the bomb I don't know they're like you don't remember what you ate after that or before that there's nothing crazy like it was pretty normal oh my god and so when I like the light looked at my pants it was almost like nothing it was like a little stream Julie West low yes I agree bent over backwards oh it was what it looked like a little little streak but like I want you to stop something came out great I couldn't ah I was like I'd poop my pants technically I pooped in the pain not like that's that's okay not like a full wad but okay and like that's sharding like sharding is like you think you have to fart see I've almost started countless times okay but the thing was I thought all the time say but you got to be kind of like but now I'm worried yeah all our systems on because it fell cuz I'm sorry I've showered at countless times in my life so like so when you like I feel a fart coming I'm always conscious about a shark because I always eat like [ __ ] so who knows what my poop is gonna be like that day so like

full poop and then I just wake up but it's Christon it's not born so but you know what won't make you [ __ ] your pants this hat yeah alright blue water alright welcome back no no poo poo pee pee I so what did you guys pee your pants the first day spoke my day as of this record we're actually talking about Pokemon Rob wants to know everybody's top 10 Pokemon list because to talk about it later the top 10 Pokemon list or top 100 top 10 no they came out with the official they did a survey whatever for today top 10 Pokemon I thought they did like top 100 though like and then well I mean yeah but they only show yeah and Offutt on my hand top 10 list was okay there was some I really disagreed with and I will give my opinion but I'm also gonna say I gotta say I personally wasn't surprised by any of the top 10 really none of them really came out at especially okay we'll just wait for the list here where can I'd it shows a mythical Pokemon yeah what is that is that it's like a little gorilla it's the new song darude dance storm karu de sandstorm that's cool where is the last wrinkle I'm looking for it's like how do you not find it hey pokemons tweeted a lot today well it is today I mean here we go here we go hey yeah yeah yeah alright alright ladies and gentlemen the top 10 list I can tell us what we have at number 10 so so once again this is the top 10 list as voted by everyone who wanted to go vote probably I have no vote I didn't know about this like you care follow pokemon twitter buddy go to for steelix so yeah whoever voted for this is are just community-driven or whatever yeah we have at number 10 Gengar well desert you like to see been top well deserved I think he is well I think she'd be higher dude anger is the first Pokemon ever shown on the TV show one of two well one of two so I like the cooler of the two he's a psychic he just looks cool I love him great guy I always picked him in pokemon battle number nine Gardevoir hmm which people if I know I think will love that yeah if I've learned anything from dorks feed I know why Gardevoir is number 900 yeah because like they think it's hot there is a lot of furry bait out there okay yeah that might explain some of these actually eight to surprise it was this high rayquaza absolutely well-deserved it probably one of the coolest ones i feel like a request might have been a little higher reposes prai I think Rayquaza just is universally the most popular legendary yeah is the only letter date on that list right me yes yeah well except for number one which I'm sure they Londonderry this oh I was like what I mean they I mean they should but they decided to choose chars are instead for some reason number seven Gore Trump I didn't understand that one either but then again I'm saying like you guys well is so Garchomp is just iconic because of Cynthia and holy crap did Cynthia rock your [ __ ] when you were kid and like Garchomp was like her best Pokemon it's the arch it's the dragon line yeah I know Garchomp is one of those buses booked one in the history of Pokemon and competitively to play super competitive and she's just in the game Cynthia rock your [ __ ] and Garchomp with one rocked your [ __ ] I think it looks cool it's a cool jet kinda he looks dope yeah he's cool but I would he would come near my top ten number six sylveon what is that it oh sorry evolution of Eevee yeah any of them surprised me I guess it would be sylveon but even then I that wouldn't surprise me that much cuz sylveon has just been really really popular especially with 100 years and I also feel like for some girls and stuff like younger girls I imagine it's abot eight more towards specially baby already and then you got the fairy type so all the girls love Eevee I mean I have to say guys don't have it but I'm just saying I imagine that's what I thought this one I was surprised by because I loved it but I didn't realize it was so universally loved at least by the people who did the survey I'm Briana I'm Brandon I'm not surprised by personally cuz especially especially in the u.s. Bryan has always been ridiculously popular well I think what happened with Umbreon that's they Umbreon an SS belong or SPS beyond they those were the first two evolutions that were the newest of Eevee right yeah yeah so I think that's why it kind of holds cuz it was not Jolteon Flareon none of those it was like a number one give me one s yeah and I'm Brandon in general I've just been like really big word estroux the anime and the games we even I'm Brown was a starter in Pokemon Colosseum like really I don't know though yeah I'm Rihanna an Espeon but I'm Browns always been super super big popular and then the next four on the list are pro prepar of the course personally no see this is where they surprised me number four Charizard that didn't ya that's wack and wait get him up there if he needs to be one that's ridiculous oh you think it needs more ice absolutely I think used to be higher I'm a little jaded on the Charizard talk just cuz he gets so much special attention as a casual pokemon the casual here this group all right you guys ready no doubt no doubt GM Pokemon masters Ivan or me alright and when I think Pokemon I think Charizard you know I'm sorry I do like that is who I think should be one not only because in the anime he was super cool any seismic toss in the the magmar in the video and that's sick that's a very good part because then and Charizard learned to become one with each other even though they have disagreements and they learned that through the show too so there's a lot more that goes the charger than there's a [ __ ] glass dragon come on he deserves to be one and I I guess I'm in the minority here well I'd swap oh c'mon take note nowhere on this list is Pikachu Eevee okay geez you didn't even make top 30 and eat what kind of shoe of Ibiza tournament like did he make top 30 I I want to I will after we finish the top ten I do want to go over some interesting pics in the top 30 that will change the way we see Pokemon forever number specifically for one group of people but anyways number three this one surprised me mimic eel whack dude what this one did not surprise me pal you because mimic you has continuously been everywhere in the anime everywhere in the games gets its own like sick ass TCG cards and in general the concept - Pokemon is just so sick people gravitate towards so much it stupid he could choose depressed cousin that is tight I don't all I ever know that popular mimics choose the one that grabs you in Smash that's all I know about it it like grabs you with a man throws you yeah that's what it does that's that Pokemon well I see this one this doesn't surprise me personally and mimic you has just been super super popular ever since they show it off a lowly region in general has had a lot of Pokemon that are just like exploded popularity and mimic you is probably the biggest one number two Lucario mm-hmm probably the least freising pick on this list in whack you got more faith than me I guess I don't I don't give I guess I haven't kept up with the whippersnappers I just didn't think like the Lucario movie was even that good like sit woodcarving a Pokemon movie that was probably one of the first Pokemon my was that like this and like that's why I'm like not really big into Lucario and I didn't really like a smash character all either he's pretty cool yeah watch soo use him he's pretty good with him although he's dropped him but that's not the point oh let's not be that good hands now this one surprises me not at all this is the okay yeah I'd never mind this is the least surprising one yeah uno most popular Pokemon according to the survey I don't know who they surveyed but pretty much everyone it was published by Pokemon so a lot of people did it idea greninja you know no surprises here greninja has quickly over the course of the past five years just like become what is essentially the mascot to pokemon Nexus Pikachu as I explained to rob it is the Zoomers Charizard yes times 10 so take me the casual and make me six years younger yeah you'd be like plus at a huge spike a huge bond the anime they made an entire like arc exclusive form holy so he was so popular than made a whole form you know Ash's greninja and they even put ash greninja in the game that's how popular greninja is what was the game you first if you played the demo what genesis him he's Gen 6 and what's his starter uh froakie froakie which is also a six starters which also probably plays into it a little bit but I'm just mainly cuz he's a ninja I guess throws water tokens I have no idea people really like him water dark too I mean it's a cool type sick type and his hidden ability is one of the most probably the most Opie of all the starters hidden abilities protein all right so we got pokemons top 10 I'm so interested in you guys as top 10 list before we go into our top 10 cuz me and fruit are probably not even gonna have like a number top 10 let's go over like just real quickly by the way you wanted it to top 30 yeah I'm interested to hear about that so right out of the top 10 is drag a pole 11 I don't know that he's number 11 that was super dope because I didn't I I didn't think Jack wasn't either high but dragon pole it's actually pretty interesting how popular dragon balls got in a short amount of time I have no time ranat are at number 12 at number 13 this changes the game Bulbasaur was normal so he's the number one like highest are Bulbasaur so ol bus Bulbasaur there was a lot of pride in Bulbasaur because he was the low-key pick well Bulbasaur is number 13 Pokemon Bulbasaur is a norman pick now boys successfully changed the landscape and you know what [Music] they've successfully changed the landscape if you feel congratulation aloni now being a Normie pick relative core behind the list although I to be fair chars are it is them before so I'm not gonna like like the facts real facts fortune we got toxicity who just released this generation like 15 lugia I want the most classic legendaries of all time is loogie it was in the water I was at some Christian about I don't know the movie bro I've watched the movie but I didn't realize he was the water I thought he was Isis yes I know and then that's Otto Kuno don't ask you waited kid Louie is not water talk about know I thought who's wind that's what I was really like ice and we is fine when's not a type well he cited him Tim my kid world you're doing great anyways number 16 is Rowlett Rowlett one of those poppy stars ever in such turn around time 17 we got age / 18 is chandelure I was wrong up [ __ ] up that Jesus died and allele or is tight shut out he's kind of cool number 19 is Pikachu Pikachu did make top 20 the chandelier got higher than Pikachu Schindler's tie come on number 20 is Eevee no surprises here Eevee is highly popular as well as the eeveelutions and believe that I'm surprised by this number 21 is luxray we like Elektra Luxx great with soup off so popular he's a tight he's one of the sickest designs for sure number 22 is the sid UI the evolution of Rowlett number 23 is roark the dark type that changes with the illusion ability 24 is like in rock 25 is core of a knight 26 is Flygon 27 is hydreigon 28 is septembe hydration 3 heads right I do yeah he's tight is tight number 29 is Blaziken and I number 30 one of the most popular internet meme pics made list number 30 is snob the little ice boom it's Nam what is that the cool boy tom is so cute dude I love them you guys likes Nam more than you like Charmander you guys know really breaks out for you are my favorite first up you act as if I voted like this is my list there's a better not be all I'm saying is that Dragon Knight deserves to be in that top 30 that is unbelievable that he got snubbed get destroyed makes me sick he delivers mail for God's sakes yeah I agree charge just blew pollinate everyone gets about a mess the fact dragon I saw in the top 30 is a disgrace it is now but that's kind of tight now because it's a low-key kind of pitch that's true wrong now you're a hipster dude yeah no I'm cool my boy Toxicroak and Croagunk got snuffed a name I'd be shocked to program gut tells me see but me and fruits favorites are already low-key picks on which is on for Gary people just sleeping on him dude oh that's the great part of Pokemon though everyone's got a different paper so they only went to 30 then it go to 100 on the site they only show the top 30 but then they also show the list of like the top 10 by region okay that's cool but yeah I mean is you don't have warmth on that banana that's cuz it doesn't rain past 30 all right give me your top tens okay both your top 10 okay you're both your number Ten's go go blue first cuz he's prepared I can't I can't give you like a wave you said you said you won't he doesn't have any order I don't have like an ordered list though I mean I could tell you I could tell you like my top three right that's not hard but I can't everything passed top three can't tell you that that's too difficult start there okay so my favorite is X so we'll start it off with stuff that reps remember with Zapdos is on my top 10 list I love Zapdos what my favorite absolutely decide on a top ten list one of my favorites it's absolutely a shame he did make the top 30 we also got Umbreon I love Umbreon so no surprises here a sec lugia also

ten I rallies when my favorites also because I bred an unholy amount of them to get to work a shiny it's not a big deal to make it weird and then Pidgeot I love Pidgeot I like a lot of people were like oh this big take pic but I love Pidgeotto specifically I love mega Pidgeot one of the sickest designs I've ever seen in Pokemon it looks dope let's tent em - shame Tim Tim wishes they could make mega remotely come close all right buddy let's be let's be honest here buddy okay and then this pokemon has quickly become one of my favorites Drago pole is on my top ten I love Drago pole he's one of the six Pokemon ever seen what does he look like he's a dragon with a jet plane on his head with the stealth bomber jet on his head okay shroom pictured ring I thought that was a Garchomp Dragon Balls is sickest dragon Paul is like cooler Garchomp on be honest we chief okay the ghost dragon is tight and then I could easily tell you my top three so number three's Charmander nice I love Charmander I always have charm riders on my favorites I like Charmander morning like Charizard I'm gonna be honest with you that's okay that's okay Charmander is just the I used to when I was a kid I would literally have a Charmander and never evolved it all the way level 100 that bring it as many games like it and there's always been Johnny like bbbbb and then I would when I played on the Virtual Console when the when red came out on the 3d s store I same thing played through the game with Charmander and emerald into Charizard I love Charmander um anime like yes you have like one of the saddest moments in the anime that [ __ ] made man that sticks with me to this day it sticks with you Charmander they got treated like [ __ ] that and then ash raised him to be a strong Charizard that's always top I wouldn't have my heart right now at 25 if I didn't see that as a kid it's true man I want to be a different emotions that's why they see that Charmander talking about Pokemon shoutout Pokemon number two's Empoleon he's a penguin he's an armored penguin yeah yeah I know that big specifically because of you yeah and Paul you tight I love him fully on he hasn't gotten a whole lot of love from Pokemon but okay and then my number one is always the most low-key pic and everyone's like really Wallace bro and I'm just like Oh pip it hands is silly silly I have literally have like three silver Lee figures on my desk right now it's simply the one with the with the three like kind of claws and it has like the hair that goes back that okay yeah it's tight I have like I like

silly keychain civilly as my background on my iPhone I love subway that's good and so we just Titus he has like one he also has one of the sickest backstories in Pokemon lore Pokemon more and I just think he has like one of the coolest designs I've ever seen Pokemon and he's super sick Pokemon and to lose my favorite so each hit Arceus mains is it Arceus like the god of Pokemon though yeah alright well that was only his 300 be that way well no he had like that whole kind of list going into it like that I was telling through the whole talk to him yeah I mean I listed my eyelid numbered my top three cuz it's the only one yeah like a number and the number well I mean I'm out I'm I'm screwed here I tried to look up an image so I could see all of them but yeah things loading so I'll definitely forgets him just just just do it off the top of your head and okay a Pokemon that are watching if you guys are offended by mister fruits list will make sure I forgot some okay so I'll just try and name some we got in no particular order Rowlett mmm-hmm so you like Riley would make your top 10 like well it's tight tucked in Arcanine oh great Pig okay core he'd be in mine he would be in mine program could be my number one I can tell you that mmm my number one he's my boy hey I even I even got him a shiny Croagunk like my man so Croagunk [Music] my boy crevo rant you know with you my boy Kramer that's that derpy bird from JP my dear my burrito boy the part I love about sword and shield is there so many good designs and I guarantee you at least one of sword seals designs has made it into someone's top 10 list like people stopped and the other or good ones cram ran is so cool is up there Tyranitar course you are my basic class like me some teeth or um real quick no Typhlosion love out of you guys no wow tyfa lotion would cynical simple actually used to be my favorite pokemon back when i was a kid but i don't know what hat I just grew out of it and I guess cynical just a new poll line just wasn't it for me I say Blastoise absolutely like that was that at 6 I'm like oh I can't be mad as you got like venusaur Blastoise or you know it's like I can't be mad I do want to I noticed I had been a sword too yeah neither be beautiful Bulbasaur yeah ok although after ultimate I be sore with it are you the high end after my heart what other ones see like if I saw more my wood no bond fly oh he's a freak oh oh he looks like a little bonsai tree yeah uh what is that - more - more probably Umbreon ya know legendaries on there just think about that okay so I'm Brianna and that gives me one more I guess you got one more buddy I believe in you if I look through I'd probably find a few more than but oh I kind of like that one more gang guard that will that's a close contender mm-hmm but I might have to say Pidgeot Wow yes oh Jesus Jesus just made me fall back in love with mega Pidgeot even though Pidgeot Loki kind of sucks doesn't matter so what ways so use a Pidgeot right that's the second one right oh that's the last one PG Oh does the second one final on yep the GP mega mega Pidgeot just takes that picture I design the next level Utah yeah I think Christian just thought of one that you forgot well no I'll show you making a pigeon mega Pidgeot sometimes they're kind of fair to have that on the top ten oh I mean it's no Pidgeot that's super so it's like super saying like right yes that Maemo that same I thought then I retract that that's definitely in there I haven't really included Megas because they're definitely some dope mega designs mm-hmm but yeah that would be my completely off-the-cuff talk - those are good list boys I'm proud of you good for you guys but Rob off the top of your head you talked in oh I don't even know if he could name ten I mean that's already the one it's just gonna be 1 and n 2 and I'd be shocked if there's a gen 3 all right there actually want to know a gen 3 I do want to know at least like what your top three are my top three okay Dragonite would be one for sure yeah I love track and I wanted anything I think he's so cute and he had a job in the show like he's gonna be him with the male thing he's in that new movie on that foot yeah and I think he's just so uh like I think his evolution is so weird he goes from at routine II yeah I still think that's a little wax and the but I know I think that is so cool I think it's just like so like sores from water and then he becomes a dragon it's just so different and so sick um - I mean I have to like Charizard in there there's like mine or me pick you know like I think I've always had a Charizard when I played gen 1 Pokemon game boy bands whatever it was Charizard I picked Charmander and that was it yeah call me if whatever you want I don't care uh three please we probably have to be gang gar honestly I love gang gar in the n64 version of the Pokemon Stadium he was no matter what an auto include it was so good in Sobers they he had like Thunder he had luck yeah he had like thunder in that game he had like psychic he had like nightmare and then he had like um he would need to have nose and hypnosis yeah he had hypnosis nightmare he had like thunderbolt or something like that it was sick about and then and then in the game when he'd get attacked he got like it stung he got yeah you do that with his tongue I thought that was so cool and then for arcanine would probably be like somewhere in this list couple of them yeah he for sure be in their home uh-huh would be on in my top 10 favorite name right ho oh oh ho ho yeah I always called him ho ho that's Santa who else would I put on there um Palkia I think Palkia is super cool no I don't like any agenda for no but like I think he's just a really cool looking Pokemon I love the pink and then he's also like the time bike person right or like you know what I think he like control space for time what I'm like that and that's like super interesting I think he just looks really cool and like I thought I think and then I probably have to throwing just for like off base of design I don't know anything about them I just like love to look at them like rayquaza I think Rayquaza fortunately needs to be in my top 10 spreads Julis wasn't chartered chanting Charizard mega Charizard Rex mega Charizard y Alakazam I love Alakazam I look coach Tom yeah Alakazam with like the little spoon besides he was super good too on Pokemon battles Pokemon Stadium um okay so now I got two more spots I got a throw-in Articuno I think you know I gotta show love to Articuno I'm kind of Norma here with the all of these legendary pigs yeah yes nine dude I'm like running out of Felix no she looks just terrible Steelers would be like on the bottom oh oh you forgot Chandeleur your favorite program at Chandler high at Pokemon is trash the bat they literally were like a Pokemon meeting like hey guys we need like one more Pokemon like what are you guys thinking so that's the thing they do with ghost Pokemon as they like they possess items whatever and then probably I post cyndaquil in there I think cynic was really cute he's a really cute boys nice any fine yeah he's really cute it sounds like all like nasally oh then you got to go with psycho - and then I guess last we could just throw in like I like hunter I think hunter is really cool one of my daughter Hunter whatever Hunter huh you're called hunter you call Hunter hunter when you're shut up yes I did Oh classmate of his I didn't see the eh okay come on uh yeah but that I mean those would probably be around my top ten I mean I would have to see you list it and then like narrow it down like 40 and then there that's down 40 to 20 I'd have to do that that's great list I think you did great I did thank you you know who else did good who our viewers who sent us some questions nice yes I will stay patrons I or patrons I forgot this week so blame me that Twitter gets to do what you guys can do I'm sorry blame me I forgot I normally wake up every Monday and then do it but I'd forgot enough of your excuses bras are okay because cámaras as a question for us what is the smell and or Shannon immediately brings back memories of your childhood you often find yourselves in situations where random smells or songs bring back specific memories but an interesting topic to discuss memory association with your senses my answer would be yes I can think of two distinct things the odd thing is the smell I can't pinpoint what it is and sometimes like really I'm only very rarely smelled it and I don't know what it is but it reminds me growing up my best friend's house in Florida his name was Matthew uh-huh his house had a very unique smell it wasn't bad just a very unique smell it was nice and sometimes in the weirdest places I'll catch a waft and immediately it feels like I'm like seven again at his house that's so weird and I can like go back to us playing melee or playing Pokemon and you don't know what it is though no I can't can you remember like last time you smelled it though like probably a year or two ago do you remember where you kind of were it was like but I can kind of remember because then I even go like what am i smiling right now I need to figure out what this smell but I can never figure it out that's interesting and then the song would be Enya pretty much any nu song cuz my mom when we were younger when she would cook it would just blare that on the speakers we had just the hole in your soundtrack so anytime I hear Enya it's a party in the Miller house I just think right back to my mom cooking dinner and we're like six or seven she's making like Hamburger Albert yeah but I can just so those that you're right yeah um mine mines smell you know the smell so you know a hose like a water hose you know like the smell of a water hose as the water is coming out of it you know like like water hose it smells like water from a hose it smells and tastes different than traditional water and I will say Colorado hose water tastes better it's weird like I got some nice tap one I love a water from the hose because it it makes me feel like I'm a kid again and it's a hundred degrees out and I'm literally just with a hose just like I love please Photoshop and it like literally smells like like it's just has a weird kind of like fresh but not rubbery kind of water smell to it I love it and it brings me back to filling up water balloons and all that kind of stuff when I meet a song that brings me back to my childhood any of my dad's just 80s music or seven or Beatles any Zeppelin Pink Floyd anything like that when my dad was working in the garage and I would just be like watching him and he'd be like pay me the screwdriver and I'd handed like a wrench anybody like does anything like that just a little old classic rock there's makes me my dad about you blue pretty much any single time I walk into a Mexican restaurant I'm gonna be honest with you I smell I smell the smell of like the flower on the tortillas carne asada in the back like when I walk in there I get everything I don't even have I get a bone Yeah right that's the dude next Mexican food smells like home it doesn't matter what doesn't matter doesn't matter what race you are Mexican food smells that movie like messed me up Coco there's like I have abuela and she's so nice I love you fee if you're watching this you're probably not I love you so yeah the smell of Mexican food in general just always brings you back to my childhood I've grown up literally pounding down Mexican food and I'm now in my 20s and I'm still pounding on Mexican food then it's a that's the life you know what I would kill for right now blue like the tortillas that cheese sauce which tip for me tears oh dude that's high yeah that appetizer oh it's like a basically it's do basically like it's just basically just caso with like sausage in it it's um well the cheese specific like the way and it's streaming when it comes out it was like super fluffy and it kind of has like some grease from the sausage chance gross like smoky news and then the great flour warm tortilla awesome like I taste a Rando okay anyway yeah do you have another one between that b-dubs dude I'm where like I'm feel like copper right now waiting for food just sometimes it I haven't eaten in 22 hours um unknown dragged asks this could be for all of us it's up to you guys is there a game that we wish perform better on the channel that you guys could play more Paragon the point that the game would need to be a little mind if it looked better than maybe it would still be alive yeah that's true minecraft or CSKA but we've never done or tried csgo so and we'll never gonna try csgo so minecraft or CS co I've made like one or two videos have you made csgo video a while ago really I have to literally come up okay whatever eyes go around shooting the chicken or something okay yeah so csgo that mine Captain Sisko my list would be long pretty much if there's ever been a one-off video I wish you made more that yeah probably I feel the exact same way or a couple where like I keep posting every now and then like paladins I wish to come head I always did like oh well I did well but I did alright but like I don't know if people would watch me just play that over and over again honestly that might be the only thing I did just play cup head over and over over speedrunning like there's no game I would I feel the obligation like speedruner doing there that but I would with Cup in then such a good game yeah I would agree with blue though paragon I was literally I was we're just waiting for it to like full release mm-hm and then never did it die um battleborn I mean there's any of those games I love that just died battleborn Islands yeah I've seen you up yeah yeah god honestly yeah I'm trying to think like there's a big catalog yeah well I wish like the first bit of the series did well hmm but I'd like tide had done everything I could when it was in early access mm-hmm and I waited for a few updates and then no one came back like no one washed it there we want more news i well you gotta watch it no I like I don't starve I think I'd throw it on there too I like when we play that because it's fun but we also really suck it well that we would need more time like yeah well I think like if we were alive for 20-something days and we had eight videos of it nobody would really watch you know they probably wouldn't like it but I would love that I wish apex would do a little bit better yeah because like the first ones for the season do a little bit well and then they kind of dip them and like Plateau yeah and I really enjoyed that yeah geez not for honor Oh oh c'mon what are we like almost every game except for called duty and destiny those are the only ones that sometimes like gain momentum and trouble and Tarascon things yeah I like that with you why that's why I'm glad that keep watching that yeah yeah thankfully that's not on the list because it does well and we enjoy doing it yay yeah there are a lot Kingdom oh yeah I do tons more to Kingdom Gotham City Impostors you know it but again no like I know I tried to not I said battleborn but I try to not put in games that are just dead anyway yeah but I wish I wish if I had some like a little more influence I could actually keep a game alive and I like that'd be nice um why doesn't blue switch to mr. Pibb asks I'm not your babe god it's him he could never leave me alone even when i'm not streaming mr. Pibb hey Teddy shame okay they do not take they say [ __ ] oh I'm actually yeah I have transferred over wait you yeah yeah you oh he is PIP he has a they taste the same okay well same well here's the thing in my reasoning I mean it's the same reason why I drink Coke now I used to Club Pepsi growing up that's all we had was Pepsi so I just got over it I got sick but you're the worst and then it's too sweet I like Coke now same way I always had dr. pepper that was my go-to for anything and so I think I just tried Pam and eyes like this in the band and I like it it's the same it literally tastes like I'm not team paid a peep on that team pit or team dr. pepper I'm the next fruit summit the same we're doing a blind so to taste-test deal I'm gonna say that's the same like that it says I'm not gonna I yeah you guys will have to be able to tell the difference I for one won't be able to because I think they taste the [ __ ] same how much gonna be flipping a coin when I guess but I think my bisoder palette for you will just purposely mess with you and put Dr Pepper Dr Pepper and next one like pip and pip do the same thing I'm like the rat that has like the weird experiment will say it's like Coke and Pepsi it's the same thing you're like dude I'm like the control group that's like taking the placebo that like has nothing going on with it [Music] let's just we're just gonna scroll and stop somewhere good luck okay Nick Clark asks most iconic console of all time if that's this is probably gonna be like I'd like to it's either the OG xbox or the n64 n64 specifically because they made me love video games and like showed me my love for video games how cool they can be Xbox because it showed me in it it like showed me the world of online video games and like where that can go and like that's basically become my life so one of those two for me I can't pick one of the other what'd you say blue Prime PSD man ps2 is everything started yeah you pissed he was like where it's other ps2 word you know what now it's n64 n64 is like as my first like console like Diddy Kong Racing all that stuff and 64mm at 16 in Tendo in general just thought will always have my heart I just can't well see I'm thinking most iconic fanboy ever like not I personally I think for me personally the n64 is the most oh oh well like mmhmm because I 64 because for like my generation that's like the console that got all of us like really started on like home consoles through Nintendo but I guess like most iconic overall would still definitely be ps2 yeah I'll put xbox over so yeah at one point I wouldn't say like OS Vinnie ass but I remember or even the NES it was clear when we were in holiday and some guy had like a keychain or something with NES controller she said was that my wife Oh like this was like the classic rectangular what do you mean there was that it's like this that's the NES controller like what you mean the one that started at all and I realize there's so many people that just don't understand anymore or don't know mm-hmm and I was like I thought that was the most iconic but they've Claire whose it was not even like a non gamer like she knows games iconic that has to break like cultural yeah so I was like I don't know so I might have to say ps2 yeah because I feel like Xbox one and PlayStation one did a lot but I feel like ps2 is the one that really broke through everything yeah that's where I disagree is because the Xbox had better online play like you weren't not many people were playing on what I guess I'm yeah the original Xbox really wasn't even that popular in the grand scheme of things but see when it came to ps3 verse three sixty I would say 360 was more of a cultural phenomena but it wasn't as big as ps2 yeah cuz he was just on a different level ps2 was like ps2 was like when console gaming became mainstream yeah pretty crazy yeah we wouldn't we wouldn't have as many people buying consoles as we do today if it wasn't for ps2 consoles new PC I was about to make that joke and say yeah future yeah the most influential console at my computer my so with that that concludes the question segments and this episode off the podcast I had
