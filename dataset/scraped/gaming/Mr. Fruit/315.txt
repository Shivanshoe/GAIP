ballsy i think oh but i got her i guess let's freaking get it okay i used my burst at the literally when nothing's going on my back okay okay we got close i'm going right in now okay what [Music] i

you look at how much damage that did i thought that was okay i think i got her i think yes okay hold on oh my god don't question it all right that was a robbery and a half i think she was blocking no she was oh [Music] let's go dude that's a that's a meaty super i only use that super ever because the other one i'm way too far to ever hit it she's way too ranged let's go here we go best of three one to one change society here we go reflecting on themselves oh they're going to let the intro rock this time that's odd such a sick intro that character's sick when the full game comes out i might just play her giant swords like that oh we see your intro but am i okay stupid oh i tried for it i went for it i went for it let's go i got it i did it oh shoot i've never landed that super before this is very exciting [Music] second yeah keep pressing buttons on me see how that works out for you got him oh you know i might just end this with a throw ready let's go i still don't know that many combos but i'm much more comfortable and the biggest thing is the fact that i actually remember what all my buttons do now here we go her guns go pew pew or something she got a guitar let the intros rock have some decency society so instead of reflecting on themselves they blame the beasts heaven or hell oh can you die real quick can you shut up aha yeah got him let's go saul he's going to be aggressive i'm calling it wait i don't know what's on my character right now okay that hurt there's only one way to learn i remember to do faster [Music] [Music] i think i got here yeah this raw
