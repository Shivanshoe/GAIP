you today's uh an interesting day isn't it i wonder so what the heck is going on well we're making a new account baby fresh that's right why let me ask you this why not i know there's a lot more points for why not than why but we're still here now i have not deleted my main account and i'm not going to and it's still gonna be my main account probably most likely but we're always going to have this side account because it's it's going to be fresh you know what i'm saying because literally everything will have meaning on this account and i technically haven't started destiny fresh in eight years seven when did destiny one come out there's this whole new light experience and i've heard it's put it lightly pre-garbage so we're gonna find out ourselves but for now we're going in blind and not on a titan we're gonna be doing a warlock warlock won the poll little unfortunate why is that unfortunate um uh hunter seems a little more fun in pvp kind of kind of upset you guys didn't choose hunter but whatever the poll has spoken we are a warlock and i could not care less about this does not matter to me i'm never going to see my face so this really doesn't matter but okay great i don't think i watched this day one i think i was just too excited and i skipped it can't remember 30 fps oh mega wall real question is why did they come to mars with a m14 what were they expecting oh yeah maybe they're gonna shoot the big big ball now imagine i just started playing destiny first i have no idea i'm like why are there astronauts i didn't know he plays astronauts do we plays astronauts it's on mars what's that big white ball oh i'm like oh who's speaking i bet he's an interesting character that's still alive where am i you're alive peter peter you sound different buddy don't worry
