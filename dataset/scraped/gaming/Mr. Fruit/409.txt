how's it going everybody it's sunday sunday fun day sunday aka whatever the date is because not recording this on sunday my immersion oh welcome to the brand new series yeah i don't know what i'm calling this yet um i know i need some of your guys's help i'm thinking something to do with like sunday spin spinning sunday sunday sunday sunday been spin spin spin to win i don't know because look i wasted my money on a um those annoying things was like all right come on come on spend the win you too can win a free blah blah blah oh whoops you actually got the very limited chance uh we own you now that's right your soul is ours it is a spinning prize wheel and the prize for us my friends is the content so let's you know what hey let's start out today's episode with a spin what are we gonna get [Music] looks like it's the content that's crazy with such a small percentage chance of landing on that that's well it looks like i was about to put headphones on looks like in today's video it's the content this was um this is a joint effort we did this together didn't really know what to do because literally we can just put whatever we want up there spin it and whatever it lands on you know we could focus that episode around it or maybe we put up a couple things and we spend it a couple times and do whatever it is and i mean it could you know it could be anything wow me um i may or may not put it up if i put it up it means i'm willing to do it so in the comments below literally just say a word or a phrase or an action it can be something i need to do it can be something vague it could be like eat three raw eggs i probably won't do that i probably won't put that up there but like that's an example right it could be me doing something it could be me going somewhere it could be me playing something or like literally you could just put like brown and i would write the word brown and then we'd i'd get on brown and be all right well i have to figure out what that means i guess we'll run with that every now and then we can put a couple too that's like giveaway an actual giveaway and then maybe i'll do a giveaway episode like um like fan mail like i have some family here just like me if we land on a fan mail we'll open one for this video or i don't know skye's limit right so i want to just make something a little bit more personal that feels like we're connecting a little bit more feels like it's more of a discussion you know um we're getting to know each other and talk with each other more a little more intimate not just a regular old gameplay video so i don't know maybe this is a terrible idea maybe like mr truth this is the stupidest thing i bet wow you could have said that a little nicer i hope i can show this i won't show any addresses or anything uh this is okay i gotta show the penmanship though is that that has to be printed see that it i think it's a font that they print but at the same time that could be someone's handwriting that's nuts that's my p.o box by the way if you want to send some looks like it's somebody's etsy shop i didn't order anything so let's see what we got here you know if i'm gonna do more of this i need to get a letter opener this is already the best thing ever look at this porky stickers oh and that's their etsy shop so maybe they're just trying to advertise you know what congrats um but no this must just be something and they know i have two little corgis and by the way they hate this thing i had to close the door for this video because i i spun it once and i'm not kidding you my life flashed before my eyes i thought they were gonna eat me live look they even drew all of an oppa and you wanna know why i know because olive very rare she's um red haired but she doesn't have any of that white streak that goes above her nose whereas oppa has this derpy he's all over the place that's so cute thank you fish fruit thanks for blessing us with your among us content watching you and your friends play makes me feel a little less lonely since i am work for hire as a freelance artist i wanted to send you some stickers that look like all of an oppa hope you like them happy holidays to you and your fam porous thank you very much chorus hope you had a happy holidays um hopefully you didn't find me exclusively from among us because you're probably not going to watch this video because you've probably already given up on my content just kidding actually i might address that in this video we got one that looks like olive and of course the tri-colored that looks like appa and then this is easily the best space corgi and it's holographic i might even you know for the inaugural i might even put this astronaut corgi on the middle of this this is awesome thank you so much got a cool little green one here with some stickers here we got here from washington they have been there they saved this holiday season tip number 195 giant monsters are attracted to bright decorations in large cities they'll

addressing me that's so cute wishing you and your family happy holidays and a fantastic new year christian we hope new year will bring you lots of amazing things and of course god damn now pay attention to the way they spell content that's the way that's some content there's a silent h in there but that's kind of what hangs up the content love from the netherlands oh shoot i was gonna say hello or greetings in the netherlands whatever but another thing but i don't know what your language is and oddly enough if i i it would just be offensive if i tried something simba sam and mir then in or i appreciate it's marielle the human oh cool i think they have uh an instagram if you want to check that out at chocolate lab simba i'm gonna go show them some love i think it's muriel i think thank you very much oh this is from colorado oh my gosh that's where i am ah paper cut myself i should have seen that one coming we have here the ancient scrolls actually wow no way is this is this their handwriting look at this it feels like i'm in history class right now and in the textbook they have a little excerpt of like ramen so-and-so's uh [Music] diaries of the great gettysburg address hello fruit of all the videos i respond to it is the one where you talk about your minor ocd oh i remember that one i think it is because i cannot oh i think it is because i count steps two so i can relate yoho stair counting gang well it's actually you know interesting i've been doing a lot of self reflection recently um through therapy and then also just um you know meditating on stuff and whatever doing some introspection and uh i've come to realize that i have some minor ocd but i 100 i have adhd but it manifests differently because of my obvious hereditarial depression um i just got a lot going on you know it is what it is oh i can relate i've been doing it since i was young many moons ago it sort of morphed into patterns and musical steps now but still counting numerically yeah i know mine is fours always in fours one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four and i always try and end on a four or end on an even number so for instance let me walk you through this so i'm on the second story in my house right so we have stairs now they're like the the u-shaped stairs you know like it goes halfway up bends and then comes up half so i know how to approach it so when i'm going upstairs before i hit the stairs i have to count one step go a two step go three step so that the first step i take is four because then i count one two three four one two three and then on the four i end on the little plateau where i then turn walk four little steps then one two three four one two three four and at the top of the second story on the fourth step it's weird but that's just that's just how it goes thanks for sharing that little tidbit of your life still watching your vids okay that's good thanks i hope you're still watching i can't tell if this i'm trying not to say too much just to make sure there's nothing personal i only just went to the p.o box this is dated october 2019 a year and a half ago that's why i was like okay well they say they're still watching but it's been a year and a half now so who really knows because they mentioned in their article like watching your new grind with destiny 2. and i was like what what the only game i'm actually excited for is cyberpunk 2077 oh ho ho no oh ho ho no no oh i don't know your name that's their name so your guess is as good as mine uh but i am so sorry the date is 9th of october 2019. i'm writing to mr frood i'm so excited to play cyberpunk 2077 well fruit from the future dude woof [Music] you can never go wrong with games developed and published by cd projekt red if he keeps digging he'll end up in china is it you're something worried you're next you're you're not you're new you're you've is it you've something you've met in a year and a half this is gonna be like the zodiac the zodiac um whatever puzzles whatever those things are which actually one of them just got solved which was crazy but i digress oh oh oh wait it is we've met i can't figure out the rest of it but it's because his name is raul because it shows on the letter that i ripped my bad but i met him at my gym uh where i used to live if that's the guy i'm thinking of and i'm pretty sure it is yo okay it's all coming together because it's going to say the the address on this was pretty close to where i used to live before we got some more mail here we can always open up some letters or like that you guys want to send me stuff um we can always open that up again you know this is pretty free form uh so i guess i'll just end this real quick with uh some dialogue about uh among us and what happened on the channel because it's no secret so let's just backtrack a little bit channel ironically isn't about its worst place it's ever been um the year is 2020 the month is august things aren't looking good however ironically mentally i'm in the best place with my channel which doesn't make sense but it's because i was literally having to come i was coming to terms with the fact that that's where the channel was there's no point in stressing about it every day finally making some time for myself outside of my job and it was weird like the channel wasn't doing great but it didn't devastate me like it normally did i was like this is okay we'll figure it out whatever it is what it is then among this comes along and blows up i am going i'm going in i'm gonna mega in as you guys know for like 40 45 days straight i only uploaded among us which might not sound weird but look back on my channel aside from the very beginning i've never uploaded something so exclusively to the channel i'm a variety channel you know i i variety is the spice of my life so this was weird but i was like we're gonna see what happens when we only play this right when people know what to expect and uh spoilers it went really well we were averaging at least through the month of september at least a million views per video we were averaging a hundred thousand before and in that one month i gained i think 400 000 subscribers is ridiculous so it was crazy and it was awesome and we were having tons of fun me and my friend group and it was great you know we all got to play and people like the dynamics but the problem is and here all kind of comes is the nature of among us because you need a group of realistically about 10 people right but with my friend group especially the extended dream team it's really hard to get everybody together so that was a challenge but then on top of that what ended up happening was and i won't say people but some of the people in the group started taking things a little too seriously or couldn't separate the game from reality and i don't blame them i mean the whole game is literally trying to like deceive your friends lie to them gaslight them so some people you know when the round ended okay that was that round haha we're back we're friends let's do a new one and then some people just carry that with them understandable a lot of people would do it so what that did was it created some strife in our friend group and so a lot of people are just like you know what i'm just not going to play i was like i respect that it's for the best like i don't want this game to become a thing that like comes in between us so that happened and then became a little bit harder to make among us content so then i was like okay i'll find some new people to make a new group but then every video started a little less better than the last and every comment is just where's x where's why play with your old group and it's like i would if it could but understandably they're all burnt out or they don't want to play and for a lot of them for me why i didn't get burnt out is the only time i played among this was when we recorded sessions every couple days every week so i mean still to this day i only have like 50 hours in game which considering all the content i made it's understandable like literally the only time i play was when i recorded with my friends a lot of the other people that would grind with their other friends or on their streams with other people but they got really tired over really fast so fast forward to all that on top of that i'm seeing a little bit of a decline it's harder to do stuff with my friends make those games happen and then on top of that like i said i'm just a i need variety and it was driving me crazy and so i started up on a little variety and then honestly it looked like on my channel like among us was going down i thought the craze was going down so early august is where i started to pull back a little bit mid-august well screw me who realized that uh it'd still be going strong until about late november early december and it's petered out a decent bit but i called that wrong um and then interest just grew less and less on the channel and then i wanted to return what it was what i was normally doing because the i never wanted to just become an among us channel right i don't know it um it really started stressing me out uh the numbers go mentally it's like the channel is doing the best it has ever done like it my channel went viral there and my channel hasn't really done something like that before but my mentor was in the dumpster it was so strange you would think that seeing every video get like a million now would be like but it's this weird thing that youtube does with you and numbers and analytics i even went into it knowing what might happen and trying to prepare myself but i couldn't like i would seen among this video get 700 000 views and i'm like this is it like what's wrong this isn't doing well right now if a video got 700 thousand views i'd be like oh my god that's incredible that's nuts but it would get to the point where like you get this new high and both like figuratively and metaphorically and it's like oh like i had to chase this or now this is the bare minimum and now i'm raising the bar even when i knew it was all only going to last a little bit but i saw this like flash like i kept comparing myself and i was doing really bad stuff like i said mentally to myself like i was thinking okay if somebody else had the success right now they would be able to catch this lightning in the bottle run with it and grow it because if you look now on the channel we're literally like right back to where we were before i'm on this it didn't have that lasting effect i was hoping it would and i was just so upset with myself because i was like man if somebody else was doing like i bet they would run and then they could turn this into this and they would only keep growing and growing exponential and it's just like you can never settle and i keep moving the goal posts for myself and a lot of therapy sessions and it doesn't help that it was a game where you guys fight your friends and so then my friends were getting upset and so then when we were playing among us i was trying to play but at the same time i'm thinking is so-and-so having fun uh am i not being am i being fair to this person i need to worry about this person's quiet is something wrong a message like i got a message privately from this person okay well they okay they're leaving because of this and then it just became it and then on top of that it's just become harder to get sessions and not as many people are into it and then we did modded among us finally with the old group and that was so much fun it was hilarious but then so many people were like this is boring go back to the old ones we want to see normal but it's like bro we did that this is fun so we're looking to do more modded among us i guess there's really not a point to this whole rant i guess my whole point is um it was taxing um what it did to the channel for that short period was incredible but it's funny september we gained 400 000 subscribers and since pretty much the beginning of october to this date gross i've lost 7 000 subscribers i think even a little bit more so at one point we hit like a little over 2.3 million subscribers i'm now at 2.29 i've been there like we're literally just slowly losing subs because people where's the among us whatever so it was a blessing and a curse it was an experiment um i saw what i could do with it and i think part of it is i could have continued with it a lot more easily if it was a game that again didn't require such a large like if it was a solo game like let's say that was my minecraft channel i can do plenty of that i can have fun with that myself i can make it on stream i can i don't know it's just a lot harder to do that with that when you need and my social anxiety and stuff has just been through the roof and then on top of that i didn't everybody was telling me oh you got to play with so-and-so and so and so and then i just got like incredible imposter syndrome and it's like yeah i'm this person that has like two million subs but it feels like nobody knows me and like i don't want to be that guy that's just like hey dude i just don't like to shoot my shot and i respect people that do but that's just not me and it makes me so anxious and i did it once trying to like tweet toast it didn't work and then of course my anxiety just took over and i'm like oh my gosh everybody that's so embarrassing i never played with other people i never diversified and that was the thing it's like the perfect game for networking but oh thinking about it oh been it's been an interesting past couple months among us will still be here every now and then it especially depends on when we can get group sessions it's going to be very similar like trouble in terrace town i always want to keep that around on the channel it's just a matter of when can we get people together for this stuff to get content for it yeah i promise uh whatever we're gonna call this um it's not gonna involve this stuff really it'll be more lighthearted i swear it'll be spins and and things i don't know any some parts of it might be games approaching might be irl stuff you know all that kind of good stuff but i just want something creatively to pursue on this channel that feels a little more personal like we're connecting a little bit more um and then i got that new minecraft channel which is new creative endeavor and i'm working on some other projects outside of youtube so creatively i'm feeling pretty inspired right now which is good because among us didn't inspire me creatively it was successful but they'll just like it didn't light a fire under me which is also why i was upset with myself because i was like you know i imagine myself two years before like 2018 mr fruit if this happened to him he would have run with it he would have been so much better but now i feel jaded and burnt out and then this comes at this time and it's a blessing and a curse because it's incredible what it's doing but at the same time i feel so bad because i just feel like i can't put myself into this right now so yeah sorry anyway uh that's this variety thing it's the content so leave some suggestions down below feel free to tweet them at me when we figure out a series name too we can make it so that you can comment or tweet at me with a suggestion and then the hashtag to make it a lot easier to see and then i'll i'll write them up there and we'll have fun with it and then i'll try and write usernames too if i remember when i write them down um but that's this thing thanks for watching lots of rambling that's what i do thanks for supporting me love you have yourselves a fantastic sunday there should also be a new podcast
