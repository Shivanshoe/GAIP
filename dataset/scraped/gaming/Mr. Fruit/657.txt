hi 80 hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome to a Minecraft noobs first hardcore world can I survive out in the wilderness equipped with barely any knowledge I don't know but this sounds like a lot of fun to me so join me together as we embark on this quest what's our end game I'm not sure first step is to just make a life and not die I'll gauge the interest for the series on this channel if you do enjoy this be sure to like and comment down below worst case it'll either just go on the second channel as a let's play or I'm simultaneously live-streaming the series as I upload to YouTube so I could just finish the let's play over there there's a link down below if you want to follow along when I go live and play additionally I'm sure I'll get questions about the resource packed and the shaders I'll put all that in a description box below I used to play casually like literally an alpha and then we did our little series and the realms a while ago but that was that didn't count we got nothing done and everyone else made stuff pretty much for me so I'm gonna have to figure this out on my own without dying otherwise we lose the entire world hence you know hardcore right however the nice thing of having live chat is that if I need to ask for advice I will but that's it otherwise try not to spoil anything our back backseat step one is just stabilize and get somewhere where I don't die and then after that we'll look in the cooler stuff if we can't like farms or literally just like the the goal right now is don't die forehead so that's where we're trying to we're gonna create a new world a whole new world we're gonna name this one help me and we're gonna lock this too hardcore it is locked at the hardest difficulty and one life only we're not gonna mess with any of a seat options it's completely random hawk o new world on an adventure we embark by the way I did stall install shaders and a resource pack guess what I like them if you don't too bad it is what it is all that matters is I'm happy and this makes me happy it's so pretty and we'll get this we are playing on the newest on 15.2 whatever which means there's bees ah but I have no idea what to do with them I know they can make like honey and stuff they got a little stinger in there but there's a horse already all this is going well I can tame the horse I don't remember how but we'll figure that out there's more bees there's the hive ok great again don't know is that a fox or a wolf oh my goodness I feel like what's what's that Disney Princess that just a little foxes I think baby fox oh yeah I don't know what to do yet okay but okay we got wildlife everywhere I like sing and all the animals come to me I feel like that right now and we're on the edge of a biome okay we got snowy stuff over there honestly the layout right here this is good I think we can settle here we're close to a forest thing stuff out there something out there we got another biome but it's nice flat we can see what we're doing wait a minute wait a minute is that smoke can't tell if that smoke or the clouds I'm pretty sure that's smoke so it could be a village now this is all exciting but mr. fruit you hardly know what you're doing let's get the basics first before we're in trouble so give me a second make sure there's not a bee hive hearing it upset the locals I do know this much I do know how to make a crafting table hardly but I do know that and I know how why isn't it showing like me destroying the blocks I don't know whatever and can I even reach that I can't uh-huh whoa what the oh I forgot I can zoom it is smoke big brain me okay when you're a village this is great this is great this is fantastic okay remember your training mr. fruit mm-hmm this isn't my first rodeo haha ok crafting table step one done step one of not dying is a go we're gonna kind of stay next to the bees I am deck queen day on my faithful servants we'll get some sticks for now ok we need we need a pickaxe mm-hmm an ax sure we don't need a hoe right no I'll take a shovel I feel like that's not that important I'll get enough actually I don't need I can just will make cobblestone after this ok I forget the hotkeys to to like stack stuff Oh figure that out I'm not gonna knock down the bee tree yet we're gonna let them do their thing wait wait wait ok I am gonna need food here I'm gonna need meat I need meat because we are we're gonna we're gonna starve so we've got little I said a little baby sheep or a pig and a baby pig I don't know we got a cow over there we have plenty of livestock it just depends on who I want to kill yes I remembered that swords are important I think we're doing fine I think we're doing great guys we also need to make a temporary shelter and then remember how to make a bed for nighttime cuz that's probably gonna be important so many willfox is around here well hey guys little fellas we're gonna be the bestest of friends just you wait imma tamed them all I'm gonna have a little little village with me it's gonna be lovely what the heck break it okay okay I can't reach that one ah but floating trees re not in my realm I think I need cobblestone now I need to make isn't there a crafting book there is okay back in my day you had to look up the Wikipedia how do I make a campfire apparently that's a new thing we can cook on that which we could also just cook in a furnace but we'll get there when we get there should I just there's a little hole over here it's gonna say we can just dig down but this work oh look at this ha ha okay oh is this a pickaxe yes yes it is okay fantastic the water - Wow looks so nice welcome to the Stone Age I certainly feel like I'm in one I made an achievement nurse alright no an advancement Wow okay so I just need to grab all this stuff we'll make some cobblestone tools I'll be less of a pleb I'm moving up in the world this is good this is good this is coal right I have a feelings gonna get dark soon day one is gonna be the hardest no doubt mmm for sure I just need to get somewhere where creepers can't immediately kill me and ideally I make a bed I need to figure out how to make a bed real quick I think I need wool so I can sleep through the night that would be that would be preferable here we can we can go out and fight the darkness at one point but right now miss me with that you know I'm saying let's go make a furnace wait don't I have enough to make a furnace why wouldn't tell me that I know how to hello piggy I'm getting awfully hungry oh my first murder ah shall go down into the record books oh wait oh

just giving them a way to come up to hmm yeah whatever no regrets ooh it's kind of spooky down here listen I'm not really ready to go into the dark below just yet into the abyss I like it where it's nice and safe above ground during the day exclusive exclusively during the day oh but wait a second I think this connects or it's something I don't know grab some coal though this isn't too dangerous listen dude I'm like I'm like Bilbo Baggins bro I'm fine staying home no little hobbit hole I have debated we might make the Shia that sounds nice cool house in the hillside we need a temporary base of operations of course but by temporary base of operations I mean I'm just commandeering these these villagers houses okay why did it seem like there was light flooding in here but now there's new will just keep getting callous tone I I need to get iron armor I think as soon as possible that's a must and then some iron tools off all right it's kinda sound like we're going spelunking whether or not I want to I'm kind of convincing myself of it as I speak so bro I got a key like I don't like this just like no you know I'm saying there's one day I'm just gonna forget about that and we're all dead it's how this village lost Bob last week they told me about him rest and Pepe Bob they say you're the best of them we miss you dearly McGarity pills these guys was this thing that Hank set up is that wheat not a hey bill the heck it is why would they you thought you could sneak what wait what the floods give me that you thought you could sneak one by me huh yeah did ya now today a bale is just like holed wheat right I mean that's we can break them down for more wheat but like that's oh yeah so we can sure why not our little dungeon is gonna be next to the the Bell Gong thing with that guy's wheat farm go oh it's over there or is it what I'm so turned around okay but here this is so base of operations let's go ahead and set up hello fudge was that no thank you all monka I think it's just the cave saying hello in its native tongue a flattered thanks hey hi hi but let's not you don't see him that's just not bro oh wait a minute I think there's stuff about that I shouldn't break that okay I'm not going into the dungeon yet we're gonna wait for day time actually wait now wouldn't it be smart just to do it nighttime because no matter what there's gonna be bit creepy crawlies down there right so might as well not with you havin fun but you're free oh my god I didn't know oh I'm stuck again or maybe I'm not yeah we're don't I wonder if that does something got it right maybe it calls the gaulan or something and I was this day almost we're going into day three it's going well Oh what is this thing repair and disenchant I don't even know these guys are like a couple a couple evolutionary ages ahead of me I tell you what man a lot of pumpkins lot of pumpkins yo wait yo what's up my dude yeah you said neck oh we can make some cake you okay now we run back to the village they're coming they're coming any second now I can smell your bar but first we grab some of these I love me some berries okay III I'm gonna talk about to fly being black and blue make the careers of this guy aye aye you're right dude yeah I'd get inside if I were you what oh the double I love the added protection don't mind if I do okay so far I feel like we're doing alright I haven't needed any help I'm alive and well relatively speaking the fun part comes ie the part where I'm probably going to die because we're headed into the dark below into the depths the creeps a little spider over there move bro I almost just got yeet it off a cliff by an arrow imagine if that's how it ended oh there it is oh god I got TIG they were out of me oh oh so we're doing this we're doing it oh fudge Oh eat the chicken eat the chicken Oh what the podge I need armor alright yeah yeah we got to go down below I can't rest on my laurels any longer Can I grab that arrow no okay not very resourceful of me but where we going where we at it's right over here right here we are here we go I mean we just bring BOTS no wait no there that'll signal it kind of I guess there we go okay let me make a chest so I can free ups why do I even have yes I was gonna say I should have but I need a crafting table well I guess I need a crafting table anyway okay and then a little bit of an bada-bing bada-boom I'm gonna make two chests because I do know that stacking two gives you an extra big one uh-huh I remember that five hundred IQ give me a second okay so put that what okay ah okay now we need to stock up on some food ideally we're gonna keep the steaks okay I think I'm supposed to cook potatoes but I'm gonna keep all the food on me rinkie this I don't need this I'll keep the bread keep the planks I mean the thing too is like well don't die with it well if I die anyway I'm dead rewrites like what's the not a lot there to it we don't need the rod I should cook the chicken I should cook this stuff before I go we're gonna cook this stuff where I go I shouldn't need a wooden shovel actually I'm gonna say that and then watch me be like man I wish I had a wooden shovel right now this is where the scary part comes [Music]
