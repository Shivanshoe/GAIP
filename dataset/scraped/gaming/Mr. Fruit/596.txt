hi ad hope you won my name's mr. fruit and welcome to name Angela there's some I don't know the announcer was really excited when he said it so I kind of wanted to imitate that it's a brand new free-to-play game on the Nintendo switch and I've had my eyes on it because it seems an e it seems ridiculous and it seems we're right up my alley now what the heck is this game well it's a online battle arena there's like a battle royale mode where it's you versus everyone but then also a team-based mode and the thing about the battle royale though is I believe you get more in than one life at a cool thing though is there's ways to customize your character and play the game obviously there's a card system which appears to be like a loadout where you can bring in some passive buffs I haven't unlocked anything I've been played yet then you can change your weapon type and changing the weapon type changes your kit so for instance this katana gives me 300 health 100 movement speed and then certain skills to use in the game but I could change to the skate hammer which gives me more health a little less movement speed and different abilities seeing as I haven't played yet we're just commutes the katana so without further delay let's try this out I'm honestly pretty psyched we're gonna do a quick battle jump right into about around alright ladies and gentlemen let's prepare look at our contestants today we've go a Archer over a Dragon Emperor now rest Tyrus I'm the SBM and you know I'm you love him through oh I'm nervous all again this map I love wna Academy thanks for having me [Applause] hey hi how are you okay oh we're just ok we're hopping into it now the unfortunate part is your boy is gonna have to skirt hit him with some gumballs Oh God ok what is happening I'm stuck I'm pairing somebody ok what the fudge is going on here I think it's some good old Nintendo online matchmaking at its finest someone just stole my kill and I'm dying good go oh my god but I'm like going on ninja jutsu on these guys ok everyone's preoccupied so I'm gonna hit this drone and completely fail and I'm actually dead ok so I'm not crazy you can respawn ok so it's good to know it's more like a free-for-all Rumble kind of match thing here skirt now bottom life you're gonna see I have some pips my 5 up them currently look at that juggle you want to get more because if you get eight or something like that you can make an even bigger weapon which to do did more damage and has better range so you have to go around killing these apples skirt oh oh god that was almost like super-sick and then it wasn't you know I'm saying oh okay oh god the fart get me out here oh my god stuck in a gumbo Wow okay everybody's already a pro of this game evidently the fudge that's fine though oh you like that well teleportation ninjutsu or something oh and I actually do have my actual ninjutsu as you can see here if I press Y here in a second oh fudge I didn't mean to press that button oh gosh dang it okay and now I'm just in the thick of it I'm a daddy I'm gonna I'm gonna run away yo is this a guy hiding no it's not because I can do this haha they'll never know except that person saw me doing it so they actually know exactly oh I won the Perry's I'm the greatest that there ever was look at me continuously winning these Perry's hmm oh my god mr. farrar you do it oh I got an e pawn or whatever the fudge that is Oscar oh I can craft a big weapon yes look at the size of this thing now watch this blow my bubble at you you just don't care apparently but that's totally fine okay when the parry battle that's another two turns out I'm the God okay now run away real quick here run away alright what do you want huh oh holy hackers yeah trying to explain this and do all this is difficult let me tell you that much okay but home get another pip we're doing great I can just wall run I haven't done that at all screw it'll give me go oh shoot there's a giant one now give me this gah gah gah gah oh they're all just big ones now okay that means most people are gonna start to get some big weapons and I'm not okay with that quite frankly okay check this out I'm gonna steal this kill I'm just gonna I'll activate this upon Oh God ah I'm stuck okay here I go and skirt oh I missed okay what I'm coming in oh [ __ ] come here God so weak I keep getting bullied I'm stuck in midair I'm frozen you've been hit by you've been struck by a smooth I'm in second so far the games almost over time is of the essence skirt Boosh ah okay let me get a final kill here I just keep getting bullied win the parry if I can oh my god just insane midair battles wait you're so weak where'd they go ah fudge second place but I guess I should take that look everyone else in this game actually has played the game before it but I haven't so haha I was not the epon master oh wait so you can get bonus points like Mario Party oh shoot I'm surprised you didn't screw me over I'll take second it mission accomplished cool what did I do I don't know what any of this does oh I got a corn gum okay so the green wow there's a lot of stuff here alright I totally know what I'm doing I tell you what though that is a genuine clown fiesta and I'm here for its same one of the equipment in Jurgen will be consumed per battle what does that mean I don't know I don't have a choice I'm just gonna click okay ladies and gentlemen welcome to the same map oh I'm surprised it's the same one all the trailers from stuff have you like fighting in a city so I thought that's what it would be like cuz there's more verticality I guess I couldn't run up on the walls doesn't really seem to be a point I am gonna go straight in on you dude oh fudge oh oh okay oh you want to play this game okay well you are playing it exceptionally well I still can't move okay see what are we that entire time I was I was stunned so clearly I need okay yeah so that was embarrassing like I don't even know what exactly I did wrong I just know I have clearly everything that's the answer okay I got I got one here I feel like there should be a sprint button but there's an there's old - so I'm in close enough right I need to try and get a big weapon as soon as possible though that seems like the play and anyone not doing it is a fool fool of a took out give me this give me this Apple no one's going for this don't mind if I do okay now check this out go underground Oh stunned oh but now I'm attacking and now I'm on the offensive did I get a kill I did get a kill okay hold on Oh wha just got destroyed by a gum dragon I have mine too though so you know I'm about to hit him with it can i oh I can do my big weapon okay crap that big corn nope no don't turn into a fencepost nope craft the weapon oh my god that is one okay here we go to record or skirt okay now I'm trying to I'm trying to get to this person before someone can just do my kill okay why aren't I hitting him what what is hat wait what I just don't maybe this all makes more sense with playtime but boy oh boy am i confused I'm just gonna whack this thing someone respond over here so I'm gonna take advantage of them I guess I'm just gonna go ahead and go underground a Boosh surprise sucker okay we parried each other now I'm just just joining that guy okay so it seems like it's wise you get the first hit and then survive like the parry or whatever the Fletch goes on then you're like good to go oh you know what I haven't done yet sure I can like turbo boost and evidently just completely miss the opponent okay I broke him hit both his spirit oh and I won the parry now summon a dragon who Bruges oh he can't escape he's trying that's so funny he was running everywhere on destroying this guy you're in the wrong oh oh fudge okay but see I messed up the parry but I won that one yes goosh goosh I gotta win the next one oh fudge I didn't okay win that one I did yes okay I think I'm starting to get the hang of this now check this out alright come on come at me what'd you just do I don't know oh oh fudge do you not regen health I don't I don't think you do oh can i regen health from killing these things survey says yep near near Oh God alright I don't want any of this but wait okay hold on I'm gonna drag in or or I'll just die okay I'm in first just what I thought I had no idea what I was doing turns out I knew the whole time all right I'm gonna drag in that guy cuz he's already weak give me that free kill yes upon that's exactly what I was going for that entire time clash I want it because I'm the best eeep on again hold up wait oh wait I just I was in first I got two more kills oh I'm at first I'm in first but now I have to win the Mario the Mario Party round Oh No yes drone destroyer that's a good start yes yes yes keep on master bonus yes wait a second oh my gosh ladies and gentlemen I can't first please I keep getting whatever all this is but I have no idea what any of it means oh so when I that's what it is so you only get one use of those different colored bats now as far as I can tell they're not different at all they would have just looked different I don't know why it would be consumable then not a single clue but we go again okay I wonder maybe the maps aren't like rotation or something or I'm just unlucky and getting the same whenever Hey yeah what's up he's what I dunno apparently when I was just getting like infinitely stunned it was courtesy of this gun so I can blame this watch this when I shoot it sends out a little ectric shock that destroys people Lu that he's just like infinitely stunned and he's already dead this gut feels ridiculous cuz I don't even know like he's probably like how the fudge do I avoid that well here's the secret bro I have no idea I'm gonna throw some COO night this guy though wait okay okay why am i why am I still a poop I'm literally a poop the fudge is going on here win okay I won the parry and I'm just gonna whack him okay but it's not working so instead I'm gonna use my ability boom eeep on ah but I didn't get I was trying to get that drone the whole time but this pleb over here checks out oh okay okay I guess I'm dead okay mr. fruity needs it you really need to start destroying some drones here come on I'm trying Boosh I see why I get extra health oh I text so slowly okay that dudes just run hey get back here huh do you want skirt good booze I don't even know where you went there he is ah he won't get stunned all right fine you want to play hardball come on come over here I dare you I'm just gonna hit this drone though so joke's on you I got it I got it okay but now I'm stunned and oh I thought I wanted the parry but I guess I didn't Oh My look at that damage though oh oh okay mr. fruit he has a career correction okay wait what the fudge is what I purposefully didn't use my old because I didn't think I had to but then I died I guess whenever they activate their alt they get health back because like I was destroying them and then I was getting destroyed okay this guy didn't finish off the drone so don't mind if I do thank you very much oh and I get a craft my big weapon oh look at the size a test saying I'm gonna use my rocket Oh inbound wait who's hitting me ah ah yes okay I want I won the clash now I'm gonna destroy this look at how big this thing is use my ability stun dude this is insane I would just like to shot this dude practically yeah via cured there's practically but we're killing this okay I like this this is my style you know complete overkill but wash wash wash wash wash wash wash but when the clash I did go ahead and stun you go boos epon I don't know what that is I don't what don't where it means but I do know that well I quite enjoy it okay let me throw some kunai your way get a home right after you and you evidently don't care at all I'm gonna actually clean up both of these wait ah fudge okay let me know hold on hold on hey let's let's be mature about this use my kunai go booge buh-booge ass okay and then use this zoom oh but I don't have any stamina ah okay here's what I'll do oh god they keep interrupting my stuff I hit harden everything but if I get interrupted is kind of GG notice me did I get that kill I did oh no I got killed classic misunderstanding okay whack this real quick oh we're saying wait it what is this guy doing I don't know where did he go oh I'll take that free little kill wait hold on let me let me let me boost let me use my rocket tell me I'm gonna get this kill tell me I get this kill I don't know but I'm first yeah but I gotta win the game around I need to win the gamba okay that's good we all tied that's that's clutch okay keep on Nestor oh and just like that I got phoned fudge that is heartbreaking but this game certainly is it that was actually a lot of fun it took me after kind of the first game and then a little bit in the second to finally like get a grasp on what the heck I was doing and the fact to that there's so many different weapon art types that change how you play that's sick hopefully you guys clicked on this video and then watched it and enjoyed it because if so I'd like to do some more so with that said I want to think often much for watching happens those fantastic day I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
