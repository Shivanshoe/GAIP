wait a second shouldn't you combine them no not yet because i get more value out of them summoning two different ones right now five head okay wait question does my gold carry over probably not right all right well then um what did we what [Music] the cup what the gushing clementines versus the milky pants i know um yeah i think we win this by a mile chief you're just gonna see its magnificence unfold in front of your eyes ah yes not even close that's what we like to see hey let's go your two animals unlocked yup what is this some one one one dirty wrap for the opponent that betrays him what does that even mean give an animal plus three impulsive until the end of battle oh another honeybee's good we're gonna throw yeah i'm really curious as to what this does but in the for the time being wait i can actually make this work should i do this yeah give a reign of friend plus four plus two i want to see what the fudge's rat thing does this could throw it for me but you know what you can do love what i'm seeing right now i think the rats gonna bone me somehow it seems like a bait i think i fell for it the edible doggies leave them alone okay wait wait don't auto play i need to see what the fudge is about to happen ah okay so someone won one dirty rat friend that had attacks deal it won damage oh that's not bad ah wait how did how'd you not die i didn't look at your health oh wait no but then that that's kind of bad ah no i think we win ah cause then he's gonna hurt him and then and then the b uh huh we did it wait um well played okay down to the wire you know what i freaking like let's freaking do it dude and you know what when he dies ba that's right honeybees this works right trying to do the math here i don't know you know what i don't care anymore to battle my insect army uh stupid stupid friend summon oh wait ah you've betrayed me yet again dirty rat yeah this isn't even gonna be a close one nice try but you can't hang with the big guys here okay bop yep and then the dirty rat yep they ain't gonna get anywhere near my horsey my pony is it a point it's a horsey let's go sheesh [Music] friend ahead faints gain melon armor and plus two attack wait he could get plus five attack and two melon armors i doubt it stacks but this is good this give to random man i mean that's not bad oh way wait i want to know what kind of dirty rat it's going to spawn summon one one dirty wrap for the opponent okay surely this dirty rat will do more damage though you got to think right bison in turn game plus two plus two if there's at least one level three friend well that's well there could be but see i'm going for a summon thing here these are cool but you know it's it doesn't you know it's that's not what we're going for do they have i don't think they have two honeybees but that's okay because now i have doggo okay the gushing clementines versus the crisp craters um what is this a tank for five oh what so you just are always doing 13 damage wait bone attack is so much better than i thought what jesus christ what okay well i'm doing bone attack every time then what am i doing over here okay summon that some of that bada bing bada boom give me that wait wait wait wait that was so underwhelming this man had like 80 million attack on everything brenda head attacks game plus two and plus two well we could get you to six seven easily okay i think i gave him honey but other than that i think um we're just not stat heavy sorry rat um do we go spooder i mean maybe spooder right now and then just give you guys this give you guys that there's there's a lot of layers of strategy here and frankly i could see myself playing this forever oh my level three oh no and there goes my strat just just just don't just don't look just don't hard for my doggo to pop off if my doggo does not exist what is that wait that's like what i want to do how's he getting that cool stuff what the fudge yeah if i was as lucky as you dude i'd be killing it too okay i'm upgrading doggo even at this point it's it's very clear doggo is not a carry however i'm gonna kill the ant no i forgot it's random ah okay well this gives me free gold fudge well now he's got a beefy cricket i need something to synergize what is in the turn give right most friend right most friend so the one in the front is that what you're trying plus two and plus two give an animal plus two and plus two okay that's what i'm saying buddy okay so the doggo has to go in the front unfortunately but maybe we sack a couple of rounds how many can i sack one okay i can only sack one round but then um so maybe hippo like just go back to our hippo plan this is clearly this is falling apart this that's what's happening right now this is no bueno oh duh wait a second this is nuts what the [ __ ] i think we just take all that okay let's go baby the hoot and chunks what oh my god oh my sweet okay well this is a fat oh isn't even gonna be close what whoa what's it dude everyone else has what the i was like oh this is big brain synergy look at that oh my the doggo is not enough for this okay doggo was a trap i repeat doggo was a trap i was focused on a dog he he's not a hyper carry huh okay monkey you were a bait and uh we're gonna do that and then i'm gonna do this and then uh we're gonna level you up we're gonna level you up no i can't afford anything else so oh god he's gonna poop on me how's he got a cool background the cockadoodle doodle what is this someone a five five box with splash attack that's so sad um oh my oh he's got a dog hold see his doggo the boot is seven fourteen hot mine's seven seven huh with garlic armor and it's level two he gets plus oh this isn't even close all right well just screw me now this is right just terrible rolls you know where my dog goes what the fudge is the draft doing ah not the bus ah what whoa i just got ran over by a bus he didn't he didn't need anything but a boss talk about a road kill okay okay i'm breaking the game right here you ready for this give all friends it i'm practically about to level up look at this get extra gold while the lob level up this is incredible we're the warmest pants mr fruit you're so funny all right who who we got uh the suspicious celts you're done for kid or are you wait am i done fall wait i'm done for fudge really ah well okay now think about this i could put three down because if i combine we get plus two plus two but if i wait we get plus three plus three now granted it's on a whole bunch of things i don't care about so that would be the argument for a lot a lot of things we're just we're gonna do this first and then i'm gonna roll oh my god what is this what the fudge can i get something else besides pigs and fish all right well whatever now we get put wait what when the fish levels up i thought it meant when oh no i didn't tell you i was trying to swap the fish i was trying to s this one's over boys can we just fast forward here i already know the outcome yep just okay this is we can recover from this i know what you're thinking how well trying to figure that out too but look at this copy health from friend to head we could get six health thinking give the two friends behind plus one plus one yeah [Music] okay see we're gonna do this we're gonna do this we're gonna combine okay i really want that kangaroo cell gaining extra two gold useless no what's your synergy right now mr fruit uh i don't know it just gives me fishes and pigs he's got fishes and pics you leave my sassy crab alone ah no okay uh oh my god we won no we didn't melanoma am i not gonna get one round one what the fudge am i supposed to do it only gives me fish and pigs i don't even have something to like respawn i guess i have this i think i just sell this let's be honest like what are we doing here okay i need to put you ahead of you this this we're gonna put this here oh wait i could force a faint here whatever you know the fish is going to carry me just wait show it to me you will not get your heart off what is wait wait wait wait what we might win this but it's not going to be pretty do we win this i think we win this no no we don't do we i am still uns um uh it is i think we might win this give me a good one give me a good one okay i'll take it but it doesn't i think we won or we draw i think we won holy okay okay all right there we go baby not victoryless [Music] oh i need a whale now i remember and then wait there might be something to this give me one moment your garbage [Music] and who do i want to buff permanently die okay yes yes back there yes i want to make sure i have a room for you yes and then this should guarantee it sees three attacks oh my god okay we're gonna we're gonna sell that yes that needs to swallow this so see we're get we're gonna eat it and it's gonna spawn two rams but we can't fit the rams but maybe that's okay never say never it's gonna come together wait for it let me break this down for you what does this do again okay well that that is okay i don't know if we win this not gonna worry about it though uh so someone won and then we get that yup and then boom you're dead melon armor unlucky whole hole what okay catch okay bop but then check this bop oh no he's dead but wait and then baba and then boom and then shh wait what why didn't it spawn two oh oh my god it's even better than i remember bop buff but wait boom papa oh my god we lost i lost to another level two meat bone fish a dodo bird why couldn't i find something like that earlier [Music] what okay this is already exponentially better because i don't see a pig and i don't see a fish see we're gonna we're gonna do this i'm gonna buy this and we're gonna put you in we're gonna re-roll oh my what this is a joke whatever dude you know what sure for the memes uh very uncertain piggies i'm very uncertain about this uh uh we lose okay great now let's just get this over with speed this up don't want to see it yup no i get it i get it yeah okay boom duck boom duck boom duck oh my god this is fine i gotta wait until there's something good in the shop i'm selling like crazy it's gonna be sick i'm probably gonna lose i don't i don't wanna just just get and we lost another duck my joke do you is that what i am buy a duck why not i'm just going to assume i i lost again all right oh not even remotely close okay what is this okay i'm gonna re-roll and it's gonna be three perfect animals so uh you know what screw up and screw you perfect animals hate my life what at what point were they gonna give me something to defend myself with just freaking like just freaking speed up oh my god we actually died are you kidding me okay freeze freeze re-roll okay this is actually kind of nuts so we're gonna sell give it to the elephant oh my god okay wait a second we're gonna buy this we're gonna buy this we're gonna buy this [Music] this oh my god okay we're gonna sell this and then i'm gonna put this in here because see before he attacks he's gonna deal damage to this which hurts this which will then give this above and then this thing is gonna be so big it's gonna hurt everybody else or even better i could do this back to this back to this make him thank you so every time he attacks back into that and then that think about it come on it took the game five rounds or something to give me something but i won't squander the opportunity this guy's gonna get pooped on i actually don't know okay but check this oh no boom buffed next okay unfortunate boom buffed and then he's gonna hurt a buff again and then guess what boom ah random damage boom ah random damage and then boom sheesh there we go okay okay that's what one win baby if you lost last bat okay that's never gonna happen because if i lose i'm done i think we're definitely selling this dude now we could do this and then badgers an ultimate last play and even if it comes down to a single one and we lose his death throw will ensure we we tie it's just so hard to pass up this six six crown okay we could we can just do the crap oh uh yeah we can give somebody bone attack maybe crab just to guarantee he kills whatever is left this is one beefy what do you got um chunky swimmers wait he he's doing the wait but that's not fair that's my thing how is his dog so big what has his dog been eating okay wait this is big though oh he's so dead though it doesn't even matter wait but the death throws no we're fine oh we're so fine and then buff the yup and the the honey badger throw doesn't matter because bop the crap there we go look at that crab sheesh okay give me something go well well well what do we have here [Music] wait what holy jesus so the the the thing i don't know is when i upgrade the elephant what does it do there's only one way to find out do you want damage to two friends behind oh my god this is wait what is this friend summoned give it plus three plus three holy [ __ ] the croc is big just seven damage and usually the last thing in a lineup is like their sweeper i think crocs big come on badger badger badger badger badger badger oh wait sniped that was his whole strat the turkey was gonna plus three all of his summons but the turkey's dead he's got nothing except never ending sheep but that's okay bob and then freaking boosh oh my god watch watch out for this crab oh my this is huge oh hey saxton got booze oh my yeah go ahead go ahead 14 29 crap by the way oh 16 30 keep it going i wish he could attack 1837 crap wait a second wait a second maybe this is the run how come the only runs i do well on are when i lose the first three rounds another elephant i'm gonna i'm gonna upgrade again and then we're gonna roll for maybe better items that's that's a better item and then give somebody else plus one plus one i then think we also get the elephant plus one plus one i feel like this has been our best build yet so if i get pooped on i don't know his crocs gonna snipe my croc yeah yeah that's fine ah oh cat oh he's got melon armor no uh oh it's gonna proc like never oh no we lost no wait oh meat bone we won me wait what what it is garlic no [Music] who can say where the road goes where the days go [Music] only
