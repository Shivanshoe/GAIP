hi everyone my name is mr vroot and welcome back to a dance of fire and ice that's right it's the rhythm game that is deceivingly simple and yet makes me want to break everything within a reasonable distance to myself if i can grab it i want to smash it that's what this game does to me i got past the level i was stuck on and i thought you know what hey i'll do that i'll call it quits but no my ego said nay just like a pony nay sir come hell or hot water soldier i'm gonna beat this i don't know how many worlds there are there's like uh 13 14 15 i don't i don't know but i'm going to beat them all and the journey begins right now so enjoy the video but now we're back now i'm chugging now you know what world eight let's go all right here we go here we go okay all right nothing too crazy oh no oh no skewed loops okay just know that's gonna be the last level so that's right though i don't like the music on this one it's tilting they know what they're doing they're trying to tell me whatever this xylophone nonsense is or hexagons i hate shapes but that's fine i'm a gamer [Music] that was off-beat nonsense oh i hate it here [Music] i hate this [Music] oh no okay oh my quit adding new never mind i'm a gamer they've never had this many levels before the okay [Music] okay i got this i got this oh boy here we go here we go all right the culmination oh my god [Music] okay okay [Music] ah i pressed it oh my god okay okay that's right look i already got a fifth of the down it's going to take me less than 10 attempts [Music] oh my god all right i said less than 10 attempts i meant 30. [Music] hi it's i can't it's too trashed [Music] oh what the why do you change the color on me dude that's the only reason i messed up there are no tempo deltas in this song don't you come in here tell i'm right and i hate everything no tempo i did your mom got him i'm classically trained and friggin pee pee poop i hate that why just show me what i'm gonna do [Music] this is it rob yes this is it i will have you know i beat the level i was stuck on though and so far i have not been nearly as stuck it was that one level dude although it's still very [Music] upsetting i can't even enjoy the song [Music] god i made it farther but now it's a dip completely different part of some and it just it sounds completely different i have to click so much faster and yes it's 69 i get it nice but fudge [Music] it's i don't even know what the music sounds like at that part or what the beat even is because i just see what's in front of me and i'm panicking and it's just so vastly different and it's so much faster it is not worth it no i'm not a quitter [Music] i i can i just hear the song [Music] [Music] doing it no no no no no no no no no no no no as long as i get the loop i need to get the first loop internalize it focus it get it through the third and then we're done ain't staying a chance no more child's game child's play [Music] ah i need to get that down [Music] [Music] easy i told you just let me get the loop once and i'm done whoa oh my god that was easy dude jungle city more like easy city dude and you absolutely know i'm going to world nine i can do the whole thing now i know i can as soon as i said that all clear goes oh my god [Music] easiness is what i'm looking at [Music] oh what the fudge okay i was i did not like that [Music] i did like that music with a little more house bounce feel that music what the fudge [Music] the fudge is gonna make me go blind wait what okay i can already tell you that is going to tilt me here we go yep here comes the tilt okay what just happened that was seven percent okay okay timeout time what uh time time what how did i do this the first time what the fudge am i doing wrong oh my it's because i'm not pressed for jesus christ [Music] okay this is kind of a banger not gonna lie [Music] go go go go [Music] no no no bras fragging dude oh my god and i made it through this is that like three attempts bro i'm on top of the world baby i'm built different my performance is directly indicative of how good the song is confirmed oh my god i just pooped on world nine god everything's gonna not be as good because as it's absolute just slapped [Music] i mean this isn't bad but it's not like [Music] nevermind i'm the best i forgot i'm the best oh [Music] i'm feeling good about this [Music] uh huh oh i take it back [Music] never mind i'm still the best [Music] [Music] okay i messed a little bit that's fine oh okay okay all right i can already tell this is gonna be the tilting part of the last part [Music] holy oh chief jesus christ help me [Music] uh i'm fine i'm fine fine here we go come on banger [Music] okay okay it's it's it's a good one but it's fast jesus christ [Music] okay [Music] it's that part right there messed me up above as well okay a lot faster a lot faster the thing is like you can still pass it if you get like an early note or something but what i found out is that messes you up even more because then i'm out of beat doing it so then i just messed myself up so it's like you because there is a perfect only mode which is just ridiculous but like that's practical you have to play anyway [Music] you can kind of make a recovery but but like see it's way harder if you get an earlier relate on something the zoom out the zoom out that's my john's oh cool that is tricky okay it's so different [Music] okay oh and it just changes right there but i got i got it now okay okay well i thought i had it but apparently i didn't press the button oh okay holy jesus okay [Music] no no no no no what and i messed that up okay [Music] like that like i does take a lot of uh [Music] oh okay i gotta hurt myself okay okay okay okay [Music] i made it but then but then i was just thinking about how the first no no no no [Music] let's go let's go we just had to get past the loops we just had to get past loops let's go yeah [Music] [Music] you
