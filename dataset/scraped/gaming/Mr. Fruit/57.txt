okay thanks you know kind of had a teammate there get him boys light them up okay i'll light them up i'm gonna die oh my god get absolutely embarrassed you dare chase me boy well then mr fruit all you've managed to do is press record post a video and embarrass yourself fantastic hi eddie hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. really really that's how we're okay you know what fine fungo yo heidi hello everybody's fruit welcome back destitute i didn't want to pose in my usual spy anyway so in today's video with trials of osiris the first one just happening we looked at the brand new summoner adapt but what better time than look at the brand new trials weapon introduced this season the brand new scout rifle aisha's embrace it's a void scout rifle with a rapid fire frame fires full auto with deeper arrows faster reload weapon is empty which is important because it's 260 rpm which for a scout rifle is balls fast crazy fast goodness gracious i'm going to be rocking hammer forged rifling for the increased range lord magwell for the increased stability and reload speed triple tap not exactly a pvp role here but this is the only one i got and for the most part we can here's the thing all right regardless what people tell you if i had to like rate gun to perk ratio like as long as you have the gun i would probably say it's like 7 70 30. you know 70 as long as you got the gun you got the gun 30 come from the perks so for the most part you can always get a feel for a gun without needing the gog roll that's what i'm trying to say so we're using triple tap adagio after defeating a target this weapon fires charges or draws more slowing deals increased damage for brief time so i'm interested to see what this looks like in pvp so we're obviously going to be reduced from 260 rpm but frankly that might not be a bad thing and then we're gonna see how much damage we're pumping out and then because it's a trials weapon it has the new origin trait alacrity which will get a show off in rumble and the new pvp origin trait one quiet moment grants increase real speed went out of combat if you're on a targeting adjuster because i'm not really sure what i want to throw on it but it sounds good enough to me i love the look of it frankly and i i actually got it towards the end of the season because i was a little scummy save some iron banner or not iron banner um trials and grams and just kind of got lucky so and you know the drill you put on the flawless and boom it's it's the red and black man looking like darth vader scout ride fly here man i can hear the music actually great question sound off in the comments all right if you were to enter a room and every time you did like like a boss music entrance music would play what would you want your entrance music to be right so let's just imagine you're about to like walk into your classroom you know when you're in school something starts playing what would you play personally i think mine would be genesis by justice if you haven't heard it listen to it the beginning you're gonna oh trust me you'll know i also did not put on any scout perks oops cauldron oh you've got to be kidding me every time i want close quarter maps i don't get them and then sometime i'm like hey i'm going to review a scout rifle cauldron what is this am i a joke do you bungee don't answer that because i already know the answer it's yeah what was wrong with that i'll get to try separate tops i am kind of sad i never got the dyno armor that was pretty cool i know people had mixed feelings but can't change mine anyway black and red it looks sick it fires so fast i can oh my wait look at that oh wow i was gonna say that reload but that's awesome because one quiet moment was activated what is what why what what is happening i can't see my senses they've been diluted oh how what from where guy's going all velcas here with his angles like what if you've never played league you don't understand but if you've played bleak you understand oh my holy jesus i almost think the rpm is a detriment to me it's firing there i said well i've never noticed budget uh dare i say it's firing too fast i don't think i want to fire it full auto because i can't even like completely anticipate when the the shots are i haven't had my hammer i mean again though this is a close quarters map and using the scout this close is frankly disorienting a lot of the time okay and it's it's three of them they're just they're swapping in now like the three stooges i could have had one kill maybe two but no there were three of course there was with impeccable coordination apparently like my goodness oh my god get absolutely embarrassed you dare chase me boy what is shooting me come on show yourself oh hello i have a scout rifle i eat at this range okay how did you i could not see you and you somehow hit me how i just want to know how something's a little saucy that's all i'm gonna say the zoom is not bad for anything that's not this map but you know you you take what you're given if you want to use this gun in pvp you know sometimes you're just going to get a close-quarters map nothing to do about it i'll tell you what there is do about it just don't use this switch weapons uninstall i don't know get creative i won't tell you to live your life how did i i needed one more bullet one more bullet i'm going to say it's it's firing too fast all right i need to i need to pop off with adagio aka just get one kill first off but then i think i'll be able to uh control it a little bit more but that doesn't appear to be happening what what do we what are we doing here huh okay adagio's active let me see that see that's much better that's what but adagio's already got i like really that's that was so fast okay well you have yourself a nice day sir guess i'm just not going to be for ever there's too many of them oh but i got out though fantasy feet oh you like this little angle though oh you're not the only one with angles activated let me in how much damage am i doing i can't see because 61 to the dome ski oh my god i don't actually know how it did it's my normal precision damage oh you know a second 47 that is a significant increase imagine they just gave me widows court though the one time i would want widows court but they didn't why would they there's a kill and that means it's time for me to pop up well i quite liked that oh it's it's see i'm a fan of the slower meteor ones you know okay sorry you have a nice day sir yep what the fudge what what i don't know why i'm using bash instead of shield throw yeah i'm i'm throwing i'm putting shield throw back home whose idea was that mine apparently but come on that's a super okay well guess what hi there get what are you doing over there didn't your mom not uh tell you to not skulk around like a creeper in the dark in corners and what not no you don't dude what is she doing bro you just had to ah okay i'm just no i'm throwing i ain't doing nothing a dodgers pop it did you they just keep running running tail that okay we got him now check this out we got weapons of light we're gonna pop off here let me just capture

what are we looking at here huh i don't know because he i i hate it here i hate it here yeah i mean pulling out my shotgun would have done the trick but then it wouldn't have got me got an adagio okay i want to know what weapons and adagio did i'm going to say a lot i hate you up all right i don't know you well enough to say something like that but guess what i'm going to i just cut my fingernails

can't see penis he's going to kill me challenged that i don't know why he's just going to go get another kill so here play nope he's right there okay third place oh my um just just imagine a world where that was widow's court or something just imagine well done mr fruit all you've managed to do is press record post a video and embarrass yourself fantastic look dude it's like i said man yeah pve role right and again freaking scout rivals and on some of these maps like which what's going on here i do think it could be good especially in trials on specific maps and there's actually a pretty funny role it can get both triple tap and fourth times the charm and if you keep rocking it you get like over 100 bullets in a magazine it's pretty funny practical or like a dps monster no but it's pretty funny you can get that combination or whatever combination you might want but i'll tell you what combination you don't want this one and the maps i played uh kill me let me know if you got a good roll though i'm interested to uh to chase some roles once this adapt weapon comes in rotation in the trials weekend i don't know when that'll be maybe it's next weekend the one after that i don't know but i hope you guys i usually van dash day we appreciate any support if you want to like subscribe comment um or not it's fine with me love you bye [Music] [Music] you
