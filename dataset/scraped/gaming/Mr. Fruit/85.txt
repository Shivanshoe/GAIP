day it's it's a day that's taken way too long it's like eight years overdue i want it seven years i don't really know that's semantics me and the boys just i think broke a world we struggled uh through vaulted glass it was sad frankly but at the very end atheon didn't just give me fatebringer he gave me that no he don't actually not he didn't he just gave me a helmet not important i got the fade ring i've like never gotten the paper so it's about better late than never right no one cares anymore though people are like you're making you're making a video on the fatebringer now now of all times sheesh just fruit you make me well guess what poop on you i got fluted barrel i asked what which perks to choose so if they're incorrect not my fault flared marewell uh as apparently i read it so far well we got killing wind and we got frenzy which is like rampage but it ain't so um but you know what that's not bad we got icarus you know how we do it's reloads but you know i just need to lock this i just don't lock my gear at all like i only recently someone just says hey maybe you should you should lock your armor like hey maybe that's that's a good idea i just you see i don't know i don't have to ever worry about dismantling something i like if i just never did i have a dismantling problem i just don't dismantle anything you saw the vault video anyway it's go time it's crucible what else are we gonna do come on oh and i'm wearing some new booties the path of the burning steps sort of flying about apparently weapon damage i don't know but it goes with my fit with my drip the trip was data approved and i will hang that on my wall okay it's just it's a little late but it's me in pvp with my own vape ringer oh hello okay well this is a party in it oh my god yo fate bringer

himself what what okie dokie i'm [Applause] and you can't even out you couldn't beat that guy i could go pro bold statement i'll be the judge of that because i am a destiny pro myself i don't know what's happening i could go pro take notes if you really want to go bro i don't mean to brag but you wouldn't even consider me semi pro back in halo 3 because i tried to go to an mlg combine event but my parents decided they wouldn't let me and rob's family went on vacation at the same time and we were too young to drive ourselves or anything like that so we needed our parents to come along with us and so we didn't so we never actually went to a halo 3 mlg combine event and so i was really just aspirational and in no way i never even hit 50 in the mlg playlist but bro you got you got to understand there was some clear elo issues back then it's like i was like 48 and then it's like win 20 games in a row maybe maybe you still won't go up a level but if you want if you lose one out of those 20 like you're you're just never moving from 48 okay so i don't want to hear it i was almost at 50. okay i don't mean to brag but i did play wall she in in one as well sniped down i beat sniped down i did not beat walsh and that is going on my grave if again if you want to take notes what who people are shooting through walls or something hello oh hello indeed dab it what then that's just disrespectful did that man have 1.5 million crucible kills she she's a beater you gotta beat ie ow ow no i'm getting spot cap that's pv kills i stop bruh wait am i top of the i'm top of the team that's just one you just know the team's back when i'm top i know i was like myself well i don't know if saying that i wasn't even semi-pro and in fact would just completely aspirational halo 3 player

reason this is a safe place only for pega plays and people allowed duck i don't know what i was okay we're about we're kind of making as you can see we're making a comment but i swear it's just like
