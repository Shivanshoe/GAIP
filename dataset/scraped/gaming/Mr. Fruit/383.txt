we're fine all right now open waters boys this could only go well this is now this is sailing yeah is it a bad time to tell you there are sea monsters stop the burial chambers oh skeleton [Music] we need so much stone to raise the ground and i think we kind of need to make fences everyone's gotten organ i think it might be oh yeah we should definitely start doing that i think the fences would be nice too because with the fences we'd be able to um like separate like our sections better too have like a nice row of like fires to cook and then the smelting stuff 100 i'm slowly raising the ground takes four stone every time oh my god you can get some of the pickaxe right yes i can oh ice destroying our beehive what the heck and now the bees are attacking me you penis okay we really need to make walls yeah we gotta get walls asap oh my we about to be double cheeked up brothers oh whoa we got ourselves a smelter baby deposit your raw ore uh you'll need coal to fuel this this can be produced by building a kiln and loading it with wood well that's step two we have coal in there yeah we have some so right now we just need to let a lot of meat just overcook maybe we hunt um you know i'm really good at that maybe we hunt uh the next we use next to make coal adding coal okay i added all the caulican and then i'm adding a whole bunch of stuff and let's see what happens all right i got a copper ingot okay new material copper and ooh a forge they give you new recipes yeah forge i'm trying to find it oh forge it's a crafting station we need coal wood 6 copper because one thing i do know is after we get enough copper we get nails and that means we get a better boat um so just watch out for this smelter um it'll puke out some tins every now and then oh you have to pick it up yeah grab them and uh uh and the storage to the right when you come in bottom left whatever i'm storing them all there i'm gonna go try and get us some more copper because that seems to be the move actually wait no i'm holding too many yeah holding i need to figure out apparently there's a belt you can make which increases carry capacity to 450. oh yeah i saw um coach carnage playing and he bought like some sort of item that did that too from the merchant all right we need to find this merchant fellow um how much does it take for campfire do you have your hammerhead should only be like 10 wood it's i remember getting stoned uh how much do you need i got some right here they need five there you go oh i got company i'll let you do that the fight got over this we got one copper war let's go oh we can make stakes like sharp sharp walls and stuff what kind of would you get with this wood it is core wood never looks like it's more oh so i got it i think it's more smooth i mean a couple of people taking him to attack me they won't attack me they're like you won't do it like i wasn't actually going to attack you i thought you were going to attack oh the throne rocks at me the audacity i definitely think mining attract attracts him but apparently the uh the graphics were like a purposeful decision to allow them to focus more on the depth of the game i think it works yeah i i'm down with that that's all i'll say like if they update the game i can only see them updating like in terms of graphics just making it run smoother and maybe lighting because the lighting makes it look pretty so yeah cause i mean at this point i think it's just the style and i like it actually is there there's not like a broken down house right here isn't it oh there's this over here this little base right next to us uh i don't know if i can even place in an enemy base hello what's in it um just in one am where is that yeah one amber and the others uh maybe this will roof right yeah we also found a troll cave by the way a troll cave it's just a cave full of trolls we don't know if it's full of it but they're full of them but that's terrifying did you see the trolls in the cave uh the troll cave we we tried to save it for you guys so we really didn't even go in to see i just i don't want to spoil what i ran into all right uh ab i'm going back so i'm gonna drop it all off [Music] i didn't have a dream oh hi um what happened what happened one did you put this here there's a hole in my house uh the hole in your house might be from all of the uh uh dudes raiding oh no my honey what happened well they break i had another bee farm and it's it's uh oh yeah um we all need to like make fences and stuff because like like there's like two of us and it's like the forest moves more like oh my god oh does it not scale no there's just a million people you got any coal there ab yep give me up well you got a bee farm yee wait a minute no i did not destroy yours because i know when things get destroyed oh wait you built a furnace yeah oh we got the moors you went into a dungeon we went sailing and we found one yeah i thought they're only underground are you uh just getting a lot of wood yeah and i'm i'm uh i'm breaking down stumps right now and and stuff too you're on stump dude you appreciate that rob i know it gets really upset about the other one we got so you can get the other recipes oh that's a good idea oh i did i did get uh i found core wood apparently i'm just or uh i did earlier i'm really over encumbered i don't know how just some tree he smacked yeah yeah so where i found it it was a pine tree and i was able to cut it down and they gave me core wood yeah also i found saplings we can't figure out how to plant uh trees yeah same thing with the carrot we found a lot of carrot seeds yeah i mean you'd think you could just drop the seeds and they'd grow that'd be too easy dude i love physics and games man like seeing these trees do all this crazy stuff following each other damage each other i love that so much oh ho we're cooking now baby we got bronze we did it we've got bronze axe bronze warrior thing bronze armor yeah bronze mace bronze pickaxe oh yo we got a cart i can make a cart app oh we can like move oh we can like probably go get like heavy items and then bring it i don't know i don't know what can drag it but oh you know we can probably do the cauldron we can probably make like soup and stuff yeah use all those mushrooms we need ten tens for one cauldron sweet jesus that's to be good though like when we start getting more we just have people doing certain things like all right you go get wood you'll get stone you go get flint you will get iron i mean uh you know like 10 you go get copper we can survive split up and conquer together you're not my dad don't tell me what to do you guys want to intersect with me with the the wall i'm trying to put gates into yeah i think it'd be smart to have like a like a city gate like a city wall so i got one gate here so i mean the gates are easy to build that way we can get out and fight if they're standing at the walls or attacking the walls yeah what if i don't [Music] what stop what the heck whoa what you doing i just dropped the wood and that happened i was giving you more wood and the roof was like okay i guess i died what the [ __ ] what everything's breaking we're not even we know that we know the trick though if someone ever starts stuff we just throw wood like what i was just giving you i'm just giving you what the [ __ ] no one did anything that time oh maybe you wonder i wonder if it's structural integrity yeah i think it needs a foundation something else to hold it on this side and that makes way more sense like what you're doing go to someone's house drop like i got something for you um you guys want to go uh to that dungeon though oh yeah did you not want me to finish the wall first have you seen the wall oh jeez have you noticed oh god i didn't know it was coming back here yeah dude all the gate this is the gate right yeah yeah they're killing those well dude we need more wood we have extra wood yeah uh well the main challenge is you need to have um access to workbenches so that's why i'm it's wrapping around like this i have to stay within boundaries of workbenches do you like our new little uh addition now they do yeah what's this new little house it'll have the forge well i have to like level the ground stuff it'll have the forge and all the stuff for the forge and then this is like our forging building where all like the oars and stuff go ye i'm chess for ores and then i'll make another building for like storage for miscellaneous things all that kind of stuff okay you know bless you will probably be free if we want to wage as a tiny bit whoa did you make the thing because there's different types of damage there's piercing damage blunt damage slash damage maybe certain enemies take more damage depending on the type of weapon you're using how'd you even get that recipe when we picked up the the new wood oh really yeah yep oh stag breaker it didn't do a lot of damage to those guys but maybe almost saying could work like if we use it on the yeah it does hide blunt damage so whatever takes blunt oh the skeletons probably pops the skeletons oh true oh that would be good for the dungeon wait dude um do you guys have a bunch of wood by any chance because maybe what i could do is i could just shortcut merge with rob's wall and then wrap rob's wall like the other edge the water line yeah i gave you two sacks of 50 anymore oh did you yeah that's what i dropped for you yeah you did okay never mind although i've heard there's tsunamis in the game can you imagine if our whole base got wiped out by me that wasn't even don't put that in the world maybe we don't have to worry about the tsunami since there's just a lake next to us not an ocean yeah i don't need that vujo well okay when you guys found the dungeon the first time yesterday there was a thunderstorm event where we definitely saw huge waves but they were not going towards us they're going along like from what let's see um they're going to like the east oh that's where we went there's like a giant body of water over there yeah well yeah in the middle of it it technically counts as the ocean so that's probably why yeah the water changes from like a river design to just straight blue oh wow and then jordan gunder came out and ate us all right maybe that part didn't happen but but i'm sure it will i want your love fruit look to your left oh what the more i get down from there this spike feels good don't hurt yourself oh did you get on here come here out there it's a it's a mind over body technique before we go into the dungeon nothing says i'm ready for a dungeon like something up your butt pegging the sure sign of a true warrior okay honey let's go you ready and don't hurt yourself hello traveler all right welcome oh do you like on our new gated community i do we're living in high fashion now we're high tech this actually if you think about it this was like this is how you flex in the olden days right i have a gate on each side look at how much wood we got what you're gonna do i heard it there's a lot of wood yeah in the old days this is a city you know yeah that's a big deal right now this might be new york like who really knows so here's what we were doing uh we found some caverns oh hey take their necks no no neck left behind but yes we uh we found some caverns to the northwest and we needed a scouting party well a raiding party really yeah to deal with the minions inside yes and you found me in the dungeon wait you passed one that's right you passed one did you mean to go that one oh yeah yeah okay yeah yeah that cavern yeah yeah we could do that one so this is a skeleton cavern let's go all right welcome to the cavern boys the burritos yes all right before we start let me uh watch out oh i did not oh i did bring a torch thank god all right step forward i'll i'll i'll be on torch duty or here we go it'll be the torch man let me try this first i'm going to try this weapon and then i'll do twitter oh the hammer all right if you would like to test the hammer i dare you to go through this door right here all right i take the front i've got oh that's a couple of them oh there's this oh that's a spawner that's a spawner we gotta go i'm going in okay please be merry and be free jesus let me get some hits there's more to the right oh my god oh my god just destroyed everything oh my god oh you missed one oh no behind us there we go all right i got two cubes for us oh another skeleton oh where is he okay it turns i have the gold and i'll split the gold three ways when we get out we're let me eat but you want to have a three weight what oh yeah right there oh god in the dungeon yes that's why i brought you here no i'm just we can make soup yeah pick up the mushrooms watch your health friends watch your health oh all right that's that's that's a dead end all right friends all right now i dare you to go through here oh destroy him oh we found feathers and arrows wow they shouldn't have nice i called dibs on looking them the next chest uh we never really figured it out just kill it i got it oh my god put the shield man in front of the ghost because it does like 30 damage to the shield oh we got oh we found quarters oh my god we got oh my god yes dude that was so many this is a mother lode there were three of them we already had the bathroom if om has one that's already enough for a kiln yep let's go careful merlin fellows you're weak are you ready oh i guess we're done oh okay wow what that's a small one yeah the ghost seems to be the best seems to be all right well let me challenge you for wait what are we hearing though could there be a secret door oh maybe a secret door yeah look around we have to put down your skeletons wait for the jingle jingle jangle what do you guys hear a skeleton uh it's like breathing maybe it's just ambient sound yeah i think it slows the wind all right we demolished this dude that was easy go yeah all right next one we poop to the troll cave we go hey i'm gonna repair everything real quick oh yeah good probably smart easy wait i have a little too much stuff a lot of useless stuff ancient seed so you get ancient seeds when you find these purple spawners made of sticks that's probably what we beat up when we're fighting all those dwarf thingies uh all right once we get in there i'll make a fire and pop the perk everybody ready we dine in valhalla all right fruits let's go roll capes oh oh okay that's what you meant he's literally right there um would you like to start taking shots pull out your hammer ready fire that was terrifying oh my god did you guys get any troll hide i got one i got a little bit i got nothing from that a chest uh what did i have some deer hide which um it's got two deer hide ten bones he was collecting bones and uh do i really i thought i brought fights what else i picked up a amber pearl come get this ruby and uh i put a trophy in there i got this is all this was was just his cave well it was it was one troll in a confined space and quite frankly it made me want to prove myself here i was expecting it to be like a family of trolls or something i'll do when we get back i'll start i'll give gold out from the dungeon we'd already killed his family man he was like the last troll yeah trying to live on for the first good oh do we want to poke around a little bit more no i'm gonna see if i can find 10. also ohm i found a uh a snow biome oh i see 10. you found a snow biome yeah okay i see a shaman and i see a spawner you
