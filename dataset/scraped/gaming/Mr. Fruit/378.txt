we also found a troll cave by the way a troll king it's just a cave full of trolls that's terrifying oh my gosh i got this is all this was just this cave oh wait you built a furnace ye oh we got them horse you went into a dungeon we went sailing and we found one thought they're only underground [Music] i love what blaster's done with the place oh whoa where did he get these like dragon looking things what the fudge oh it's applebee's hello hello applebee's how may i take your order love the rug i think he's done a great job with the place can i get the two for 20 orange level three holy heckers what the a breastplate of hammered bronze bronze greaves to shield your legs bronze sword oh heck yeah oh lord bless his has done great work on walheim heck yeah okay this is the exciting thing though here we go here we go oh yeah let's go fine wood i can make it tankered screw all the other stuff oh wood dragon ornament that's so sick a portal a ward a table oh my god the banners i can make a new boat fermenter what we're in the end game now baby the fudge more importantly how do i make this a portal connects to another portal with equal or no tag i need two cores but that's sick ward emits a magic seal on nearby surrounding that prevents other players from constructing buildings or opening doors oh oh here it is carve need 80 bronze nails but then aside from that i think we got everything oh i want to go sailing a fermenter oh so you have to make the soup and then put it in the fermenter it seems like hey not cool bro hey not cool take your time all right wait your turn there we go now just imagine when i'm decked out with bronze stuff dude i'm working on the copper deposit all the live london now rip gotta go fix my pickaxe holy this copper deposit is massive good lord i don't even realize this storm is spooky oh the rain is stopping i don't get it it shouldn't be i only need to work on my fireplace apparently this just doesn't do the trick maybe see like i feel like that'll smoke me out now let me see i'll probably dive smoke for sure now that's working yeah whatever i guess if i start dying carbon monoxide i don't know that'll be the indicator tim's probably wrong all right let's see what this cart's all about huh not in the right position oh hey maybe this is good i'm very cold indeed okay why isn't this fire working okay see all this stuff is like trash we're just keeping here because we don't know what to do with it just need to throw it out somewhere you know what it's supposed to be a survival simulator right so let's let's simulate real life we don't have a trash can yes we do it's right here it's called the ocean high oh i'm a horrible person i don't know if those will despawn oh wait wait you know what i should let me see if i can get an actual pickaxe i can i think and take all my stuff and the only problem is i won't be able to fix it because i won't have a forge but i mean it'll be good to have anywhere right let's go do that the feeling this is going to take a very long time to get there but sorry it's also going to be extremely hilly i'm stuck in a rock already okay good start all right let's see this thing ready caboose oh yeah yeah i think the pace the progression too is good it makes every upgrade and stuff like actually feel worthless gotta get hydrated oh and my pickaxe broke okay wow where did all you guys come from what the what the fudge oh god i gotta kill the shopping first no die die oh jesus okay i killed him oh my oh okay okay all right i think i made a mistake i actually don't know if i'm gonna survive this and if i leave they're gonna kill my car all right we hold the line i'll get the stragglers come here okay i'll get this guy [Music] nope i can't i can't wait don't you touch my card oh did they knock over my cart fudge i regret everything i regret everything oh jesus all right ah quit with the rocks grow up oh jesus oh oh okay i'm panicking restore my health please i beg of thee come here you stupid god if you don't square up right now i swear to god [Music] okay all right one down good yes there we go [Music] okay grew me we did wait so how's my cart doing not in the right position what not in the right position what gotta flip it over come on buddy yes oh it's all still in there actually pog okay that's way better all right once i'm done with this copper deposit we'll go back be crazy if there was magic i wouldn't be surprised if they added that later or something i mean that's just it this is really early access like this is the first part of it and it's already this in-depth you know yeah i wish more games like early access came out like this like this doesn't feel early access but how much stuff there's already do it feels like this could be the game you know [Music] um to love you what are you working on uh i've just been mining my life away i need to get a pic i want to fight that deer boss so i can get a pickaxe too um i made a copper one copper pickaxe yeah so i could give that to you but the slight problem is you need a forge to repair it so it's a little harder to like have a forge with you than the workstation you know oh yeah hello oh my god you move you move pretty fast i'm sprinting the buffs definitely help him because if i if i'm not sprinting go go oh he's hurting it off grab those berries too might as well [Music] i'm carrying too much well i reckon uh just let all this stuff smite pretty much we can go to the dungeon yep let's do it this was the burial chambers yeah um i don't have enough stone for campfire do you have any stuff i have seven but it is time may the gods be with us i believe hello pregnant and that's it okay that was an easy clear bones i thought that was as small as the one we did at home that was such a small engine hello yeah yeah nice skeleton trophy got gold coins and feathers nope easy peasy just mushrooms oh there's some over here oh jesus ah oh i hear it was not anticipated stupid oh this one goes down instead of up nevermind no wait um try here i don't think this will work yeah i like where you had that that would have been huge if you just unlock more rooms oh connection oh oh ow beautiful go go go go go go spawners down spawners down he's oh oh look he has goodies yes what is this application the elder oh it's the elders though there's spoopy i guess that's is that the one you should probably do next thing yeah yeah the next boss we're gonna need everyone for that supposedly the bosses get way more difficult oh hey thanks buddy what a pal oh hi what a nice guy we probably have enough for a forage huh or close to it uh one off if we want to do another one or uh all right oh all right go i found a cord don't stop swinging die you haven't found a ghost yet he's just waiting to speak oh i think i heard it nope okay that makes it seems like every dungeon has five cores because we've gotten five each time that was an easy one i feel like that first one we found spoiled us yeah the first one was such a cool one i hope they change depending on biome like if we go to like the north where the snow is i wonder if there'll be different dungeons oh yeah where is that snow utama we can go there i'll bring you now um skeletons whoa a lot of them oh the dungeon right here oh really yeah oh and a boy yeah why not burial chambers yet again i have five more stone if you need it for the fire i don't have a wood deep wood i do oh there's skeleton right here in this room wait really yeah oh what up dude he's like welcome crazy travelers what you bought what are you bought what do you oh hello jump him i think the spawn is right here ready let's go change your weapon oh yeah i'll just let you do it then you're just stabbing at the bone oh look what we found easy clap money honey money money there's money i can stack the feathers and amber oh oh my god i broke the door okay oh whoa oh man are you kidding me wait this one's had six this is okay so this breaks all the rules i know yeah everything we've learned is a lie even though we just learned it yeah i've got i'm working on two stacks now oh another one dang bart oh oh my god we hit the mother lode are we about to get the ten boy we double cheeked up right now boy i can't i can't hold all these chords oh okay well that's fair enough we we got pretty lucky yeah wait a blue ball and i'll take it dang oh good yeah we have 14 cores now that's seven portals if we wanted the skeletons for guiding us they wanted us to find it there we go level two oh oh there's a house here to the left a skeleton thing oh my oh it's a brute yeah i thought that was a like a giant skeleton oh my god we can take them well if i stab you we can't try man try me [ __ ] all the two star on you yeah it's all right oh you missed it i was i pretty much had to take on a horde like this by myself to defend the cart oh really yeah there's like 12 of them now i had my little spear i am missing oh here we go i'll just pick up whatever i can stop oh man the mountain whoa there's uh oh look at all the board oh i'm losing health and there's a you are yeah i guess i'm too cold no i'm not i wonder why or not yet at least it's a slow uh don't let that one escape oh now i'm freezing yep ah ah okay sure he says um this land is hard and wild but we also brought harder still take comfort traveling and it gets for you ah fudge ah god think this would have just they fear it's it's the home of boar and they fear fire i like boars well did we know this whole time you want a board we have to go to the mountains where it's snowing oh what the fudge is that oh i think i found the the boss there's a giant lit brazier well you you found the boss like it's just where it says like the elder no i'm assuming we have to make another sacrifice oh i cheesed the troll he hit a tree and now he's stuck he's stupid all right it says hunt there or burn their young jesus christ patrol's dead he got a tree fell on his head and just bonked him he got stuck with the tree on his bed oh that's good that's good stuff i can't tell i wonder if you might have to put dwarf trophies or something it might be dwarf trophies i just got another um but on the top of the pillars though it looks like ancient seeds hmm well maybe the ancient seeds are like the dwarf symbol like this like maybe it's like the symbol for them or something it could be seeds or their trophies or both i think we'll definitely have to wait for everyone to do the boss i want to make that fine bow what the new what do you got do more damage oh i got another troll on me oh a troll cave i think it's another dungeon oh oh you you still want me to bring all these people to you if you want to try and fight two at once oh he's throwing rocks
