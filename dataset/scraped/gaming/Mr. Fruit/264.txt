hi eddie hello everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome back to the last spell but this will not be our last video because well i'm not sure it's unlikely we win in fact no it's 100 we're not gonna win in this one but we will get there eventually let me put it this way i have like over 20 hours in this game so far in hades i have like 30 hours and i've beaten that game like 20 different times this game is tough man okay and it takes a while the progression is slow that might be my only gripe is if progression the meta progression in the roguelike part of it was a little bit quicker but aside from that god this game is just freaking i love it let's get into it bang bang uh if you remember from last episode we ended on me being absolutely paper excuse me and um yeah not saving enough to buy a hero which is sad because this hero is so good ah that hurts but uh yeah there's no way i can um afford it slight oversight so instead i'm gonna have to do this night with three people i'm still gonna try and get a perfect might i don't know if that's possible i'm gonna be honest but we're i'm gonna try my darndest and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna blow all my man up there's no time to save mana let me say that much i have to figure out who i think is going to be able to solo the easiest and frankly i think it's i think it's our true i think i'm going to put another watchtower and we're going to have the same strategies we did over here and then youtube take care of business over here and if you can't god help us all that's all i have to say i'm going to put it yeah what are the odds that come over there i will do something like that probably so i'm going to need you to skit scan skadoodle here real quick friend because i gotta make you a huach tower now you need to climb into said avac tower and oh look at that coverage hopefully nothing comes over there because that would be unfortunate but what this does mean is i get to build some stone walls um wow that took most of my material that was eaten up rather fast which leaves us with not really any over here um but maybe that's okay look i'm just gonna look we're holding this fort down this way the walls can take a little bit of a beating over here yeah we're just we're um [Music] ah what am i doing um maybe a watchtower here would um [Music] yeah well maybe i mean it's not the best but it's also not the worst what if we were i'm doing it i'm doing it yeah yeah but but we don't even have massage meat man ah screw me yeah i gotta do this don't have enough for a gate sick all right well oh my god i almost didn't level up people mazel tov to me hey i got another slurpee or icee from 7-eleven don't judge me i still don't know what i'm building with you ah where where am i building with you guess i'll give you physical damage i could have rolled i guess man you're just not getting great anything okay experience game what the fudge you do get a new perk though oh while at full health you get extra reliability uh moot point penalty uh i yeah we just go thrifty what do i think not even it's not even an uh question you are our arranged fiend and you just so happen to have that 33 range damage escada oh see why can't we get propagation stuff on the people that need the propagation you don't need any of this ooh just 10 straight up damage okay okay okay thrifty is looking mighty fine is there anything is there a class you would not take thrifty on genuinely i don't know and i'm not sure there is okay yeah getting a perfect night here is uh gonna be a tall task let me say that i'm gonna do my best but um yeah not getting that extra hero was just just something else from me i'm stupid so um as long as i can get a free item that's what we need we we need that economy if i want to make it past my record of night nine that's just what's gotta happen it's not even really up for debate all right they're all funneling in here let's um just kill you and uh well we can't really hit anyone else can we oh we can't holy range batman that's incredible um freaking ah who's next compose and this would do a lot of damage and this would do not as much okay well there we go my accuracy is so good they don't even have a chance to dodge oh that didn't even break armor oh my god i'm stupid whatever i couldn't hit anyone else anyway okay i don't hear it um now what do we want to do here this isn't exactly super dicey you know our current circumstance um you're only going to propagate on three people it's free though so um might as well they're done for get them out of here i don't want to see him no more i could armor pierce this manner but it doesn't do much damage what's with that how much health you got two stacks of poison will do it um uh it'll just this will just take two hits but whatever and you're practically dead feels bad hmm this fell over here is a little annoying but i think we can manage you're gonna die to poison extra okay cool uh no point in wasting me mana i reckon i wish you had another weapon though about to utilize some of this extra mana you have or we could go over here and i could hit this guy yeah why not budge that was it um should i yeah all right whatever i'll just kill get that over with just so he's not bothering us later let's uh omega multi-hit euclips okay we'll be able to get the kill here it'll take a little bit oh but see um i'll just shoot you a couple times easy clap all right one here didn't move yeah it's because he's on the watchtower oh wait no they don't count that they can't they well you see this is the problem what why are they coming like this this is not part of the plan oh suck ah god oh boy oh this is gonna be so bad i don't think there's any way we do this perfect all right well pray for your old boy um i just think i think this is our best rap bar and then you and your freaking armor sure i hate it all right kill you uh clean up you and then again i'll kill this pleb i guess yeah i hate it or i could slow all of them it's not much value there i might as well just get the kill okay it's definitely gonna be getting pretty interesting here i think i'm just immediately gonna start hitting the propagations um oh my god wait i can do four on this okay wait let me get omega value here here here pretty good pretty good chief this uh line of sight problem we got here is not so nice uh how many times do i get to hit three as much as i'd like but but but you would live with like next to nothing you freaking oh you too well screw you guys okay dodged really ah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all right well you know what good poison stupid you're done you hear me your career is over i have nothing to propagate so i'm just going to you have armor no you do just slow you off get those debuffs in screw you lancer pleb it's about as good as they can get um probably gonna keep the crawler here i assume he's just gonna go right here maybe maybe he won't though i just don't want him because i could wait and just propagate it probably with these bat things but i'm not even going to risk it like i said i'm not saving any man of this round we're uh we're going all in so it's exactly what i planned to do you have no extra stuff you okay really i'm just worried about this what hold there's no way you hold this okay hmm the good news is all of our economies over here oh my god i'm gonna get like this is bad um i think i gotta rotate i might have to bring him over here how in the world i'm gonna manage that i don't i think that that's the answer okay well i can shoot you as long as they all go here i can kill them but then i'm struggling to do this um how much movement will you have after this fudge all right screw you oh my god i got it fudge all the movement i wanted to keep ah screw you guys take this you foul demons ah sorry about that uh do we reach oh we do oh wait no that's oh you've gotta be kidding me so this takes two minutes of that i guess i could have waited um i could stall these guys or these guys at this point really all i'm trying to do i guess now is stall until help arrives huh yeah that's decent we get four kills here but we get the three about to hit the walls here um yeah let's just go for the people hitting walls kill you and then i could do decent damage or i could debuff because i'm not going to break through the armor [Music] so let's just do that and that'll last two turns so buys us some time and then you like i said we're not going to be waiting on um man in here we're just going to be going in hmm just make sure everything dies oh i think everything's done okay perfect i'm so proud will die to poison how much health you got that will not die to poison we'll just do this though okay or you'll just dodge mr funny guy okay barely not hit him as there any point though i guess i can reduce his movement but that's really it and then i'll just poison him that's all i can do i'm afraid and yep hope i can just continue to hold the line by myself because uh we gotta we gotta help the left side and we just have we don't even have a gate here so all these crop fudge man these guys are really really trying to just get on my nerves wait wait wait wait where are you going sir where would he be wait what well i can't shoot him because i don't even know what he's doing that's unfortunate get back here you winch um yeah all right yeah i can't do anything over there so good news i don't have to worry about it yet instead i have this to worry about [Music] see optimal value here oh that's pretty optimal if you ask me let's start over here what do i do here i don't have many good propagation targets here yeah because i can't even target them um i don't much like this if i'm being honest um i could propagate to myself screw me right uh there there there there i'm just gonna try and kill these stupid things i have to rely on my reliability and it failed me a little bit that's okay i forgive it or do i um all right just keep making sure no one can do anything you are still moving absolutely nowhere you're going to hit a wall you're going to hit a wall actually i'll have you guys okay let's finish you uh okay i have to make sure they can't hit anything i think that reduces their movement speed enough yes i don't think anyone except for this guy should be able to make it to the wall uh so let me poison you and on my way out kill you hurt you or not you're annoying but the poison should slowly kill you so instead i'll just hyrule and reduce actually nah screw it double poison you clips boom i'm coming to your aid fear not um i can't poison this uh yeah why not it's something all right you're doing great over there buddy hey we could again delay somewhat excuse me with three mana we're gonna be taking some damage but that's why we got walls okay um i'm not gonna go for people i'm not gonna be able to one tap all right these guys will be squishiest so that's fine all right you know what i don't want to get ahead of myself where's this runner going i actually can't figure it out is he oh wait is he going for this wooden wall or something this little scoundrel or is he going for the open part i have a feeling he's going for this in which case no one is getting there in time this will this watch this one little crawler destroy my perfect knife why would he go that way like what what compels him to do that um well this is the thing we got to deal with go there there there there oh the crit big big pretty big all right nice let's finish who we can remember i do a sword which could kill you guys and that means i can finish you hog all right this is going pretty well uh cannot one tap you and unfortunately i kind of cut myself off from field of view what am i if i go here what's my line of sight garbage okay but we can propagate and i'm unable to get up the oh okay just do this kill you then let's see okay i can propagate here which i'm gonna do okay then come over here and propagate here that's good uh and then we'll just i don't even need to omega so i'm doing i'll just kill you um he plebs man all right the bats might get through  man i'm almost i almost feel like i gotta get off this thing i might have to do after this turn okay i think we pretty much everyone we see here right now though is it so i'm gonna throw everything i can here run on over try and intercept this dude so actually i might just do like one thing here um like that i can't even kill this plug all right hold up let's kill you kill you and i don't have enough for the other one so yeah screw that dude nobody likes you anyway kill that guy exit watch tower and run if i can get to this watch tower saved but i don't know if i can do that in time gotta say not a big fan of this dude kind of a joke wait i might get hit by all these guys trying to get rocky little answers all right all right pay attention this guy what is he doing he's really going for this open spot well fudge all right so i have to somehow kill and get back there i guess okay so throw everything i got right now and then get inside these walls good work this guy's coming on a wild goose chase what is going on right now uh climb up this all right peasants feel my wrath take a little bit of that yeah take a little bit of that yeah and screw you guys kill you kill you that's all i got but i'd say that's pretty darn good come up here freaking ah swap to this sucker uh can i get closer oh yes i can bop all right he's almost dead now just gotta figure this piece of the puzzle and i'm looking pretty good uh these are sent and done i suppose [Music] uh i'll just screw it just freaking whack him oh wait oh okay does not propagate to my walls thank god that was almost really stupid okay now start running back this way can i shoot i can't do anything okay or can i wait a second oh no i need one more movement hold up if i go here ah no that won't help gives me a little bit extra movement but not quite enough armor up for the sake of it and that's that okay by some miracle i think now you start hitting the wall what what is wrong with this dude you've got me all confused i must admit i haven't the faintest clue what you're trying to do really that's not gonna kill you my answer is man or whatever freaking screw okay uh i'm gonna oh ready for this watch how much damage i'm gonna do this thing ready 554 damage uh you you died a poison in fact i think the rest of you died a poison uh so i guess i'll just rack up some kills for the fun of it i got nothing else uh you died a poison and you're gonna die to poison but screw you anyway oh okay i gotta come over here wait no okay can i reach no i cannot hmm kind of sucks because oh there we go perfect let's say otherwise i hurt myself big okay screw you plebs all right now oh what i got to make my way over there how much damage you gonna do he's probably gonna destroy the wall right then um just in case i could somehow get there before why not actually he might be able to he has a mega range so holy cow i can't believe it in great wait what he what he just like did all drive by there for the fun of it what is wrong with you let's go what was i worried about oh my god oh let's go that's another perfect night fourth hero never heard of them who needs them oh look at that income not juicy juicy income my slurpee is almost all but melted that's a lot of tainted essence chief ah well that was easy yeah totally totally oh okay i think i got a prowess for hitting someone with more than 500 damage with a single rain shot i believe yep so i now get the inquisitor oh what is this items offered as a reward for the city panic have 15 chance to be rare oh wow yeah yeah yeah ding dong let's see can i finish oh i can starting armor quality unlocked we got all these new ones i want wealthy haven but that would literally take like 8 million playthroughs medium armors better magic heroes heavy armors freaking i don't know these all sound pretty good more longbows could be good longbows are good more spears more rifles more pistols more two-handed swords more axes you go for this medium armor thing yeah why not i know obsidian armor just and scale arm it just sounds kind of cool so that was my thinking there look at that income all right what are our options here holy that's some good tiered items is that the druid step yes it is that's a tier three one to be specific oh it's so much better eight mana daily management extra magic damage oh please i can only get so erect uh this is poo poo and this is pretty good but let's be honest screw you all right miguel here's the deal we're just gonna swap it's just just in case you wanted to use some extra skills like that you would have more centipedes to use but that is uh how do we say park my dude oh now we can unlock this okay so what i've kind of found though is once you get to this point though unlocking specialist you kind of suddenly become cracked and i think that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna unlock a specialist now we do extra damage got 20 extra damage and plus one use so now we get four centipedes does that count for we get three b's holy yeah worth all right let's level up see what we got um extra magic damage isn't bad probably i have a lot of mana i just need to refill most of it uh what do you want brother just go with magic damage screw it i'm not getting more experience come on give me like poison or something fudge yolo it's not good perks sorry friend alas oh a prowess has been accomplished what did i do no seriously what did i do oh have it here reach 40 man we got priest sat oh now look at me go he does have quite a lot of mana and the thing is if i do fully refresh it if i wanted to like next time i could do magic fuel and we would be at almost 60 percent magic damage holy that's quite a bit i'm gonna be honest with you chief let me double check the gear um well it kind of sucks all this is low tier i don't think this really helps anybody no i could upgrade the shop and that's what i think i might do like see increase the level of available items but first we got to nail down everything else um aka our economy and buy a new hero uh so i'm just gonna go ahead and upgrade this so i can use all my workers here this is a fully maxed out finna make me act up okay before i do anything oh wait wait right i don't have to i don't have to increase that whoa whoa just stupid oh did did this not refresh no i think it refreshed did it yeah cause you have a dagger you have a i think a little wand you have a scepter you have a you come with decent stuff you come level five though you come with physical damage physical damn a lot 16 physical damage from the boots pretty good but i'm not really looking for a physical person right now am i [Music] i mean just another archer am i gonna say no i don't think so now give me your short bow get on in here durand welcome so good to have you friend let's level durand up here oh you're just killing it buddy we need to get you a better short bow but for now this will certainly do um now that's really helpful okay range damage pog uh probably some more range damage uh yeah more range damage why not we like accuracy uh reroll accuracy the accuracy yeah why not it's not bad give you extra xp steady aim and well we don't need to give you initiator doing um so you don't have any propagation or multi hits as it stands oh we might just go with cherry picking all right monica you've been working so hard oh my god i could give you more crit girl you offended me at 27 percent let's go extra accuracy gamba i should have taken okay gamba allied uh okay my bad girl what you won't ironic we're gonna get her confident but i'm not confident we should give her confident but whatever and lastly the greatest marksman we could give you extra critical you've been lacking on that i think it might be a little late but um five percent extra damage just in general isn't bad but let's just go across 30 that's pretty sick kind of at the point where like like he can't miss more or less which is really nice well i'm gonna give you confidence that'll put you at 70 reliability seems pretty good all right i could build new buildings now if i wanted to um what would i want to build right now maybe manuel and temple but as far as mana goes aside from you still kind of chilling so we could focus on our economy again um or i could even just get a fifth um porch mcconnell warrior hero whatever uh we're going to upgrade this then we're going to upgrade this i'm going to work upgrade this that's another 110 gold so now you're practically maxed out so then we could kind of do the same here i won't have quite as much um let's upgrade to use another one so now we have two matched out um oh before i forget push the miss back with the sear please and then again i don't think there was anything to buy i want to upgrade the shop's levels but i'm going to wait until i just have so much income that at that point i can do whatever i want with it which i think we're nearing don't get me wrong um where are they coming from well i'm glad the stonewall purchase wasn't completely null and void there and they're coming that way okay let's go for if i got gold i could upgrade the shop but let's just get materials i think that's where i'm at right now i have i could get one extra worker if i upgraded or i could build okay well currently i don't have any work excuses anyway so i could i could just start building scavenger camps i think that's what i should do [Music] or build an economy in the a scavenger department i haven't invested in that at all but i kind of feel like we're all right with that right now on that front now we need to build some defenses um might just build uh well let's see let's upgrade to you and you and you sure a complete stone wall over here we might need to do the same i think we're gonna need to get watch towers because let's see we got pretty decent range the only problem is our crossbow friend kinda needs to bob and weave it still feels like so if we had uh i think i still put archer friend here right druid staff guy could go i'm trying to think yeah over here and then put both the bow guys over here might be a bit excessive but and i'm trying to see i think coverage wise we could put the watchtower here i think that's pretty decent put another watchtower rocky eu clown raw update and then for coverage here maybe a watchtower like right here but see then he doesn't touch anything over here i know he might need to steal more mobile but i don't know if i like that uh i'm definitely gonna upgrade this i should destroy that and at least put to my decent wall there huh it's just the range isn't quite big enough me to really like this so we could go here but then if they go too far to the left but if they go too far to the right i don't know i might just put a watchtower here and if worst comes worse you can always just you know get off of it not it's not the end of the world let's build ourselves a gate and a better wall and at the very least i mean at least get these to better wooden walls all right that leaves us with some let me do that some extra extra stuff for maybe the next go around it looks pretty good freaking all stone here not quite there on this one but all around pretty good i'll do it around the watchtower noise all right i think we're good to go let's uh armor up and apply all that stuff for again uh no good reason aside for free things free essence uh i think we can get a little greedy with you and uh let's do this to a successful and hopefully perfect night six oh fudge we got exploding boys wow and they're already starting with farmers man get alive can i can i hit anyone okay god the range with this rifles nut i swear if i put you over here and you still can't even cover this area we're gonna have a problemo screw it that's fair enough for me um let's it's see gonna kill oh wait i know what left there there and then freaking 616 damage boosh yeah that'll do that i'll do i don't even think will this break his armor it will a little bit all right that's worth it all right he can't do much he tried why are all the exploited boys over here uh fine question huh i can't slow that one though uh let's just go with some multi-hit stuff here real quick kill that guy nope okay oh fudge i didn't realize you'd freaking pop off like that man you gotta warn me next time i let that propagate through all right that'll finish that guy off so yeah i'll reduce your movement finish you off hopefully hit one of those uh come over here this gives me three movement okay double poison you i could poison you too yeah let's double up like that all right and then you chill right there armor up i don't think they'll make it to you but all right six action points but there's nothing to do with them so many explody boys all right looks like they're finally deciding to not be total boners um who do i like the most you like that most come on hey there we go i never doubted you stupid it doing great i'll look at this guy taking them all on by himself off fudge there's an exploding boy oh but wait son of a gun okay when he gets here i am lighting this dude up i should yeah i can one shot oh my gosh that would be a fantastic but in the meantime screw you guys oh wait a second i need to watch my mana uh because i might be running out of here um hit him and hit him pog you guys are counting they're absolute stunts but whatever this is i'm not a fan of this is a big propagation how could i resist could undo all their armor but meh propagate right here that'll do that go here here out of range here here here here okay all right calm down we know you can do this all day kill there and then you can't even move anymore essentially um well you can uh this will be the last time i can use this and of course you dodged it oh but okay he got caught in that so that's all good you'll die to poison uh to do this again i mean they're practically all dead it's just that then i could poison him even more don't wear that then if i wanted to another two man but all their armor and dodge would be gone pretty big for the lancer or i could just hold if i get a better one uh or i could do this and just kill him see where's camp worst camera so i can just hop off the watchtower which i seemingly forget okay pretty well so far we're not even halfway through the night though so let's not get too ahead of ourselves here mr fruit but i think we've been able to uh what is this guy doing control the population the most part die see i know maybe the watchtower right here would have been better okay you my friend get a dime one shot oh it's gonna be satisfying that was every bit what i'd hoped it'd be um well how much mana do i have maybe i can avoid using that because i am down to six need to be a little careful now not that careful but careful enough uh will this break it'll break your pretty heavily all right great job over here guys you're killing it [Music] you can hop back into the watchtower and uh wait maybe not oh that's i can't i thought if i figured it was a movement thing so i could just undo it i can't it's annoying well then i guess i can just wait for them to get closer that's how they want to play is is that how i want to play it i don't know screw me all right take two start on you so it should propagate to everyone boyfriend got him and he was gonna die anyway but uh let's multi hit you up the butt [Music] oh wait if that kills then yeah whoops oh whatever still gets the job done noise uh and i think i can reach him poison poison and then just lay some damage in dodge dodge dodge rip he's dead okay we're doing a good job of corralling all these rascals so far i think the biggest thing i just need to do is remember to get a man well now and have enough workers aside from that okay well as i say that where did you all come from if i could just hit right there actually that's about the same huh oh yeah what am i doing there's a better one okay i can hit you now screw you i don't know what you're trying to do but it won't work i can't hit anything else we've got another rascal here i don't think i can one shot him this time he's not isolated uh so what i could do instead is hit there then pop them do minimal damage what's that uh kill you you already weakened so let's kill you dude freaking kob is just a legend he shall forever be known for his valor now propagate yes yes screw these guys yes die die stand i don't have enough movement to get back up there get hurt not die oh but practically um i guess we could blaze i think everyone almost everyone there is dying to that so i don't don't need to bother i'll do that should take care of them right well not unless you just want to barely not die but still works out for us see it's like monica already forgot she even has physical damage as a as a weapon i'm gonna poison you you know what i'm gonna well i could poison you again but at that point that's just that's just rude i'll arm her up sorry let's do this okay we might be getting we're almost towards the end of the night so there's really not that many people left of which i have not seen yet waiting to show themselves that appears to be pretty good die die die and uh die and yeah how about you yeah having this much accuracy to where i never have to worry about dodge even now geez that's nice that's real nice uh i think that's our best bet ah he's just on the cusp so then i'll just do this i'm only huge give glory beep beep beep beep beep beep he's on the age the age hey propagate through all those could you will you go all the way i don't think you do you'll stop here right oh no you will you saucy minks die um kill you and um hurt you and uh let's just kill you so that you uh do a little aoe nothing crazy but i appreciate it no you didn't have to kill man come on there you go yeah take all those eh eh it's from me with love from fruit there can't really be many people left her i reckon that's about it oh nevermind quite i thought that was kind of going to be it okay looks like i need to manage this as soon as possible and come assist this um oh my i do this i can hit the people i can't kind of out of my range so then let's just kill this guy [Music] and let's go for the archer just screw him and uh let's snipe this guy for the one shot this assassin h2 clutch and then these guys need to stop i don't know what the big idea here is but i'm not a fan i hate that okay i don't have to never mind um it'll take more than two shots for that instead just do that and wound you you're done you're done uh propagate from the back forward oh i can't so then right there this is perfect uh we could blaze it up it's pretty good let's go get warmed in you really just didn't want to die huh okay he was gonna die from poison i'm throwing these guys way out here though bit annoying okay well they might as well all be dead uh so i'm gonna poison and poison so he'll be dead in two turns i don't want him annoying me too much then what are we gonna do about you your rascal how much poison are you taking you're taking quite a lot of damage oh yeah looks like you're taking just enough damage um looks like he's gonna be a bit of a straggler so i think i can get off him do this my own way proper gauge okay and then just clean these guys up come over here you got that one all right so all the ones left pretty much over there oh okay double answers turns out they hurt and of course we have another splotty boy how do we want to do this gentlemen that works with me your dad your dad your dad uh your dad and i can't reach anyone else with this absolutely tragic i have to wait just to finish this one guy before i can help you friends sorry actually they might be coming this way i'm not entirely sure where all of them are planning to go uh if i could kill this guy though that'd be pretty big i think i can we did it get rid of the archer all right oh i guess i could hit that dude man not that big deal all right 15 action points remaining wait what the fudge oh yep because i did not do this shadows but yeah it seems a little high it seems a little sassy screw you i'll just keep throwing them out until they eventually work i get to use bees for free so you're done for stupid i'll come over here to try and wrap around to help easy all right let's go car uh then and then hop on down and can i actually hit one of them i can where would you look at all right oh it appears we're going to be just fine no target oh can i not get down there oh boy move you oh yeah wanker and i still can't help you live for now all right he's the lesson that's six perfect nights let's get it again slowloads let's go we're over 3 000 essence for that night not bad level eight seven level seven level five let's go see why don't why don't we get any extra for that but we should get a pretty high tier item for night six let's be real it's gotta be pretty good if not i'm gonna be pretty best all right i'll just keep pushing back the fog it doesn't matter what you do oh my god the gold you ready for this oh oh yes yes 525 gold let's get it let's check out the reward i don't have to take one yet oh a tier three hammer that's a bait it's an offhand weapon oh wait now that's still a bait isn't it yeah i'm pretty sure it is i could do that instead of our great sword but not sold off hand pistol and it gives us poison damage well no that doesn't work oh wait i could pair that with um the one hand crossbow or just get a better crossbow 30 reliability that's saucy that's sassy does way better damage it's its floor is practically our ceiling all food for thought all food for thought let's level up something in the old essence emporium uh what was i level though sheesh apparently nothing oh more medium armor um so anything i just buy for the fun of it this probably worked took quarter something now more light armors and the warrior set sure that sounds that sounds good right who wouldn't want a warrior set yes we could work on leveling up but first [Music] uh we're gonna upgrade this upgrade this upgrade this that's all maxed out so holy oh oh oh oh hey that's pretty good we only have three workers left but uh i could just upgrade all my other ones if i want because well i do need to push the fog back that's happening um yeah i guess i can get more workers i get i get another hero and buy him that's five heroes right now tempting uh i think i'm gonna start upgrading the shop of that i am sure but let me upgrade all of our houses real quick one two three four five where's my sixth house wait do i not have max houses um i dared to have max houses why did nobody tell me this how embarrassing okay i don't need to buy more right now well now the world is kind of my oyster is there anything here like another hero is good but i'm just debating if i need to do that right now or if i should start investing in something else because let's see we could build bowers but we almost have all the bows we need i guess wouldn't be bad to try and just get better uh tier short bows and stuff blacksmith no armor maker maybe oh manuel and temple that's right you guys almost let me forget thinking let's let's just destroy this i'm not even gonna use my workers on it uh because i want to shave them for the manuel temple actually the temple currently i don't need so let's upgrade that um [Music] could upgrade how much mana gives back to um if you give a free one all right everybody mana wise how are we looking we got decent not decent half and half okay um i'm gonna save i don't need to give back that much many yet i'm gonna do the free one on you and then the bigger one on you oh you're max let's get it and then you got freaking you just got 15 22 holy jesus 13. kind of the rest of you are chilling i'm not gonna lie uh so we'll just give it to the freaking yeah you i guess which means i could now start upgrading scavenger camp too that's probably next on the list after i upgrade the shop do i do it again buy some new gear oh look at the levels look at the short bow all right where's our uh pleb short bow user yeah so this is pretty good we don't do any poison damage so that's kind of lost on us but better damage yeah in fact is it even worth it because all we're really doing is adding plus one to it and adding 10 damage max um oh what is this freaking 25 poison damage miguel i might give it to miguel now but it gives but it on the other side though it gives plus 12 percent physical it kind of seems like a waste what um big potion of strengths gives 80 strain 10 mana 75 hell holy 65 dodge shoes check everything we got here is there a way to refresh the shop i don't think there is i'm lucky i could level it up again though but i think i can wait on that all right scavenger camp upgrade keeping track of how much cold we got upgrade um yeah i you know i'm trying not to destroy this just for the sake of destroying it but i think that's great that's what i'm doing build another scavenge camp and we're missing just enough gold to do something let's improve the effect and then use worker use worker and destroy that 440 materials feels pretty good we're out of gold i feel like we got quite a bit out of that pretty happy with that over 500 materials now so now i get to decide on this i think i just grow with the crossbow reliability's just too good i'm doing it where you at there you are uh take this crossbow friend meanwhile i can give you this as uh an alternative what else would you do let's see does any of this hurt you minus one move points that's fine we do need to get some better minus accuracy okay see you don't even need to wear that um that's fine that's fine i need better armor we need to start getting helmets none of my guys have helmets does this does the shop just not sell that oh maybe i have to make an armor for that maybe that's what i should have done [Music] um i think next time i'm going to just get as high of items as possible and then just start throwing those on because literally everything will be an upgrade for us [Music] i want to hope we can get through this night perfect i guess maybe i should have gotten a fifth year to insure it oh we're still only gonna hit from two sides tomorrow night i think is when we get hit from three i think we're still chilling for now i'm gonna be chilling but let's level everybody up um not at all what you want oh my god okay yeah ah [Music] you do have a good chance of creating so i'll increase your crit power now i think i might do the same for you you might throw in the old specialist and by that i mean that's exactly what i'm doing it's too good i'm kind of torn here i don't know if i want to use specialist being able to kind of swap has been really clutch could get extra crit uh could regenerate mana but i don't think that's gonna happen i'm torn [Music] i i kind of like what we got going here and i don't think i'm crazy for thinking that you know oh so i'll have to deliberate more about what i want to get you then oh miguel miguel what uh what do you want not range damage health don't care no don't care about any of that let's go with critical i guess [Music] and accuracy but i don't even know if i don't think any none of your mana stuff can like miss right i don't think that's how that works i don't know gambo oh okay it's only 10 poison damage but that's poison damage now what do you want isn't that the million dollar question yeah i don't know i don't know what i want to give you durand you beast give you some more range damage uh oh the propagation bounces could propagate five times see where has that been imagine we get that with our b's bro you are now a hundred percent using in fact i might just change what the i'm torn well then then i should also use this right thrifty is good but i think initiator right now our blaze will be bouncing seven times with another multi yeah yeah that's what we're doing there uh so now i gotta figure out i didn't give you these give me some more range damage 38 that's pretty good and just eight percent damage yeah why not all right perks now let me go to the bathroom and figure it out well after a lovely um really tempted to use specialist but seriously being able to switch between them has been so clutch i know i should probably just settle on one because 20 more damage and an extra use on each skill that's it i don't know which one to settle upon because like imagine i could use freaking two rain of arrows every time or three power shots the wooden rifle there was sick because i was able to take off the the big guys but i i don't nearly need to do that as much so call me crazy you know maybe while i wait until i get a fifth hero i might keep him to hmm because this does give us reliability i can't i did it okay i did it you have the short bow my friend let's see [Music] i kind of need a better short though though he's our cracked sniper fella but he's sitting on a zero tier short bone so i can't really afford it though  i don't think there's any way i can afford it don't want to get rid of that yeah i guess he's just gotta keep rocking this or i could just have him rock the wooden rifle for now but man i'm having a crisis i don't know i just don't want to make a decision and that decision absolutely boned me i just got to take the short bow hope it can do enough for us and then next go about hope that uh oh yeah well if that's the case i think i'm gonna give you the wooden rifle instead of the short bow um has a nice backup nice range in which case this one does more damage but we get less crit power but uh it has a higher ceiling screw a little bit of an upgrade that's the plan we're sticking to it now we got to build some defenses i don't even know what to throw in i can obviously upgrade walls but like what all do i want to do i think for the most part we're gonna keep the arrangement we had same deal you'll come back here climb up there i could just upgrade all the walls and then just put watch towers everywhere so worst case if i need to do something i can just kind of hop over that's not the worst idea of her why not i think we got enough for if i wanted i could add some ballistas and stuff but maybe later um let's put a watch tower towards the corner then how much movement do you have you have eight so let's say i gotta move one two three four five six okay so watchtower there would do fine or even better one two three four five six seven the watchtower here might be best give us the ultimate options i'll just upgrade you in case um let me same thing over here one two three four five i could put something like here right about here for one thing's pretty good to me uh let's upgrade you and you and then i might end up putting them uh well let's see i could put walls here but i don't think i need to i need to fix that though it won't let me repair that bit of a bummer uh i think i'll build nope build a watchtower right here same deal and then i don't know seems kind of baller if you ask me to throw some traps in never really used them though i don't know if they're like game changing uh let's do a watchtower here and then wall wall wall and i wish i could undo that and it makes a little bit harder to jump in i guess well not really all right but that adds even more protection we got all stone okay this looks good to me if we get another if we could get a flawless knight seven i think i'm getting ahead of myself but holy that could be big all right let's one perk point remaining what what oh i thought i upgraded you um i think i'm gonna go first blood extra critical and hitting full health thanks game i was like wait nunny um just throw some extra perks on you this will probably be the longest last spell video yet should probably be ending it now but i want to do the next night i okay don't pay me and it's probably gonna take the longest so yeah probably gonna be an over two hour video so if you're watching this thank you if you got to this point comment down below with the word um peanut butter frosty and then i'll know and i'll be like hey it'll be like that leonardo man all right julie jeff i can't see i'm just worried what special units we're fighting bats are fine but on the other end how are they already hitting the freaking point i've only seen bats so far uh we got splitters i do hate splitters this is true that's pretty good baby yeah and let's see what she what damage you can do your propagation stuff is cool but uh yeah we got to be a little closer for that don't we well it's a good thing i gave you this thing um i could just do a big big debuff uh let's just do that that'll last for a few turns and then let's just kill whoever we can hit you once hit you twice and then i could punish oh get me the high raw as you can see our reliability should be pretty high [Music] um get rid of the thrasher i hate him you don't have any armor so yeah i can't reach you never mind um let me get rid of you while you have no armor perfect okay now you yeah see maybe i should have just i wish you had as many propagation as him you have five but he's got seven or whatever freaking nuts man let's go there wait wait hold on no one's going to be able to reach you you boners um i want to go here so there we go propagate everywhere don't dodge your bonus believe me i ain't done poopoo faces all of you uh let's propagate here let's propagate over there um just kill you i guess kill you i guess kill you i guess uh you're out of ap that's fine um let me just do this now he shouldn't be able to move enough he's got 86 health poison will do 52 let me take these guys out first or dodge dodge dodge okay there we go i'll just hit him easy there we go i just didn't want them getting out of hand by going all the way over here i think we did a fine job all right so far so good we're almost like halfway through the night how's that is it just i think it's just way more wave heavy like density um well a lot to choose from here let's start with this and then that looks pretty good screw you guys ten percent chance to dodge come on get pooped up one shot and one shot what the fudge my dpi went to like eight million percent um all right well you can propagate this don't kill everything so you can propagate oh man see your boner you did you did too well um let me kill you the only problem is when it takes this two man that gets it's a little weird because then it's uneven one shot you pleb that's all i can do now over here oh just a propagation wet dream brother let me tell you these guys are getting on my nerves though um well this will be nice let's start with that oh yeah maybe oh you can kind of go wherever you want with it um i would use it again but then i'm worried it's just going to double up and that ain't what i'm trying to do oh hey what's going on over here i i'm gonna have to get line of sight on this boner all right wanna play hardball huh okay um it's annoying but kill everything uh that was pretty good i'm worried if i go over here i don't think anything's in the fog but i don't want to get omega jumped but in order for me to get vision i can't even oh my god i still can't hit it what the well it's a bit of a problem isn't it uh you're gonna die to poison what about you no you're now gonna die to poison you're gonna die poison much will my boys do 52 i'll take four turns to kill you i'm gonna take two turns to kill you and you can't hit the wall yet well i think we'll do that then uh i think that will he kill uh there you yeah pretty much like everyone's gonna die whatever let's do that fog and then i'm gonna come over here so i can catch this boner um i think i gotta dismount because literally like everyone here is dead gotta come over here mount up this is what we made it for but okay we have a bit of a blind spot up here yeah yeah well kill what i can all right oh that density though oh my god what the f oh well i have a gate no one was like wait how did they destroy that um if i go for the things at the wall right as i just aim at the back um i can kill you guys later okay well let's see what i can what uh crossbow shenanigans i can get up to first not enough shenanigans watch if i just had like skill range or something but i tell you what i know all about yeah because unless they get right over here i'm kind of useless no don't kill right ah fudge the propagate ah geez you hate but all right at least gives me something to do dodged excuse me that's all i can do oh wait oh god no i have another oh what the i live quiet all right you're dead oppositely just laying down upside down and all just like barking and staring um pretty good and then that should leave enough for me to kill everything here if they don't dog no dodge arena okay but he no i thought he had no movement yeah he is moving fine it's fine sir why why you like this all right we killed him but what are you boners doing what it like what is you're gonna make me waste um i have to waste i have to waste a bee on you screw you all right um should i attack or something no we'll get off we're coming back get back up okay and b b's this is your q uh go go go another b i want to be the very brush uh wall's going to take a little bit of a but that's all right another one sure does a little bit less of a dicken how many multi is still here only three now uh get what i can pretty solid like we missed a little bit but i'm gonna slow these guys as much as possible actually if i could just kill that would be even better you would stop dodging that would be fantastic good screw you this guy will be hitting the wall unfortunate but i can only do so much yeah we're gonna be taking a little bit of a hit now you know northeast uh really really slack holy jesus there's so many of them ah ah my stone walls hold all right we'll start with you we actually have a decent number of uh targets now so that's nice a little bit of this a little bit of that a little bit of this that's fine uh i can't do it again because i didn't take specials so now what they're all so weak and i can't kill any of them i'll work on that in a second probably just going to go for people closest like are they hitting the wall they're all hitting the wall with the punch better not dodge all right uh where's maximum value there we go all right friend just kill who you can there you go yeah i'm so proud of you kill that guy screw him can i kill anyone kill the dodger hey we did uh you can't do anything else oh i always forget i didn't give him specialist can do something else yeah we got something something else over here i tell you what i don't want it to trying to kind of control where it propagates so i have to go here here there not bad we do it again there there let's go monica go on then get on with your bad self oh that crit go on girl nice nuts he can't even hit our thing so i don't have to worry too much about him right now calm down poopers do you die not quite propagate around you bet okay i'll kill you later you have my word screw let's beat it up again darn i killed him too fast uh i'll just kill you and then why don't we hop off and get you on top of this one for next turn in anticipation only 20 left it's looking like a perfect night seven go on all right you avoiding all the you know i'm just going to shred literally all your guys's armor because screw you guys actually poison's going to kill most of you whatever um it'll take two action points to kill you next time as well as bees uh you're dead poison will not quite kill you so pretty much just have to focus you and you let's see poison you and um over here i didn't even need to do that did disrespect you died a poison you died a poison you died a poison you died a poison they literally all died of poison that's it so let me get down i don't think the other side is going to need help but just in case um some pretty good value one shot you one shot you don't either dodge oh my god i love each and every one of you get that reliability bop that's that cherry picking and yeah let's just do this pop and round that up and then watch boom let's go oh my never mind that night didn't take too long it's because miguel level nine there wasn't as many in or waves as i thought or like turns of the night it was just more in one night okay okay like 600 uh materials just for that yeah how much essence oh we eating 3 500. uh yeah and now this next night we're gonna have five heroes girl oh you best watch out i'm finna act up oh my all the free things essence i guess hey hi how are you i'll get the warriors cheese cheese more rifles i get this i can lock all these but then i'm also kind of like what if i just very slowly work towards a wealthy haven but that's real slowly it's like old medicine uh heavy armors sure i guess i'll just unlock most the armor first night reward what do we get to choose you know i've still only ever seen in the 20-something hours i've played this game i've only found that one epic ever there's that one chess piece or whatever short bow three that's like exactly what i was hoping for uh lmao no oh extra propagation bounce [Music] hmm extra experience in ap is nice another propagation bounce um but then again uh i think there's the the short bows way better where you at here you go my friend you deserve much better there now this guy's gonna slay yes let's buy some new gear tier threes i don't see any tier four maybe i haven't bought tier four why not my dear i have not bought tier four i'm doing that now it's max oh a hat oh my god jesus look at that plus 11 accuracy 30 crit power we don't have any hats first armor extra momentum and mana really the only thing helpful for us there is mana 21 isolated doesn't really do much for us but it is this is all sick extra critical is not bad plus 13 critical sheesh but i'm not using a sword anymore 75 hell 10 minutes tall i i like that oh i quite like that uh and you know what else i like i've seen him out of money got over a thousand in the bank who's selling price of all my items uh i feel like that'd be good if i was producing items which i'm currently not oh um could improve this i mean at this point like what i can kind of do whatever the fudge i want right uh we're definitely gonna uh upgrade for hero i could upgrade i could upgrade i could get six heroes right now am i fitting to act up i think i'm finna act up let's see let's see what we got in here robert is level seven one bag saw eight range damage five percent dodge minus two minute plus one skill range minus one bag slot extra critical we got another cracked archer if we want paladin oh my god physical and magic damage and mana two move points less critical power i could slot physical damage like i feel bad but like just more archers means more winning feels like yeah i think we'll get uh radburt welcome friend let's go over to radber where you at go on uh let's go ahead and give you this short vowel it's way better than that what does this come with minus four percent okay get that out of here uh okay the rest is fine perks give you extra experience steady um currently you don't need initiator if we're just going to have you on like short bow or longbow although let's say i did get longbow i think longbow does um now that's stunned chance isn't it i'll do cherry picking thrifty coarse um confident and specialist freaking boom bonafide cracked brother oh i should have also given you this okay well we don't want any of this oh i guess dodge ranged pretty good nothing here ranged ranged critical uh critical um the rip accuracy is probably we haven't gotten any accuracy oh there we go extra accuracy uh bit wasted let's get some more accuracy there you go buddy all right monica you sassy minks i don't think i've ever gotten anyone a lovely maybe once so what do i do um could give you extra crit that'd be 42 chance when attacking someone at full health um that's pretty good to me then oh man if we get to level nine i i haven't even read those i'll get there when i get there you know let's level you up you still have zero percent range damage i'm just making you a crit bot i guess you're doing great uh increase some accuracy you're doing fantastic monica it's even more range damage holy cow 43 critical power yeah perks i think we also just give you first blood i know looking at these kind of seems like the play overall it's not bad but i mean maybe badly wounded but uh first blood again seems like just like almost specialists in first blood seem like almost best in slot for this row oh miguel hit level nine oh shoot now i gotta read what these do night owl on the fifth turn of the night creates two action points and two movement points for three turns hex any applied debuff poison and lasts plus one turn uh well as soon as that's all that he does um poison for four turns that might just be overkill don't panic when attacking excuse me a tie located inside the city extraction damage two percent damage for each hit taken during the night this bonus resets every morning five percent chance of regenerating an action point after killing an enemy killing an enemy with a melee within the attack provided by melee weapon or generic's health or dodging an enemy attack grants one action point for the next turn um i don't even really think it's a question i think we go hex yeah uh durand another sharpshooter of ours i feel like thrifty is the play as always like that's just the one you always take at the beginning all right so whoever not here we go uh some magic damage sure buddy 47 magic games miguel is freaking cracked two extra propagation bounces we did it so now b's propagating nine times and applying four turns of poison we could remove armor and dodge for three turns remove oh my god miguel please stop it uh some more range damage why not um you know how much crit that whatever let's give you damage anybody else nope okay now the question is do i recruit another one we might want to get some gear i think i'm buying the inquisitor huh no doubt bet can we get rid of this i might even just get like the armor or whatever one cloth armor yeah like maybe let's see like this literally just way better graves who's this for let me go give him 10 extra critical extra accuracy oh we're gonna buy those extra crit again if we buy this then this yeah i think we just give all this to people um yeah we don't really need that i don't think we really need that or that still haven't used potions but maybe it's time i grab some i am kind of uh as the kids say double cheeked up although i am almost out of money uh because i'll only have 110 to buy another new hero so i'm debating if i don't get another hero what do i do you could build probably a bower and an armor maker the others i probably don't care about get more scavenger camps and also upgrade scavenger camps but i'm gonna be honest kind of think oh max pog i think another hero is the play because i think if this is the difference between perfecting knight eight or seven whatever we're gonna be on uh 100 worth it so i would have to choose from these guys though or i could reroll but i don't know if i have the gold good let's see i can only sell that for so much um so i have a short bow in the back right which probably wouldn't have to do because i don't know if i can just throw like chloe in you look like you could handle yourself with your sword but well actually what am i saying i can't even afford you actually the other person i can afford is chloe who has a magic orb magic damage move points dodge health man about less health you only level two wait i can buy another mage what does that do where's even fit i have four of them the heck all right i might want to wait because i maybe it's not worth it to get another one but then and be sub-optimal you know all right i guess i'll wait well in that case let's build uh armor maker which we're gonna do right here what tier is it giving us right now not good tears let me tell you that oh 20 poison damage probably gonna i know exactly i'm throwing that on miguel go [Music] you're gonna lose your extra ap but i think it's worth it how much poison damage you're doing 84 poison damage that's pretty nice and then who wants all this this gives a lot of accuracy and critical power um almost tempted just to give it to you because you have the best odds of critting it's just you know what you just don't really do much damage i don't know what i've done with you you really are just kind of this enigma i'm so sorry i just use you for blaze and there's the extra accuracy and [Music] hmm i mean the crit is nice and the accuracy is nice whose else is highest you've got decently high crit radburt little rascal maybe i give it over to you or i give it to just our highest damage i don't know i guess it makes most sense because you're gonna be quitting the most there you go yes milady and then why stop there get even more critical 44 chains and then with first blood 59 chance hitting critting people at full health monica's about to pop off let's go monica extra crit extra health cal you do do a lot of damage that sounds nice um built in critical you well you have those pants there's not as good so why not guys plus two mana does anyone not have pants this guy we'll sell that i think we sell that keep that beat right wait i just maybe not i think we sell that which means [Music] first off push that back yo if i keep this up though i think i it might even be pushed back further than when it started which is super sick very handy oh but we're getting attacked by three sides now thankfully two of them are the ones we have heavily fortified but we're gonna have to fortify this side now um reveals the full list of tonight's horde i don't know if that's good like even if i know does it really matter no no i'll figure that out here um i don't have enough to do anything here i'll upgrade how many workers i can do here for now sure and then uh let's figure out here okay so this is going to be the weakest side so i can put one person here i'll put two people here two people here one person here and we have almost 900 supplies to work with pog i don't need to refill anyone's mana either so the workers don't matter ladies and gentlemen um come on this has got to be it right it's feeling good things are clicking seven perfect nights in a row we're gonna try and keep it going it'd be cool if we could finally win wouldn't that be nice i guess we'll have to wait and see though continue rooting me on uh and we'll be back again for night eight and hopefully further on so they said i'll thank you all much for watching have yourself fantastic i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] you
