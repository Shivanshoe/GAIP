season anyway what's that it's all right it's almost the new it's the new oh chris i missed christmas well hap happy holiday hope you had happy holidays well if you're not i got a present for you shall you wrath that's more or less probably how you say that also just look at the black and gold this is a clean weapon did i put a shape i didn't even put a shader on this thing anyway sorry uh polygon rifling accurized rounds i love that range tunnel vision i do because i do that all the time to my own detriment 99 of the time snapshot sites way oh i put freehand grip on it but now that that doesn't make quite as much um okay maybe icarus counterbalance let's go icarus maybe anyway uh master worked it because range look at that range big old range that love that love that range that i opted to try and eventually get some rolls on this thing because i was told it's good i couldn't tell you if it really is i just did some trials and grams until i got a semi decent roll is this a great roll i don't know i don't know that's not my expertise i did not study that uh undergrad unfortunately i only learned how to be an ape and hold on to gme so you know the drill ladies and gentlemen we are headed into a game of pvp control first to see how this baby purrs because it's a child's weapon and trousers of osiris saw it it had a bunch of cat stuff per you know see what that there also i just saw this was in the store for bright dust had to cop it this is incredible i love it show your enemy this place belongs to you now i will show you the wrath of shah russia i forgot where the r goes in the name but i know where to point the barrel and where the bullet should go so that's really all that matters who cares about grammatical uh hold on really focused right now okay wait a second no the whole point is to aim down sights mr fruit i don't know i've got it in this thick skull of mine and i got a hip fire i put on freehand grip for like two seconds and i just apparently kept beating myself over the head like hey we're trying to we're trying to we're trying to hit fire we're trying to the the goal is to hit it's not nothing on this gun watch oh it's safe here it's safe it's warm and i'm ready to go come on come on yeah oh my god i'm ready oh my god the tunnel vision the tunnel vision the tunnel vision is still going what well that's fun and balanced if i've ever seen it i can't let you get the dollar horn this is for me and only me oh oh wait i hit something did i kill something nope i'm not failure to kill will result in no kill tunnel vision still ready to go and it's gone wait you're my friends you are my friends ah i'm sorry for shooting i have not participated in any guardian games since the first one because you know titans wine i figured hey it will not get better than that so no point try also i got a cap c i am helpful believe it or not but not at range not at range excuse me thank you is that our grenade or your grenade it's a fun game you know walk in it and why don't you find out i don't really want to though it's a game i didn't say it was i like the game it's just a game that exists nice half damage okay i'm oh my god let's go somehow i got a kill there excuse me oh like a knife to hot butter or a knife a hot knife to butter i guess it really all accomplishes the same thing right as long as one of the two things in that equation are hot should accomplish the same thing right okay he's weak and i i'm gonna die can you guys give me suggestions on titan exotics to use for pvp i just always use grass valve loop i know i smashed right is it even i don't actually know i just kind of have it on all the time why oh i'm sure there's some other good ones i just like crack crest about blue because it doesn't matter what i'm using my loadout it's always just kind of helpful you know fear not friend for i am here okay and i'm running through people i guess don't ask me how that works is this halo infinite with no player collision high oh still don't really understand the idea on that one but i'm coming from behind oh two quick ones three no he's not on the menu chef special was a double kill not a triple gotta come back on sundays sundays triples i always forget that keep the pressure come on catch you right did i go with um oh boy i'm dead aren't i yep uh counterbalance okay what kind of i mean icarus midair your jumping right just doesn't really seem conducive to anything productive frankly but uh above and uh uh but wait what that didn't kill him it says who not i clearly oh okay it ran out but that's okay cause you got it because you're a gamer i'm pre-finally that pre-file oh sheesh oh nice well stupid okay you're not coming after me good you appear to be wise yes save yourself separately i just had a stroke self-preservation is the word i was looking for die what the what why aren't you dying [Music] blood yeah what what is with this little beep thing like midair that doesn't like nothing yeah what okay what the fudge am i watching what is a stupid thing first off how rangefinder frenzy icarus grip apparently kills three times as fast what's this stupid thing well what is it i just wait while mid air to quickly descend restore hell that doesn't work when he's not even a foot above the ground he just spams it doesn't make your sense has a powerful can you tell you're dead you show that forget about it huh wait what is this dude doing what what's up wait titan melee ability i'm sorry how we have little t-rex arms and he did not he didn't have the shoulder thing what how did he capture uh i'm just getting too old to ask questions just just you know shut your mouth what  walmart go back to walmart dude you can't even see this you're just gross dude no one likes you everyone would rather go to target targarte bed targeting whatever we'll get to getting out of my game what i just really don't understand it everyone's shotgun always one shots me oh that's a super and i saw he died to a super and yet i ran towards the fire you know that i'd like to think that's actually a desirable trait you know most people in uh in a fit of panic in a a bad situation would run away from the flames not i but unfortunately i'm not a firefighter and that was not a fire and no one needed saving they're all dead but point being you can rely on me in a stressful situation always count on me to do the dumb things you don't have to worry about it because i'll do it for you all right see ready i'm going to show you how it works when i shotgun okay well it doesn't even matter because ow what all right here i go here i go time to show you guys let me reload let me know uh okay that's not fair i hit him in the head i usually don't hit him he was already weak he was already weak hold on there we go see like that you know sassy little saucy start using the shotgun and sell them on a killing spree coincidence i think not it's just a video about the shocking or the sharp poopoos wrath mr fruit that's a fair oh my god what okay you take that sir he's like rip well played okay and do it all about i don't know what we were both doing there buddy i just don't know how you didn't kill me frankly that's the biggest surprise yeah this is a close game it's almost going to let's see two shots that just doesn't seem quick hey hey nice nice teabag walmart stupid stupid i crouch i'm sorry i'm always going to disrespect it is crap like what's the best way to say it i don't know it's like you're at a family gathering you know family reunion somebody pulls out like a deck of cards you guys like hey why don't we play like go fish or like spoons you know spoons nice game but then there's always that one guy who's like yeah let's play spoons and he thinks he just has to win at everything and has to be the best and has to try hard at everything when that's just read the room dude you know like we're just here to have fun be with family friends laugh about it play together make some memories because guess what 10 years down the road no one's going to remember who won the game could be the memories you make playing the game you hear me walmart you hear me it's a quick crowd shot the end but mrs flew it's actually a strategic incentive that you could use as well it's available for absolutely plenty yeah but guess what i don't want arthritis at the spry age of 27 and i'm just i'm an old dog okay i can't learn new tricks yeah that's mainly just it i just don't it's just too much it's just too much for me i can't right don't so rather than adapt yes i'll just sit here and complain okay i i know what i'm doing i know it's hypocritical and i i know it's not his fault just upset with myself you know also i could have gotten the rumble but whatever reloaded for me so here it is don't tell me while martin's in the game oh my god walmart all right at least he's on my team you know what crouch shot away buddy spare our enemies
