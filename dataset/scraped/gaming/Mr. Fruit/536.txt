heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to gunfire reborn gunfire reborn is an fps roguelike and you guys know me i love fpss and i love roguelites so big thank you to gunfire reborn for sponsoring this video the game recently just had a big update they released a brand new hero added a slew of new monsters elite monsters and even weapons as well as balancing some of the weapons and if you're up for the challenge they released a harder game mode now let's hop into our own game here we are the game is just beautifully stylized i can never get over it so we're just gonna go in and do our thing now like you would expect from an fps and a roguelite you can do a little bit of both you know what i'm saying you're gonna find new weapons you can pick up and use all of them are gonna function differently each hero has unique abilities and talents every dungeon is randomized no run is going to be identical it's a beautiful thing that's what it is so it's just a matter of getting through without dying obviously the difficulty is going to ramp up as you get deeper into your run but that obviously won't be a a problem for us but you should be wary once you start taking some damage you're like i'm freaking invulnerable and then you're like dead so just uh word of the wise never get too comfortable but i'm gonna use my ability which will chain people oh my god and what is this give me this got me a shotgun oh oh my goodness i like this wow oh yeah whatever this is is great preemptive strike the first shot from a magazine deals extra damage i'm going to go ahead and take that that is what is known as an occult scroll it's kind of like a perk that we'll have in this run i also found the angelic aura let me just go ahead and pick that up and we also got the uh the tiger cannon my goodness look at this thing well let's not squ oh what is this brutal gloves weapon damage and skill damage plus 35 on normal hit yeah sure why not give me all this stuff open up a treasure chest why not where you're just swimming in it i gobbled over phone with mysterious energy pick up to enhance power that's right we get to upgrade our skills during the run so i can get some extra lightning damage i can debuff opponents with my soaker nate or i can do some extra corrosion damage i'm gonna go with this debuff because it sounds freaking sick you can see down there our progress to the boss we want to get through the first stage which hopefully whoa hopefully i can that is one pull of the trigger oh god yeah i'm i just i click it once it's just this giant oh my god this is nuts okay there we go let me just debuff you guys goodness gracious i actually can't like control this thing i've cracked the case i am i'm actually i'm i'm like smurfing right now what the heck this thing is nuts it's it's almost a little too good i can i can hardly control it hey hey look at that shoot a thing and somehow i don't know where oh whoops that was my ability i meant to go into the vault like a little secret hidden passageway you can get some goodies don't mind if i do oh wait a second i think i know it's gonna oh jesus oh heavens okay just avoid the big balls here i how the heck okay i'm actually nuts now how do i do this okay wait for the spawn wait for the spawn oh my god okay so far i'm doing it okay okay run with the boulders wow i actually didn't get hurt that's nuts and now gain immunity to all cursed scrolls oh well don't mind if i do what what's that over there you know what i'm not gonna get greedy i'm not even gonna bother checking i got something i'm getting out of here best to not push these things oh that looks like a cool looking chest though so don't mind if i just grab this the little burst that could give me all zulds look at this luke thank you very much oh ho portal is opened and that means i get you oh what is this ye almighty spirits from the underworld i summon thee i can lose some of my health to get gold i can lose some of my health to get in a cold scroll i can lose so my health to get a random weapon or i leave i'm going to get a cold scroll screw it lost half my health but fill the magazine instantly after swapping weapons now we are talking ready watches and it's reloaded like what's not to like oh my god wait i got ammo this is incredible on to the next one let me start with this boom okay yeah so that uh turns out that's pretty strong yeah um i think that's safe to say oh oh what are these things ah stop it there's just too many of them cotton let's see if i do this boom hit the big guy oh my god we're just one shot in them that thing is nuts no wonder they were hesitant to give me ammo they're like guys do we know what we're doing if we give him that do you know how powerful he'll become now let's go back into this vault thing yes this let's see what goodies away to us uh oh what is that thing i don't like you much so i'm just gonna did i kill him i actually didn't i missed or when i just didn't do enough damage okay let's uh take our time here all right don't get hit by this that would be embarrassing okay don't get impatient here we go here we go okay door unlocked what is this thing what is that kill it quick ah oh nice j i didn't know what to do with it so i just threw some rockets at it and that seemed to do the trick oh but i think i'm at the end i did it i'm nuts what did i get 25 damage dealt when your hp is full well my hp is not full so that is unfortunate but we're kind of we're kind of killing it we just got these insane guns like out of the gate and unsurprisingly uh it's becoming super clutch for us we're just debuffing them though with our smoke grenades and using a smoke grenade gets us a kill which gives me another smoke grenade what is this a craftsman hello i get to enhance my guns i think i 100 enhance this thing let's just you know let's just enhance it again plus four look at that damage i'm thinking big picture here big damage you know i'm saying like up against the boss just oh what is that i don't know but i get to go pick it up so apparently once you hit a certain achievement it'll unlock a weapon in certain runs or future runs but also once you earn it you can pick it up as we see here some sort of a dope looking crossbow i assume well let's just try it out you know what i'm saying oh my god it looks sick oh that's so sick the question is is it better oh wait a second no no no no it's not because it also takes special ammo okay yeah that's why it sounds so sick that'd be a bad idea to do that because then we're both of our weapons only special ammo and that's obviously what we get like the least amount so i wouldn't want to cannibalize oh what is this challenge event is the risk that may appears at any time an adventure but it also means unexpected goods so wait what what have i done ah back back there's too many of them yay just throw that chain some dudes okay okay okay all enemies transform into a horn beetle after being defeated oh that's what's going on here can't see i really like it no you don't get away from me swordsman oh i forgot little beetle spawns and challenge complete and your shield starts recharging when you kill an enemy or destroy an item oh my goodness that's real good okay oh what's this i don't really like this this is oh okay well we're oh jesus oh god what the just a hello peddler what is this evil devouring sword that looks pretty cool but i don't have enough money for that mysterious bun oh it restores health how much is this whatever screw it i bought it i'm not full health though dang it oh gosh okay well long bowman i don't know what his deal is but i do know i don't like it and he's dead what is that thing oh we're doing this again huh what a throw what an arm i got on myself here i have no idea if i'm if i'm doing well i don't know i'm just gonna chain that dude okay wow suddenly there are a lot of them holy heckers all right well oh what the where did you come from back oh fudge oh my god i'm almost dead i'm down to just my health i don't have shields oh god and the health that i do have is so very low where do they come from how did they keep hitting me hey you take that yeah get debuffed idiot couldn't be me okay oh my god not dead yet how do i freaking do this i don't know what to do with the horse head aside from this that appears to work pretty well oh jesus it's boss round okay what do you have um badge this is ah that's all the healing i can get right can i buy another one no i can't alright well then uh let me at least upgrade my smg a little bit okay for the love of god i've never been able to beat him so it would be really cool if we could do that like right now all right let's start off with a bang we should be doing approximately half a bajillion damage all right let me lock him down here okay he's locked out or is he locked out i don't know smoke grenade completely missed i'm nuts oh god i'm almost dead i'm almost dead i'm i'm so almost dead holy jesus what is he doing oh he's healing hey wait a minute that's illegal oh god no get away from me beetles could you see i'm busy okay sit beside this thing though oh okay as long as i sit behind this it gives me a whatever a line of sight break which is pretty good oh no no no okay i'm still alive barely though no no okay we're in this i'm just i'm rotating as fast as i can through my spells yeah no you don't no you don't come here don't let them regen yeah wait a second there's bombers wait a second a second i will not let you oh now ah okay we're gonna revive i get one revive apparently ah that's all i'm gonna get though i thought i was out of the distance but evidently i was not oh come on i'm so close he's firing more than usual wait that's illegal okay wait wait wait wait wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a second oh i did it he's dead long live the king oh my yeah i had to revive once what do you want from me look at all this loot i could upgrade something sure illusion plus three this kind of just seems dope so let's see here oh yeah oh i like that all right we're gonna we're gonna rock with this my trusty rpg and this little rifle thing i'll be honest though without that rocket launcher i don't i don't think we get here but let's go where are we going oh the next world this is all new to me where am i the anxiety desert or something oh what the heck you got some crow looking dude or something how angry will you be if i shoot you okay apparently very angry and i do no damage with this thing okay maybe this is a mistake well it's because it seems to be like a shotgun rifle the heck very interesting also maybe it's because these guys are like super tanky yeah we went to the next round and then suddenly it's like oh we're actually playing the game now okay okay you know what i'm saying all right well let's go to a vault never been to these faults kind of scared but that's okay because you know what at the end of the day we have each other wait am i supposed to oh it's a little jumping puzzle well did they know i'm a master jumper make the cup i'm nuts okay now what oh god i gotta wait for this fire there we go up and yep now where am i going over here oh my god look at me go all right here i go skirt now where am i going i don't know i'm gonna go over here uh open treasure chest so

vault that is depressing all right well nothing ventured nothing gained we go forth you know what screw dude i'm just gonna i'm gonna take this thing why not no that's probably not better at all but but it's too late for that actually wait no i already like it way more yep never mind this is the play oh my sweet jesus that's a big explosive barrel he's got strapped to him ow who's is it's that

this is good uh uh it takes actually here slides sticks in the enemy on hit and explodes uh like you know what why not right well let's just keep tossing these things hitting them doing slow dot
