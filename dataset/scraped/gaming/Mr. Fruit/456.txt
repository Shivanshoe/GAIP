hi everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to among us i just wanted you to suss him thank you and trust me dance monkey you're welcome i don't get it i could never do anything right i just need to not talk it was like look crafty mate because he didn't talk but we're gonna see i just spilled chicken all over you guys what are we saying i don't have anything i'm sorry guys can we see it now you have to finish it you got to show us oh club i'm eating this buffalo chicken i'm not choking on myself oh god hey guys what's up can we surprise to talk about yeah i'm a little worried do you have glasses on can you not see yeah bryce uh tell me why you shouldn't suss you right now um because i'm an innocent crewmate and i don't know when i am muted but i'm pretty sure i probably i'm muted with the part where i'm like i'm probably going to die here i feel like no no we didn't hear that you said you said let's see what we could do about this so what did we do i'm the imposter let's vote me off when i was [Music] look right now it's a 50 50 bryce and you lose these you do need glasses for this [Music] it doesn't because then the two imposters could have skipped to save him right uh it's like smooth brains when i'm uh when i'm crewmate but when they're imposters like yo let's just immediately give these guys the benefit of the doubt where the fudge is everybody i want to try and get whoever tries to snipe lights who's trying to snipe who is it okay so what the fudge oh interesting i was on my way to uh fix the lights and there was a little blue body there bryce why'd you do it where there on like right no when you come in the main entrance door before you go down into the electrical right normally i got a little mad that i unmuted and you all figured out i was the imposter so i just ran right away to bridge and stabbed him right in his hat ironically the hat is part of him and he died yeah did anyone see anybody buy electrical probably not because lights were right now i was i was mostly in med basically no i think it's kept i think as in like yeah as in the baseball cap i've got a halo i'm voting for you okay so it's kind of killed yeah um i can do that for you there is nothing wrong with murder okay well you're sounding a lot like el uh light i kind of don't want to vote for you anymore dork is the only person yeah trying to do my share to stop the spread of coven yeah we appreciate that you know he's covering his eyes wrong hey you know what that's better than it not covering enough so we appreciate it that's fair ravi why are you hesitating on this vote we all know who did it all right guys exactly who voted for me every time i'm proud of you every time let's see what we could do about this let's see let's see guys you took out my partner okay big brain time i'm not gonna kill i'm gonna report it after one then i'm gonna be like see bryce had to have been it you like that yeah what can i say except you're welcome it's brilliant it's huge connect super not suss this round except i need to give the time through the kill a little bit of time oh okay so i'll say i was going to click the emergency meeting here i'll let someone fix lights don't get another don't get another kill check oh fudge okay it doesn't it doesn't work podge i mean great going oh no all right so it is it was very dark also yeah two kills so it was yeah it was not bryce wait bryce lied yeah wait it was cap i told you that's hot okay specifically somebody was on cams do you see anything it was actually rob on cam's because i was hard-sussing him i thought he was gonna kill shark and then uh rob was on it but he's dead what do we know yeah you you were moving a little bit suspicious wait who's talking kevin i thought i for sure thought rob was it because he was moving all suspect just standing by the wall i don't know if he was talking to chad or what and so i kept going back to check to make sure he wasn't there but he was on cams when the lights went out because i went down to the tree room then case night killed him i did not sure where was the body of course okay wait who does the crafty's body is like near water wheels but outside to the right yeah but let me tell you this if rob was on cams i was literally just saying whoever's on camps has to be the or like either has to be the killer or somebody that's near him has to be the killer okay i went away from the lights because lights went out as i was walking towards me speaking my piece yes on the situation okay i go to check vitals and who's dead white i believe so it's crafty so i'm like let me report this go to report it lights are off so i'm sitting at the button trying to click it so in between when i saw him on vitals and you guys never fixing the lights was the second bug so the first part i died pretty soon i see and that's why this you own because i legit was just following sharky and rob why would i kill then who is it it's gotta be you no it's not me why would i admit that i saw him if i wouldn't wait fix life yeah please that's not how i wanted that to play out i was excuse i was gonna click the button i was like don't say he's got in a second killing he did and i was gonna try and say what's the kill cooldown because maybe they could have gotten two kills which is true um but ultimately uh didn't work out but at the end of the day it's sorry feels good feels right oh my god okay i felt like burning man dude i don't know either i've never been who had me thinking you were going to murderize me i was doing the exact same thing you were i like kevin from like most people because i was terrified oh i just saw shark and fruit chasing me like just with a mission well um you pushed for kevin so well only because i no one gave context that shark was with case night before well we don't we don't even know that that's wrong yet right because here's what i went out i was leaving med bay i was entering like the common area i see the cam's on lights start going out so i'm like oh they're trying to set me up i thought maybe the killer was on cams so i go straight south all right and then i was talking to myself i was commenting about how whoever's on cams is probably the killer or somebody that's with them if they're dead that's why i asked at the start who's on camps because i was trying to figure out if the killer would admit that they were on cams case night covered for rob but i didn't know that k-side was walking with shark i thought case night was just there so if that doesn't make you believe me it's no no it's not it's not that i don't believe you i actually think that there's a chance that you were right because if there was if there was two killers they would have just needed one kill to win and i mean maybe it was close i don't know we have to figure this out right now okay shark's been talking like he's impostor since the start that's that's that no no i have not i've been talking like i always talk normally okay shark usually is suspect i'm honestly not suss of shark right now who are you who who's skipping between don and fruit who skip vote last round excuse me i don't know i don't know i'm going home i went for point fingers at me every time voting fruit out for no reason i'm tired [Music] oh my god yo i thought it was shark i can't believe i killed both of them that round all right crewmate christian reporting for duty it's ya boy you know i think someone's gonna pull off a kill here sometime soon but i guess there's always some people watching i don't know if you could get away with it now and do i really want to scan first no i'm going to blindly no i'm going to blindly trust bridge bridge rich come with me come with me no no bridge no okay well there goes my alibi feels bad witness me i'm not gonna hold my skin though i'm not gonna meta i'm not gonna be that guy perfect holy i got i got that oh i'm i'm hiding i'm hiding in mine we just came out let's rob don't come in here rob okay all right so at the very least i know rod came up from specimen if i see a body nobody okay all right maybe he was looking for someone to kill oh see he's gonna call reactor then come back down and kill me i'm calling it i'm calling it and i could be wrong but i'm gonna pretend like i just know exactly what i'm talking about i'm talking about but i got the holy trinity they say oh i thought i died whoa oh jeez okay kills three kills yeah people are moving fast so i think that their kid was super fresh so i don't think it could have been the third one at least couldn't have been shark and ohm no the third one the third one was shark and it was immediate and he self-reported because i was a vital victor wait i want both bodies and shark we're right tower that is the body though where is the body yeah wait wait no who was with us rob it was shark dude but i don't know where a body was yeah shark where shark left bottom right he was already heading towards basically towards light direction i'm so confused right now no i'm not on vitals right right now i was on vitals before reactor was called there was two i saw a body drop like a domino body dead body domino so it's got to be something on vitals i don't know where the bodies are when i'm out okay wait wait we got to figure this out robbie and i okay shark i don't i don't i don't think we should vote on seven but i do think it's shark all right no no no no no no shark's movement was so suspicious just ran away are you not on tower anymore here is my movement which is not slush okay i was at telescope all right just get the power tower should feel bad okay power we need to know about tower that tower i went to the right side rob was already there i was gonna hide behind there and i was like okay rob got discovered and then i went down and i went left shady came from the left side i don't know why shady will run away from the left side if rob was already holding it so shady doubles because he's seven and i'm also gonna say mr fruit i'll be quiet over there so i think it's shady because he's so quick on trying to like blame me and which he could have just happened i didn't know you left so that's what i wanted to hear were you i didn't even come from left now you're literally out in yourself i came out right now why would he be waiting for a third i don't know sharks also sucks i think i clear rob because he came from specimen there were no bodies around there i don't think he would have had any time and if shark was around him and shark didn't see i'm thinking rob's good i might live to regret this oh okay okay now i recall it shady i do yeah picture story okay here's what happened i gotta fix my story because my memory is very broken please forgive me so i do remember you coming from med bay but i remember you doubling back right before i found the body so that's why i was very suss of you i mean there was nobody i never went past the gasoline room like there was no double backing hey wait first off bryce and don where were you last round uh i was in o2 last night mr fruit rob i saw you you came out of specimen room which is why i soft clear rob because there was nothing in the specimen room i'll tell you this and if he saw a shark snap with rob immediately in the first game i go straight to specimen with tech yeah that's what i'm saying i soft clear you last round so i'm saying okay that's what i know i saw you in specimen i went down i was looking for bodies nothing by the time it was called so i solved clear rob that's where i was i was in specimen i got three tasks down there i thought it was a goner donna bryce where are you i said i was in o2 i was an admin i want to say this too i didn't know that shark had left the tower but i know that us three were at the right when some who said that they the bot or the kill just happened was it shady or who i saw the body the vitals domino'd before okay but before if you were on vitals and you saw two kills though why don't you do anything i can't okay see these votes right here we need three more than that katie are you still stuck in between dawn i'm not like i don't want to throw i don't want to be third impossible i want to say donna bryce your boat just seemed like a self report to me they're the only ones way far away from it except for me which i mean yeah sure that's sus whatever but this was nope nope nope i am not going bryce no sir nope sure is bryce following me oh i'm sorry bryce uh do we have a problem the reason you would jump in a specimen and then jump right out i don't even know if i should download now no i'm not i'm not there's got to be a kill ah it's too late now there's someone there's someone a specimen someone in electrical someone specimen or someone an electrical somebody's not something nobody's dead nobody's done who came out at me bro rice don't press stop rice i think i'm gonna die i think this is how i die two people in comps somebody just died in comps who was it nobody wow what the [ __ ] i really thought i was on something ah all right whatever all right at this point you know what detective works up to somebody else i'm gonna do some tasks i'm tash tanner right now i might go for three this thought i round a couple things and every time it turned out to be nothing so could still be bryson just didn't kill me um oh i bet there's two kills all right jenna saw okay well i was clearly wrong about character so it's not shark it's not a shark because that's why that's why i even said i was like i want a third imposter i'm not like super sus but it just seemed like a self report okay so we have to figure this out wait where is everyone i'm in decontam or just leaving decontamination coming into lights right now wait leaving decontam into where into like the map room admin i guess you're coming into lights from right door why lights went out as you were leaving like that o2 area you decided to go out and around instead of going straight up no no they they went out when i was going into the main area where the yeah i guess that's fair as you were crossing through so i came back up hey uh shady yeah you opened that door when i was running up to fix lights correct right yes uh then i go to fix lights correct right now where did you find this body this body was in camera so where were you coming from when you came down to fix that door from electrical and then why didn't you fix lights anyways i think you're confusing that cause lights went out twice this round right hello no no no no i'm saying i'm saying there's lights went out twice this round i fixed lights the first time the second time i just came up from o2 i had to unlock i don't have to unlock that door in the hallway down there with shady all right the bottom door that's blocked right what do you think if the body's in security it had to have happened while the door was locked so i think i ran into shady and the body was there so he ran into security and reported the body rather than go fix lights with me and if he was already in that thing why is he going bottom hallway instead of fixing lights wait a minute i couldn't i never even no it's not because that's crazy man i don't know well played robbie oh blade this man oh but you think it's robbie either that or it's got to be don okay he could just be leading us on but no i think it's dawn but i don't even have a chance because they're all just like robbers i'm going to go down anyway because if there's only if there's still two imposters it's game over anyway um i think it's don oh no i haven't heard anything i haven't placed them but then again i'm getting weird stories i haven't been around anything all i know is soft cleared rob for one kill hard i think i heard clear brice there i really think i do i don't know if no one's so no one's gonna fix lights huh okay so i'm gonna fix that somebody's probably dead though right i don't know i'm just gonna get my task done i'm not gonna i'm not gonna hold the team back excuse me we're close i can feel it oh i was just explaining to my chat how you took uh like you saw robbie become the third and past and you're like all right ally this is fine yeah pretty much shark helped us too by blaming shady as well sharks i was gonna go with shady because i killed right before the body got called which made shark look super sus i was gonna take that to the bank and then ohm killed him and then i was like all right i mean if we're gonna we're gonna kill shady that's cool i had no choice because shark would shark was on cams and i i figured he was gonna catch one of us who did i vent in front of at the very beginning of the game and then save because i definitely screwed up a vent really hard and then i killed him immediately and i trusted you bryce i'm sorry mr fruit [Music] you
