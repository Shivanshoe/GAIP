hi the hope joined my name is mr fruit and welcome back to call of duty modern warfare as we all know with a brand new season means brand new weapons and today we'll be looking at the brand new submachine gun the iso or the iso i don't know however you want to send it which means we'll also be looking at the legendary blueprint for it the conduit the iso is a precision grafted nine millimeter substitute now the conduit is bundled with the attachments you see here oh the conduit look at the barrel wow that grip tape now obviously i am an smg kind of guy you can run and gun even more and that's what i love to do welcome to sold all harbor oh my team's leaving me hey guys wait i just got here and thanks to the brand new inspect weapon button ah the conduit the iso the iso i think i'll fare a little bit better with this than the an-47 although i think to be fair unlike the an-47 there's no real trick to this gun uh you don't need to change its fire mode or anything like that well you'll lose at range but it's simple steps to victory one acquire the weapon to equip the weapon three shoot the weapon succeed as you can see though results may vary we got a couple of camping carls here making in my life a little bit difficult oh head shot tater tot maybe a chili cheese head shot tater tot this time around that sounds real nice okay he's gonna get flushed out by that boom oh what are you doing up there you'll rescue oh my god more importantly how am i alive oh and i see this guy does he see me that was the question oh i'm just making love with that trigger tap tap taparoo watch this i'm gonna read this guy like a book i was gonna say if he doesn't show up soon i'm gonna become the camping carl uh buddy we've got we've got tango's inbound tango's in the area i repeat why don't you go ahead how did you not see that i don't know but i just saved your life how do you plan to repay me i do accept cash checks and credit cards oh oh you're my friend sorry he even started shooting me too like jesus dude freaking me out yes so where is the enemy team exactly i don't know i guess i'll just push into their spawn if they're not going to come find me i'll come find them dead silent i think i found the flank oh watch this yes no i just wanted to get the animation ah g you freaking me out man i might not have assassinated you but i'll make sure to finish the job where's the enemy they're probably gonna want their tags but i'm gonna grab them all for myself yeah she oh sweet moses oh load here they do come though okay oh god i'm gonna go try and score on a and if i fail i'm giving them a lot of free points okay don't mind me just grabbing all this oh my goodness gracious molly mio-mai that's a lot of points i just scored there i died for it but boy was it a noble cause i can already hear the songs they're going to be singing about me to be honest the melody's not quite that catchy and it's a little off-tune but nonetheless i'm flattered i'll be remembered in the names of valhalla forever give me your tags please oh nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice noise okay okay i'm going i'm going i'm scoring now check this out i must admit though i am liking the iso because well i don't like that very fitting you know they're in their natural habitat hiding behind trash did you kill him you did you're nuts what what am i getting shot by what is this like what's going on over here believe this see didn't think i'd see him normally i wouldn't have but fool me one shame on me fool me twice stream on me fool me three times shame on me for me four times shame on me fool me five times and i'll eventually learn oh that's a lot of tags but not many i think i'm just denying tags i can't really score oh wait i whatever i bank some tags there you go team hey we won ah jesus back on the rig huh you know i don't enjoy it and you know i'm i'm out away from my family for months it sucks it's it's also really lonely because all i have are these boners look at this just a big old sausage fest wait a second oh wait there's a lady oh my wife is not gonna like this you were stranded out to sea with who ah ah well look at those lightning fast reflexes from this guy heads up ladies he's single this rig is just one big ginormous skirt oh i meant to slide that's embarrassing one big maze man now remember the way to succeed in modern warfare is to play it slow methodical check those corners you know what i'm saying and i'm telling you all this because don't model your play style after mine it's a terrible idea it doesn't work nine times out of ten but when it does you're like that's what it's about and then you you give yourself this fault like oh that's what it's always like yeah and so you get this little adrenaline rush and you're like yes dopamine give it to me feed it to me and then that puts you in this never-ending trap and then you chase this high forever and you know what i'm starting to think it sounds a lot like i'm a drug addict i'm chasing some dude and chase that dude i did no shame in my game no come back no why are you there harriet tubman no this isn't the right timeline you play a bigger role than this you must understand nice kill me i'm not the way i had to just clean up my my teammates kill with one bullet it's like how does he do it holy recoil bro the sun got in my my eyes i lost my target he blended in with the background and i started shooting and the recoil like i just straight up lost him i know this dude sitting around the corner like that the question is how did he know what you know i might need to invest in some recoil stabilization stonks i'll admit i did replace the commando grip for a sprint to fire speed uh griptape because i'm a slave to the game you know i'm starting to think that was not the play oh this is nice oh it's got to be freezing here whoa excuse me sir can't you see i'm enjoying the how did he hello he's gonna come this way no you just couldn't let me enjoy my cruise could you sir oh this isn't a cruise i'm going to slowly oh wait i only have a couple seconds never mind no more slow no more slow just in time fod ready skirt i don't know who's shooting but i threw grenade you oh jesus christ oh my god if you replay that you can hear the exact moment i pooped myself this right here you hate to see it well good news i'm just playing on the 3v3 map so who needs recoil stabilization when i can literally cough on them and kill them as you can see here which i guess right now that has a whole entirely different meaning when i say that just know i don't mean it like that you know what i'm saying oh my gosh yeah look at these spawns bro give me a second give me a second i'm just just trying to live the best life that i can man what a jump i didn't see that one coming did you ah i was weak you son of a you got lucky but next time can't say the same punk what did i tell you what did i tell you i am a man that ah of my word all right so you you're next i guess can i make this jump yes i can okay you're not the person i'm here for i can't tell i think they're both ghost so it's really hard to tell which one i'm shooting there's two ghosts and then the chick i don't actually know her name miranda alex i think it's alex isn't some maybe oh geez oh what am i doing oh my god i don't know but i actually killed them heard them up there bop run away before they can realize what hit him it's the hit and run tactics you know what i'm saying guerilla warfare at its finest boom i don't know why you would peak but you did and it got me a kill and i can't say thank you enough behind you oh no i gotta reload i gotta reload you what i have to see this what the pickaxe didn't even make remote contact to my body i refused to acknowledge that i got killed there that sex can i can i jump up here okay well you know if i jumped up earlier that actually would have been totally okay but watch i'm gonna stick the wall wait that actually worked i didn't think that was gonna work sometimes i'm like so big brain my omega brain just can't handle it you know what i'm saying it's like wow i'm used to like gassing us up but just like overtly lying to ourselves i never expect whatever we lie to ourselves to actually come true you know what i mean that's what i'm saying will it into existence a broken clock is right two times a day right two times i'm like isn't that insane it's gotta be two times right because i mean unless it's military time but then wait what is it one time okay you know that you know what i'm trying to say here this is daisy [Laughter] you make me sick here it goes oh my god is that a cinder block as if whacking her over the head wasn't enough i just drop it on her but [Music] i don't have any fmj i can't duty figure nice throw he's just gonna jump off oh never mind we got him again i don't know how i'm getting them with these hail marys but best to just take the dubs where you can see you know sometimes yeah i'm guilty of that like yeah it didn't really feel like a win but did you win okay then it's a w you know just leave it there oh geez wait he killed all of us in this little go around oh my look i'm like no i gotta reload freelance thank you to the iso the conduit it led us to victory overall i mean the smg is cool it doesn't really feel like it has a niche it just kind of just kind of feels like an smg which isn't a bad thing you know not everything can be super special you know like not everything can have the an-47 would have hyper burst you know anyway with that said i don't think all much watching absolutely this day i'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music] [Music] you
