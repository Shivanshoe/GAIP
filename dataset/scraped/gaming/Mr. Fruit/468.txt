another entrance yeah stairs go up the stairs go up here right over here go that way and then this one yeah you got flashbangs to lead with uh huh right there yep you're gonna go don't forget your flashes oh yeah you're heading off towards the bomb yeah hurry hurry you run out of time follow the line if somebody did throw smoke before we could even do anything you know trying to cut the dead weight trying to trim the fat that was probably your smoke wasn't it let's be real it was because i thought you were gonna detonate and then we're gonna smoke in there we're gonna go in there with smoke except we couldn't see anything right we could have detonated thrown it farther in that we knew what we were doing in retrospect it wasn't it wasn't a great [Music] idea [Music] foreign
