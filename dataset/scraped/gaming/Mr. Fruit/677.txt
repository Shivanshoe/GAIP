I mean that's not I really feel like people already know those just once it's gonna be great Stewart hello [Music] hi ad ho everyone my name's mr. fruit and welcome to the GG over-easy podcast episode 32 episode x-amount into quarantine I'm not really sure it's all blended together welcome to the quarantine series GG easy yeah I'm gonna be honest mother nature released the corona DLC and I'm I'm just no no no listen YouTube is stopped oh yeah they said they won't do it anymore oh okay plus good news - is this is technically after we do the little intro so as long as we don't say it during the intro - odds are who's the manual reviewer he'll watch the first man and be like whatever actually a fan though he's like man he's like he's like okay like come on you guys got this year's Crona oh I hate to do one job dude plus I just said Corona I didn't say yeah you know I could just be talking about the beer who knows it's just a corona DLC I got to say I'm not a big fan kind of lackluster yeah it's it's honestly just not really that's not true it has chains absolutely I think it has my other than go to the gym gym yeah and currently I'm gonna have to figure out something to do with my hair because it's getting to the point where I can't I can't really keep it up too much more than the style I usually do don't like cut it no no well that's just it I can't touch until quarantine so I have to figure out what I'm gonna like style it because I could absolutely shave my head and I'd look fine does that challenge all right give me a second please don't something like it would never grow back I'd be bald benefits benefits of not having a face are you gonna grow a quarantine beard blue like like just letting you know I just shaved yesterday but he's starting now can he's one day oh I'm not - you trained like Christian I trim there's no point in clean shaving it's just gonna grow back and also I don't really I don't know okay this doesn't make sense to anyone but me but the more you shave it the faster it'll grow back right no but I don't want like the rumor I've heard yeah but that it's like proven to be like I I always believe that too but evidently like very recently it's been debunked that apparently doesn't do it yeah well I mean there's no I look stupid when I fully shave so I'm not gonna do that I looked like a bevy I'll see when I grow up my facial hair dude I look like the kid in fifth grade who hit puberty just a little too soon and I just kind of has like little prickles everywhere I mean the reality reality is do you have to like really work on getting a beard in the first place I fruit he had to he had to work on that thing for like a year more than a year to get to the Viking he is now I wish it reads it is I see an old video yeah it's really weird makes me sick plus I was awesome when you first tried that like first tried growing it out yeah it was uh he was just like September 2018 there's a couple months after I was uh started working out him except it was either September October if I'm gonna know it's just one day like I just hadn't bothered to shave in a while start and I was like what like this is like the most cuz usually I just didn't do it because it never was never full enough or didn't connect but I let it go a little bit and I know it's like wait a second like as I used to never connect here so I was like all right I'll give it like I'll give it until like no-shave November and then enough Shave November was like it's coming together screw it and then I just not kept a sense okay this is gonna be a stupid question cuz I can't picture your face for some reason do you have the part where it goes like this and this so it's like Oh your mouth - okay I just didn't realize I couldn't remember ice cream remember if it was just the bottom and you didn't have mustache no it connects okay I think I'd yeah I don't know if I could pull off the non connection if I didn't say for a month dude I look like a freaking gremlin because then like I grow like the little like weird straight ones down here on my back I hate well the good news is the reason - I didn't grow stuff out for the longest time is because I I have like a little bald spot under my chin and like everything would grow except for this little patch under my chin but now everything's grown out around it you can't tell anymore oh but it's but yeah I still have like a little like divot weight it's it's starting to finally grow in but it's not as much but you can't really tell you could like hide stuff in there that's kind of sorry it's not an orifice and like another world keep like an emergency bandaid in there and like when shake it's bad just wake it out well through those minutes oh yeah just a little pocket like a little cashew or something they'll pick me up I will say though in the in this quarantine life actually today since we mentioned it about disrupting our normal daily lives I got the first pump in since since I started self quarantine because I self quarantined like two weeks before the official quarantine came out bro the whole time here the whole time you were you were a whistleblower I was ahead of them come on now where anyway when you got serious about it that's when we're saying so since that self quarantine so it's been almost a month but after a couple weeks and then the official quarantine everything is like I don't know how long it's gonna be so I got some equipment and put in my garage and everything finally showed up yesterday and so today I did chest try with some cardio and it was amazing mr. fruit pump videos maybe I am unsure a pump let's go that's all I want one-pump chump cuz then I could get like in like maybe like I could get my pump vicariously through you like I get that works I wish otherwise I'd be I'd be the strongest man in the world so yeah that just felt good so that's like helped return a little normality to the quarantine schedule but that week or teen is over are we gonna are you gonna like not go to the gym anymore and just like no I'll still go to the gym well the reason I never originally wanted a home gym was because then they would never leave the house like the gym was the one thing guaranteed beat me and I needed it yeah so now it'll be there because I didn't get a lot like I don't have any fancy machines I would just have a half rack and dumbbells but that's enough to do almost every freeway yeah that's enough to do most free weight stuff but if I want to other cardio things or some machines where you know maybe free weight isn't that yeah what is that called like you're you're not running but you're like pseudo running oh they love to call people running yeah well I have to do that because of my resist or my knee problems oh that's right which so when I went to look at gym equipment okay this is crazy I was like alright well I'll look at like home gym places and I found one place like we serve the most places for gym equipment in North America cuz I okay great yeah this guy ba so it's like picking stuff out yeah oh wow that I've seen that before oh that's at my gym so I'm like picking stuff out this is great alright I gotta go in I go to check out and it's like eight thousand dollars and I'm like and then but I was like that's a lot hold on let me check and I go to the checkout and then they go like enter your address for estimated shipping guess how much the shipping was big I thought that was like witness you know that was just the equipment so just guess how much the shipping was add a 1 in front of that and you're correct yeah thousand twelve thousand dollars for shipping and there wasn't any that was that was the only option it was like three-day Freight that's the only option you had twelve thousand dollars no idea sure so I said alright fine yeah that's fair come let me call up a guy I know I'm he's like yeah it's greatness no so I go okay hold on I go over to Amazon get pretty much everything I wanted to it came out to a fourth of the price originally and everything was free shipping so so I had to wait like a couple weeks on some stuff but yeah it went from $12,000 shipping to nothing and a thousand of equipment to like I want to say like 2500 which is still a good bit but honestly for everything that I got and I got like higher quality stuff I'm good and get the pump in twenty five hundred dollars in fact you did put a price on yeah and but now always have it plus like if I have a busier day or something this way I can just go right down there get a pump in for that day if I need to or I've never had it before cuz the elliptical I can do like fasted cardio in the mornings now and stuff which was never I never wanted to go to the gym for a separate cardio visit because I just a lot of time but now I can like doing cardio yeah oh you didn't do cardio like you don't work out on every stomach before no oh no that's all I ever worked out with an empty stomach if I work out with like a full stomach well you don't be full but you also don't be empty especially when I I'd do something like my heavier stuff and just like pass out you need you need some fuel but anyway that's part of the quarantine that's how that's going and this review of the podcast is going pretty well we have one from no don't play okay boomer episode okay there we go from ven true he rates us nine a half stars thank you very much these guys are not your source for insight into geopolitics and you're not gonna get any useful stock tips but they are hilarious and relatable and honest Thanks what is geode geopolitics was Gio we mean like like Gio like geographical oh I thought it was like G dot oh no no but right above it - because we're moving up in the world we have jet hacker with a 12 star uh oh yeah because this guy gives 12 so I got it yeah this is the podcast I have been looking for the perfect in-between on topic news and gaming would recommend anyone who want to have a good time helps me get through work as well thank you dream team thank you jet Hecker you know what's so funny is when when fruits was talking about what he wanted for the new podcast he was like I don't really I don't really want to like do like current events or like you know like what's in them now I kind of what just want to do something that you know it's like off topic and but we're still you know talking about subjects and and the podcast has quickly become the exact opposite of that yeah Gabe up at this point dude what are we good I am shocked for one I am shocked well originally I wanted to do like a more like a guest kind of podcast but that just doesn't work one when you're not all in person and two when there's when the guest is outnumbered like normally you see it where it's like one-on-ones or maybe sometimes like to them ones but it just didn't really make sense and then I was like alright this is what we do bad so screw it here we are like well I want to add guest on your but then it's like how do we do that you know I want to I mean a weird day at the summit cuz we were all there yeah they were practically just a part of it yeah otherwise would be awkward like three people throwing questions or whatever like button and then the and then they kind of like do I belong here when do I get do I tie and there's you know then I was really like I don't want like a webcam podcast like I don't want to just add like oh yeah let's go yeah by not by choice but by necessity so that how our coronal life is going and before we hop into it let's give a big thanks to our patreon producers Stan's we have Dustin why rich green Pete Benjamin Thomas Wayne Angie Brandon Smith in seven Falco Maria brenes and GP hash and of course we got our big boys the stag big sexy Omega arts safe are you trying not to sneeze are you trying to sneeze window in the basement no your windows bright right behind you like my webcam makes that look way bright it looks like there's a the gates ahead inner side it's like a window well like I'm jealous I wish my office was in the basement right now because I got to tell you sweating buckets oh dude when I move back like I'm moving in the bait I was like my office in the basement was like that's not that's how it is I'm just gonna take my office and move it down it's so cold down here I always remember when I was a kid I was like if I ever work from home because again this is just how everybody works it when we I always remember this when I started working for him I was like okay actually on the lowest floor if I'm gonna work and always in my head but every single time I think about this he rises here as he rises and I cannot stop things under my head like oh if the bottom the bottom floor is always colder than the top floor and I don't know I feel like I have like mental trauma possibly from like one of my teachers from like telling me oh yeah he rises you know so every time I think about something related to Holmes I just I'm just like oh he rises what the [ __ ] what is wrong why okay he rises that's like a dad like thing it's just yeah I don't know why I know it stuck in my head but it's always has been and so whenever I think about Oh working from home gotta be on the ground floor Rises prices bro oh man I never wanted to be in the basement so bad like before like I had to sleep in an unfinished basement for I think like five months while my dad was finishing it because I wanted my room to be in the basement so badly I had to play Halo 3 in an unfinished basement for three years yeah it was dusty dark dank and cold and I loved it well but I mean at that point it does those mics were so bad it no matter where you were what you like I don't know looking back at those default 360 mics with the one little styrofoam earpiece that would connect ya to the front with just like the most garbage my I don't know how I could even hear people I don't know and I remember the day yeah I remember the day for Christmas my like big president was he's like low-end turtle beach's but to me going from the default 360 Mike I remember putting that on and hearing footsteps and being like oh my god like I was I remember I was on the the top of Nero's bridge and I just heard someone like walking around the barrier I was like oh my god this is it I'm going image is what gaming is like this is what gamers are like and then you talked into your microphone and you could hear the Rocky's play-by-play oh my god dude yeah that was a whole other thing that actually wasn't those headphones it's when I got Astra oh it wasn't it's when I saved up and got myself Astros like two years later or something and that's when I was obviously that's when I was like all right now I'm MLG you know like dr. peppers about this dr. peppers about to come to my house I'm about to get that that gaming house or gaming room makeover I'm winning that sweepstake I'm gonna go see t-squared my boy hanging out with stray tripping bro is gonna be sick anyway I was waiting all right I got the Astros finally and then will and behold what ended up happening was what exactly would rob say I would literally just talk in the microphone and while I was talking in the back you were just your sports radio 9 times out of 10 it was like someone casting a baseball Rocky's game yeah I was like I wish it was just like a normal radio station but it's baseballs like you're pissing me off like about all these things for it to be it took me so long to realize - cuz I'd be talking someone goes it's someone listening someone like watching baseball and I don't hear anything so what are you talking about and then like they took like a couple weeks until somebody's like what is that and I'm like oh my god it's my mic and and I email the Astra they had no fix for me now the last time I used Astros I'm pretty sure you and I use the Astros for the same reason that's cuz seananners is like bro Astros hey they're the wave and what do we do we followed our God we followed our God hey well then I need to fall I need to follow him into the the housing market although right not now no I wonder how he's doing right now because apparently cuz for those that don't know I've slipped blue and I know because we're stands but Aereo's hairy hostess seananners last upload she names last Apple it was over a year ago now I'm even - it's been a while it's been like two years yeah it might it's getting close he just stopped uploading and there's like he hasn't made a video since there's no announcement nothing like happened to me didn't die but essentially he was just like I'm kind of over it apparently and now he just manages properties and rents him out and makes mugs money that way and he's just chilling so good for him I feel like that's what I mean property is like the easiest way because so few people have the money to actually invest in property so it's just kind of like yeah just kind of buy some property and rent it out mm-hmm yeah I mean if you're lucky enough to amass the money to own property then like Kratz you get more grabs more money yeah you want money here's more money I mean that's I mean that's how money works you can't get more without investing more hey you got a do you got to play that turnip market you know what those old like 360 stories around like being in the basement did you ever play when it was like you're not supposed to be up at this time so like you'd be playing and since you're in the basement you hear and they're like you go I remembered you I would literally go this is my bed I would be sprinting oh he must use water playing sorry boys sorry sorry sorry like it's down five now my bad my bad let's see the problem for me was while I was in the basement my room was second floor so if I ever got caught there there wasn't really there wasn't but then thankfully later in high school I got to move it it was one of those CR TVs to into my bedroom I remember helping my dad try to carry that thing of the stairs dude there's a recent CR TV's died out Jesus Christ bro I mean maybe you're like hey look I'm surprised I'm surprised Meili hasn't died yet because I figured those people must be tired of carrying around thousand-pound TVs like it's insane see our TVs are like dying you can't find them now well yeah I mean for reasons jeez but once it got into my room there's a lot easier to to be sneaky sneaky did you if you got grounded did they take away your xbox or any or like did they ever take away your gaming from yeah it'd be like two months without Xbox 360 and that's like game over you know I'm saying like for me like that you might as well just told me like what did he do take it away for two months I don't remember there's always some a couple things here and there even though I was like I was like a super good kid it's never really bad yeah it was never like failing classes no like I was talking with Claire the other day because she had like some old book from like her earlier childhood and she was an only kid and so I was like going through this I'll say oh my god I never had that like I never got to do this and it was like well yeah it's cuz I for the brothers and she was like yeah like if I got like an for every a on my like report card I would get like X amount of money too and I'd be like if I if I got A's they'd be like keep it up and if I didn't it'd be like what are you doing and if I never got to see because they're like if you get a see like that's your life is over like forever and that's like man that must be for me it was just like what like you're gonna get A's boy and you're going like mine was like just pass this house there was I've gotten one C of my life and it was known as trig precalc and C no junior year or something and I was just lost and it didn't help one of my best friends was in the class so we would joke around and then the teacher was also just really chill so she like we just joke around during class and so obviously I didn't learn as much as I should but I was like trying and so much so to is like I don't know what I'm doing that that was the only class I've ever gone in for like extra hours I went in for like teacher meetings when I could like when she'd have conference hour or whatever I could go in for that I did extra work at home like I would try bro and it was mainly towards the end of semester I was like I don't know what I'm doing and no I got like this I got like a 78 I think at the end but my parents saw how hard I tried because it wasn't like oh you did it because you gave up or like no you didn't try enough like they saw that I was actually trying to apply myself 78 I was actually super proud yeah cuz it like the final was like 25% and so I was like I don't even think I could have gotten to be but it was super likely I was gonna get a B so I saw that 70 I was like I was this is the happiest I've ever been unlike a grade and it was a C that's the one time one time other words otherwise yeah I guess 75 prepares to just beat my ass what are you doing if I got a deed that's when they would get kicked my ass but I see they make that like that's not good but like it's and you're passing yeah exactly if I could still play soccer at the end of the day that's all I really mattered my dad like if I was as long as I can still academically be eligible my dad here's my grade he's a does that mean you can still kick a soccer ball yep alright good stuff son pretty much dude I don't think he ever I don't know everything I got my xbox or anything like that taking away maybe just like they would try and stop me from playing so much I think one time he took remember on the Xbox 360 the the thing was on the top like the hard drive was on the top yeah I think what time he like figured out that like that's what stored everything and he took that but I'm still able like to play the games but I was able to play like on my profile and stuff and then my parents were divorced too so like if my dad took it away no chance my mom was taking it away from me and supported my video game it and then and then that's when remember when in high school when we would play my dad had the shitty internet and my mom had the coach yeah so it's like yo Robin played my mom my dad's this week like though videogames like all cuz I'd rather have like not play the video game then try and play it and just be red red bar red bar my god us red bar robbed for even like in the first like dream teams I was red bar robbed when you go home I'm here yeah yeah when I came home for breaks and have to record here I was like red bar robbed for like eight well I remember that yeah I remember even then though we'd be like Rob we got destroyed all right I got to go to my mom's and then you go over to your mom's just for her internet to record or something I think I got my stuff over real quick my dad had like god I forgot what a CenturyLink but it was like trash CenturyLink it was so bad and then and then so like if I if I had to take away my dad's there's no chance my mom ever took away from me the only thing my mom ever did though was [ __ ] yell at me at like 2:00 in the morning like stop you know that these video games Robert was like all right like see that for me they'd be like s1 he was gold too and um well yeah for me see the thing is I always had a bedtime up until senior year of high school I had a bedtime bedtime like what like nothing like like it's bet yeah like you're in bed and I think it would increase by like thirty minutes every I like seventh grade I want to say I was like 8 p.m. yeah yeah and and then it would increase by 30 minutes so and so like by junior year I had a bedtime of like 10:30 and then ya finally got like decently and then senior year is finally like all right just yeah but so it's like it was rough weekend's was the best though like Friday and Saturday I'm like I can go to bed whenever yeah although they come in at like 8:00 and be like you should get off and go to bed and I'm like yeah sure thing but then they go to bed nice to have but yeah I was too stressful they would just stop trying to punish me with video games really yeah I would just straight-up move my entire set up but most I would mostly play handheld when I was okay that makes it really cause I couldn't afford like like ps2 or like GameCube or anything like that so I mean eventually I would just start mowing lawns to afford it but they'd never take it away for the most part I was really unproblematic until I got into high school when I got like super bored before I got born and then my parents were like why don't why our Great's of it and I was like it's kind of boring mom at that point they don't understand me MA at that point they would try to limit me but like it like they knew I was still one way or another gonna find out how to play video games they're like alright as long as you go to like a good college and like do what you want to do like you'll be Chilean [ __ ] it you go you go save your Kanto region young well they were so strict when I was younger but I was like the good kid so I would there was nothing to worry about with me I'll use a good one and then by the time I got to high school they were a lot more relaxed because my sister was oh man my sister was like the my sister was like the one who would like go out and party and so they were super strict on us and then like by the end when she I mean she went to college and figured what to do and I was about to go to college they're like yeah you know I guess our kids can handle themselves so they were a lot more relaxed so by the time I was bad it wasn't yeah I mean at that point I mean like what can you do when your kids in high school like realistic like Oh take you video games like oh yeah that's gonna work we're little shits in high school we could figure anything out like but I never got punished like that like crazy punished don't think I remember like the biggest time I got in trouble oh when I was a kid though um I mean I'm not gonna I'm just gonna say Mexican parents y'all know what I'm talking about when I was a kid oh man I she gets whippin my Chancellor well my mom has this I don't remember this but my mom has a story that like when I was a little kid I was being a little [ __ ] and I was like doing something that I was like getting spanked and like she liked the scent I looked at her and I was like that didn't hurt she was like well okay and then she thought about like what her dad did when like she was growing up and like she just like was like all right pull down your pants and like gotta belt and let me tell ya I said it never heard my my mom has a I did the exact same thing one time she was spanking me I go like like that doesn't hurt and as you look whoa and holy [ __ ] up but I got the belt a couple times when I was a young kid because that's what my my paw used to do yeah so my paw is dead that would that would essentially be like my mom my grandma would be like oh just wait till daddy gets home and then it's like oh you know and then you just see like the boots boom boom boom and then gets in the room and Ben takes off the belt but yeah and then they eventually gave up because yeah punish it is they figured out that physical punishment didn't do anything to me but but if they say Christian yeah if they said Christian up disappoint you I would ball and I Billy is that what you want we worry so much and say things like you're the only one we worry about because you're such a problem but like they really don't like they actually worried about everyone because all their kids or shooters but they just like oh if he if he believes he's the problem child

getting an MIP down here in Pueblo and Logan and Eric are gonna drive us back up and I'm really sorry and so I was thinking it was gonna be my dad who's gonna be upset cuz I got at this point I was still playing I was still like playing soccer but I was playing soccer for him but I knew at some point I was gonna quit so like I thought like he'd be upset but like my dad was like I don't know raised in the 70s and the 80s man he partied so he was just like I knew you guys are gonna go down there and do that and he's like before I told you Robert what did I say and what he told me was don't get caught like that's what like just don't get caught if you're gonna do some stupid rocker and I said okay that I won't and he goes you got caught didn't you I was like okay well you're grounded I was like okay and then I call my mom dude and I think my mom is gonna be like the cooler side she was pissed she's like now I gotta try the Pueblo which is like a two and a half hour drive and then like the worst part too is like when we had court for like like our court hearings and stuff like that either drive all the way to Pueblo and be at the courtrooms by 7:30 a.m. which like meant we had to leave here at like 5:30 and like I wasn't able to drive yet so my dad had to drive me oh dude it was so bad and then I didn't have the Xbox for two months because my mom was really upset about it so all I had to do was play soccer now that's all that's the only time I got my video games taken away from me well I did community service so it's not on my record anymore thank you good day good stop dude it would be a nice addition to society yeah you're welcome Society also so you're your cop actually showed up to your court hearing - yes yes I was pissed my dad was pissed - it that guy that he actually showed up on a bunch of 17-year old kids jeez yeah that dude so petty that never had like he's no offense to like police officers who like like hardcore about it but I'm just saying most cops when it comes to like small things like that don't even show up to their court hearings well yeah because they're just like it's fine or like it yeah it doesn't matter I just wanted to make sure they like knew is wrong yeah that's nuts for like some kids getting I mean everyone does that when like I don't understand what that dude but Miss got caught I didn't do it I'm God you didn't do it well I was gonna say hitter during your stories when it's like wow I wasn't like everyone was around me doing it so I got it I was already the exact option I can't tell you how many times in high school people like dude smoke this dude let's party let's go no I'm good come on this person's doing is that yeah okay and then they keep trying and I I go woody really you guys I want you to know that your peer pressure makes me want to do it even less I'm stubborn and that like if someone's peer pressuring me I get stubborn to the fact that I'm like I'm just gonna prove them wrong I'm not gonna do it then I don't do it I never I didn't do anything that's because I hated every single person I ever met leading up into high school but it wasn't it wasn't until college when I like actually met friends I liked that I was like yeah I'll try this I'll try that it's not usually do that stuff when you're around people who you actually want to do it with as opposed to just oh just doing because we're doing it there's a time and a place for everything and it's called College it's true yeah no I didn't do anything college either I pledged dota YouTube just became a famous youtuber - oh well you were party during college I was becoming Kraft mainly I was just playing League ungodly immense and that was at least that was pretty much my freshman year I mean I guess I still went out and mingled and someone whatever but those are all no I mean I still I'm 25 now and I'm still yet to order alcohol ever never ordered myself a drink once I think since turning 21 I have what is it your cosplay Viking because they loved alcohol I know that's the one thing I just can't agree with him you know I go I go back to be like skull and I bet yeah and I do the rob thing like dip it down yeah I bet I bet if it came down to it you'd be a good whiskey man you seem like a whiskey man if I drink hard liquor I have to do this thing I don't I don't drink hard liquor because I hate the taste of it never have I taken a shot or anything with mmm like wow as anyone oh no no one actually no one has I take a shot and then I don't breathe like 30 seconds yeah that's true I take a shot cuz then you don't taste it you don't taste it if you if you don't breathe 30 seconds after just do that and I'll just like something like a halt upon our champagne I don't have to put my nose not to breathe I'm not six so you know I don't want to stay in there at the bars like oh wow guys I just got done taking my shot it does know I just and they're like I just sit there and turn blue and have a big I'm a big firm believer in puke and rally if you guys party puke and rally that's that's the best way to do it I can't tell you how many times to be like yo Rob you good that guy's gotta pee real quick I'll go pee real quick there's like in the bathtub I like that come back I don't but I don't drink very often but what I do I do drink I did I did tequila shot has gone up from three to four though on the pack South trip ooh oh my god that dinner yeah that's it was a lot of fun Larry I said it alright we're done yeah let's do one more all right where is get some more and that you guys well in at the beginning of the thing I think we briefly talked about this but you were like guys don't let me drink more than like three shots and then you're like alright fourth here we go rob was like unspoken word don't just just know out there kids don't think you have to do that to do stuff I didn't do any of it I stood fun in high school in college all right get involved with like sports or the arts I was involved in no extracurricular activities until until I stayed until high school or I mean senior year yes I say you won like everything senior year out did a I did the announcements not me I did not get banned you got bad that's what someone who got banned would say no okay I might not explain this story before I feel like I don't know all the podcasts maybe I don't see us the hard part I do this in real life too I'm like like I know I've told this to somebody but I don't remember who you know I'm saying yeah and so for like all I know they're gonna be oh god mr. foots telling this story again but anyway senior high school I knew I was really good friends with the computer teacher super tight love you mrs. Hauser yeah she's great yeah look at us we'll get us now and so we just started I think the year before doing like video announcements and it'd be like really short like every Wednesday or whatever during like fourth period and for the first like five minutes you just put it on you have all the announcements for the week and that's it and it was your typical high school announcements like yes today is like Spanish class will be meeting after school on Thursday and like that was the announcements and it's like oh my god so I told mrs. tabs like hey I can make these interesting and like people are gonna like this yes I'll make him like people want to watch this and so she's like all right fine so she made a class for me senior year my first period was announcements and like I said mister I was tight and so I'd go there and we'd prepare like during earlier in the week and then we'd shoot Friday or Thursdays and then like edit Friday morning and it was just three of you right it was right it was me Matt Hayden and I feel like I don't think so maybe it was well maybe they'll know it might have been Dallas I don't remember yeah it might have been Dallas anyway there's like three or four of us and she'd essentially give us the sheet that during the normal announcements that's what it used to be they just verbatim like and then and so I'd go okay what it's like the gist okay great and then I would spice it up and then tell everyone like yeah and so I'd be like all right so like we'd make a skit for like every announcement and so we started and like they'd have ideas like okay yeah sure whatever we like film em we had like all the green screen room too and stuff and we do this whole thing and they would do some stuff and uh yeah it's funny guys but then I'd go to the cutting room and just be a bad kid yeah like I'm not gonna ruin their fun while we're recording like yeah they're having fun whatever but then I got a edit like yeah guys that can't make it like that's not going into the announcements well the one Friday I don't come in because I was sick and yeah and so I don't go into edit like I have to come in later in that day and so I go in and fourth period comes or whatever and the announcements come on and I haven't seen them obviously this is new for me and my friend Hannes like yeah dude don't wear like I got this and they just started playing bro and I don't even think my teacher finished him and only thing I really like remember at one point in the announcements it's like Matt on a table and he's doing he's sitting there he's sitting there like this and it's just like panning and it's like 90s porno yeah playing there was like red whistling roses and there was some weird it got a little too sexual and then I think they made some inappropriate joke they said I think he didn't he didn't even take out cuss words either oh my god yeah like it was just oh my god I'm sitting it's like showing titty on ABC like in high school that I was literally just sitting there and everyone's looking at me I'm like this wasn't me I like this this is what you don't see this doesn't happen and so during the end of fourth period someone comes in the class because a Christian Miller I might yep yeah that's me they're like the wisher would call it the whatever the foot to the principal I said the principal needs to see you I'm like oh my god and of course I got called down I got called down to the principal's office and already everybody else was there Matt Cory and they're not Cory odd I think Dallas and Hayden and I'm like huh Mike and I just show up I'm looking at him like guys like I've disappointed dad like you guys had one job and Hayden assured me he's like no dude like yeah yeah I got this I got this and so he's like what you guys did like that wasn't blah blah blah so obviously we got canceled and all this different stuff and I lost that class and blah blah blah well you know what normally would happen like people are like looking forward to the announcements break you're like oh great announcement yeah oh great now it's been it's like looking forward to next time we'd have funny little bits always little skits and we would like we would we would like skirt the line I'm like is this okay but like people go along with it and it's a laugh yeah showed that we cared yeah and people laugh people that was funny and for the first time like first five six minutes of that class wasn't just like and then yeah my friends just going ruin it I had I had a power Waits and on fourth period when announcements were going on and boli hated that we had to watch a taciturn he already hated the announcements because we would like watch him he's like just a waste of time but we're losing time on like lifting we'd be done eating whoa because we watch the announcements we get to be done early so bye guys it is so and like I'm the it just got to that point with Matt he's like alright everybody go to your stations [Laughter] no they use like the announcements to ask somebody to prom and I took like 9 or 10 minutes out of teachers times with that announcement and bully right into me he's like hey Venegas you ever take ten minutes out of my class again I'm making you run no we had we had like little skits I think before Christmas we'd had like a little carol acapella we did we did little skits we're like beards I remember but it would be funny like one of them Freud one of the Spanish class announcements I just sat there and read it off but then instead of my audio I dubbed in like the buzz lightyear speaking Spanish audio and then I just had like a teleprompter like telling you the actual news it was a great stuff I was like I do remember the one time though that I skirted blind it was um yeah where I was like I will see if we get away this one we were talking about some like someone was like polluting the waters and I like there's something it's some issue with the water and they do that and then it like pans to me and I go like thanks man speaking of help [ __ ] mother nature and now I go I go I know I go thanks Matt speaking of a health issues Spanish class because then I was like it talked about like dirty water yeah that one was fine though yeah mr. fruit as a little racist buddy no one yeah but knowing it but see it was like edgy but that wasn't like that was probably the most where I was like I was a cheating that was like mmm I think we'll be all that would might be okay but I'm not telling all the stuff I would have to shower in Colorado there's actually quite a bit monka stolen through that it's not important anyway it was a thottie it's not pointy yeah and as ones were a lot of fun we got canceled but that was like one of the extracurricular things I did and then that kind of launched me into mr. Titan which was like our mail pageant yeah and I hadn't even thought about it but people just voted me in because of or like wrote me in whatever well you were the announcement and the guy running for prom king well I know I had got your prom king no I don't think I'd ran yet it was you know no I thought that was before because the tickets were prom yeah yeah during that I think it was prom king I wasn't gonna do because someone like was like yo like Christian you should do mr. Titans like what I don't know what that is I'll just do it so I like signed up but then that's when after mr. Titan someone wrote me in for prom king I guess or something to like campaign and I never thought about that and then they're like yeah but then so then it was like four or five like candidates and I was one of them so I was like alright fine like I'm not gonna win but I'm gonna have fun with this and then that's when I did my whole campaign thing and we won and then the next year they they like my younger brother told me yeah they like they made it a rule you can't campaign yeah I got I got some of the announcements it was because I make like little I showed it in my story time video I made like little uh the commercials I went all out I thought I wasn't gonna win and apparently it was berry berry power of marketing apparently it was very close I'm sure it was I was I had to do the fire with the with the prom queen and king dance he was like I'm just gonna go like no no I told her oh yeah we were gonna dance I was like you can just get Kody up here like you don't have to dance with me cuz Kody was the one that was good it's supposed to win they're gonna be like the prom couple you had to get away through all high school yeah so I hope you know they broke up so they're yeah it's colorful that's my bad I've ruined it doode if he'd won pranking they like have like eight kids by now it's pumping you're the reason there's a time line you don't win prom king and they end up happily ever after yeah that was the butterflies yeah Rob didn't vote for me very salty yeah dude Cody was my locker partner dude and was like talking to me how badly just wanted to win all the time get rough he was like God he just wants to win so badly and is afraid Christians gonna win I was like dude I'll do what I can you know who wore the crown that took pictures with her me get destroyed right on Invesco Field baby that's me let's go have those pictures still somewhere somewhere I got you got had a little sash and everything I can't find my my all but I did find this remember oh yeah Rob found the sixth grade yearbook and that's me can I see it what's a before hey blue for some reason I wrote I put dots on all my friends like I was like oh he's my friend there's one shackling has I don't get it I have you guys were tight blue okay what is the nickname for sixth grade Christian nerd ass no it's pokey maniac oh my god oh that okay yeah I forgot how cringy sixth grade okay yeah hey I was like uh my sixth grade okay now I'm like okay but then it's like at the time I said what is his favorite movie oh okay so since you're probably saying is great this is probably the first time you're feeling any type of emotion so I'm gonna say Love Actually Jack Black right isn't that movie with Jack Black I don't like they fall in love no get away or something like that I forget which one thing that no but blue it's a Pokemon movie it's a Pokemon my god you actually well you actually told them Pokemon the first movie nope it's not the first one wide flu year 2000 that was my guess not that one what I did I didn't even know myself did it might have been the I guess it's the only other one that's popular latias ones yeah I said oh my heroes his heroes nope huh yeah come on the 9th and I hate the nine like that's always like he's like the ninth movie I don't know like that one why would I you're probably just high on it cuz you were a kid and you really are man that movie was so tight no I don't like people go I think it's the only I think I know which one is it's Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the sea so I was right yeah I was right so what's Pokemon Ranger no well the Latios and latias one was heroes no but then I said Ranger cuz man foe ya know it's Ranger trash I don't like you know that's probably my least favorite one ya know I don't sixth grade Christian who loved it no I was held hostage dude I don't believe it someone was like you're gonna write the ninth and then you also put a cute little star at the end of your signatures that's still the case no I don't know why I did that that's pretty flashy Thanks hey I was a baller dude no one actually even called me polka maniac that was the thing too I remember putting that down there like nickname was like I don't have one vogue mania do it is that when you were competing heavy in Pokemon nah I'd started then but then 7th and 8th where my main years but I'd like seen 6th grade was the first time I went to one that was with Matt when we went with our just the janky-ass decks like imagine some kids looking through the card collection like like I like dragon I pick up date yeah make it like just like no trainers I'm like why would I want trainers so it's just like an energy and bad pokemon and then I go up against like lugia e^x Blastoise CX all these I'm like what are you XS it's just like I just got joy and that's what I was like all right I got a like you actually believe you're gonna win because like you I'm the hero of this story my Pokemon is strongest and then like you actually get in like you loogie X draw six alright this is my draw engine loogie now how's the power to wipe out your entire [ __ ] squad and uh put my Charizard Pokemon Pokemon quickly made me realize I am not the protagonist in this story well anything competitive make sure you geo was like what I was like oh my god these people these people know they really know I was like the [ __ ] idiot who was like oh I'll combine I'll have Dark Magician and three blue eyes I'll be on stopping like going I'm like oh my the Stooges did you drop my ass in Tudor oh my god [ __ ] what that was like furry dude yeah he looks like a brown haired town almost like he has like look plausible for most account savio use them and like it's a sacrifice kuriboh that's kuribohs whole I'm not gonna get that card for you but that's kuribohs whole archetype yeah until I get bone if it like bone if it's benefits you know I'll only be freezing and I sacrifice my kuriboh super winged kuriboh where it's like we're like you okay you buff him up and now like he dick punches your opponent basically he special effect dad dictates like a punch is you get your favorite card game blue um it was for a long time I mean now it's TCG mostly because Pokemon TCG is like God let's go especially over the past five years is God like has like they've upped their game on like the actual artwork so now I'm really back to like just collecting the cards cuz the cards are tight you use my favorite competitively for sure though like how they so they like continuously every single like three years just [ __ ] it up but where do you talk about that you know we're not gonna mess up and release they'd release an expansion oh it this a dream I got a P dude we got a good of everything okay I gotta pee I'm at a lot of water will be a bit and we're back to the G G my ovaries look at the kuriboh card look at the text and then look at like a newer UVO card Oh Mike it's like a small novel my Emperor the mighty master of magic his card reads oh wait a minute I'm a magnet darn right here it's right over the control over this bunk out is a hand if you do that's what happened to Pokemon TCG if like there was just never any band like any rotation because there's no rotating card list it's just power creep power creep our key until you have like small novels and your cards God that's not too terrifying this we got a so car somehow they got to make up stronger than the last room do they that does you do half the version of holographics or no oh yeah you're gonna has super tight holographic so they have like yugioh does this super tight thing where they like release like super like collector's edition versions of hollow so they're like rainbow ray uh rainbowers but like holographic rares and like they like these secret rares that are super they have like like scan lines on them and you know has such tight holographics they're holographic game Trump's pokemons holographic game uh early on absolutely like no doubt but pokemons been on a different level the past five years dude that like King Soopers I went to literally had that like Pokemon like trading card machine that I had never seen before wait what remember the what remember I sent it to you oh that picture yeah like that little Pokemon bending machine yeah that's literally in Fort Collins what the Hank yeah it was literally like there I was like what the hell I'm moving back did you see these ever like and it was literally just a vending machine dedicated to Pokemon cards and I thought that was really cool you're really cool thanks man you know who are also really cool these people who asked questions on our patreon page and whoa you know the best part is we had an entire list of things to talk about and we have talked about literally none of them yeah you're honest well here I'll read our list that we had we had Balor in hype let's get through them hey yeah we're excited cool okay I don't have a key god I'm I don't normally like to swing my cloud around but Braille I'm trying in I want I want boys I'm trying yeah blue we can just play trials and pretend you know I'm trying my hardest quarantines moms who's like she dance is great like please just let her dance please cord we tied so bad quarantine yeah we did talk about quarantine TFT I'm addicted we've been grinding yeah I've been grinding - we back we back on the group we back on that TFT train but then I'll be I'll be off of it in two weeks oh well once probably around Bala room but then the thing to is then I'll probably find myself playing here in there and then and then I'm it's like as soon as I'm back into it I just go it's like VR sickness and half life wish I could play VR because half-life game looks dope but everything didn't really think thought I got VR sickness until I played this game for ten minutes it was like [ __ ] puke that I wish I could remember those like like it's like was literally all around me I just I don't know and then like on VR like when you move something you it's not able to move like this at least with the game I was playing like if you wanted to look on a corner it would literally just jolt you to that corner like yeah it was weird I hated it and video games getting delayed feels bad but mainly last of us yeah what is that did they give a specific date no it just says delayed indefinitely right now and it's because I'm sure like they can't get to like their computers and work well no I mean the game they said the games pretty much almost done it's just that economically it wouldn't proof because like yeah I think literally no one will be able to get physical sales they'll get no physical sales physical such a big part of the market to you like this makes sense it's so weird though I had not bought a physical edition of the game and so long let's I thought pretty sure like 60% of sales are still physical right now well here's the thing I bet you those 60% have never done digital because as soon as I did I was like I'm only getting physical all right I have to get this digital and then I never went back I mean for me personally I was gonna get last of us physical because if there's like really important games to me that I know like you kind of collect it because you know I have to collect it because I want to have the artwork and the gonna have Final Fantasy then physical know probably Final Fantasy is tight but it was never like my one of my main I know there was always a Dragon Quest boy we are here I guess so only knowing physical ones I still get I guess or Pokemon yes I'm that's probably Pokemon is the one I will always get I was gonna last whisk cuz slide the first last of us was like I cried my little baby it can't be downloaded mister miss me like the collector's editions and she Animal Crossing came out as such a perfect time because it was they are shipping all their stuff regardless right right when the quarantine stuff started hitting and oh man Ravel crossing here like I've never seen like a blower program do you think Nintendo fabricated this whole earthly DLC I don't know but if they did I mean they've they made a great choice because Manor make a bank on that game good for you guys over there they're making so many bells bro yeah that was kind of list we had obviously we didn't go into any of death because we have patreon questions alright so this one is this one is it like a question so I thought it was actually pretty nice take on what we're doing here Ethan Stevenson says thoughts on these hot takes so these are our thoughts on these hot takes this was it Ethan subway is the worst sub sandwich train I disagree I think they're I think Quiznos bro Quiznos would have that toast and then they had their special Italian sauce hmm you get a normal sub get it toasted and then on their little bar at the end they'd have Italian dressing as quick as gone and then you why you be speaking to past tense I mean I can't tell you the last time with the Quiznos I'm just saying when I used to go which is like 10 years ago I have no idea the I [ __ ] with tight interests there's so many different sandwich chains now that both of them are pretty I think the taste kinda tastes like [ __ ] Oh what's what's the best sandwich chain firehouse firehouse under fire house in which which probably for me oh I used to like Jimmy John's a lot but y'all say great tuna they got a quick yes depends I guess yeah I think it's just they're bred specifically that I love but firehouse is you know hey guys firehouse is just on a different level I'm sold my house wins because they have their cherry limeade which fun fact my flavor is based off that cherry limeade he asked me for inspiration I was like free and firehouse cherry limeade bro that and then their Italian is great they have a wide variety as well they got cold and hot subs but on rare occasions I'm just feeling Jimmy John's I don't know sometimes sometimes Jimmy John just hits different yeah there's a special sauce in there that they put that makes it different I still think firehouse is definitely my favorite though yeah six six days out of the week I'd say fire hustle yeah I do I do get cravings sometimes for just a specific jimmy-john sandwiched over here that's why I'm saying what jimmy-john sandwich Italian Italians pretty I don't remember exactly one it's just any jimmy-john sandwich they all weigh all of them had like a specific sauce and them it just hits different let me also say this if the if the chips or does not have miss Vicky's sea salt and vinegar I'm out that's a deal-breaker you know like this Wolfert basically miss Vicky's first yeah well damn miss Vicky's jalapeno as long as they have miss Vicky's as long yeah but if you don't you are in the presence of quality right now yeah otherwise you're like bTW I'm saying I'm out all right this next hot take is Chris Evans is hotter than Chris Hemsworth yes that is a hot taken I disagree I think Chris has Hemsworth is probably the most fine man on the face of the earth why I need to see back okay Chris Evans crisp and I need to like see picture from Australia I feel like we're gonna be biased as Americans because Chris Hemsworth is exotic yeah so just naturally we're gonna be like I was like he sounds different I'd actually go Chris Holmes really yeah oh dude Chris that Thor man oh I mean yeah but I'm personally do if you jump in Aki would look if okay if I have to be wiped up probably Chris Evans but like if I'm just thinking like only [ __ ] dude how that happen if you're trying to settle you go with Chris s yeah but like if you're like what the [ __ ] holy it's Chris Hemsworth I look at Chris Hemsworth I go like I can fix him [Laughter] it's close though here's a hot take New Jersey is the worst state I don't I never have either I've been to New Jersey I guess but I will say we're gonna find someone in college who was hardcore New Jersey person she'd always talked about being from New Jersey she was like I miss New Jersey I miss Josie Josie I kind of miss Josie I can't wait getting that that's okay Georgie go Robbie you think it shipped in London and that was it gosh that's the bet now mind you I don't think I've ever met a more stereotype Erica sure if someone from Jersey than her she would smoke menthol Newports we drink every single night she it was she was into Henny before Henny was a thing I was like see when I was in college like oh okay I guess the baddest [ __ ] I've ever met and then as I got older those like nevermind she's just kind of dirty she's doing great she's actually really nice but like but you come on but I mean I mean everyone's every single person knows of her there's some there's some dirty girls in college and you're like oh I looked up worse dates to live in 2020 and according to this was a 2018 survey Louisiana was ranked the worst and New Jersey was ranked 12th so like that 12th best no 12th best oh yeah Oh Susanna was like no who is is the worst it's 50 yo so according to this the top 10 worst which would be 40 to 50 B Louisiana would be 50 Mississippi 49 New Mexico West Virginia Alabama Arkansas Alaska Oklahoma South Carolina and Kentucky and I'm not saying I hate Florida is this is this his heartache because I've never heard that take I don't know I guess these are Ethan's hot takes I don't know I've never was he up against New Jersey button er easy what's the price you got prom with Jersey hates Josie this one is Halo Reach is better than Halo 5 now eat both our trash you're just saying like dog [ __ ] is better than cash it at the end of the day this [ __ ] like it doesn't matter I would say hey we'll fine it's better I paint both hey that's like he'll if I was like what are the first halos I really gave a shot and I don't think I've ever felt like a more mediocre experience in my life yeah so for that reason alone because Reach is older I have to say probably it should be are we talking multiplayer campaign cuz campaign reason is I think as a game in general for me high fives game times the whatever really played reach I think I played with you guys on on Steam right well you didn't you missed like the the genuine like experience but um I when I played he'll if I'm I was like this is this halo yeah well I mean halos had an identity crisis for a while but I would still say halo 5 just because I still think it made some important improvements at least for me like it was more of a halo 3 than the Halo Reach for sure this one I don't think it's very hot tik-tok is inferior to vine I think if you talk to any of us I think I feel like tick tock has quickly become more influential in vine personally really if you still see so many do you see so many tick tock memes nowadays and I would say it's more influential I think tick tock I mean purely because of how its managed to keep by four years old Rob four years all the Rob cut it cut it Rob you can't say so no one says do it for the buy anymore but you know and we're just this tick tock trying to bring you back to whatever we get it we're gonna bring back the Daniel we're gonna believes that come from vine are better than the tick tock I mean my cousin Terry out here stamina oh I mean I think you I think you underestimate how many memes come from tick tock now do you see oh yeah I think I'm more up-to-date because Claire is all in the tick tock so like every night I get an update like here's all the tick tock so I think I mean as far as I can tell especially in my little sphere it seems tick tock has definitely been more influential but also tick tock has just I feel like has turned into like a dance [ __ ] like everybody's everything that was vine to vine would go but like take talk more so is like oh like for like thank you sure I feel like Drake came out with that to see song and which first of all is not that good I think I'm really drain so I think he really just made that track literally for a tick tock it's like put your right foot and then through the to see slide it's stupid I know I'm you'd rate its marketing I mean you see cuz you'll see you'll see the power of tick tock if there's some song people start tick tock it blows up yeah exactly i I think tick tock is has rapidly become better than mine and I think part of it is I loved vines the that you had to get it down to seven seconds but the fact that tick-tock allows more than that does mean you get a wider variety of content you get so many better skits from Sam why aren't you guys on tape talk your I see you're right get one Monday I'm going tick-tock and playing fortnight I'm out because our YouTube and twitch guys we're gonna take talk guys well yeah can be if whatever whatever memes happen to us end up on Twitter anyway so so thank you thank you eight thanks I kind of like that hot take thing maybe you'll see more of those this is from Alex black what were your guys is first jobs and what and what was an interesting story from that job that you guys have had uh my like first job was a soccer referee for like Kiwi kids but like I hate I only did that drop like two months and then I got a job at a golf course here where i live and i valeted cars for about like three or four years until i started streaming and that was pretty much like my first job and an interesting story from that I remember dr rich expensive cars I mean dad I got to drive like Porsches mg any any car you can think of Rolls Royce summaries like some cameras he had double bugs Camrys some station wagons Mercedes CL X we have a different idea of nice credit so one time so this like area of like Colorado Golf Club is it's like it's kind of like in like the they kind of try and make it look like a prairie kind of a sense so there's a lot of wildlife there so there was this one bird I forget what it is but they just [ __ ] they just do what birds do and just don't shut the [ __ ] up they're just classic mating call the general manager Mart and there was one that like had made a nest that was like right under that like so like here's the valet circle and then like here's like the over part of it overhang I guess into like the clubhouse so one time the GM comes out and he's like I'm sick of this bird and he's like Robert can you pull up my car and it was Marshall first of all Marshall then Todd like thanks I cried Robert can you go to like you know I haven't got my car I was like yeah Marshall why do you talk like that so like I grabbed Marshalls car also Marshall had like this in Fitness Infiniti Quattro dude and it was stick the only Infiniti I've ever seen to have stick dude and that thing was tight bro like if you know if you drive stick to this clutch was literally like if I put it in first I would literally have to go like some look like I if I like didn't like automatically like perfectly time it the cards [ __ ] stall out and you don't want to stall out the [ __ ] GM's car so anytime somebody wanted to drive my was car even was like nope I'm not driving it you driving so like I'm bringing up Marshalls car and I was like here Marshall here the keys like have a good day he said oh I'm not leaving I was like what are you doing he literally opens his trunk grabs like this pellet gun or like a shot like something to shoot like like I think to shoot quail and he literally like he's like can I borrow like the desk and he like he really like props it up and it's just like wait and then it like starts flying away and he's you're hot he shoots the thing hands me the gun ghost picks up the bird throws it away and then I had to go and put the shotgun away and then he got fired because of that really yes swear to God that pretty wild story I loved that job though that job was one of the dopest jobs ever if you could ever work as a valet at a golf course do it I loved that job I miss it sometimes Pepa oh I mean like no no no no I seeing like and then like but like and that's the thing when you work at a golf course like that dude anybody that came there was happy because they were here to play [ __ ] golf so they were always stoked and happy to be there I never really had to deal with people like oh how you do today I'm mad cuz I'm coming to my $50,000 a year Golf Club facility they're always they're always so happy pulling up like I'm glad to be here I prayed too much and they were most of them were just old boomers but they were all really cool and they all really liked me yeah he's got to drive their cars yeah and I never I never I never crashed any I never crashed any I'd to this day never did never messed it up one time though so you know when like new places are being built they had those weird hey things like a circle of hey and then they had the spokes in him to hold him down you know what I'm talking about it's like for native for some I don't know they had it but so so somebody had like backed a car up and it went over one and it went into the spokes Oh like a wooden spoke was like now hanging into the bumper of a car so when they parked it like that in the morning that's how they part this so now they had three spokes of wood like underneath the bumper of a car so now when I was told to go pick up the car like get in the car turn it on start driving forward because at this golf course we had to park everything in Reverse so that's how we knew that like we parked it so this was parked in the a lot so we backed it up in the a lot when over three spoke so I so I turn on the car bro and I've never heard anything like it I like drive off finish your [ __ ] what did I did what did I do and then like I look dude and the bumper and thank God it was like oh I mean I say I say like thank God it was still like a really nice car it was like a Lexus like it was some ladies Lexus but and I was like nah my god as I'm so [ __ ] and then I was like oh wait a second I'm the second [ __ ] I didn't park this car I just I had to take it like this so they had to like find out who like parked it and all that kind of stuff but no I never I never messed up any the cars thank God thank God blue do you have any interesting stories from your first job and what was my first job was at McDonald's and I mean McDonald's is not as nice as it is now back when I worked at McDonald they were still kind of you could find some pretty ratchet-ass McDonald's I don't really remember any I just remember customers being super shady in general and like I remember this one chick we didn't have the best McDonald's okay I'm gonna be on to be chief I was probably the most reliable on the line and general cook there and I'm not a reliable person so that does it so I just remember every single time there was this one chick who would always come with like three kids and they were the shittiest kids I've ever seen in my life and she'd always make like a shitty [ __ ] pun every time like she got her order wrong and her order for some reason would always be wrong and she'd be like I don't know who works there but they need to go back to hamburger Academy and she would like look back at her kids for validation and start laughing with them and I'd be like all right so you [ __ ] suck so but you want a number two lady yeah just tell me what just tell me what you want fine here's some free fries just leave me alone I will say by the probably the story I remember the most I don't remember these two chicks they hate each other they were both not managers but whatever is like right below a manager basically like the crew managers like they would be like above normal employees would be like in their little red shirts and they think they're pretty hot [ __ ] because they're like oh oh I manage you guys today and we had two of them because I I I would work overnight so like right before overnight you'd have two of those crew managers who like what would be leaving the shift and want to be starting it I remember one night I'm pretty ignorant to drama and like people like being passive like I just went there to work and get the [ __ ] out for me for a check I'm here for my paycheck I'm here to flip some burgers and get the [ __ ] out and I'm chilling that's number one night I'm littering in the back just cooking up cooking up some cookies cuz we're low on cookies and your boy the boys got to make sure they pull the employees are nice and fit yeah I'm cooking and cooking up in the back of the back saying cleaning stuff up I come out to put the cookies in the front because they have like the little front display and I just here like right behind me just I'm slowly I turn around let's go to the two crew manager just like being the share each other uh yeah yes it was a girl fight and I'm just uh I still have the cookies in my hand I'm still putting them in the display I'm sorry hold on I got a couple more worldstar I swear I was it like a shitty movie cuz I just sat there I didn't even try to break up I'm gonna put these cookies away bro so everyone was trying to stop them understand they're like slowly putting the cookies what they're fighting about I just I just I just remember that but you saved those cookies just the loudest right behind me did you ever work drive-through blue yeah I mean I work pretty much everything was that light cuz like that's one reason why I knew I could never work food is because I could just not do the multitask enough okay but what else boop boop boop boop boop I Drive Thru Oh what do you want bah bah bah and that I couldn't do that Oh give me your card that's a lot what do you usually it wasn't that bad because you would have like people who would tell be uh so so yeah I mean drive-through is like a lot of multitasking if you're the someone who is in the drive-through you're not just doing drive-through your cleaning trays for the for dine in your you're also watching dishes if you're drive-through so in between when there's like not a lot of traffic you're in the back washing dishes and then yeah you have to sometimes we'd have to go on the line and help out while taking orders so whoever is like on Drive feel like respect you respect people and drive through because they work the hardest I was like I'm surprised you've never worked service job for never right okay that worked service in the sense of parking people's cars but that's it cuz I remember when I was at fruit summit and Rob was like rob was like so nice like hey man take so much hope you have a good night man and I was like oh bro you're like you're the type of employee they're like food services people love and he's like yeah and they worship like yeah because I know I can't I can't do what they're doing I know that for a fact so like and they're giving me food so I gotta be nice to win way I said see I try to do that all the time but I don't think if I didn't work a service shop I would be that person well I think people are just nice too or like I'd like to think that more people like that I'd say there is nothing that makes you question humanity more than working drive-through people when you get in the way people's food oh my god people are shittiest people I've ever met in my life have been through drive-thru I don't think it's [ __ ] so funny cuz I don't think any job has taught me more than McDonald's about like being a good person which is ironic because everyone's like oh you're gonna flip burgers but no you work drive-through do you treat people not nicer because I watched humanity in a different lens you wash you baby when they're hungry and man people are dicks I also McDonald's taught me kindness like that is my dad who is the still to this day in Bera Singh when you go through drive-thru this is my dad in the driver to keep PTSD okay just pull up hello no literally we just pulled in rolls down window hello yes sir it'll just be a moment okay oh so I'm like dad please we'll just go odd number two uh coke and then like he's just really just the worse than the driver like I was always in the passenger seat like thank you thank you so what the worst is when people like you when you're like hey sorry sir can you say one second before I take your order and they're like no with you sorry you're gonna have to you're gonna have to wait no I need to order right now I need to be somewhere sorry man just give me one minute and like they're literally in your ear while you're doing what you have to do like like yeah I want a number two I wouldn't number two at number five and then like they'll like repeat the digits say their whole order while I just told them sorry man big enough to give me a second before I take your order and then they think they're done right so they'll roll up and they're like yeah what's my total I'm like ma'am I'm sorry I couldn't take your order I told you to wait and she's like well I told you my order I'm not gonna repeat it and I'm like okay well you're not getting your food so you might as well keep your order again and of course they want their food so what do they do they give me the order again God people people like that too I'm like my dad goes hello my dad there's six other cars in front of us right now what is taking our order five seconds before you said hello you're gonna do crazy six some people just don't think like then how did you try to be so nice whenever I go food service now like whenever people are like sir I'm so sorry I have to you can have to wait for a couple minutes and I'm like that's totally fine oh yeah no problem in like I'm just like I just Dukes like man I've been there she's probably like she probably thinks I [ __ ] hate her like I feel so bad that's what I do I think to like men they're probably busting their ass back there I try and give him the benefit of that but then sometimes I have a limit though if I'm like waiting for like 10 minutes it's alright what we doing do you have any fun jobs Christian from your programming years your data entry yeah well my first show is basic data entry so absolutely no interesting stories know anything what's basic data do you ever see like is like a tube between the one-zero-zero-one no it's literally just here's a stack of like a thousand paper okay and then each one has like per page there's probably like 25 items you sit there all right put it to your left you look at that while you're on your keyboard okay a 7 0 - 9 - intention and tab you're in an Excel spreadsheet you agree you do all 25 and then you gotta make sure you put everything in right cuz if you don't you then have to go through all thousand pages and figure what you put in wrong yeah okay you put your next one all right and this was a tap it was a tap and that was my life the only thing I found out about myself during this time was that I am a workaholic and now I know that but that's when I first discovered it because I could work my own hours and so I just I'd go home from work from school I'd be like alright I need to worry like well yeah but then I'd like to be watching TV and there's but why am i watching TV I can just go do this data entry and make money and so then it was your school basically a d'être school based at an at your school based data entry and then you bought a computer yeah and then I and then Here I am made some gotham's any posture videos it's actually pretty good question this will be our last one this is from a surgical cell a question for the podcast has there ever been a movie that has been so bad that you just turned it off instead of finishing it if I could have it would have been Avatar The Last Airbender but it was I was in the movie theater with a group of friends otherwise I would have walked out of them you never walked out no that movie I I have I ever my parents did when I was younger because like they didn't realize what movie we were in but that was about it otherwise I usually just stick through it I don't know it was like a wolf feral comedy but I was younger and they like didn't realize I don't know I've only walked out of one movie in my entire life and it wasn't because the movie was bad is because it was making Sydney and I sick it was that new Blair Witch Project and there's something about when the cameras like we're gonna get out of here like it literally I wanna throw up I warned me late I never saw Cloverfield in a movie theater and I still haven't like seen him I've only seen like clips of it like I've seen Cloverfield I thought that would make me nauseous but it didn't I loved but go I would keep going like just that new player Witch Project movie I forget like what it was called and it was trash it was trash and it made me so sick it's probably about of like 20 bucks it was a new one it was the moment like they're always at 9 I was at 9 years old did you guys ever watch the original Blair Witch that [ __ ] like actually fun okay well I haven't because like but that Sydney was like can we like go and I was like I never thought you'd ask for me was the Dragon Ball movie Dragonball Evolution I'm sorry my dad took me and I was I was so excited and my dad was left and my dad was like oh I like Dragon Ball too but I mean you know he was just but he was like watching watch but he was he liked it cuz his obviously like dudes beating the [ __ ] up dudes like that was tight it's like yeah he's like yeah my mom was like no no no this show was terrible my dad was like cause she was kind of [ __ ] it's just kind of tight so he took me to it cuz he was like yeah it's cool show I'll go watch it with you and I'm just sitting there and I see little big edge look on my dad's face he's just like oh my god Jesus and and I had to save over the Utes in the end or I just look at my dad and like hey can we just go you know it's just like yeah let's go damn you literally why that it was man I don't know how I don't know what they put that thirty million budget into because that was like watching like a b-grade porn movie with how bad that movie was it was oh my god I don't want to think about that movie I was so excited a kid when I went to go watch it to you man I was so excited yeah live-action just except truffle wanted to see cats just to see how bad it really was but I ended up not seeing it yeah I'm I'm good what is the aim all right here's a question when is the next time you think we're gonna be able to go into a movie theater uh honestly man like I'm thinking like October well here's the problem her purse for me I think what's probably gonna happen is I think this is gonna be one of those moments where people realize we really don't need theatres for movies to succeed I feel like theatres are so like movies though I still like I like doing the movie painting yeah but I like enjoy that I mean it's hard to tell because I think well as long as we're smart about it it's like it's not gonna go from quarantine to normal day yeah like we can slowly start to like open things up and then still limit the amount of people at capacity in certain place there's like the movie theater could open up but like 25 percent capacity or like X amount of people per viewing but the problem is right now we don't know how many movies are being finished because so many projects have just been postponed yeah so I don't know how many movies are gonna be ready yeah I don't think we're gonna be back to normalcy of crowds like that honestly for years I mean you know so I crew normalcy is what we're used to I don't think I'm gonna be like that for like thinking about it's gonna be at least a full year from now it'll yeah probably around next really like summer blockbusters might do yeah but yeah I would say so yeah to be the case for sports then Oh hundred percent yeah I don't know though a lot of the people that go are boomers and they uh I feel like they just a lot of them just don't [ __ ] it yeah and I don't mean that in like a disrespectful way but it is a lot of people that go to games you have like a younger but then there's also a really big older generation and especially for them to it's like if they go to games they've been doing it for years and years and years so these are like people who like sim take a whole bias right there like corona I went through measles I went through smoke I went through I would do all that I was fine it wasn't nothing then I could go to a sports game I'll be fine that young man on the bench taught me a lot you know yeah blue where can people sitting on a bench find you on the Internet hey man you could find me everywhere at blue Osler can find me everywhere Robbie Vee you find me everywhere mr. fruit that's been another episode Gigi over easy quarantine edition
