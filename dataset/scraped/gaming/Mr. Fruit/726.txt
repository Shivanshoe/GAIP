hi ad hope you won money miss mr. fruit and welcome back to call duty modern warfare and in today's video we'll be looking at the last LMG we need to get for a Damascus the mg34 would Jill look at that honestly from playing battlefront kind of looks like a battlefront weapon I bet you can't guess the attachments we have on this the FSS stubby barrel for the 80s beta movements made by Mel watt laser for the head sprint 5-speed no stock stock for the moments with a DSP that Gucci's sleight of hand and it wouldn't be a mr. fruit video without it who is stippled griptape so I'm go ahead and hop in on my paws dirty old house bout here and we're gonna measure up somebody in failures here you know I have to admit this might be my favorite LMG I don't know something about it just tickles my fancy Ironsides kind of butts actually dent what okay I don't know my friend died I started so anyway I started blasting got that you're my friend I'm Stock God you are my friend better start for some reason ah the recoil is real some reason started think about anime gonna start singing 7ro - theme song which reminded me tonight I'm gonna go see than you might hear a movie and I am oh so excited although apparently is gonna have quite a bit of spoilers for those that don't read the manga which would be me okay can I get a kill okay there we go you know that I'm thinking about it I don't really know why this is my favorite the magazine a small recalls pretty intense I can barely see through the iron sights but then again at the end of the day fudge me this is exactly how I made the weapon so it's not really the weapons fault like if I want to sit there and shoot it arranged well then maybe I should make the gun be good at that but instead I made it good well I wouldn't say good at running gunning but at least having some viability in the run and gun Department this is just yeah it's just I can't see whoa looks like I just jumped into the game I'm kind of added here so that no one else sees the beginning of the game that's great yeah there's no point there's oh my god oh this is this is a massacre oh my gosh the virus takes even more more victims dad I'm okay I'm alright I'm over I'm gonna name my steam name first I wonder it wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I shouldn't be saying that in a video apparently you get like instantly demonetised so this unnamed thing that is happening around the world that is very very you I'm actually can I'm actually kind of getting tilted why is this like this is this is going horribly she's just so just well I did just record a battle right video and it we lost a lot I mean we the video hasn't come out yet it went really well and I hope you all watch the video because I did want to play it I really wanted to play it and then after I got done recording I was like I wonder what's going on this game and that's what I realized yeah they announced the last content update for it last like the October or something and they've left the game so that also kind of tilted me as I go okay cool well just another dead game I like just add that to an infinite list at this point what is it with me and being drawn towards dead games I mentioned in that video too maybe I shouldn't make a video game because clearly my taste in video games is a very niche genre or appeal that very quickly dies so yeah maybe maybe it's better but that's aside the worlds like no fruit nobody wants your ideas well like imagine if I made another battleborn ish I just think I just don't think this Ivan died nothing new we did it but there's something I was like yeah I can't wait to use as LMG but oMG this is not going well goodness gracious Lord Almighty I was like what is that thing well it's a sin it's a century gun mr. fruit that's what it is alright give me a couple minutes I don't know why it comes with 50 in the mag loses all the bullets real fast can't kill for the life of it and it takes forever to reload welcome to the m ditch hide in the corner hide in the corner we're okay we're fine this is fine this is oh this is okay all right all right I'm a bet you know what second game I'm completely renovating this thing no never mind I'm doing it right now all right screw it I changed the the the loadout let's see this oh my god I still have like a couple 80s increase look at this thing oh my god I thought I thought it was decent before but then look at oh my god it's it's so bad but I invested in recoil control invested in those stomachs rather than the Dow because we know that's going right now thanks to an unnamed event happening throughout the world that the World Health Organization could tell you what what do you do it in the corner right there that the World Health Organization could tell you all about but I can't say the name of it in hopes that I could actually make some money off this video chopper gunner really yeah please just make my life worse descripton i'm just humble I'm going in I'm going here yeah this road scrap his Oh hide under the thing he doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know okay just oh my god he doesn't know Oh like no one knows about this this is this is our little secret you know if I ever need to call and killstreaks will that's where I should hide right here all there's a dock I want to see what this looks like he heard it shoot Edna please pity me I you were though this is a rough first game but you know what's important about those they they are supposed to invigorate you to help you rally for a next game Yeah right right I feel like when I'm playing with my friends like Rob and he gets really upset with Rob it's just like you get angry dude yeah like channel that for the next round now I realize why it never helps him cuz it cuz that pep top certainly a helping me right now that was an assist at least sweet Moses okay okay we gotta kill seat now we can we can perch up here but I don't I don't think I've slide a hand so oh my god oh you're friendly thank God Jesus Christ why does that take so long I'm so Sheltie right now I'm so salty my mouth is like or just a like ten saltine crackers it's rather dry crummy an extremely salty extremely extremely salty I'm like sotc Dutch we're back on rust I'm getting PTSD interesting idea to think about which I don't know why if you saw a siren and you knew the price but it was like the most beautiful gal you ever seen the voice quite literally an angel would you do it would you drown in editon would drown or like no not worth it I don't know it depends you know I'm saying maybe you're under that half-fish kind of thing I'm not one to judge geez so like dogs did not like that I am very clearly not a siren which an dogs are running the opposite way I would turned all the Sailor boys away maybe like oh no that isn't that what were you thought no thank you where they even come up with the myth of sirens clearly it's based in actual fact you know so maybe some dude drank a little too much seawater oh my god get off you really spawn there drank a little too much seawater you don't I'm saying is a little high on some shelf I can barely make you out in the corner I will kill you you have like nowhere to run okay that took way too many bullets but we got the job done okay okay okay we're making a turn around this game I'm feeling a lot better about this one just kind of start talking about sirens gee it's good wow that's incredible all right look what he did he got with a sniper did he like you hit fire me or something died died died aah Oh heart palpitation oh god I wash how about that scarlet you guys know what I'm talking about oh it's like it's like it almost feels like you have like a pocket and your lung or something you can't take a deep breath and if you do or try it hurts so you have to take short shallow breaths and you have no idea how long it could last it could be like two minutes I'm at it last 30 minutes kada just hit me randomly seems to happen a lot more when I'm sick and well I'm still sick I've looked it up I don't know if it happens to a lot of people but I do know that apparently if you try to take a deep breath you run the risk of collapsing a lung apparently something like that I don't know if that's if I was looking the right thing up but needless to say it's terrifying and I'll never take a deep breath not that I want to I don't like it I can't explain you how much it hurts all this I would have to say to me it was like hey they'll take your chest pain away all right script I'd immediately hop in there wouldn't matter phone and phone in my pocket screw it when I guess who wouldn't wouldn't need my phone if I'm dead but maybe if I but they like drown you right well but then maybe I drown become like a sea man or a merman that's what they're called Yammer man and maybe maybe I get bored you know anyone play some mobile games cuz I am a gamer started out well and it's not going well anymore everything changed when the air pocket attacked my lungs where's the fire nation now that's huh can't get a break that's that's what it must be someone is using airbending to take the air out of me kind of like blood bending you know that's Rask us why am I getting it is someone marking dudes with a UAV like a drone who in the world uses that I don't know but shout-out to you I like thank you thank you very much oh there the phone goes looking for I can do a better Alice NAT I'm gonna [ __ ] you thank you very much you are nothing but a hound dog cryin all time you're not a guy at all the time and I guys mm down Hannah don't know the words that's all all I know is your hand up you rascal you dead jump around that corner god precision German engineering at its finest I'm neither charming nor do I think this gun is I don't know how that applies but you'll just have to take my word for it which I wouldn't that I don't trust my word not my work whoa sirens wherever you are please just sing your songs I'll find you and I'll jump right in take me just take me right now please well I sit here lamenting my life enjoy this siren me oh gosh ding is staying ish I forgot to put on the gold cameras and you can enjoy that for one but they love you gunrunner I've played this in a while one of my favorite Maps though dudududu what are you doing hiding in that stairwell right there all right behind right behind right behind me so I just need to find a way to sneak up to him oh you although I did see my friend nicely done mate oh ok oh shoot oh shoot get it ambulance but not for me you're probably familiar with the meme and if you're not what are you doing familiarize yourself oh my god oh my god oh my god how did I survive that I'm really doing it dad um what are we oh come here you hello oh shoot okay back it up back it up back it up this reload is gonna take Oh a while please oh Jesus New York man I almost have myself a VTOL things were actually looking up there of course that's why everything had to go poorly I must save myself screw you fudge alright well that was just a really expensive radar to see that there's someone behind me trying to kill me and if I still die to them how does he know where I am oh well my friend I wasted a cruise missile so I don't hope that's the that's not ah that's not the mantel button I have two mouse buttons and I forgot which one it was in the heat of the moment it's the top mouse button not the bottom one webs holy jesus original raid aren't you saying well there's gonna be nothing personal about it this is like shared airspace bro and you know that we don't like anything flying above above us okay we didn't let the Amazon drones in here and we certainly won't let your personal UAV don't make me do it again trying to spy on me huh I know you heard my singing like where is that magnificent song coming from I must find the siren all right well you sir our route what what did I say this one's a little bit farther away but I'm still not gonna allow it God every time I play just a normal map though I I remember how slow modern warfare is yeah I would've been over by now unlike rust or shipment or anything large with shipping but okay they they have a century gun and technically that is that's not the airspace so they're getting smarter oh nice you shot down the UAV I couldn't see it for some reason I'm blind I left my spectacles back at day I'm gonna get knifed oh thank god trying really hard not to get knifed I almost failed wait is that another personal doesn't know what oh yeah is this the same person is this all they've been doing this entire game my goodness what oh Jesus hold on you know what no no I it left [Music] it took me just as much time to yawn as it did to reload and I'm a that was a big yard okay quickly I must humiliate somebody none of those connected huh a lies mr. fruit he was a terrible soldier the worst soldier but we loved him all the same I gotta kill oh my god I did it yeah and we lost ah but did we I think we're the winners that is not the high note I was hoping to end the light machine gun grind on but nonetheless the light machine kind is done so now on to I'm not sure yet either finish the ride shield the snipers or some assault rifles oh don't know to be honest hope you all enjoyed that video though thank you very much for watching happy she was a fantastic I'll talk to you in the next one very well [Music]
