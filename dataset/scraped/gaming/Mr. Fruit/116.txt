i'm a simple man what what in the lag okay okay that really really really the good news is i can use this whenever hi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2 the 30th anniversary update now before you're like what in the power ranger looking son of a gun hear me out i i changed the color because i put on some of the new like look it made i kind of look like a dragon you know but more or less maybe less than more but you get what i mean and i have this shoulder thing on because what is this i don't know but it is hilarious anyway today is a special day a very exciting day because i have the floor runner which for those who do not know they added a whole bunch of easter egg from bungie's previous games and his 30th anniversary and this is the classic halo ce magnum and this thing was a beast then and i'm hoping it's a beast now it's a sidearm but it takes energy ammo which i'm happy because this thing should hit hard intrinsic trait full stop oversized sidearm with extended range heavy caliber rounds fires full auto with increased rate of fire deals increased precision damage to unshielded targets which it's like that's an you know in halo once you break their shield you you headshot you know you know what i'm saying you've got small board flared magwell smooth grip and pace yourself tapping the trigger gives this weapon less recoil and improves accuracy which one will be the go to play well i guess i'll find out for myself it also has an ornament which you know looks like mint chocolate chip or something looks like something i'm gonna about to brush my teeth with frankly and i mean we're not gonna stop there expect future like freaking they added the br man literally and they called it the bxr oh my god it's too yeah it's yeah it's great stuff i i've never played oni or marathon so i'm sure there's a whole bunch of things in here little nuance you know and easter eggs they're all missed on me i'm gonna be honest but the halo once i'm like oh yeah also i found a new attack cluck beat me up scotty do i really honest okay we're we're starting with iron banner what is this increased respawn times what since when is that a thing i'll put the br on but like you know i kind of want to save it for another video so i'll just put on the submachine gun and like look at this the energy sword from halo ah so i want to get the catalyst because i think that's where you get like the halo frag grenade i imagine like you get a kill and then you get a frag grenade we saw in the trailer can't wait for that however apparently to get the catalyst you got to be like rank 16 wizard on this seasonal activity i i played for a couple hours straight and i'm like not even level six okay yeah all these new pvp changes in iron banner using this new gun this is gonna be great it's gonna be great can't wait look at this beast i only start with eight shots oh jesus okay gotta make him count i guess but look at this like old default god it's like i'm a simple man what in the lag okay can we talk of it can we talk about what just happened how am i supposed to hit that thing set it's not man okay 70 70 to the dome i like that i'm out of ammo okay this is gonna be this is gonna be something and all right yeah that didn't go well but i have friends oh who what the fudge i'm picking up this three bullets is that even enough to kill somebody you're pulling ahead oh well there you go would you look at that i clicked the head and uh turns out it worked yeah great advice guys thank you excuse me fantastic stuff you know i'm gonna try and full auto somebody i've been using the uh you know just tap the trigger approach which is kind of how i prefer to go about things you know i like to be in control um okay well maybe i don't even have to be in control but i guess if you want to maintain ammo and whatnot oh my god oh it's like wow jesus christ was this a golden gun but yeah just a good old team shot oh my god yo but this thing is nice with it oh my god it feels like a hand cannon on crack and ironically it's a sidearm jeez will we oh shoosh help me i'm gonna die guys i'd watch that grenade or you know you could just go right into it yeah sure okay i'd i'd be interested to see you know how to play out but i saw how it played out terribly yeah what am i kidding that was a stupid bite not i can't really judge it it's not like i'm the the pioneer of smart place that is a great grenade placement by me one kill come on two kills yeah he's using the floor runner a touche that was a dad's man dead dead man uh can we take take two this thing is meaty and now you're gonna tell me if i get like kills or something i'm gonna if i get kills i have the opportunity to get a halo franker name like i saw the trailer too and i was so excited because ah jesus christ i'm not excited about that it showed him throwing a true halo frag grenade and then using it to grenade jump and it was so funny i had a friend text me he's like wait do like halo grenades like push you or something i was like oh my god he doesn't know well listen here my friend oh that's that's just 74 to the dumb chief and i'm dead chief oh he's weak he do be thinking about it oh and he's he's stopped thinking about he's so weak opponent claimed zone b okay all right okay what the fudge is this okay well opponent claims was popega but check this out but that really really really we might be able to out frag him but that's only gonna last so long guys oh my god he's one shot he's so weak and i want to punish him but i just can't just can't get enough are you are you what i'm not mad i'm not mad together pop their super i was like okay well there's like no chance anyone else has one left i'm trying to help you man i really am what you're gonna tell me we traded that man was straight up disintegrating fading away he was letting mr stark he wasn't feeling so good and you're going to tell me he he meleed me in the afterlife like that no i refuse i refuse to accept that okay he's weak good you got that you got that let's go zone c captured opponent claimed zone b stupid wait what why what did did my melee not do damage i'm so confused will endure well i'm not confused about that we lost let's see the damage okay okay i mean not bad practically top frag in the entire lobby in fact we had all the top fraggers just uh the head zone advantage and you know the captures and you know the things that help you win the game how the sandbox felt it felt that it didn't i'm just gonna it didn't feel like less supers i'm pretty sure there was it's just i was unfortunate to be near every single super when they popped it and died to it so and it's hard to say about the kinetic stuff because i'm mainly using the forerunner because it's sick but i do look good that's the takeaway right now i'm wearing the pants right now but just because you know i had them unlocked not because like i think i'm making a statement or like trying to change the fashion game no zone b capture it holy jesus but that's not whoops okay watch this guy get yeah i tried to use lightning grenade tried to stick it to the wall until realizing wait missed fruit you would have just you just changed your subclass okay pretty hefty damage fall off as we uh we see there but uh yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna take that uh every day of the week frankly okay and um this just isn't conducive to uh anything frankly okay i'm i'm just i'm gonna i'm getting that heavy ammo because otherwise i don't know what i'm doing i need to kill somebody and take their their special ammo okay or or not there we go there we go but i had to use up my uh very limited energy ammo there we go a couple more shots yeah go ahead and grab some go on go on with your bad self i'm coming friend that did not go well huh yeah no opponent claimed zone c come here come on what okay i hit one of those and um you have yourself a nice day sir i'm out they grab day it's not a great start he's afk bob forget about it that's a double kill no triple okay look at that full auto i see a player who is tactfully not moving frankly oh my god they have two of them okay well now i feel a little bad lost oh just kidding i'll take the dub we would probably 100 percent be nice yeah yeah nice crap shot mean crouch shouters we go way back it's frankly it's not it's bad blood bad blood there i had to reload i'm so bad i'm so bad i'm so bad little triple with the uh the forerunner okay i ran out of ammo but you're dead all three had their backs turned to you shut up that's all i have to say because you make a valid point and i don't have anything re holy jesus to really say oh they did uh change the titan melee dash melee to not be a one shot again which just feels a little weird because like i don't of all the things right now in the sandbox i think holy jesus i i'm pooping my pants oh jesus hold on have mercy oh i just oh oh god what the you're okay that's friendly just a lot of bullets being thrown around oh my god the flick i still got it baby take this oh i don't have a grenade that's awkward okay let me just grab all this ammo yup game's almost over yup but i would prefer to pad the stats a little bit that's it okay well guess not if i could put icarus on this thing oh sheesh brother let me tell you let's uh let's take that one from the top you know there were some afk people look here's what i'm gonna do incoming montage of me popping off guaranteed or your money back even though you didn't give me any money so i can't give you your time back either so actually it's i don't want to get sued so i'm just gonna stop talking iron banner you know what i could do i could just splice together last game in this game as you strategically crop it so you can't see the scoreboard or enemy names and it'll just look like i'm super popping off that can't be that that hard right i'm not thinking about it i should have just taken i would have killed him if i didn't full auto try me oh i'm invisible well how nice just in time for me to die that's a nice name though oh they're oh they're feeling that okay stick to this stick to the script mr fruitcake we're literally we're taking out all the bad clips oh there we go there we go oh my god how oh my how do i do it the good news is i can use this whenever but i'm glad okay i'm dying frankly it's okay that was an unfortunate grenade placement like what in the melee nonsense was that's a nice thing okay they know i'm coming it's it's not a surprise to anyone oh my god oh he's going to kill me i wait how's this for a montage that was in the forerunner just didn't tell me oh my god you know yeah maybe top tree uh uh it's just it's not the play you know i'm thinking just maybe what are you doing here you invisible boner you're gonna help me you're gonna watch me die man really just baited me jesus was it worth it um let me get this straight they made throwing knives one shot again just you know chuck em range um but the very committal slow to recover practically unless you're killing them you're guaranteeing you're gonna die shoulder charge is not a one shot anymore just so we're clear there no miscommunication okay all right that was the the three tap built different built diff oh he's he's got the freaking legs god i hate him dead before he knows where to man hey yeah burn away stupid uh [ __ ] it's it's just like it's widow's court man you know like if i could play of all the d1 maps we brought this back we brought this back did did you like did you i'll get some community members did you do a poll qa like where did we come to decision widows courts where we bring back just just not really i'm really sure guys hello i'm getting baited again i think all right screw you zone advantage is yours oh that was a team shot i was like oh my god it's fine i got three bolts that's all i need okay i was so close i really was i [ __ ] victory we're nuts forerunner consensus it's sick would like a little more shot a little more ammo again it happened to just come at the worst time where now energy ammo is is which is fine don't get me wrong i'm all for that you know primary battles is nice i i i'm down for it i wonder it seems like it you gotta think it's gonna be pretty good pbe right and i can't wait to get the catalyst see uh see what that does interesting honestly you know what the play is as much as i hate to say it like go bow for because it deals increased precision damage done shield targets so straight up bow shot boom you don't have to like fully charge both shot now just bop like body shot them boom there's uh there's theoretical mr fruit destiny theory crafting [Music] [Music] you
