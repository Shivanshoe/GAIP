heidi hello everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to my youtube channel i'm so glad you stopped by today come on in come on in you can leave your coat right there you can leave that for door of yours over there i'm going to be honest not your best look but i support you anyway in all your endeavors and i'm gonna lift you up you look great in it anyway come on in today's video is on a dance of fire and ice a rhythm game that i don't know well actually i can tell you exactly why i picked it up clear showed me this tick tock of somebody playing it and i took it as a challenge and i was like okay i'm gonna play this game myself needless to say i got stuck on world six and there's like 13 of them and it was it was very frustrating i was playing it off camera and i don't think i've ever been so violent with the game i don't it just awakes something in me but i took it i took it personally and i was not going to let the game beat me i had to beat the game so thus began my journey to beat a dance of fire and ice enjoy the video i don't know if you've ever heard of this game [Music] but uh i don't think i've ever reached uh as hard in my life as i have at this game so let me show you how this works uh i'm just gonna go ahead and sk well actually okay so let me show you this is essentially the gist right like this right not bad you know i'll go to world three we're going to bring it back a little bit okay when i originally did this i'm not going to lie it kind of messed me up a little bit but you gotta go on trevor see ready watch uh huh oh look at that okay but here it goes i have to be super focused ah fudge there it is if you miss one you have to restart the entire level there are no checkpoints you have to get every single one i have to be laser focused laser focused otherwise there's no like ready i will attempt to commentate how this is working for me because ideally you have to you have to feel the song out get the beat and then try and mix it up on you uh-huh throwing some shorter stuff there very tricky but once you get the beat down it's not that bad but then they mix it up on you see you think it's like and it's gonna fall a thing and then they're like what if we just changed everything and the problem is you can't just feel the music out if you haven't done it because you have to look and be like how are they going to dick me this time surprise they find several different ways [Music] this is only world 3 by the way there's like 19. let's see you think and then like oh it'll be this but no but then once you get the first one it's a little easier [Music] oh my god i'm the best [Music] i am the best okay this one's very fun very okay so now we're working with sixteenth timing or something i don't know it's very now we'll go through world four right okay it's a little slower but and i really like the music but see they work with like little tricky timings and then they swap it on you as if it wasn't already hard enough what if we just change the rotation but see still i can do this this is still my pace oh wait fudge oh wait shut up me [Music] what the fudge is this [Music] i'm so focused right now [Music] and the problem is you can't even see like half of them so you have to assume what's behind the little thing and then they slow it down [Music] and they speed it up just a little bit [Music] but we go faster this might be their favorite song they've had so far swap it up on me now mind you too if i mess up here i'm restarting this entire thing i have to redo the entire thing doesn't matter how far i got [Applause] that's the most tilting part now of course he did first try cause i'm a gamer but look that took over a minute probably right so if i missed some at the very boom we're restarting it okay world five i think this is oh yeah this one's a very nice one i like this one okay and i like the fast one [Music] very fun oh wait oh look at that one tricky i'm climbing let's see ready they think they'll get me there but they [Music] won't my brain already hurts from focusing oh god what the fudge was that it was all nice and peaceful and then they threw that in jesus you know the first time i did this i didn't fail i swear [Music] [Music] [Music] what see there's there's times like that like i clicked it there's no reason that shouldn't happen so it's like oh that's rough except wait let me start back to the beginning to do this all over again i swear to god i pressed it but whatever but see i've got this beginning part which is fine but that's 50 well what i just got to was maybe 30 of us not even i don't think i don't want to talk about how long it took me to get this part it's because they they have to compensate for the little wieners so instead they like turn things upside down or you'll see later they like literally move it as you go just to make you motion sick and distract you [Music] see okay the part i always mess up on is coming up but see you have to do that perfectly every time just to get back here and it took me about 70 attempts to get here [Music] oh see i bro i had it i pressed it i pressed it and you mess up once 62 percent oh that's fine and it's it's it's what's oh what i'm back at the beginning so just do it all over again perfectly i can't tell you how much this raises my blood pressure because like i know i clicked it [Music] bro it's because they're tiny weiners where they're like hey what if we just put it upside down and then start rotating it for no apparent reason [Music] back at the beginning i wasn't even looking i wasn't in that freaking chat i'm telling you [Music] see it's just so it's something in me dude where it's like i just wanna punch something mistimed that my anus dude done this eight i'm not even looking i'm not even looking you know i'm not go ready right i'm not looking [Music] i got farting i thought it would [Music] start it all over again i have to listen [Music] uh buying this game is the biggest mistake of my life it was only like six bucks [Music] too [Music] [Music] come on please for the love of god let me get past this next part so i can rage at something else please [Music] it's not hard except they're like wait what if we just put it upside down and start spinning it and it's just it's the restarting that gets me dude [Music] oh my god oh my god [Music] i'm doing it [Music] no i saw the i understand why i kept messing up though after stupid like oh look at me um instrumentally who let's throw in a quarter note or whatever like a sixteenth note or like a dippity hippity-boopity-boppity stupid dude [Music] [Music] no no no no no no no [Music] [Music] let's go i am free i am finally three oh i'm i might my way i can't my heart i hate so anxious now here's the deal chap i'm gonna i'm going to go to world seven but if i get to the final level in world seven and it ain't looking good if i if i start getting violent again i think that's when i have to call it but at the very least world six did not beat me how many attempts did it take us let's see i don't know i'm gonna say about 90 attempts it's not great that's not great wait what oh i'm not redoing that no give me the world seven what like to go what's the fudge [Music] okay it's world okay here we go sweet moses i don't want to think about the other worlds right now okay world seven it can't be that bad right [Music] see they like to introduce you to some stuff that's fine okay but [Music] sorry [Music] nailed it nailed it screw your swirly [Music] [Music] okay the outside squares are okay that gives me enough time and i can see what i'm doing but [Music] jesus christ okay offbeat spins yeah i'll say [Music] sorry i'm a gamer next [Music] okay wow that was embarrassing [Music] easy clap okay but oh no see this is what i was worried about that means this last level is all squares so now let's all put it together all right you know what i'm doing in five attempts easy no first attempt ready [Music] [Music] well that was fun no oh 61 i'm telling you this one's i got this one [Music] okay wait shut up me i met it's this the same exact spot okay what the fudge [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] i said we do it in five tries and i did [Music] [Music] you
