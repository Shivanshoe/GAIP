hi eighty over one my name's mr. fruit and welcome to gunfire reborn mesm good content no make sure to subscribe I concur subscribing is the only way anyway there's a brand new roguelike game I stumbled upon steam except you know I'm gonna like it cuz it's a first-person shooter Roble currently there are two heroes I only have one unlocked we have mr. meow mr. wolf yeah so as you'd expect each one has certain attributes then you have certain skills and during the runs they each have different abilities that you can upgrade along the way and then like a lot of rogue lights at the end of the run you get some points that you can spend on some stats to permanently upgrade your character but aside from that you lose it all so let's try this I've only done one run and I lost surprise welcome Oh ladies and gentlemen now the first thing you should know I love the art style so this is the starting room need to activate arm support whatever that is so I imagine that some upgrade you get later on to unlock some perks so let's portal our way into this the tomb of course so I'll show you I most of these guns are at least everyone I've unlocked currently don't have a way to aim down sights kill crossbowmen 15 Oh what is this we've already found ourselves a new gun let's pick this out oh that looked cool so this is what you need to know in your backpack you can carry your weapon one weapon too and then your initial weapon which has infinite ammo and you can't get rid of down here you'll see the actual ammo you have for instance this guy uses large ammo you have ascension which is like I said the skill tree that you have during the run and then the occult Scrolls which are like relics or artifacts and all the other ones that give you like passive bonuses however we have like no ammo so I'm gonna have to rock with this for now until we get some more then we have some abilities boom I deal an explosion it can freeze nearby enemies obviously shoot people in the face that's pretty effective we have a Dodge oh my what is going on here Wow oh well now I've got look at this thing oh my I'm gonna it's a little too sensitive oh oh my boom oh my damage the guns are sick they look cool they all play pretty different which is good because obviously it's an FPS you want things to be shaken up boohoo boohoo boohoo get out of me face oh yeah this could roast soup damage ah finish them off with that and what is this a trip we'll come back rare Manx HP and Mac's shield oh okay hold on I'll reread that in a second enemies are afoot boom use the ability I also have some smoke grenades it's like a poison lingering field and then I can upgrade it to also give me bonuses later on which I'll show you in a second but anyway that's trying to read before I so rudely interrupted max HP and max she will be cut in half but you gained two extra rebirths what that all right so my shield health or doo doo but apparently I get a couple free reza's so yeah I'd say that's worth it we also have a treasure chest because we finish this level and this lets us upgrade our skill tree so I can take reduced damage and do more damage to enemies when they're hurt by my smoker nights my energy orb freezes enemies for extra seconds or after casting my energy orb well shield recharge rate is increased let's just go for some extra fries why don't we and then I am like this so evidently don't ask me oh I can go in these vaults and find something I guess so let's see what's waiting for us in here well it appears to death my friends death is what awaits us you're frozen though low low LEDs highlighted enemies critical hit critical hit red a cool head and it puts him on fire dude that's insane I think that's a pickup where I'm if I was weak I could get it and apparently I completed I completed the quest casual guns Manship extra lucky shot chance which is a chance to deal several times the amount of damage but 20% weapon damage when you don't make a lucky shot hmm yeah why not screw it yeah ma let's head into the next room the next stage of the tomb longing tomb Stage two you have to what their fire a whole take that right click only problem at the right click is that boom oh my god takes up a lot of ammo obsolete fires off with six shots real quick Oh what well your dad thanks for coming body I need to conserve my ammo I'll use this for a little bit collect some ammo I assume as we get farther and farther ah oh a new weapon don't mind if I do the Calvary honestly I like what we currently have screw it dude who needs it I don't know if destroying pots does anything but if Zelda's taught me anything like that it does those are grenades I've already all right Marty flowing grenades it doesn't currently do anything for us you have to be careful though the only the time I died in my one run the enemy exploded a barrel right next to me so yeah watch out for they have those all heard which was like that boom but yeah I don't think oh Jesus or there's anything near me back back you foul demons I have lower health and normal it's not fair quit bullyin me pop only this little underground thing what do we have going on here Oh anything to note doesn't alter Pierce oh but I really I'm really over this whole bomb throwing shenanigans can we can we stop that oh hello sir I guess that's a no portal has been opened oh well that was this floor however we're gonna go through the vault of course cuz that won't the good is well let's get this upgrade first ooh stuff energy orb has one more Church that's pretty good wait how do I know I just got to shoot it I having two of those seems dope and then I can just upgrade the rest it oh what the Indiana Jones is going on here up all right real mature reah reah mature how do what the fudge can I free I can't freeze these things good okay I guess that's it Oh God okay so they hurt let's get my shields back here real quick let me look at the pattern pattern pattern pattern I don't see the pattern pattern pattern pattern I'm going this way oh geez good okay I think I did it open up the treasure chest well begin weapon attacks instantly kill normal enemies with less than 20 person HP remaining or bosses a little okay the final judgement indeed don't mind if I do I already have that ammo alright let's head to the next stage cool does this chat you want to talk greedy get a cursed scroll would obtain a precious occult scroll I don't know what a curse scroll that does that kind of seems well stuff I'm just gonna go with lose some HP I don't even have that many anyway to get an occult scroll buns will recover full HP rather than some HP oh well too bad I don't have any buns huh you hate this here let's do some damage though let's freeze everybody I got these extra charges might as well use them you know what I'm saying show me the buns I want the buns serious where the buns oh Jesus what's going on here hey hey no no no you stay right over there okay and don't make me say it again silly sentence our guns don't even know what they're coming at me with yeah yeah oh Jesus there's too many of them captain I guess I could just use those against them I take this up look yeah sitting at buddy like that oh I know you do now let me see this right click doesn't do that much I guess it's some nice burst damage though Oh see that no no no no trying to trick me but I said no boom oh wow oh that was close all right I'm trying to prepare the the wall hacks here oh all right well something worked oh okay all right freeze full time out here oh that's oh that's not mine I was wondering what that huge amount of like 100 million thing is but that's the judgment thing yeah that see because it's pretty much just executing them so it's like screw it odds are the enemy doesn't have this much health right they won't be able to stop this that's what I said oh hello friend how are you doing what oh I don't know what this is all about it never ends does it they
