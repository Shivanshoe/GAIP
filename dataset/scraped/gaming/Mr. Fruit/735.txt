hi ad hojoon my name's mr. fruit and welcome to the GG over-easy podcast I need to figure it out what I say after them cuz I've been I say hidey-ho everyone welcome back oh we're like yeah so it's like doubling up that's fine he's fine whole thing you got a hurry dude I'm using all my power please this is the 26 episode we talk about some things like why was the podcast missing for a week why did rob commit a crime that is this title that's a great clickbait title why did rob commit a crime oh geez he's right let me look at this notes because we kind of roughly fought it we read a review herp derp a games we're looking forward to in 2020 actually I never got to talk about I mention one thing and then we went completely out but that's not important her movies um patreon question this is a lot of stress listen just stay tuned you're getting really rough right there [Music] hidey-ho everyone welcome back to the GG over-easy podcast episode 26 and we should it's been a wild ride there's been there was a week off which wasn't exactly planned and what happened was so well okay so I'll tell you what happened I privately died yeah well I just heard like well because it was like a day before we were playing board games I was like how did you back down that thing and then yeah so what happened is for those listeners of the podcast you probably know from December when I had my Maya training bra oh yeah yeah right before that yeah but before I went to Mexico um I had this like where up in my back and it was like Omega bad and so on your cube rhombus oh yes excuse me yeah and my left around my left rhombus area or wrong behavior angle yeah it's a grace it's I mean that's a shade but it's not important and so that happened and I've been taking precautions and then after that I was told like I worked on because they said it might be like a week rhomboid I was like mm okay sure whatever but I was like all right so I'll throw it in the beginning of every workout I do because I already throwing shoulder PT a bad shoulder let's PT physical theories mother yeah we love I mean honestly it is crazy I've recently gotten the physical therapist and I'm sure blue knows it's like like wizardess dude I've never been a little wizard yeah like the knowledge they have about people about you never have to yeah hopefully you don't like as much as it's like oh wow physical therapy's amazing it's also like oh you don't want to be there but you're in good hands I mean you seem stiff as a board man you need to get a little stiffer I mean you haven't moved in like Monty I'm worried about you need to get you back there to your physical therapist but the knowledge they have on human body and stuff and the great thing about them is so they can't diagnose you they don't do that they're not not like a doctor they can say specifically doctorates I don't know the whole specifics but it's kind of like a psychologist and a psychiatrist a psychologist can't prescribe medicine but a psychiatrist can know yeah it's like that like the certain things and they just can't do certain things like say exactly what's wrong with you but they can pinpoint it and a lot of it's looking at your deficits and stuff and trying to like narrow it down and figure it out and go from there and the best part about it is it's all non-invasive so the whole idea about physical therapy is doing stuff with your body that doesn't require you to necessarily take medicine or do any surgeries go into your body anything like that like yoga yeah I don't know it poses that's his app of course that started the fusion so anyway my back spaz DUP again we recorded the Friday before just I don't know the date so we recorded the Friday it needed to go up Sunday and I had it all edited by the way I was not edit Andy everyone thought like I was edit Andy because I said like I gave it in the wrong file form yeah so that's what I thought the problem was and then you let us know well Friday so we'd recorded it and then right after AB was staying with me so we went and that was the during the Omegas snowstorm we talked about how yeah because I was so essentially we were snowed in we didn't have food so Rob is like yeah we'll go get some mmm so we went to go get some fuzz delicious and pokeyman cards and there and then that day pokemon cards had released AB wanted some pokemon cards so we went to Walmart or Target sorry Wawa mommy's not gonna have the sword and seal packs that we need we went to Target got some packs came back we did that we played some board games so we just spent the day with each other and so Saturday us like Saturday morning cool alright I'll get this going get audio sin we'll work on and I'll get the videos to rob all that good stuff it's all just normal but then Saturday morning I wake up and I'm like just laying on my side I kind of wake up oh that's kind of stiff it's like not comfortable so I try to go to the other side and it's even more uncomfortable moment ah and so I go to the other side and then that's when it happens again and just like yeah yeah just full I can't even begin to describe it to you worse or the same as worse Wow and I will say this on the scale of pain I felt my life that would be the worst of Iran I cried I've never cried from pain oh my god like I would really just saw you cry NAB wasn't he was downstairs okay so once why you cry yeah that's the first thing I've ever seen Christian cry I don't normally yeah that's what I'm saying that's awesome whoa yeah like the pain was I literally could not take it yeah and the worst part is like when it happened so the only relief I would get is if I was laying down and this super specific position and it was not comfortable that was the worst part cuz like my neck was like this and I had to like kind of go up on like a pillow and then there's certain like thing in my life and it was just so uncomfortable which was it like just like 7:00 in the morning and I'm just like I'm losing it and I'm like but as I was like I can work through it I'll get up I'll just start working I'll just if I can get to my chair and just is fine I'd like try and push up and I'd get like a foot and then just fall right back down and it was just killing me so I had some leftover meds from last time I went to Urgent Care so I still had some muscle relaxers and painkillers so I took those and just slept for a while and then woke up back around noon [Music] I was just I didn't want to stay in my room because that's when I do when I'm like sick mm-hmm and then I just get depressed geez you're not sick yeah so I didn't want to just lie there doing nothing in my room that's wet and then I'm just gonna feel and then I'm gonna get my head blah blah so I just need to get somewhere like watch some TV or something but try to go in the basement to watch some movies or TV anything so like Claire is helping me down after like I'm literally the best posture yeah I look like blue I look like blue every straight as like stiff as a board yeah you know my like armor and Claire she's essentially just carrying me down get into the chair and it's pretty painful the entire time I get into like one little thing where I can recline and I should stay like that for about eight hours this is in that living room just because there was one point so when that did I have and Claire went to go do some errands mm-hmm about two hours in I got a pee but like bad enough they're like I gotta go mm-hmm like I can't hold it I tried so I fell seven times trying to get to the bathroom that was maybe 25 feet away and not because I couldn't physically but because like a thing would be so bad I just have to fall and lie on the like Leonardo DiCaprio wolf of Wall Street kinda yeah drag yeah as if I just taken some what were those uh no doesn't matter yeah but so like I would try and hunch over and then the pain would hit so bad literally all I'd wanted to do is just stop it immediately so I just hit the ground like just lying there until it was a little bit better and then I peed gothics practically I got like that was with it and that little endeavor is like 30 minutes I got back in there and I'm just just in pain oh all in over and then on top of that I hate muscle relaxers is that day and then right before beds you don't like the way it makes you feel or just like cry out yeah like I'm in any other world yeah like I've never been drunk but I'm probably the closest I've imagined it is cuz like like I'm there but I'm not yeah and like I know I'm there and I know I'm not yeah and it's just sounds like me on the uber car yeah they're not there and like I shouldn't be tired but all I want to do is sleep and then sometimes I can sometimes I can't and so Saturday was ordered with just me stuck in a reclining chair yeah went to bed sucks too is because Christian was I hate trying like when you edit this make sure you take it from 2019 to 2017 I couldn't figure it out and I was up early from Miriam yeah and I was up to like cuz we recorded it that like what's a turd or that laughs write it but there's more so yeah I needed to get it out or let's get it done so I literally did it that whole night Saturday night just to get it or know that one day night Saturday cuz you were like I need the footage oh yeah I'll try bro and so at one point I got clear to help me yeah I was like at can you oh that's what I texted AB and Claire and I was like hey can you like do it for Christian it was like I have to do this now so I pretty much just sat my chair and like clear was in that thing I was like okay here's this SD card you're gonna like be in the baggy like plug it in and then I was like trying to move and hold them way you're explaining it you're like yeah and so I finally get it to the mic alright and then drop bikes like seven hours left I burn my anus so I got to go back and lie down and then right before I go back to bed I get like Claire to check it and it was done that's when I sent it to you then I was like alright Sunday I'll get it but then Sunday it wasn't as bad as Saturday mm-hmm but still enough that like I couldn't do anything and then I felt bad cuz I knew you were kind of hurting so I was like and he's not gonna want to have to go into the matrix and make this file edible in seven edible I'm gonna meddle in 2017 I [ __ ] it up again yeah cuz the thing is so I had it in Premiere I only like CC 2018 or something you would think it wouldn't be that big a deal yeah but Rob had 20 17 16 I don't know something I know it's the previous version whatever it is it's previous oh yeah you've legacy it's all it says for me okay I don't know what that means um so it goes in and for whatever reason you can't open a that's like not in that version you wouldn't think it'd be that big of a deal now but it is and so then I have to like go in I have to save it as a different file I have to change the file name I have to get a zip I have to extract it I have to then make it a notepad document have to go in the notepad have to find certain code have to change that version code then save it then save it to do this on Sunday you see like I'm so sorry I'm really sorry and then like in the DM z-- you're like you know can you give me the files like I think I did like way back there and like all I see is I'm really sorry but I get like get it to you as oh um link expired so yeah so it there was no way and then it was like coming Monday and then I was like well it's we missed the Sunday and we hadn't gotten the audio version and because of that it wouldn't have gone up a little bit so I was like whatever we'll just do it next Sunday and so we did except the audio version for the first time was up like it was four or five days early it was so that was for you audio let's just totally purposeful you're pointing again to the audio listener right okay well I'm just imagine I'm pointing at you or audio stands we're pointing in your ears yeah we hope you appreciated that this one should be good to go both on time as long as nothing at this point we every time we say that we just we buck up yeah it's hopefully a meteor doesn't hit right now thank God then the audio today for like your first time there you getting right after you feel bad too because we just been like giving it to on Saturdays and they're not in the office on Saturday so we feel bad so it's like we're doing this yeah listen long story short of the podcast you probably don't care about much that like the podcast we're here even if sometimes we're a week off or something is we're not dead things come up and it's different too for us because for some people podcasting that's one thing he's the podcast yeah but for us we got we do how do you - what else but I know yeah I got blue shiny Huns you know there's so many things that we do in other words you know it's like priorities we got like food systems yeah shiny linens are important there's a lot of some we're doing with the hidden ability though blue I'm sorry you did not hit a hidden ability their ability is very important for charlatans because it turns into in sooner or which will absolutely murder and destroy the entirety of what we know and love as the Pokemon meta game but that is still insane that you were able to get two shiny Linton's in there's I mean there's like a 60% chance but I still got time oh so you kind of got unlucky in the fact that super unlucky so what does this hit a bit ability do if you guys aren't watching blue shiny huh you need to go watch blue shiny push out TV so obviously okay it's hard to explain so so in sooner or has this ability called intimidate uh-huh it's a hidden ability and when on entering battle it lowers the entire Pokemon team's attacks at that's very important that's pretty Oh penises oh it's really good because in doubles the meta game is mostly physical attacker is like Tyranitar and like excadrill uh-huh and like Conkeldurr battles on stream I did if your battled stream once did you get rolled out I did okay it's just like whenever I do stuff like that I really want to have like a good meme team uh-huh I really wanted to use like GMAX butter for you with like heck straggle put I sound like a [ __ ] nurse I really wanted to use GMAX butter Frese like GMAX befuddle with dragon pool hex mark because I'm a papaya some of a pain thought you know we did our best we did our best we out here i I I still need to play it I open packs so like they all got pokemon packs cuz I guess it like came out that day did you get your packs I didn't get my packs pokemon cards are Maddox see and I noticed that too I was just about to say I bought like six packs and it was like a $38 so expensive like I was like dang he was just a 3-piece pack is like extra because well they have to put them in like protective packs now because people would like weigh them because like holographic cards weigh less yeah you told me that that's right so people will weigh them and bring them in and like they'll actually bring like these little mini weight weight things and just literally just sit in the [ __ ] Walmart or Target or wherever the [ __ ] and sit there and weigh them so now they had to start putting them in like these cardboard 3-piece packs which are more expensive well I don't what I don't understand about the pokemon cards will really pissed me off dude so like you know when you open up a pack and it has that like barcode thing or like the first barcode pack or whatever when you open it on the top I guess if it's green it means you got a good card and if it's why you got bad and since it's the first card you see it's like a spoiler I hated that I think did I think they changed that no they didn't patch it cuz Noah's meatball and add we're talking about it cuz because literally we were opening cards and meatball that face times AB and it's like I smell pokemon cards it was like the funniest thing ever so how did you know okay so Christian left but we're keeping the train going yeah so what's cool about now that Christians gone he never has time to bring this up and I feel bad for Claire so in the Christmas episode this was literally sitting in the bathroom was his katana sword I don't know have we talked about this thing yet I know I mean I mean I knew he had one but I didn't know like sits in the sits in like the sit in the bathroom dude is a real guitar I'm gonna cut up fruit oh no that's not good for the audio listeners already listeners if you guys are listening to this I just opened his katana blade and killed three anime characters who listen to that now watch that happen that's nice why does he have in his bathroom I don't know but I put it literally like in front of the desk so it kind of has its little like a real katana sword and then he has his dice here we actually did take down the Christmas tree 200 yeah YouTube comments are really matter that they were they really yeah I better see I don't I don't they calm I try not to read them but sometimes I do and literally every single time I go through like the new comments list it's like y'all it's February hey y'all needed to yeah oh my god wait have you seen sonic blue I haven't [ __ ] no I haven't either I haven't either but I really want to see it I really want to see I hope it's really good things I've heard good things hi there I never imagined the day I'd be more excited for the sonic movie than the last Star Wars movie apipa hands do you want to hear some sad news absolutely something that said [ __ ] I'm going out this weekend with a friend and we're gonna go see a movie and we're seeing Star Wars man what they haven't seen yet no they haven't it's still theatres yeah and that's what I said I was like is there gonna be like a showing and she found one yeah and I was like are you serious oh like yes so we're gonna go see Star Wars now I'm like like the second so like maybe I can license she sounds terrible Rob likes her maybe I could like like maybe see maybe it's better blue maybe I was wrong better you don't think it's better no just nothing about it could be a little better no I can guarantee you as soon as [ __ ] can we can we talk Stan you areally literally you're gonna see oh look my name's ray and then you're gonna and they're gonna be like ah that's so stupid and then Kyle is gonna hit the line you're a Palpatine and I'm really gonna be like ah you're right it's good but then like I'm just gonna be sitting there and be like you know what like this could be worse like I could be seen like like a scary movie like I don't like scary movies the part that pisses me off too and I forgot to put this in my rant so I'm gonna I'm gonna say it now when I did I when when Chewbacca when Chewbacca supposedly dies and raised like leaving oh yeah and then he's just happens to be the other ship like what yeah it's just three buddy yeah I hate it and then they're like whoopee stupid me Chewbacca's okay I mean I wouldn't have I would have been mad if fake Falacci baka but it was still like okay that's we're on the topic of movies what is the of movie the last movie you saw that you would recommend I also I'm very upset we didn't do Oscar nominations our last podcast we [ __ ] we should have I mean to be fair we kind of skipped a week so we could yeah we really couldn't have been on there but I kind of was sad about cuz like after the next day I was at all we should have done the Oscars I had no idea the Oscars I miss Oscar week God a missed fritz-pak you but then I hadn't I hadn't seen any of those movies guessing you know you know who I'm gonna it's part of our dark topic lists parasite oh really have you seen parasite yet ok so is this like a I go spoiler free version of parasite or are we gonna use her I called me out here [ __ ] what I'm about I didn't today some but is it the sword yeah Jackie on Christmas instead is this week again I wasn't given it on Christmas so you said would you get on Christmas I didn't think about it this was clearly the best gift there's a freaking genuine samurai sword okay yeah and I kind of realize I messed up cuz you had a mini sword out here that I took away and now I have it say mega sword I was actually watching on reddit I'm like professional damn right fight or something showing like how it's more realistic it would be when you're fighting what it would actually look like uh-huh it's very interesting nothing like you would see in the movies really yeah he was like yeah so you always see this but actually if they did that you just go stab yeah like yeah like there's no blocking in samurais you would see like that when you bail and that's a big big big big blows like this you wouldn't do that cuz that'll break your sword I don't care you're freaking out like some final destination [ __ ] whatever all you know is just like you know everything you see in it is why and also like bro yeah you don't pull your sword either until your like right next to them and then when you do you hold it out like this at their face whatever like wherever their whatever they're looking at you you hold it as far as you can and then at their face uh-huh so then they can't tell how how long your blade is oh so they don't know your reach so that's a big reason why like you'll see people they hold their sword like this just to keep the length of that sort in like so they don't know how long you're sort of oh yeah I should do that with my penis like hi very last second well it's too late now probably make it because then they would expect something of you so we were about to talk parasite and bloom a - device parasites so no I hadn't seen I haven't seen parrot parasite but I did watch like a spoiler kind of 30 minute thing of it yeah 30 minutes room that's 1/4 of the came in like at the end well no so like Josh in them that we have like a discord movie room where like people are in it and so josh is like it were watching parasite tonight and that's when we were recording apex or something like that so josh is like just join whatever and I was okay worried so like I join little do I know they started way before they said they were going to so I literally join it and what I see is what are we doing forward I mean yes okay so well okay yeah I will put a cool timestamp because I've learned him now because we've done so many of these I will put a cool timestamp and where we start and then audio listener those foreigners I will add in there yes when you'll hear it right now yeah okay so I just want I so I join and I see a woman getting stabbed by like a bald man oh you look like the last leg [Music] like so I joined them like yo it up guys and then like Josh goes please and then likes it like listening drop he goes leave Rob Bromley drop and like I'm like chillin already at this moment what okay sorry sorry and then like I left and then Josh like literally dims he's like you literally couldn't have joined at the worst time I was like oh okay like I guess I had seen we were like the last five minutes it's okay he only got a glimpse of it so he probably doesn't know the show but then like that made me feel like I can watch like this 30 minute kind of movie review of it that some guy does and breaks down the movie so instead you well I said it's watching I'll just yeah you pretty much they very Zoomer of me but I'm sorry that it was very zoom you probably took this 30 minute to and then put the speed on two times I can't even be bothered for this I go therapy and they tell me hey be honest with everybody around you so I'm being honest I was like you know I'm just saying no and tell them I didn't see cuz they're gonna judge me if I tell them that I saw this 30 minute you know that's for a we appreciate the honesty so I you robbed the old person you hurt here with myself yes robbed yourself so good job being honest big guy Huntington here hey we appreciate you but it looked like a good movie like it looked like it deserved Best Picture I was like whoa I did not see that coming and whoa whoa no counterclockwise but I could see how that movie is like because I could only imagine hiding and then like you're tense for them for hiding these crazy I've seen a lot of horror movies I've never seen a movie scarier than parasite that's not a horror movie it's thriller suspense yeah I've never I say it's a horror movie because I've never felt more tense that in any movie that I've ever watched besides parasite easily the most tense I've ever felt watching movie really yeah I feel like fruit can agree here yeah it was although to be fair it scared it out last so I mean there probably is coming out the first games and movies are different okay because movies continue without my input but games yeah I'm the guy opposite one no see this one this one's nice because I can kind of like disconnect but it'll still work like it'll still happen things will go but with the game it's like I got it I gotta be doing this so then I plus like when I'm doing something that's what I'm doing I can't really be distracted in the sense of like doing anything so like if I'm playing the game I have to be like but then I'm like and then I'm into it so then it's like you know I'm saying my name is boot yeah real spook that uh that pic not the picture the scene when it's like the kid eaten the cake and you see the guy on the stairs that was that was scary that's uh yeah he's like they show that part he's like well yeah they showed the the dark stairs and I just mean really well how come there wasn't a thing there in the dark stairs part like normally there was like a cabinet there how come at that specific no no that's that's the entrance to the basement and then in the basement around the corner is the dress watch the movie I would have liked it I would have understood that but you did it I did not oh yeah great movie and I put it here on the notes because I also just showed a band clear for the first time snowpiercer that's a great movie to have seen that movie have you seen a blue I've seen what movie it's no snowpiercer I really want to watch it now because I love Paris well so what I never realized I saw when it first came out there's like a limited release and so I found it at a theater near by when to see it great but I never realized that that's the same director parasite in shells that either yeah so then AB had when he was over here asked like because he saw a parasite and he was looking up other movies yeah I saw you'd be like what Chris Evans likes no Peter Schilling that was him I've seen that's great watch it we watched it I guess we can't talk too much because I don't want to spoil anything yeah I think it just kind of plays on the same thing of clay at the class kind of system I think of the poor and rich I think it plays on the same time themes and that was the good [ __ ] for me yeah I liked a lot of the symbolism like I mean I would have noticed this too if I didn't wasn't watching this dude break it down but like when they run away from the family like when they get away they go like down a hill and they go downstairs and it's like they go from the very top like I just everything about the movie is so artfully every little thing what might one of the one of the cool things I remember it well I mean already talking to boys yeah we're spoilers yeah he's Jessica was always uh she was well one she was always the one who seemed to be like the most hopeful I was like someone who could actually pull the family out of like their you know their class oh yeah and then even during the the scene where they're in the living room where they're all drinking and stuff she's the only one who's not sitting on the floor she's sitting on the sofa so every and and then in the movie as well she didn't have to steal a job she made her own and that's exactly why she had to die at the end of the movie and I was like God even like all these small things are just throughout the entire movie and it's just like so good delicious there's a lot uh it feels like everything is like paid off in that movie like there's not one thing that is left like just think what our message of it too was just very perfect I don't know it's very the holding the idea of of if you rich then you're probably gonna end up being rich regardless and even when the poor get to exploit the rich the rich still benefit like it's just good yeah I'm glad I went in knowing absolutely nothing mm-hmm I was like I was about to watch a trailer before nothing yeah I need to I'd rather just go in blind mmm and yeah I was not expecting any event I was really good but snowpiercer I really liked to just because of the idea it um it explores I like like those movies I talked about that even regardless snowpiercer is good anyway but I really like the ones that just explore the weird ideas like I talked about like you Burberry tour mhm these certain scenarios how do they play out like even like Maze Runner for instance that like young adult film [Music] watch the ones after cuz I heard they were trash but I wanted to watch Maze Runner just because it was like this idea that these these teenagers the first ones pretty decent yeah the teenagers are stuck in this like giant they don't get their giant maze they don't know how to get there I don't think they remember really who they are or whatever but they're there and then there's this maze that they're trying to get out of but they can't and at like if you're there at night you die or whatever it was like that's what cool concept I just want to see how people explore that idea and snow piercers idea of the world is frozen over and the last survivors are all on this train that's like a self-sustaining ecosystem how would that play out and that's snowpiercer yeah it's dope I guess the people who listen to this skip the spoilers won't hear this anyway but I didn't recommend it I like the one thing I liked about look one thing I would have liked about Perez is he's actually like why for my third watch I liked so I didn't understand so the boy so it starts off as like the boy starts working for them first and then he gets his whole family to work for them right mhm and then there is a secret man that lives in the basement whose wife is one of the caretakers of the family or something you don't worry about that I can tell you halfway through the more I know that and everything like turns yeah but she was the previous like housemaid or whatever that that family is mom took over when they kicked her out with like the peaches and everything picked her out and that's when she comes back cuz she has to she's like I gotta feed my husband it's been stuck down in there that's one thing I didn't understand about the movie when he was breaking it down there like listening to a conversation in the basement and then they all fall down and then she takes like a video of it or something like that saying like he has a sister or mom or something like that and then all of a sudden they're in the position of power I didn't I didn't get that so I didn't even watch the movie I'm gonna [ __ ] drop kick your ass I'm learning again watching that breakdown scenes and then I was like I'm kind of lost on this part so I'm having you guys I don't want to explain it because I've would rather you just watch the movie just watch it 4head fine that's probably that's possibly the most important seeing the movie I also loved honestly because it sets up everything for the rest of the movie oh yeah I like how that kid carries around a rock like though there's something that he just knocks him out like that's him I thought that was hilarious well I also thought it was funny that it starts out his friends like yo I need you to take care of this I'm going to college but like but with the family like their daughter as soon as she gets out of high school I'm gonna marry her and then he's like okay whatever but then he falls for they fall for each other and then he's like as soon as she gets out of high school I'm gonna marry her and then for a second - I thought it was gonna be like some weird thing when they first showed the basement I thought they were gonna be like oh it's gonna be like a dud either like the family or people beforehand that they trapped and this is just a never-ending cycle like I thought that's what it's gonna be and then they showed the husband I'm like wait what and then it took a different turn than I thought - mm-hmm but I thought they were gonna do that like the how they ended it was really interesting like that because they're looking for the heartbreaking but like that they're looking for the dad right but then the dad says he just hides himself in the basement and so you just be care that guy yeah but then like Kevin right that's his name or something like that easing so he's gonna get like a good job and stuff like that and then why didn't he does yeah there's just a fantasy that she was heartbreaking and then and then it brings you right back to the basement and it's like oh so is he really that that's another thing like is he really actually in the basement or was that part of Kevin's life as fairy tale like his dad is still missing or is it actually he's in the basement no that was just that was just him thinking about his future but the way that brings you back to the - their little basement home is the is is like this this isn't

basement this acid really nice not the dago's no and welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the GG overeasy podcast yeah brought to you by crime Oh crime it's not crime if you break into your own car all right not people watching we're probably like oh that's what I was really okay so long store okay so before the podcast started okay so I Drive a Christian spoiler alert for those who didn't know nest well a house there's a tavern of excuse me immersion purposes your tavern I ride on my steed on your horse and wagon yeah come on bruh my fault and then I pay the toll of the kingsroad so I like parked my car and like when I when I leave my car I always I always always do that key wallet phone check I don't know if you guys do that - I call it phone if I absolutely that very often because I have terrible paranoia so I do that like every 30 minutes probably to him so like um the one time I didn't do it cuz I was like that's why you do it I like cuz I got out and I was like I'm late and I get out press the little button to lock my car cuz my car is old I don't have an unlock thing on the fob yeah I'm not cool like that so when I pretended to always lock my car go boo boo like like I was just like press nothing go boo boo with my mouth it fooled everybody yeah oh so like can't break in the mat now lock the door lock the door close it take two steps and I was like oh I didn't do the wallet phone key things like we're straight yeah and then I go I go wallet phone key mookee yeah it is yeah just the immediate my I did not so and then like I look in the car I just see keys right there in the center console I was like oh my god I was like not now so Christian opens the doors and then I was like locked my keys in my car I gotta figure this out you have clothes hanger I just think of a POV of like you know all those things like POV is yeah it's a picture it'd be like looking at you like like face up on the glass like would be is the keys locked in your car yeah and so I'm like do you guys have a metal hanging rod and what are we like in the 1990s nobody has a full metal hanger rod anymore like that's not a thing anymore very rich and their shitty hangers - you have some left blue the head ass is strong who doesn't know I don't I don't I might apply what you get from like Target like honey pack for two bucks yeah yeah Midwest doesn't blue I just have like a [ __ ] ton of metal hangers that I have none real real quick that brings me up I guess Colorado is technically the West but I think it's I feel like it's Midwest no or West but then I think he really was skilled at Midwest we still get Utah then Nevada then California yeah but I would much rather you be considered part of the way we're like we're right on the cusp of West like Kansas is Midwest do we really want to be affiliated with Kansas [ __ ] exactly why oming well Braska you might as well be nobody you know Oklahoma no disrespect no I'm not disrespect but come on well when entertainment stuff happens you know where they go West Coast yes Lee I don't matter at all you know is there's West than is west coast I would budget you really are not being good argument for Colorado mr. freer like yeah but we're Midwest it's like how are you start saying that you're part of the West and you know dude we are an equilateral state every side we have is equal to each other you also know what is up with Colorado it's one of 10 states just right back it keep and roll it go we were one of like ten proposed states or something that are gonna in the next like twenty thirty years you're gonna see it no well I mean maybe who really knows but a giant influx of population as people as the rising sea tides really su old yeah it's a Houston Colorado watch the news a couple other states but yeah I remember Houston Colorado cuz that's where I live and that's where you guys live yeah yeah the other ones don't matter Houston Denver whatever but that's the good news you know I mean oh you're all drowning we're a mile hi baby we got a little while I was trying to explain Iowa for man he's like how he's like if I went to Colorado he's like how higher is that than me right now I was like a mile a deeper I was like a mile high her I'll say I'm literally a mile higher in the sky than you right now hey yeah I mean I was like hey Lily done does it really work like that so say like I moved my body yeah I'm sitting here you might be a mile up above sea level yeah and we move me over California but we moved the earth you know like I stand still and you move the earth instead yeah and so yes and I'm now I'm over San Francisco you know I on the ground or a mile I and you fall and die that's cool feet above sea level that's you know that's that that by this a couple hundred years that's something yeah that's like a yeah that is well that's the thing too with Colorado especially the mountains zombie outbreak you go the mountains because once it gets cold they got a trudge through all that stuff their muscle tissues and stuff we're gonna get cold freeze over boom yeah but I have to be easy man that's why one thing about Colorado okay okay so when it's a zombie apocalypse but I don't want to be cold I would rather take my chances over there yes I hate being cold I hate to be fired for it you know when you scrapes it off your car that's the worst feeling in the world and you're gonna say no because I have a garage now but now like when I scrape up snow off my car is the worst thing in the world I hate no you want to know what is great what being cold because then it's so nice to curl up and be warm but when you're hot I find it's so much easier it's so much much to be warm when I'm cold then they get coming after a hot day like a nice cool room that I do coming in after being not breathing I'm just a warm shower I'm a cold-blooded creature you know like my isn't that right like what he wants a reptile yeah but no that's what I'm saying well I don't if I'm cold I'm gonna be cold like I'm whatever the room temperature is like I'm not a hot or sometimes very there well come to taxes prove the city for the grass is green and the drinks or our winters only ever gets like 40 degrees is thick yeah you could go down there why not we got great tacos yeah good time so anyways about my car oh yeah my car so uh I'm like looking anyway to do this and not spend money the last thing I want to do is have to spend money to get in my car and just like that's the last thing I need I I had a freeway Oh what was that break the window okay so I'm just like thinking of anyways and Claire goes robbed you can you take off your antenna I was like I don't think so so I go outside like try and do with my hand I'm like I'm an idiot like that might be able to stick I'm well let me do this real quick so I had to get like a pair of pliers I take off the antenna and so I end up like bending my antenna a little bit so it has like a little fish hook yeah a little hook and I have Claire just pry open my door and on freakin cue oh my god I have Claire out here I could probably get mr. fruit and on cue coming out there why eating a [ __ ] banana to be fair I was I had headaches and I was feeling nauseous I needed something to like like not even year of having your house say hi mr. free no we won't go yet so I ended up getting it hooked thank God to be fair up though during this I'm setting up the podcast you are you're not like yes just picking my nose here like yeah he was setting up the podcast to be fair and we got in thankfully and I didn't have to spend any money my antenna now though if you do see while driving on the freeway and you see a 1998 on the password with a little look that's me that's him that's me you can immediately know look at me go it was really do be zoom in it was good they're like you cuz he had it in straight and he would get the point right to the little lock baby like papa thankfully I have the one where I can just hook onto the thing and go uh yeah I don't have like a little nubby one or the one that kind of see I'd be screwed because when I had the little minivan it was like the little hill yeah you know like Oh like a little ya know like if it was locked it would go in like all the way in nothing I'd be screwed yeah so we thankfully got it and I didn't have to pay any money to get back and my stupid [ __ ] crappy car yeah so that was how we started this last time we started you know my car got stuck in snow this time you're you left her kills your car in the car blue next to the next we stayed out of a car it's gonna be some final destination okay good good keep it that way at least for the next week yeah keep you safe it's like in the dark night when they're telling everyone like no don't go anywhere and then I think I was like that judge goes into her car and she's like a joker card turns out it was full of explosives I don't want to hear about that with blue you know I'm saying yeah that's what we we stay away from that you know avoid that with all it would it would just be a card and on it would say audio listeners you'd be like oh you know well I do have a podcast review I was only took us 50 minutes or so into the podcast when it was the first thing but we have a podcast review uh a five-star review from a Cayenne cayenne jelly thank you and some reason the title is just yes so yes so yeah I guess yes the dream team is back and better than ever special guests Japanese mercy and a lot of dumb questions make this podcast perfect for anybody looking for a good time also I'm loving the TTT uploads keep them a-comin thank you we just need a patch we need patch notes first and we need to get everybody in the discord first well thank you for that review kuri jelly I also had a one-star review that I saw and I thought was funny and I was gonna read it but then if I really know you're encouraged yeah exactly if I I will read it off stream but it's fun you're gonna catch me in my blade yes yep but it'll be real but it is pretty funny one star review but stop doing that that's not funny hey what's on this what the [ __ ] oh I think he thought it was like peanut butters yeah who's been touching my sword peanut butter oh cheese I'm gonna hurt myself okay bad hands not me course we're slower slide my tub of peanut butter off the side so thank you for that review we have a rough list here let's go through it because I'm sure we've done a terrible job read review I did that done I did that robbed breaks in the car don't did that I didn't break okay FBI age you know making sure this is cool you just admitted to it you know you're done my car is your name on the title dad's and you're done did that's a yes sir this man parish parasite talked about that was at the bottom and snowpiercer we talked about you know we've kind of been what's next on their games we're looking forward to in 21 tear oh my God we're finally doing it I guess the only game that right now that I can really think about like in the foreseeable future like which I there's like three months for me which is tomorrow probably a doom I think Doom is only kind of cool game before the fall that like I'm actually kind of excited for I think Jim is gonna be sweet I keep like seeing things and think they added it looks like they added this place where you can I can get collect collectibles and stuff like that and you can kill like certain bosses and take their like thing and put it in your like game room I think they call it it's sick looks just really cool I'm down for that so doom for me what about you blue so there's two games obviously cyberpunk looks you well as long as it doesn't get delayed no 22 as long as it gets delayed to 2021 monka whichever would be like hey I would rather have it not be delayed and rushed time and then I'd play and just be like yeah sure my boy but then the other game of super excited about his game called blue protocol which is like an MMORPG from Bandai and I don't know if it's going to get an English release this year but I know that they talked about how they wanted to have it release this year Japan at least and they've been doing all of these big updates or not updates they've been doing all these like what is it's an MMORPG and it looks really cool because it has a Linux like mine system xyx really fun it looks like anime Monster Hunter MMO anime monsters behind I was like that's what Monster Hunter is well no but like it looks like an anime like but doesn't want her to look like an anime no no it looks like a you can tighten up a picture form yeah I literally bring it up and you be like oh that's what you mean yeah but I mean that sounds interesting I bandai's making it like the Dragon Ball bank I or Bandai bunk yeah mukbang it looks really good I'm really excited for it I've been watching a lot of videos on it and then I even signed up for the beta coming up wait so you saying it's only gonna Japanese release well for the time being but they've they have like people who they want for like English localization that they put up on their site for like job so hopefully line I mean what am I gonna use like Japanese all I know is Baca and Nani and that's all I got alright that's a mess yeah that one too so that's cool it looks really good and I'm really excited for it and I've been following it for like I've been following it for like half a year at this point I've been so excited for it yeah I just didn't keep it up and like on the change they've been making and if it and they just released they had like this whole stream coming out in 2020 2021 spring yeah well that's it's official it looks like like breath of the wide release looks pretty cool it looks really good and then I just been keeping up with a lot and I'm just really excited for it I really want to dive into an MMO it's just I've never found an MMO that has listening really crap all right buddy I've never felt like it everybody and that's this episode of Gigi I think it just comes down to the combat like you can't cuz like with I tried file fantasy for a while I really like you like you like a lot I thought I liked it a lot it's just I don't I need like that level of immersion of like being like really in control your character mm-hmm and with Final Fantasy it's like it's still I mean you're controlling them but for the most part you're like one two three four one two three six three whoa six oh yeah yeah I have the same issues you blue I will I've wanted a game like that like the clothes I gave like black desert online a little shot because I heard that was that in there's a dragon no no EverQuest no I'm trying to think there's some other one I can't think of the name right now that are supposed to be more like Diablo one the action combat mmo's yeah exactly which like because I'm the same way with you I don't want like a tab click or whatever they're called exactly like a WoW or whatever I don't want to cycle through yeah and I like rotational like stuff like oh you have to master the rotation for your max DPS or heals and that's fun but like a little more than 43 I need like a little bit of skill shotting yeah I need some I need some movement you know I mean I need some I need more than just go stand here you're an ass standing here and now I'm going to type one two three four one two three four perfect DPS composition it's incredible it's an action yeah I'm the same way with you so that's why I'm also hoping I think you're the first one to show me to that blue protocol comes out sick or well first off just comes out in English because they're always so many that seem promising and then never see an English release and so I never keep up on them oh why wouldn't you be able to play it if the text was Japanese you just got none of it's localized servers all that kind of stuff oh so pain gonna be off the chart like but the cool part about the cool part is here about the beta that I think they're doing in late March or something is that it's not like IP blocked like the other ones so if you really wanted to you could people on that means right it means if you're in the United States you can't connect to it at all even if you got like a key reason why we need to use like you need to use like a VIP and no free advertising I don't know yeah I know they're all something VPN yeah I see my room oh yeah but not here what are you doing uh what's your game at 2020 God fall looks pretty cool oh I forgot about it looks so tight a cycle gonna see a full release in 2020 who psyche with the cycle like oh the psyche yeah I'm not sure I like that Gaghan was a lot of fun actually I had it you didn't play with us okay can we also talk about that matches take like an hour and a half and what csgo yeah you're like this is one match bro that's one like every game I go into of csgo goes like 1514 and then sometimes we go 15 15 and then up dude I forget what we were doing but it was like all right let's go it's like Rob just started she has curly and won't be too long so then it's like him it was it because it was 8 2 and then they came it's like an hour and then he hops and he's like guy start it's like 14 14 hopefully when this other ice is going over time 45 minutes later yo guys I'm ready it's like that was one bad game that game went like I think it was like 18 16 I think was the final score of that game and my god yeah it went on for about at least an hour and a half yeah God and I don't mean it to go that long it's just like they're fun though man I'm in the [ __ ] zone I love CS I love csgo that's my game 2020 now hopefully my game day you can take that aim warming up there that's what we did then we got triple pizzas challenge after that that's true you bent you bend then we can we taught you benched wrong a little bit what's been going on man lost CS calm hand disco just shoots way different than every other game so like it's just I just talk about knowing learning the spray pattern go I can just be looking a couple clicks for 30 [ __ ] minutes it seems like just looking at a specific angle just sitting there and then they come and then I just go brah yeah you should come on blue eyed literally bike since going back to apex and trying to like do content apex again my penis is going down at least at least the motion of the ocean is don't be like wow Rob like needs hell yeah I need it okay like this this pill most people need it for their love life I mean it my gaming life for gaming was very hammered that night though but that wasn't the only night let's be real age its whole weary cuz series like some fights where sometimes I'm not able to spectate which is a shame but I'll know you're in a fight and I'll see Rob go down and then no comms no nothing like what what happened so I go back in his strange and he just like misses gets up he's gone and that's like AB and I are like trying to get caught like what happened Rob okay mom girl this is mine this is fine rumbling commit to something though like him like a shooter like here's like a pride thing so he's like if I can't beat this dude on my own offense or hey I'm gonna i'm actually gonna write a maybe something controversial in this podcast I don't see what everybody's fault with ninjas tweet was I'm gonna be honest the tweet about like being angry when you lose and is not a bad thing here I wasn't pulling it yeah do I really agree with that I don't see what anybody I don't I don't get it I think it really depends from person to person yeah everyone has a different method to how they improve like and I look at it from like a smash perspective right cuz when I see like there's some people who get genuinely they're like really [ __ ] mad welcome and they're upset yeah like laughing and they're super super mad and they use that to improve but then there's other smash players who are just like man like like my toe mango is like that definitely is one of the most dominant players of all time and smash he doesn't get angry he's just like man I guess I miss because he didn't I guess I'll just have to improve next time and what does he do he's these bins like 8's tears in a row so it really depends on from person person so I think some people whereas with it and they're like oh yeah I get [ __ ] mad and I just I shouldn't get mad but then there's champions like MK leo who are way better than you who are like you know what pop yes okay I totally disagree not nearly as dominate as MK Leo and AM killer the inspiration and weights not ninjas yeah I I agree with you so the tweet he said yeah the phrase it's just a game as such a weak mindset you are okay with what happened losing imperfection of a craft when you stop getting angry after losing you've lost twice there's always something wearing and always room for improvement never settle I think weak mindset was maybe a bad way to phrase it I mean weak mindset and you've lost twice yeah because when I stake a lot it's very over-the-top for sure but yeah I get where he's coming from I understand like I think if he's trying to i I think the problem was he was trying to defend his way of going about it and some people's we have you laughing who lose and get pissed yeah and some people it's just a game and the reason that's not good as you're mitigating how that person's feeling you're trying to tell them this doesn't matter that much you shouldn't why I got in a fight with my dad at a rec soccer games like Robert you don't need to be mad at Steve game and I lose like that you're not my therapist leave me alone because yeah centrally they're they're downplaying how you're feeling is they're saying like you're an idiot you shouldn't be feeling this way yeah exactly so I understand that but then when he's trying to say he's essentially then saying though that that's the only way to improve and I think that's where he's wrong I think so too I think that's definitely not the only way you can improve but I do think but I don't see why it makes him a bad guy or he's trying to say you should be super angry and toxic I mean I don't think he's a bad guy I think people blew it up I think people took angry and toxic and kind of combined the same not the same so I can understand why people had the problem with it though because Ninja has built his entire brand on for tonight on being a kids Channel essentially right so I do mix movie from that sense going to mix her though he says like [ __ ] but hey hey whoa whoa monetized kids fanbase as like a parent when you see someone like oh if you it's okay to be like really mad at video games is how a lot of people took it which isn't what ninja meant for sure he really he's a competitive person he's always been a competitive player so obviously he wants to be better at a game when he and also for 99% of the people who play video games are not like competitive yeah these sport players in the same way that axis yeah I mean to be fair he's not either but he's inherently a competitive person so yeah I mean the one thing I guess I would argue is if you're getting upset about a game but you're not trying to get better at all mm-hmm and I think that's that's where the problem lies yeah like then at this point it's just the game is like bro stop playing that it's not good yeah that's nice I'll play destiny like noon I'm not playing destiny to get good at it I would literally just play it and be angry and hey myself and I don't want that cuz that can be just a you can only put so much into tweet like you can't yeah from what ninjas coming from this of course he's man he want to get better and there's a difference between what Freud said getting better and just getting mad at a game cuz you're [ __ ] mad yeah I I don't think it deserved like the backlash that as much backlash as he got I just thought well I think to when when he says when you stop getting angry after losing you washed twice a lot of people take that as had to be over-the-top angry yeah like yeah like you suck bro yeah one people internalize it different and I guarantee you if someone's competitive and they lose even named Kao he's gonna be like okay he's gonna be calm about it I know how to improve but he's still gonna he's still gonna be upset II lost hmm and I think that's where he lost like the only way you can improve is to have a angry emotion instead of like accepting one yeah or like like you should one I think we trying to phase yeah yeah you should care about your losses yeah and if you stop caring about your losses that's when you're no longer competi I think I think that's what he's saying angry works for me it works for him it works for other people you know differently with with with their losses I used to get really mad but I've just kind of grown to be like okay well how do i exac time at to manage to still get really mad just cares differently about when they're competitive so yeah but you go put some what you tweet yeah so I think I just think it was a big misunderstanding I think his um his message was he had the right idea he just went about the wrong way saying it in a way to not tweet yeah with the platform he has it could so easily be config it wasn't if I he had dude I would you know you very quickly lose it I would literally if I'm making a tweet like that I'd me now if I made it to me like that I would make sure that there's no way that is to be misconstrued that any other way person who would have still have their platform is fruit because he posts Wow what food is so good like 93 to infinity [ __ ] like just random ass [ __ ] sometimes listen I just don't include my opinion somewhere no I mean you won't find most of my opinions I know right well some of them you will but like a lot of them I'll leave out I also just uh I just don't like I also don't feel like I need to tweet that like or something I feel I there's something that spurred the song I think I'd seen it there was like a clip in his thing where he was streaming and someone was like like everyone's like really being mad yeah and so I think that he was just like tilted yeah so I understand [Music] [Laughter] again you're not wrong for me though like I'm so bad at posting on Instagram and Twitter and stuff because when I'm doing something the last thing I think about is I need to tweet or post this mm-hmm so I usually just don't I do it like after the fact and I forget where I was listening to it but someone had been talking about it and how it's so important because some people don't find that disconnection and some people stop some people get confused and don't realize at what point am i doing this because I want to do this or am i doing this so I can post the gram yeah and so I've just met I'm just on that opposite section where I'm doing stuff hopefully someone will be like we should take a picture and go that's a good idea and like you like just like when we're at packed yeah looks like I'm thankful you did because otherwise I wouldn't have any pictures of packs like well I know that's that's one thing that like has come for me but relationship I used to never take pictures but when you have a girlfriend for so long they love taking pictures so I just I now I like to take pictures Claire doesn't let me have like honest we've been together almost six years it's embarrassing how few photos we probably I ever when I was taking a girl on a date and we were gonna see that movie I was telling them about you I was like let me see if I thought they post about I had to go back to when Claire Claire graduated college which was like three four years ago to find a picture of you two together and I was like this is that for like four years ago there was nothing like this anymore yeah whoops well also Claire is also that same way in the fact that she just doesn't need to be on social media she doesn't care she doesn't post anything yeah doesn't want to be in a lot of stuff too just because she wants to keep private stuff so then add that on to somebody who doesn't think about it all it's just we're just two people who's like we just don't never do anything like that yeah I don't know where did that start from I didn't god only knows ring a tweeter oh yeah but I don't know it doesn't matter how we got there what does matter is this ad break and welcome back this episode of the GG overeasy podcast we'll be wrapping this one up with some more patreon questions yeah thank you ad for bringing in it not even asked me if I was ready because I'm literally logging into it right now because for some reason that logged me out so give me you wanna sit here in silence no please don't I hate that I hate silence please don't please don't please don't because now it's like Inc now now because now I feel like I have people watching me and when I have people watching me I don't like that well but when you stream you have a face cam and verify this device are you kidding there's no swiped by the one well no button like this in the sense of like in like real like life like I don't I don't like it I don't like eyes on me I don't like a scene you know I mean but if you're streaming it facecam I'm talking like in this room like public speaking and then yeah I'm a bad public speaker if like I think it girls cute or something like that and like I just shut down and that's what I was talking my stream the other day like the only that any time I've ever been in a relationship with a girl they were the one to make the first move like hang out or like talk or text or anything like that alright yeah cuz I'm just shy uh-uh verify this device mm what'd you say when cuz you what'd you say what'd you say okay here we go with this is from Derrick Karstens hey Derrick with fruits new-car mentioned are you guys interested in cars or have any friends to help help you work on your vehicles its last advice on your purchases anything about motorcycles I have my friend Benjamin who takes me to the car mechanic and they'll fix it really know what X my older brother loves cars mm-hmm he's a huge fanatic he's worked on cards himself he like he had one project for fun he did where he bought this old Beemer completely tore it apart was like restoring it and everything sounds like my dad he's loved cars so if I ever have a question guarantee I can ask him and like you know what guy that's my guy cars okay um he'll help with anything if I needed like help fixing a car something he would be able to but usually I don't want to waste his time any interest in like cars or just in general or just is a car like for me is kind of just a form of transportation yeah I I like Corvettes when I grew up like a stingray that was really about it mm-hmm just kind of because it's like 18 miles per gallon like like the insurance on it alone the upkeep the depreciation yeah I'm all about the economic value and their garbage respect that like the zo6 has looked great but there is no reason I should buy it yeah literally no reason so the Camry yeah that's only someone in the college was like it's so stupid like by a by truck or cool car like no that's stupid that's some seven-year-old who just doesn't understand like like how a car works you know and like we don't drive to work when we go to work we go the most driving I get out of my car is coming here and Jim that is it but then even then for those few trips I wanted it to be as economics possible yeah baby exactly I have an interest in cars but like the cars that are just super Omega expensive I like I worked out a valet you not do that that was disgusting no and I like I hate the sound of it it seems like someone's like scratching my ear um so like I got to drive like Rolls Royces like AMG Mercedes like they were saw Porsches r8 anything you can think of dude I drove it that's an Audi are mm-hmm that's what that's what uh no come on he's a youtuber okay Antalya oh okay oh yeah if you're making 49 videos as much as a value like a couple rx but like if okay so yours would be a Corvette like it your dream car right right guys line ever really thought about I mean now it probably different yeah zo6 is still look sick but like if I could get any card probably something else yeah I guess mine would probably my favorite car is an Aston Martin so any kind of Aston Martin's I love those things at the balm car those are the James Bond cars uh goodbye and then no motorcycles I've never my dad never had one but and then my dad is the car guy my dad knows everything that it was about cars like him and I just changed my alternator because I went out not too long ago I've saved so much money because my dad just knows everything is he's a he's a well he was like in the 60s when everything was like I Drive a 1969 GTR Camaro like I nodded fix everything and then Here I am none of his kids not a fixed cars I can barely like change a tire like he feels like he's like we were changed my Alton he's like I play ok he'd said that he's like he's like in terms of like a car and like fixing years like car Nona he's like I failed you I was like I didn't have any interest I was like you could have done anything for me to like this I'll say I hate this so deep Lord for blue Wessel here in high school I really really into cars and even in college no I was never like the type who I mean I'm not like a mechanical type I don't know a lot of what goes into that my cousin is mechanic and he's really good at it so he knows far more about cars than I ever will he could probably fix everyone's car in this room right now because he's my needs for a long time but I was actually really into cars I was a type of dude who played like Need for Speed and Forza and would you call it Gran Turismo and I loved that stuff and I actually for a while I was really into rally cross and just in general rally car stuff so I was like really into like Pujo and like Lancia and was booted or stuff and that's like it's a new factor yeah it's not really like the type of brand you see here but it's very like big and like rally you know like and then obviously like more like notable ones like Mitsubishi Lancers Subaru Audie Fiat stuff like that so I was really into that like that rally type stuff that's what was so interesting to me and I loved watching it so that's where I found my love for like imports like Japanese cars dream car which I'll probably never get in my lifetime unfortunately is the GTR is usually the car I knew it I was like GT our house it's got as far as like reasonable dream car that I know is pretty reasonable like if you could yeah I'm sure you could find one for pretty like no no doubt but I would have to yeah it's like it's like from like at the mature standpoint do I see it for a Nissan GTR 2020 Nissan GTR estimated MSRP value right now as one hundred thirteen thousand okay that's like a 2020 can we get like this miles per gallon a 16 in the city yeah so as far as reasonable place just go fast mister fruit and like that's what they did sorry car that I know one day I will hopefully get that is also a car that I could use to actually like driving the city mm-hmm my eyes are one day I'll give WRX your ex she was still making evolutions rest in peace think about you every day buddy I would get those but I don't want to get like a fixer-upper card that I have to be like constantly putting money into like uh as much as I like that idea I also have to be reasonable item not made of money so Maya my life reasonable dream car is like a like the SUV BMWs I get x5 like it's some mid-2010 15 X 5 ish something like that what was what was that about another nice yeah they're really nice like that is like and you could give them let you get like a 2013-2014 for pretty like reasonable price I'm not too bad um I just think they're really nice your mom has like that super Omega nice one well that's a x6 blue you said so you said through high school to college does that mean your interest has waned since or I mean I'm still I mean I still like car I just not like as I knew them as I used to be I guess like I would be I was the dude who would be like oh my god you know did you guys oh my god the Stig bro hahaha Stig me Top Gear's I love talking Top Gear's all of Top Gear Pippa hands I don't know yeah with all the stuff to happen but um and then turn to these I'm still I'm still into cars I'm just not like I've kind of yeah I don't know I guess I've there's like a limit to how in deep and go into cars and I think I'm also not super into cars too because my dad is weighed super into cars and you can't like the same thing no no I can only like I can only like like stuff like as going forward I don't I don't really like looking too far back because then I'm gonna turn into like the duty like oh my god yes the 1970 BMW a classic this one is worth $200,000 and also you have to put in approximately two hundred thousand dollars a year just to upkeep this thing I do love 1991 BMW m3 and 3s though but I will never buy something like that that's like 28 years old like that is this stupid what do we got next rum we have a question from D okay I'm gonna say this first and I'm gonna tell me how to say a dis deficits deficit Fox its de de I fic D I D I fake Fox dye thick gosh why don't you make any League of Legends videos you said you enjoy it and play in your free time but you've only made one video before and I'm joking yo shout out yo riot hit me up for project day I like I like League every once in a while this is why he doesn't make League videos I I'm just being I'm just being facetious cuz I can never play another MOBA after the death of Paragon I'm scarred for life now I have to set them back up please no you can't statement I just cut you down blue with my samurai sword dude you're the one so you hurt me by killing Paragon and then you heard me might knock me over you really die Fick he goes and I really enjoyed that video thank you so one of the reasons is to make content from that game the way I do is very different not only that but that genre of game does not coincide with any other game I do like the kind of person that plays League they can play other stuff but like the people who don't play like people who play League can play different games but if you go the other way around like first I don't know buzz in general yeah just foreign yeah and they don't understand it I feel like most viewers of League are looking for like a very specific content creator nowadays to like there's not really like it's kind of like toast like in the sense that like you kind of want to go and try to learn something while you watch it yeah you know it's not so much I'm here to kind of escape and watch something funny and laugh it's more so let me learn something while I watched someone frag or something thank you for lying and tell me that you laugh in my videos I appreciate what do you mean I mean blog I was talking about everyone's making a self-deprecating joke right it's not that deep and then the other part too is it's nice to one have that completely separated because it's a game you can play that I have an issue just because of the nature of my job I'm normally playing a game there's always like well I could be recording or is this gonna be for a video if it's not why am i playing that kind of stuff it can like seep into the Hobby part of playing video games but with the league I know it's completely separate just me playing a game with friends or not whatever but it's completely separated so I don't have to think about that kind of stuff yeah that's for much why yeah I thought you had a question oh let me pull one up good luck dude they're all pretty wack you guys need to do better on these questions there's one like there's like bow maluca like what is that cat what is that oh wait do we answer it which one and then there's like two TL DR questions like that's too long I didn't read you guys gotta remember who's reading these they're me okay well we'll just do this one in a berry ask oka what thing or person annoys you the most what person or thing annoys me the most I think I've said this on the the most thing the person I hate the most is a yes man I hate somebody who just takes the path of least resistance and always just as I guess yeah yeah you're right yep yep like if they don't like something you're like oh I like this and there's like yeah I like that - look I love that - yeah I hate that like oh it's the word no it's the absolute worst right I hate it can't stand somebody who just always agrees this and do I like this sword this is a it's just I that that really annoys me when I see somebody who just takes the path of least resistance even when they know and they don't like where they're at and all they have to do is just kind of change the pattern of saying yes all the time and kind of just be a victim and just always kind of be in that spot of just kind of sad and I just I just I just don't want a yes man in my life because I've been a yes man and I was very sad and I didn't live for me and I was living for other people and I when I see it yes man that's what I see in it it sucks and it makes me sad so it doesn't really annoy me more so it kind of just makes me sad I'm gonna be about you blue [Music] well yes what's the next question I hate a rude person rude people suck there's nothing that annoys you no there is me that's why I say he's like oh all right fine I mean I've talked about it I hate because I have that I came here in the name but the mouth noises specifically but certain noises but yeah like mouth noises trigger me like that uh-huh like yeah like Rick and Morty yeah the burping literally can't watch Rick and Morty because all he did I can't like it in like he'll be first time I'm like like every time I can't that's all I felt in this and I can't focus and it's a good and then it happens again I can't do it haters over it and like I was telling Claire today when I might like the gym sometimes I listen like TED Talks or GDC talks you put in this on Twitter like I sometimes listen is to get high and it was mogs yeah that gets me so I do that's so funny Amy so different than you but I'll listen to that and sometimes they have the mic too close and then but my break like taking like I can like yeah because I don't want people to have to hear that or like there's too close to them and they hear like having every mouth to it I just sit thoroughly blue you don't like ASMR do you I don't hate it okay so you don't hate it now you hate it right yeah well the same reason a lot of it I need it to like shark is the only one that I know that likes object stuff is fine but when they start doing body noises or anything that's like without noise have you did have you seen one where it's like you close your eyes and it's like supposed to make you feel like you're getting a haircut and that one is really weird like it oh yeah yeah yeah it's weird yeah not a fan well we've been going on for 20 long a bit it podcasts over yeah that was a good round up that's really nice like I really thought I brought it all you embodied what this podcast was all about grew together during it oh absolutely blue where can people find you on the Internet as they grow into your separate endeavors only do the podcast because you are the number one hero endeavor you are I like endeavour a lot I use Rudy Minami hey guys if I'm a bad boy whatsoever Wow Wow no you're on Instagram you're it's blue I slow gaming fire why am i nice that's not you Oh No it follows me Teti and Christian and there's a blue west low gaming man you hear that because I thought maybe I'd like actually use it and I always thought that would be the best blue as if you did Instagram Instagram but you just posted pictures of like the mountains or like an hours everyday and I was like that's [ __ ] sick that's the best idea ever I was thinking about the other day I was thinking like I gradually do like parts of my body except they're like just fully clothed so like I'll have like a glove on my hands yeah and then I'll post like my shoes and then I'll post like the corner of my shoulder so at time your Instagram would be so poppin it would be insane like you could be like this souffle was great tonight but just have like maybe your thumb in the picture those at whoa you you go to populated places take a picture and you say I'm in here somewhere even if you're not oh yeah like you like you're not even in it let's say but then yeah that's people sit there and dissect everything like they'll try and be like okay that person looks like this person from this photo these was but the map yeah and then so they just go grocery something be like bought some bananas and like you're holding the bananas that's all like I just I've always thought that was a great idea so follow him on Instagram too and I know a lot of you ain't following that account right where can we find you uh Instagram calm slash blue west low gaming is where you can find me you can find me mr. fruit even though in reality must my URLs none of them are mr. fruit none of them unfortunately all taken next time once I hit a ninja's level I can be like this is mine no but I'm not it's an unhealthy mentality to not get your handles mr. fruit I once you lose one handle you've lost two I'm you should be angry about it if you were ain't more angry about it you'd have the handles it's not true I've reached out right but it's not Borden but this podcast is and so little issues yey-hey yes great view I thought we love you all - see you next week [Music]
