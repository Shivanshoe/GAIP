try man don't get high get high my brother shoo oh my god him that was sick they just disappeared i swear man okay i'm gonna kill him oh did i spread it did i fly from a live fire bro hi ho everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome back to destiny 2. and in today's video a look at a brand new old but new weapon oh jesus what even what is this dude a destiny 2 has never been more broken for me than this past like two days my app might very well crash it'll be the third time in about 10 minutes it's never just hard crashed like what is that what is that over there what am i looking at can i even inspect this ah there it is in all of its glory [Music] ah okay well we're back i don't know what's going on there we're taking a look at the callus mini tool not the miter mini tool because it's back with a vengeance and season of the haunted it has retained its midas energy superb handling move faster with this lightweight weapon equipped this weapon grants additional speed benefits when mida multi-tool is also equipped we want to go super fast now my role is not it it's pretty good chamber compensator extended mag whatever moving target increased movement speed and target acquisition moving while aiming down sights is okay perpetual motion or something would probably be better here but what you can do but it's the incandescent brand new trait and season of the haunted that can roll on the new weapons defeating the target spread scorch to those nearby more powerful combatants and opposing guardians cause scorch in a larger radius it just goes in the new cellar builds it's like the most redeeming thing right now for me and then the new origin trait for these callous tool uh weapons whatever to excess find the buzz with this weapon while your super is full grants a bonus to strength and discipline for a moderate duration so if i hold on to my super which probably won't get until like the end of the match but i can get extra strength and discipline to access we got a range masterwork and yeah it's the mida mini tool you know and loved from before so of course i'm throwing it on with the mida multi tool not gonna be using the mida well i might because it depends on the map we get but maybe just a little bit but we use this just so i can go super fast wait a second i don't have much mobility too i mean how much faster can it really make me when my eight percent base speed increase well maybe the miner the mini tool will carry me because we're also using the peacekeepers that's right the thing that i've pulled out like it four times in these very specific scenarios we gotta reload stowed smgs whatever but ready them instantly and improves our handling and movement while we what that's this three movement increases uh it doesn't show here read but i think i read in the patch notes that peacekeepers now give smg's i think like perfect in air accuracy as well because they did a whole bunch of inner accuracy changes or something i don't know it went over my head so actually yeah let's just uh throw on some mobility burr so i don't think the crucible is ready for what we're about to throw at them or rather what's about to be a blur to them because i'm gonna be so fast look at this look at this drip okay can anybody be bad with drip like this well actually yeah what is i'm flying so fast space literally can't keep up so i was right the pvp map is new it is here i just haven't gotten it yet but it it is here it's somewhere it's among us okay ready i'm pretty fast pretty fast yeah so anyway that's cool but your cape's freaking out i'm freaking out i didn't hit anything with that this is going great what's maybe it's just because i'm so fast i'm burning that would be no i still i i you know what it is oh okay i need my hammer out enemies showing 30 above i i can't is it just because my mobility is so much faster i kind of i kind of think that's what it is i know it sounds dumb but it's true okay i assisted with that that was cool and now oh look at that you it didn't seem like much but when i killed him he'll it's my little i have to like where is he what's happening holy you know if i had killed that one dude though they'd all be burning my biggest complaint with solar 3.0 by the way right now is the whole scorched versus ignite thing aka burn and explosion you you apply scorch stacks and you need to get to 100 and then it ignites for a big explosion right very fun very cool except in the past you could do that and you know you just kill somebody with it and then they explode and this one you can scorch them and kill them but then that's it unless you hit 100 stacks it doesn't matter it won't explode it's where's my team okay we traded somehow though which is weird like there's so much less explosions going on now especially because in pve especially like a lot of the smaller ads you'd want to like proc all the the explosions uh you just you kill them before you can even stack scorch 100 times so like nothing's exploding there was a vanguard question so i get i think it was like 25 ignition kills and if that was volatile i'd be like okay three prediction did not work out oh wait what and did three three strikes uh i think i had one i think i'd won oh i see the big ol explosion that's pretty much just because of the incandescent oh see because yeah that would spread the fire if uh anybody was here who who is ratting back here what i guess i should be floating around a little bit more but that's always the problem there's like all these interactors and changes of state we've said once i'll say it again titans take advantage of any accuracy the least just it just doesn't really work with our jumps and whatnot doesn't really make sense hunters can do it super easily warlocks well like that's their bread and butter okay i'm gonna kill him oh did i spread it i guess now he wasn't close enough i thought i would have spread my incandescent apparently not please stop hurting me okay i'm applying scorch i'm applying scorch you exploded and why oh my god how did you not die that's so sad wait i have to reload dude that's even sadder hold friend for i am here i don't know where they are perfect in their accuracy was an assist okay what wait what what was is that my friend jesus okay this is see this is not real okay yeah let me just let me just swap there this reminds me of doing the trespasser i saw some people like oh it's just the dude like you know trying to shoot at other people from like 40 30 meters away whatever like what what is that where are my bullets going it's just like that in the side when i when when i can only use the side arm i always sit there i'm like yeah i can i'm only gonna be using the sidearm uh how else do you expect me to fight him especially some of the maps it wasn't like okay let me simply it's like night this is it i can't do anything so oh nice i gotta give my boy scout best okay this dude is what smg you using guardian who to what now the antio okay some sunset one disgust me okay okay well we killed him we we killed him i don't feel great about it oh he's so weak he's so very weak check this oh my god what a name what a bank shot ready you're gonna see numbers flying everywhere any second now numbers okay yeah the grenade didn't work i figured you know i just dude hear me out here it's a cool pv weapon i ain't feeling it in pvp mr stark i'm always haven't used smg's in a while but this thing shreds like with the solar thing it's perfect for solar 3.0 builds pvp though it's is it's here okay but here's the thing here's the thing i have my super so if i get a kill i will get to excess with my discipline and strength oh my god i'm i'm so honored to be soloed by your golden gun wow it feels so much worse than i thought it would all right let's go yeah okay okay in fact most of the time i have died it's been because i eventually get to be wand whenever i get a kill i'm solo i don't know what the team's doing is it because i'm running from the team probably but i'm just going to blame them anyway go incendiary ah oh yo everybody was apartment burn papa burn i'm dead if i keep losing to like a 0.2 second which way you think i'm going yeah okay can i i'm gonna say jesus christ how is that not hitting the oh my god what happened to my projectiles why are they they doing like nothing these days there's no they weren't being generous at all it was like they're having to shoot golden gun headshots pray with my hammers to even damage people okay ready i don't know how this works ricochet that almost worked and that one shot me yeah they did change that they reverted that a little while ago right i wouldn't know i haven't played hunter um i'm fitting to act up i am very close to uh to switching the hunter this season i'm just gonna be up wait what okay oh i ex what one minute what wait a knife bounces twice he he just randomly i can't even be mad well played sir okay do you do you see that my bullets it says they're shooting straight you could and it's like two damage i get it rains but like they just disappear i swear man i'm running out of john's right isn't really only only one thing i can think of i was already weak too it's what in the lag yeah that's just one part of destiny pvp that i never liked and never bothered to really start doing is just the whole sliding shotgun melee never really my thing but that is oh what is that riptide no brand new crucible fusion rifle i figured out the problem it's been too long and i keep avoiding it and that's the problem it's time for the patented rumble test test test that's right now i'm on my own barely be getting double triple quadruple quintuple sexy tuple teams because what always happens the whole w all too much i was thinking miss fruit clearly there seems to be a bit of a pve got you said it yourself right i did i did but you know how we do it baby babyween pvp because when i farm these dudes i make it look like it's pve like uh you point to literally like last game um i've determined that's a lie like that's fair dude okay how did my name everyone's time to kill is like .3 seconds or something and i'm out here 41 mag deep you know just gah like jesus like maybe breaking a shield like okay and then it's just every smg better i don't get it this genuinely feels like it does not it does not make sense that's a trash roll essentially but he's even put a perk on it wait okay hold on it's i think it's because let's see this see this is a 600 rpm and this one's 900. yeah hundreds have never really been meta and um i'd like to think i'm demonstrating to you exactly what we did okay you know the other problem i'm adsing i think that's the problem screw the ads although i do have like the moving target which is kind of fun but yeah screw it all right no more ads here who is okay okay okay i couldn't even get that kill i couldn't even get that girl fight for my life here bro look at me just give me something man somebody said i got sex let's sir okay no no no no no you guys all spawn next to me no you guys fight it out i'm the third party here okay i think he he's he's caught on to what i'm trying to do here i'm chasing i'm sh where are you guys are you guys going stop running off you cowards oh that's a that's a nice nade and that's uh oh oh doing negative damage the throwing hammer of justice okay i don't know what that would put okay yeah no oh my god oh my god i'm alive barely but i'm alive yo for a little second there i had like eight million buffs running that was pretty cool try me yeah you're so close okay this is a big map and i swear during like what i scorched myself off his body or is it the lingering scorch from his throwing hammer i don't know why i sound like that right now yeah so that whole like perfect inner accuracy thing uh i've determined that was also a lie because uh it doesn't see what i don't know maybe his intention was to help but but then again i don't mean perfect it doesn't matter perfect that looked pretty perfect to me i guess what you're oh my god did you see that was am i playing apex legends what is this rat doing hold on let me kill this dude i give up i give up i turn around everything's one shot it doesn't matter something something just kills me in an amount of time that i cannot do anything to rebut you know take this the combo oh that would have been sick it's close too i don't know what you're doing ditch oh my darling you're my darling i've never known the uh yeah i've never known the other words that song i'm about i couldn't even like fake it's like is that even how it goes okay i'm kind of making a comeback though yo yo get high get hyped oh my god hit him that was sick oh my god i did it and then check this out ready put that message okay okay please help me what's going on who's what is this what's that is i don't that's a warlocks thing right and i was fighting a hunter i thought what was that i was getting actually done you still have heavy that's a different dude jonathan hammock has 16 kills because he's gotten 16 kills whatever okay you know i saw his dudes spawn that off didn't hit him um whatever he's yeah that's fair isn't this auto rifle it's like an smg but made for mid-range so that does make sense you can never just get close enough see that was okay since he was shooting me with a bow you know what counts as a dub quite literally top three finish okay it counts as a win according third place okay sweet you made third place it's like you heard me we'll take that we'll take that i got another fusion rifle wow we're just getting these everywhere now aren't we oh that was close lads look am i damaged out what's that about okay i'm gonna i'm gonna do something i never do prepare yourselves oh my god what is he what's he doing what are you what is this am i getting pranked where the ashton kutcher i'm going i'm going to briefly demonstrate to you incandescent in pve and how the the multi-tool can work now in pv you don't really need to get the the midas energy thing but okay peep it okay i really don't need peacekeepers here oh freaking just does it doesn't matter now let me show you especially a little bunch of enemies okay we're gonna start spreading this like it's a sexually transmitted disease because it's important to educate yourself kids okay nobody was close enough but that's why i chose average here is because wait for it wait for okay i had to reload i said wait for it okay ready screw it just you're burning you're burning everybody's burning mangling me why am i burning okay i kill you and it didn't spread hold on this is troll oh it did it just doesn't show me on the seat boom oh i'm burning oh guys oh my god

like once i give it to you you'll never be able to go back to a normal look okay ready this is a good time right okay boom and then i pop and then see skirt oh and they're all burning and there wasn't quite enough to kill you all but let's see ah that's sick baby so um yeah that's why i do uh pvp reviews the callus mini tool farm your local public event today and hope you get it for the record all of the new weapons from the season are at least like the callous ones and i think the hollowed ones or whatever those are called can roll incandescent seems pretty sick we give the kalos mini tool pve out of 10.
