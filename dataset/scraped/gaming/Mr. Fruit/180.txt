fly three xp baby what yo see you can like um you can uh put like a uh a youtube video out to this i glitch trials and then get a lot of clicks yeah free rap baby free rap that way most of the videos us not going flawless but it doesn't matter because that's not what it's about you know it's exactly it's about how to break the game trials of osiris okay maybe lucky for once is lucky just finding a game oh anyway yeah i was like that's lucky now just get the opportunity of getting my ass kicked like it looks like we will that's what we've gotten to at this point yeah i'm scared i want to go each home and aim true they're outside oh my god i'm so weak one behind us too i'm gonna die no i'm not they're going i little weenies oh my god he's close right you just spawn swap them foul one minute

right i'm coming to you nice blue challenge me again one minute left happy more like sad about oh it really be that way go next all right dude you asked me do you know what time will be done and i responded with no because destiny sucks [Laughter] thirty percent went flawless i think we just dude you have stop you're literally you giving me anti-vaccinations yeah that is pretty anti-vaxx vibes you give me like anti-vaccine like yeah so like my cousin uh that means they're not one of the three people who go oh my god i'm gonna fight you i really don't care i was one of the three people that actually stopped playing this game regularly so i'd rather have that than the 33 who made trials you guys know why i'm here all right it doesn't matter if it's like i'm coming back and playing this game if it's pvp and competitive doesn't matter see i i've learned to drop that ship in this game entirely because this game is even lucky to have pvp in it to still have it i should say trials of osiris it's like destiny hey guys we're getting rid of pvp nothing was lost you know you know what i mean we're like if you close your eyes does it oh that'd be like that hey we got this match all right we were we're gonna be okay yeah wait there's that two people oh there's three i like that guy's armor protect your team do you like we'll need each other oh my you're nuts boys where's the last guy i was actually an ns we've already won more than we did last game does it almost feel like no things changed at all somebody stop this man we can go we can get four wins here we get four wins

the game yeah but you don't care that's what so like it doesn't that is true like i have taken away the care which means nothing anymore you know what i mean that is important i think this just upsets me because i feel like as a whole i've just gotten bad at games and um it's like when my youtube channel is not doing well and someone comments like dude dead channel it hurts even more you know that's kind of the same thing see the way i see that is i look at their channel and it's like they don't know what a dead channel is because they would look at their own channel and comment on their own channel that it's at that channel comment in the chat if you have a dead channel yeah if you guys have a dead channel please wave okay it may make mr fruit feel better give us a free win please please dead channel the channel oh he's got a thorn oh he's got no composure oh he's different you're among common people no one's gonna make you feel bad here epic gamer yo oh whoa there's a soccer
