hi ad hope you won money mr. fruit and welcome back to the cycle now big thank you to the cycle for sponsoring this video I checked this game at about nine months ago when it first entered early access I had a ton of fun with it and was looking forward to seeing where they're gonna take the game well they reached out and let me know well turns out there's been tons of new updates seasons and well you're just gonna have to watch the video because it's amazing for those unaware the cycle is a PvE VP game on the surface some might say it's about a RAL but it's so much more than that you can go in solo duel or with a squad and you hop into a match and the idea is that you get the highest score and try to evac you're competing against all the other prospectors and the maps that aren't on your team or you make a pact with now the map is filled with enemy players that you can PvP or there's PvE monsters everywhere that you can slay for points resources to scavenge items to collect and fight over and during the game you get credits that you spend in that match to get new guns upgrades point is it's great myself Rob blue and vs. we hopped into some games had a lot of fun I hope you all enjoy this video and if you do there will be a link down in the description box below to check it out I highly advise that you do so it's free to play you got nothing to lose but everything the
