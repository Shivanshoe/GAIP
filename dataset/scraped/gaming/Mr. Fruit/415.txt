heidi hope everyone my name is mr fruit and welcome to today's video sponsored by epic games thank you very much deborah games for sponsoring this video now i was preparing myself for what we're about to witness i was doing some mental gymnastics oh hey this is i can explain you should do them as a kid i was a lot better than mental gymnastics is no joke but i'm preparing myself because a low iq what am i i guess neanderthal being a person that i am you know i'm gonna have to elevate my brain function because uh it's auto chest time now i know what you're thinking like this chess imagine this is like a chess piece no do i actually have chess i don't know let me go check a few inches later all right well the bits ruined great i was i was gonna turns out we don't have a chest set why don't we i was there was gonna be a bit i was i was gonna be like give me like this chest and i was gonna throw it and be like no time has passed let's just get into it i'm talking about this auto chess based off of well actually it's from the original creators of the dota auto chess mod where this whole shananna gannery began this is their creators this is their game auto chess it's free on the epic game store click the link down in the description box below to go get it yourself on the epic game store and if you make any in-app purchases or anything make sure to use creator code mr fruit that'd be cool now i've played autochess and auto chess flight games but the thing i like the most about auto chess is i think it's the most beginner friendly and i'll show you what i mean okay wow okay i can start round one by starring this guy up if i want to so i'm actually going to lock the store here so if you are unfamiliar with how this works auto chess you get these creatures they all have their synergies which do different things like for instance we have here stone spirit which has the spirit trait and the warrior trait now if you get x amount you'll see over here like let's say i got two spirit i'm gonna have to move my face aren't i so different down here all right well this should be better so what happened was you missed it i just ended up buying those two other ones they combined to a two star unit which you can see here there's a lot to take in an auto chest but let me let me put it this way imagine you're playing chess but it you could you could they would battle and it would happen automatically you get what i'm getting at maybe not but that's okay okay so here's what i'm gonna do i am going to go for marksman why not i like marksman i think it's fun i need to buy something else i think oh god what am i buying oh what am i doing oh i don't know i'm buying another one of these oh this can't be good okay now see this is the cool part what i just did here so imagine you have chests but instead of pawns and knights and bishops and kings and queens they're monsters and they all have special traits put enough out on the field to activate said special traits so for instance well i need to pick one of these items i'm gonna grab this looks pretty cool so hunter oh sorry it's the hunter trait oh but i'm trying to explain to them oh okay well that's a hunter okay i'm just gonna slot you in right there buddy el pal so so get this i can click this button and it will position my board to what it thinks is going to be the best place to put them all based on my comp which in all other auto battlers you have to figure that out yourself and that could be one of the turn offs people like i don't get the positioning who needs to go in the front who needs to go in the back how does this work well guess what click that button and it'll help you and the more you know the more nuanced it can be like obviously that helps but nine times out of ten if you actually know how to play and want to position yourself you can probably make a better lineup but this is a great way to start and i'm actually i'm absolutely dumping on this rooster cockadoo looking son of a gun but if you see there i really am a booga booga i'm a bunga goblin and okay so oh that's great another another hunter and another hunter so watch this trade over here we have two out of three boom three out of six so now what's activated is all allied hunters gain attack and have a 50 chance to not miss on attacks which is great because there is a certain perk where people are actually harder to hit and if we go up against those you guessed it we're gonna be looking a okay so yeah we're going marksman or uh hunter i always forget it's a great build in my opinion and here's here's another awesome part about it okay i can just go like uh you know recommend the lineup i have some hunters maybe i want to go for uh let's go for warrior hunter boom so now when new stores come up i've enabled this so it shows me what i want and if somebody that's in that lineup shows up in my shop it'll let me know what about yo you dingus buy this okay so battle begins so you'll see everybody has their own traits whatever they're supposed to do it all starts and then it all battles out by itself by itself that's why it's called auto chess i know crazy right and we're absolutely dumpstering on kids so the way this works you can see over here everybody has health i am one of two people who has yet to lose when you reach zero health guess what you're done for and you lose health depending on when you lose how many people they they defeated you with and what part in the game it is so later in the game you're going to be taking more damage but you want to build up an economy you want to buy your items you want to combine them because like i said if you get three of one unit they become a two star and then if you get three two stars they become a three star and as you imagine the better the stars the better the character and the unit like i said a lot of digest here but you guys are smart i know you can do it okay so nothing here i want fine so i could re-roll the shop and quite frankly i think i will uh we hit nothing so that's unfortunate let's try one more time oh i get a star somebody up okay we'll start with that it's not a great start we're still struggling a little bit but that's okay but now that this person's a two star it's our best carry we're gonna put our items on them and then we're going to pray but oh tis the season look at these little golems they got presents so every now and then you get ai rounds which means item drops and all that kind of good stuff so look at that i got a magica staff and then they'll probably drop something i get to choose from survey says there we go so i'm going to go with ability damage because we're all about damage right now and i could actually combine these so the owner has 35 ability damage i'm going to put that on some butter we're gonna put that item on our carry again we're gonna look at the store oh see that check mark beautiful that means we want that person that's great we say nay how about we do that oh that's great okay and with that we didn't hit any new synergies i don't think oh we did we did we hit uh oh of course the eager eggers trait which we're going for so all enemies lose four armor and then if we get four of them all enemies lose eight armor and so the idea here is we get this trait to lower their armor which protects them against physical damage and then we have hunters who do a whole bunch of physical damage so inherently they're doing more damage you see what i'm getting at here this game makes me feel so smart perfect oh wind ranger another evil knight umbra wait a second i actually think i have six hunter so if i put you here and you hear oh one more one more okay so we'll just have to go all in on the hunter trait but that means we currently have six people uh so right now we have max buff which all allied hunters gain 85 attack and have a 65 percent chance to not miss on tax that is a lot of damage so i'm hoping that this raw damage will carry us through the earlier rounds before we get a bit more of the front line because most of the hunters aren't so much you know people you want to put on the front line they want to sit in the back their range they want to deal more damage but we're working with what we got and it's working because we're in second place however there's this guy um this is his board whatever he's doing seems to be is he he's not going my build is he i think he's going my build okay i don't see anything here which means i'm gonna take my extra xp because after 50 gold you don't get any more bonuses for keeping gold so you never really want to stay above 50 or no more than you don't want to collect more you always want to kind of get down to 50 in between rounds so you're making the most of your money i'm keeping a safe econ which i probably don't need to do so i'm actually going to level that seven oh okay apparently i messed it up because i oh yeah i have three eager sis in there i was supposed to have two eager six hunter um i'm hoping this still works out in our favor though yeah why do we have we have two wind rangers in there on accident that's my bad that should be our dwarf sniper and then we'd have six marksmen or six hunter two eager sis of course but we're still winning so i ain't complaining still nobody we're looking for so i'm just gonna level up until we're at about 50. then i'm going to see which item this should go to so they still want to put the item on our carry which is a great idea i agree now they're a little bit harder to kill we got our positioning and it makes sense what we're looking at so this guy's a melee he's our best bet for a front line he's the tankiest these guys can draw a little bit of aggro and depending on if they have assassins these guys can draw them out then we have our carry in the back corner so that it can attack more realistically because you see here an assassin wanted to jump to our unit but we have the dwarf sniper right behind it to bait out assassins trust me this guy has so many two stars though holy cow must be nice so we're gonna lose this one unsurprisingly because we have one two star but we're gonna start fine we're gonna where are they exactly all right well guess i'm just gonna start leveling is that well that needs to happen wait a second oh wait we have duo of this wait where did this come from wait a second oh it's fixed wait am i blind i'm blind i'm actually blind okay well we do need to hit level nine for some other shenanigans for marine uh but good news is we're four eager sis six hunter which means we're just doing even more damage and yes i'm gonna get more raw damage why wouldn't i let's peep my items we're gonna combine these oop um all right and skull hunter oh he's not even a part of the build that would be why i've kept him in this whole time but we don't actually need him now each character also has their own ability so for instance this soul reaper deals 100 magical damage to enemy units and 100 healed ally units and 3 radius so he's big he kills the enemy and keeps our people alive ready he almost has max mana boom look at him healing all of us we're all tethered to him meanwhile our carry when they activate their ability even though they're just dead it increases their attack speed but we're all stunned and i actually lost huh do i have a level two of this dude i do you know i'm just gonna sell that dwarf sniper at level two all right whichever one i get another two star up first is who we're just gonna go for the three star we're gonna go with uh extra mana region why not and another staff which means we can equip these oh evil knight okay we need that let's see come on let's find it please soul reaper no i don't have room all right uh i already have level two sorry okay we're buying that oh star up okay hold on level that up that's a three star oh shoot suddenly it's looking pretty good folks all right i'm going to place him over here and then let's move all of our items restore we're nuts and you can see on the damage graph i never showed you guys dps who's doing the most our three star is killing it right now but i need to not put him in the front that would be a smart idea but other than that we're chugging along and we're winning this is big this is big but we still haven't won against our nemesis i'm gonna worry about that later yeah out of sight out of mind you know what i mean okay let's see if we can just get a star up here somewhere i think i was pretty close but i panicked when i saw him and i just sold things embarrassing but uh let me make sure i didn't take anyone out that i was supposed to have in there it doesn't look like it let's position do that put all of our oh my god look at this dwarf sniper double cheeked up with these items okay here we go the final battle there's no way i'm letting you get away with this hopefully the tsunami stalker did die immediately but i put him in the front so that's perfectly fine our dwarf sniper is popping off look at that oh no yeah look at that not even three star doing the most damage and just like that winner winner chicken dinner number one victory on an 11 win streak we only lost what one two games okay what can i say i'm built different this forehead can only contain so much that's why i have the game to help me so like i said
