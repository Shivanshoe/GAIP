evil beasts i'm going to find you later when i do ah oh hey whoa whoa what the fudge hit me oh that's dull you sassy bakas heidi ho everyone my name's mr fruit and welcome to into the pit i don't know much about it but i know these few buzzwords fps roguelike boom that's what i'm here for that's yeah that's it let's do it oh and i do know it has some pretty pretty cool interesting graphics loretta you're my cousin they call me foolhardy but you're more reckless than even our grandfather your pursuit of arcane knowledge is admirable but this time of you have gone too far speaking of going too far where we walk into lauridia i knew you were following a rumor through the wastelands the scent of dark rituals allowing access to other worlds but since your last missive begging me to come here i've heard nothing it is not like you a prolific writer to become so abruptly silent yeah like whatever like filter uh so i promise to find you and now here i am at the outskirts of a desolate hamlet under dark eldritch skies what did you discover loredia are you still here and if not have you left a trail for me to follow okay so i'm looking for loridia i am i don't know if i know my name but apparently i'm here to fight in the depths of hell oh my god we're zooming hello town clerk ruination is upon us stranger a profound evil emanates from the great pit a beloved out a man has abandoned us and most of the village have vanished with him the remaining villagers are too scared to do anything but perhaps the ritual keeper could help i beg you go speak with him his alcove is in the toe across the plaza villagers love the aesthetic though oh i guess the rune of calamity i knew that shut up no i haven't all right i'm i'm working at it ah hello outlander i'm afraid you have caught me at a bad time says the merchant normally i would be able to offer you valuable extreme services over my voltage lock the main quest of dry my business is to serve the villagers in monetary matters exchanging moats and whatnot however most of my normal clients are lost within the pit through some incident involving the element there's simply no point in operating my business like clients to provide for 18 or so returned voters make it worth morale go forth and extricate them 18 return value the heck who is it the outlander he's the room cleaver i don't know why go away i cannot help you my workshop was damaged by the last demonic quake and i can't fix it myself normally i would assist you by constructing ritual wounds to empower you within the pit but with the workshop in disarray there's nothing i could do perhaps if you were to rescue some of my colleagues we could restart the missions look i cannot move these chunks of masonry myself rescue at least one villager and then we shall see if the artificial station still works okay well one see that's a lot more doable i am the key maker and you are not so talkative i see well you don't need to talk to the monsters do you and there are plenty of them around at the moment crawling out for the demonic realms of the pit i am of course an expert in the understanding of these demons and their lair and i can craft powerful runes that serve as keys to access their evil realms however with so many villagers lost in the pit there is little point in running my workshop please rescue the fools and we will see what we can do uh go away stranger that outlander perhaps you could rescue us from this disaster shut up yeah whatever okay what did i get the ruin a ruin around sure ah access the ritual sigil well what is this place dilly dilly oh set runes with the open the pit to the underworld uh the key to the obsidian thought this invocation will open the pit to the obsidian fortress three villagers to be rescued increased damage from all sources but an extra remote each time you collect one in the pit i don't know what that means i begin each journey with a small amount of emotes of renewal begin each journey in the pit with the cheat death ability already partly charged beginning journey into the pit with additional health sure oh can i just i think i can just pick all of them yeah why not yellow sure the ancient ritual has been performed go now wait what the fudge ritual chamber zero four altars active locked yes of course they appear to all be locked press to leave the oh uh it's me it won't last for long so listen carefully in each of the pits there are four altars they activate an altar you see i just gave up from the voice you must sit at the champions league from this room destroy the keystone diagram and also rode you with the overpower absorbed accusing the potency of your bellies he's doing uh so much you trade for the uh upgrades power which one which one which one reduces incoming damage when you're low health slows melee attackers reducing incoming damage by small amount let's go slows melee attackers oh i can pick one for everything i like high power let's go mid-range so i got freaking hawk and then i got whatever this one was called oh that's fine let's go to the chamber of blood yes maybe not it won't let me hello okay i don't know what that was about destroy two keystones i'm on it kind of feels like doom-ish you know what i'm saying picking up oh it feels very doomish oh whoa oh load i swear this doesn't happen every time okay pick the oh wow collect all of these things they have vital importance oh get absolutely okay hold up i'm already getting the hang of it we're moving fast it's insane it's fast paced could use with a little death music death metal even though i don't prefer death metal hey one down they're starting me off well with some easy stuff because they think i can't take it but i can give it to me how do i get up over there that'll do it pb panel ppl pew pew pew pew oh my oh i can hold it i can hold this down like this okay has to recharge believe that okay all right i understand you're done for easy it's done time 120. rookie numbers wait i missed a moat oh that won't do now you've survived the chambers collect your reward let's go bleeding damage all right oh that was it okay another one no this seems like a bait wait oh healing free chamber look at me go i just knew it boom eight seconds beat that pooped on oh my god i'm good there's a real train have increased range i guess i'm just loving on my right hand sure oh wait the symbols probably tell me what they do this is green and this is yellow green destroy three keystones oh is that the kind of moats i can gather probably have some kind of a say in the matter of something oh the right hand's too strong right now bruh they don't know what to do hey i'm bleeding ov i jump super hot you are a lot faster than i thought you'd be get your blood off of me you heathens i don't know what those do but i do not like them sam i am ow i've taken damage i don't know what that thing does and why i couldn't hit it at some points but we're good and all right don't look at the time now my bash ugh 115. didn't even get the 112. give me something good projectiles real quick and apply curse protection right hand apply poison plus three oh my god right replaces slicing bolts oh i don't want to do that let's go they apply curse causing outgoing attacks to hurt the attacker sure oh yeah now it's cursey ooh should i go green or blue let's do the blue swirl okay can't okay apparently i can only go through these for now for whatever reason where you at speed the speed run speed [Music] oh i didn't realize there was only one i could have gotten more currency whatever deflects back a percentage of melee damage with that you'll finish defensive stuff am i right right ah exit the further depths available dive deeper hello well done you managed to descend now you're familiar with how these chambers work be sure to look for lost friends number of villagers hiding in each dungeon if you can find them and speak to them they will be safe returning uh red seems cool okay well we're just starting right off the bat are we see they have a shield i have to be close enough i guess okay i can slow myself i don't know why i'd want to do that but i can do that thought i wouldn't see it did you let me check for friends any friends need my rescuing perhaps not good go 52 seconds that's right under under a minute ah you know it uh am i even getting hurt in the event then something like that happens let's see what the gold one is i'm pretty sure it's just the kind of moats i get i don't know what the difference is oh chamber of wealth so perhaps oh yeah i guess if i just looked at what i said at the beginning i would already understand what each one does oh hey whoa whoa what the fudge hit me hello i actually don't know what hit me hey get over or get out of here whatever you want to do hey what's this all about huh start to kill everything first i think i just have to walk over whatever that was weird oh we're continuing sure i don't know what that is and i don't want to find out same with that and that shoot first ask questions later okay yeah we just got to unlock him easy peasy let me check over here anything else nope perfect almost collected that's what we call straight cash 120 could be better i'm all in on my right hand baby oh wait oh villagers uh hello hello dear i really don't want to be any trouble but humble scrubs like myself shouldn't really be in a place like this well we got one refuse power ref what does that mean plus five red used to forge key runes i see increased chance of receiving higher ready spell upgrades used to buy runes okay let's go with just increased piercing i guess uh let's go with the blood thing ow oh bro i just got here man really come on y'all no you don't yeah i heard you trying to sneak up on me not today away i say and so does the snake oh you bleeding you might want to get that checked up on rare you suck a bad record in in rewire ah why'd you wait what the [ __ ] i have three help what the fudge just what what did what are those things doing to me wait it was all going so well i just don't know i'm down to stunned i think i'm dying ow seriously wouldn't have three health protections for another tan have increased damage from right hand computer increased maximum health all right apparently i need that dive deeper outlander by now you should know the evil logic of these chambers but now know that there are more twisted dimensions you've already seen signature once you have the pit i will have more of these flats for you any villagers was that one no no whoa chamber of blood magic proceed upgrade my powers lose some health i don't really know you cannot afford anymore but no well if i had known that i wouldn't have been that way free room i guess particularly degrees protect those i don't want to replace that flex poison melee attackers sure uh let's go this way oh oh we needed that yup two easiest rooms of my life do we know that's the symbol for chamber of healing you should probably remember that plant to seed so they explode right hand increased rate of fire oh my god upgrade to level four sometimes replenish health when an enemy dies ooh oh man those are both tempting but i should probably go with a faster fire rate yoho baby i'm a glass cannon watch this ready look at that rate of fire i don't stand a chance whoa they got armor now hold up what the fudge is this thing is somebody in the demon upon my show oh wait what why does everyone have armor now hey that's not cool is that was that fair reps can we get a check on that or i don't know what that was but okay sir sir go away i don't know what you do i don't know what you want aside from me well done oh projectiles no thank you what does this do i don't know look the game's foul fast-paced i'm not supposed to ask questions we're supposed to do things okay as far as i'm aware lucky evil beasts oh is that the thing giving everything shields uh i get it now no stop it with the evil summoning there like sheesh leave it being all i'm saying i didn't collect everything but that's okay i only miss one more forgive me uh slow projectiles it's like additional damage that's pretty good my left click is really good it's just oh only fires occasionally and it's harder to hit thus why it would deal more damage mr fruit yes i understand okay all right there's no need no need to hiss at me dude okay let's talk let's talk this out okay only one at a time gotcha yes yes yeah see i can do it too stupid i'm gonna give you the chance what oh it's gonna say i didn't touch that refs can we get a call like come on man oh okay watch first run i'm gonna complete this i'm calling it now everyone's like don't push your luck go uh take what you have uh no extra critical hit chance booyah and we're done perfect dive deeper any villagers any villagers villager i'm coming fear not i've come to rescue you my friend gotcha you are free six seconds on that save nice increases damage when hell is 90 or higher oh i'm not there but i'll take it maybe i'll heal myself one time speed speed i oh god i am not speed i'm backing up i'm backing up you ain't got no range yeah okay all right you got friends huh you got back up do you i hear people peop peeper i hear people hear people creepy crawling around here i know what you're trying to get at oh what a snipe okay you're gonna show yourself you're gonna be a coward looks like you're opting to be a coward i hope you bleed to death check it oh my god absolutely eviscerated annihilated i'm trying to think of different words that all mean you got pooped on go go go i'm starting to get the hang of this and i know their tricks they're not clever i've caught on skirt wait wait wait they don't want me back here wait oh run okay nailed it i thought there was only one so i was like oh well the other place will have something that but news how that worked okay perfect uh increases damage the health is under and maybe i should get that now but uh protectors from the right hand to increase damage to enemies under certain health or oh that's kind of cool projections often will critically hit if you have not cached from this hand for a few seconds six second interval do bonus damage when i'm under x by now give me the cash that's language i know wait what is that a spawner oh so we're spawning things now are we on you have little walls do i have something coming this way okay the spread from a distance is whoa wilden out oh [ __ ] wilkers is exactly the thing i'd be saying in this scenario like this demonic beans on the pith of hells g welkers stop it satan we'll call it g that's not ow what hit me ah jesus there's little orbs in the sky i guess you're not very sneaky dude you're like i'm gonna sneak up album i'm gonna hide around the corner and just go [Music] he'll never know dude only so many ways found it it all makes ow that's dull you sassy [ __ ] okay all right not great

first pit i better not ooh spooky oh also kind of cool very atmospheric mmm okay spoopy who are they okay i'm just gonna start shooting i'll ask that later okay he slowed me so maybe whenever he does that i should jump oh okay are those gonna stop or okay what have you done here okay well he appears to have spawned some ads and i have to get close enough to kill these things okay he spawned he spawned more action than i thought he did gonna be honest a lot more than i thought clearly where the fudge okay well there goes my cheat death where'd all these things come from what they're spawning on me can i not stop this or the fudge okay okay jumping does not help if you're cursed and he's running towards me i don't like that oh i do not like you so fast [Applause] come on come on hey let's go the pit guardian has been vanquished my descendant of the pit has been one of terran revelation the realm below is one of many layers linked by passages like dreams of delirium the obsidian fortress is patrolled by demons like the ones we saw in grandfather's grimoire hello dear please free me i'm so sad i like chests motive inside oh yes i feel exceptionally clever give me trendful i'll be the judge of that stupid oh oh god i thought he was fighting bad at me he's like hey and that's how it's done outlander you went into the pit return was it were down there the villager of the
