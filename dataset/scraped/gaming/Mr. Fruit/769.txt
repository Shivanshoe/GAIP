hi ad Holdren my name's mr. fruit and welcome back to more called duty modern warfare another day another camo on our road to Damascus not just any camo my friends the golden combat knife this one wasn't too difficult probably the hardest part was doing the stupid kills while injured similar to the riot shield because for some reason it is so inconsistent so incredibly inconsistent yeah for my attachments on my combat knife I like just just the knife it's all you can do pro tips you're welcome now the riot shield is still a work in progress a very frustrating work in progress but we got the knife so that means once I get the red shield it'll be ready and plat baby now I want to prepare you all for this game we're about to go in if you didn't see it I made a video on the combat knife a while ago this will be my highest kill game ever and we popped off so if you've seen that and your expectations are set that high lower him that was a fluke and will no doubt never happen again but you bet we gonna try anyway now of cool all right well we're just starting with the OL kill streaks in here okay this is fun okay my friends are getting sniped left and right I'm not I'm not terrified you're terrified ah oh you trying to shoot me check it come on now rush this corner rush it do it somebody fetch ah didn't quite rush it but god I was gonna say let me know you're all did I stick that I did oh my god I helped kill it nice enemies are around here somewhere I think they're spawning right over here [Laughter] [Music] we had a good thing going there and then it stopped being a good thing you're stunned ah but my teammate took the kill that's fine it's fine I don't want to use dead silence yet because I'll probably die like that and it'll be all for naught screw it I'm using it skirt you're dead it's all about those sliding kill yeah okay thought my team was over there don't don't really know what happened that's okay boys I forgive you all now watch me kill this guy mounted on up here ready boom oh that was actually impressed had to eat um how did he even how did he hear that he didn't even hear the the stun hit the ground yet he was just kind of like I knew exactly there uh-oh yeah well guess what buddy double cheeked up right now you can't hear this and my booties clapping a little bit but aside from that you ain't got nothing no mean boy what hey where was he wait did he well I made that pretty easy for him didn't I are you there sir no I don't think so nobody's home I mean it's not expected to be an absolute God using the combat knife it's fun and you can have your pop off lives but all in all it's not gonna go this is gonna kill me isn't it yes it is I knew what I was signing up for me I refill my my knife ammo just gives me a whetstone and I just kind of sharpen it a little bit boom I found him with a direct hit a friend cleaned up the kill because I hate getting kills uh-huh that's why I let you have it buddy so so glad you could take it from that's the frustrating thing to you about using the knife and right shield to keep trying it camera challenges oh you'll have people stoned or like on the ropes like that and then your teammates like oh they just think it's their bounty to harvest like no I did all the hard work I was at there every day planting the crops watering the crops looking after the crops making sure the crops didn't die making sure the crops were loved and looked after and all this kind of stuff and you know what you did nothing you just come in here as soon as they're ready to harvest you take them and you're like this is mine no and that's mine and that's mine ha ha oh my god he'll wait wait the worst possible time dude I am drinking some water remember to hydrate everybody hydration makes the heart happy everything in your body the body was meant to feed on water live function its fuel for the soul I hate my life I don't know what I expected running in like that but it's nice now we're in killstreaks worried about kills from behind we're in about ha blah blah blah you took that kill I called you I had to burp all them I called dibs apparently that means nothing these days darn Jen's ears don't understand what that is the equivalent of me calling shotgun you guys still do that oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute this never happens this is my Claymore now I should have put on that one challenge like heck 15 pieces of equipment art challenge ever never happens hold on I'm trying to not immediately die as soon as I get in but that does not happen oh now just kill me we're just holding these corners and unfortunately watch though this guy's all grown up watch this boom chakalaka Bop yeah you can't mount up put him out and put him out of mount Bop right shield as long as you don't have friends you can't do nothing why what you gonna do blah wait this isn't my knife but this is wait I'm mob not Molotov thermite whatever it's all the same even took in my right [ __ ] but he likes done near some and then I tripped my own feet I was trying to shoot me right now that person would be come here boy wait there's another one sit bye bye mister enemy guy hated your guts but you keep spawning and all of your friends they show up when I least expect it thinking how the heck are you there's so many of you who up there is only supposed to be sick your ups nice now watch this dad's gonna be chasing me okay well that was a mistake did I just hear some whiskey Pacific my brother I think that ow that would be a yes my RP is so high right now oh thank god I was about to cough up along their way I was a scoreboard no wonder we were getting destroyed where my team by the way they just all kept quitting screw it we're gonna be playing Amazon Prime playlist it's called same-day delivery that's the joke but it is cranked and drop zone so let's see how that goes knife and Nolan haven't actually played cranked yet but I think it's like you have to kill to stay alive that you have to move or something supposed to keep you moving and grooving I guess I'll see what my timers add if something that I don't I don't know make an oppa hole a bunch of garbage right now as I tend to do just garbage spewing from my mouth over and over that's a nice done meat and I'll give this guy he has no idea oh my god I can't believe I should kill him okay I'm cranked oh you can see the chimer bottom left no wait what what did they uh I don't know what happens when it runs out though oh well I don't have to find out oh oh oh watch this yeah I think you're afk so I don't care a boom kill toms - I think that means I I get more I was trying to do ki fakie cry steer 180 ladder stall him but he saw right through my plans oh it's got randomly mated so well played to you but I think you do more damage or there's some sort of a bonus but I have no idea since I'm running around with my knife as to what that bonus is god only knows literally only he and the devs and everybody else playing this game out that's actually played this game on before and read what the game mode is I could have done all of those things but I didn't so here I am now watch this skirt ah yeah you're on bouncing betty discourage english skirt bob no damage that's right you're injured IQ i used to think you could just crouch and avoid damage and then I'm like wait a minute you can lay prone and avoid it all that is a nice stunned me Bob pop and pop pop and pop oh my god oh my god cracked more like cranked am i right oh my god it actually worked okay this is incredible this oh gosh darn dingus dings man I didn't realize he knew where I was coming from aha it was not prepared for her and Mazhar I wonder if since it's only 48 to 44 something tells me depending on how cranked how correct you are might also deter our okay I'm running away from whatever that is might also be bonus points depending on how correct you are you know if it's your second or third kill in life that might reflect how many points you're gonna get but I'm dead silent and I know there's some clever around here because it's this one guy with all of his bouncing Betties he just loves them and you love them so much rent you Miriam goddamn and I can't find him you shut up alright I'm missing out on all the action I guess didn't want to be invited anyway oh you poor soul that's right no no kill my friend get my friend ride shield for the rescue oh ho what up and now I'm cranked and now I'm cracked on these twin sticks I did he see my ride shield clip in through the wall or something that's the worst about the ride shield you think you're all sneaky nobody can see oh and on the other side they just see your shield poking out clear as day and it gets killed I was I don't I don't I try to lay prone there but the game decided hey how about no and Here I am Oh get destroyed once they see how fast I can head it and oh my god they're gonna be like oh my god he's a real gamer if you can't even crank 90s don't even talk to me and for those unaware I'm not even I'm not even using a controller I was joking about being cracked on the old twin stick it's okay it's bit okay how about I don't or how about Bob I think my friend just killed you that is convenient timing and what do you know my teammate takes all the glory did that mean justify gravity ran around like this jumped but except you jump like a fool still like a reverse reverse personal radar al I have something to say about this ready yeah not even close okay thought maybe I could put the arm behind that but evidently not my boy Rogers didn't make the Superbowl neither will I if your mother oh yeah I'm coming too oh he just died right here check it what's freaking I tried to hold it I was ready to animate him give him the ultimate BM but it didn't connect and then he turned around so oh I see you you are sixteen going on seventeen but you won't make it cuz I killed you you won't get a birthday you are so dead like that play it didn't work at all but I knew I had the ratchet on my back and I couldn't do anything so I was just gonna turn my butt bop sit there while the stun did its thing and then go to kill him he didn't play out but I felt pretty smart for a Tim Tina but just like the guy won't have a seventeenth birthday doesn't really it's not a smart play if I'm dad but if it doesn't work yes ah finishing move those are few and far between even more so being able to do without getting interrupted by anyone friend or foe oh my god I hear you right down here I'm coming if I could live is it this mayor is this game going on for couple moons too long it's been a fortnight anybody remember when fortnight was actually just a medieval term used for signaling an amount of time that's passed whereas now everyone just thinks about kids snortin gamer juice and crank in 90s that just me I sound like a Boomer now don't I joke's on you I'm a millennial it's true I think Millennials are cut off was like 95 or like yes soon as 95 started I think it then became gen Z but I was born in 94 s right right at the cutoff of Millennials mean my entitled attitude says every boomer ever like that yeah you do Bob oh what a perfect execution the stunt was a ballsy play because if he had rushed me any sooner surely I would have been dead but I knew I counted counted it out loud oh you get old you oh wait what what that wait where did you okay I don't know what events just transpired I wanted to do it before these guys are show bluebies Oh what okay I held that I held that down for the record okay what's going on here on the nobody like it oh yeah hey one finds him and I well ten sayings for the game ends hurry find a kill I go down I was gonna kill me oh I hate my life that's that's really how I end the game huh dying to fall damage classic mister for a play of the game hey leave this man swinging away come here what you thought you you take away boy hey we actually won positive let's go yes I am clapping for myself no one else is gonna do it so that's another Gold down my friends I think I might save ride shield for last cuz I or just like use it for an hour here and there and then swap back to something else because it's stupid three kill streaks who came up with that I don't know thing called much for watching happy listen right Ashley I'll talk to you in the next one farewell [Music]
