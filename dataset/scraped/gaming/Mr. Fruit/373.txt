it was thematic i'm a lumberjack bro i got the elders swamp keys would you guys like to see the elder trophy [Music] he's ugly so i wonder what we can make with the other body i don't want it well we can uh return back to the stones and find out i read her deposit over here though well the problem is we uh we can't teleport with uh or so oh teleports nope oh i wonder why that is i also have two of these swamp keys yeah each one oh yeah get make sure i have one so give rob one all right the legends told that there are four dungeons in the swamp yes you need the e to enter the dungeons oh but supposedly there are very dangerous foes in the swamp but i'm not afraid also we might as well pick up all this wood he broke for us thanks dude and the thistles too thanks stupid watch we're gonna die to a log falling oh my god we defeated i mean i did die to a log technically you know yeah yeah you're not wrong you're not wrong it was a hentai log i liked it it's already got it somewhere now oh dude without fasting [Laughter] all right boys we're gonna we're gonna do it just a little quick test if you defeat you defeat whatever is inside here you can take all the loot that awaits to defeat what's inside all of it inside this cave do not leave this cave until either once someone dies or it dies it's sorry i'm just saying i have to outlast guys i got my stick i'm going in how did i die how did i die there's a dead body in there we're just we're just chilling out here we see a stone fly out of the cave i literally i literally entered and then exited and then it like i explode as i'm just like walking out of the cave that's pretty okay it looks really funny is that the troll can actually leave the cave oh kenny oh it's the one with the yeah let's just try it we'll weaken it for him oh my god ah if you have plenty of armor i don't feel good about this at all just keep a safe distance social distance i hate to break it to you but the cave is three feet big i don't know if we're gonna be social distancing here damn in the butt all right um this blonde shield is very useful i exited whoops okay i'm going back get if you exited you're [ __ ] you'll explode no that was just you it is a very exciting time i understand how does that happen to me i don't know but you should have seen it from our and it was hilarious i think it hit him while he was loading out get him oh i'm gonna run wait what killed rob what are we doing here man what are you doing i'm cold you guys just leave me to [ __ ] dry wait there was nothing you died to a war i'm literally looting my body and then i just explode again i know you get two phones at once [Laughter] sorry we're finishing the troll for you we're exacting revenge the troll's almost dead by the way yeah yeah yeah we're doing well i just don't have any stamina are we going in like this all right oh if he's not here he left no he's here there we go okay oh we killed him he's dead oh he's being realized he was going to take a nap after we left nice here i'll let you take all this stuff here brace thank you good sir all right i am hovering over your body i won't let anything happen they will not get you this time all right so i'm not gonna lie i didn't think i didn't expect that to happen i didn't expect us to i didn't expect us to get one shot by him but apparently we are yeah yeah we got a lot of control in the log yeah that's when it's like he also was right at the door when we spawned it he has the lawn there's nowhere to run he was right in our faces when we walked in he's like hello we should have knocked i didn't see a door though all right we can go home successful successful we've that's what i said i feel like some of us may have uh different definitions of success than the others four yeah four yeah so how many bosses are in this game i think i missed the initial part we probably talked yeah and we've only killed two and they only get harder to the next jump in difficulty is huge so we're going to go from this to like enemies doing 110 damage and stuff just 180. all right watch the gray dwarfs all right good job rob let's just have him die down to the grey dwarves that are behind me miss fruit fight i'm not i marked it down if i can't come back yeah we can just drop off all of our stuff first that's true we are pretty full on we're slaughtering these four great boys i saw someone in one of the one of the later dungeons and the dungeons like they go from small narrow hallways to like really open areas with big boys that sounds awesome we'll come back once we drop off our stuff boys give me the [ __ ] out of here i want to go home we can go to sleep too that'll help so overall we all had a really good time yeah it sounds like it you know i hated everything about that thanks i hated it and it's weird that like it's always me like i just walk in i'm like i'm gonna walk out of there because that'll be funny then i just explode yeah that was even funnier i felt really badly because i was actually going to help you fight and then i watched you explode i was like never mind i just yeah i just see a stone then i just see bryce it's bedtime boys all right i'm murdering a baby while you all sleep i'm going to go warm up my breakfast totally not irl obviously in game rp oh i'm trying to there we go there we go it works just keep moving yeah yeah uber's just

gaming convention something happening yeah trophy convention you know oh okay yeah a lot of people getting in my car's all about it a lot of people dressed up in some really interesting outfits yeah you guys do that stuff or anything like that no not not really oh okay what about you like what what made you start uber uh you know just kind of a side thing you know my wife oh oh my goodness oh you bro we gotta clear the bushes oh right yep that's sorry just a flat rating this happen often or oh my god you saw him fly away yeah he just like exploded across the map yeah so i'm normally an accountant so i work from home and just to get kind of get out of the house that makes sense yeah i mean especially now like oh my god what the it's freaking out for us it's turning into the flying dutchman yeah with the pandemic you know i get it like you're stuck at home and stuff yeah i just kind of want to you know can you put a mask on by the way for me that'd be great oh yes sorry um so

out of five oh by the old father yeah um i actually um believe me or not i actually picked up odin one time wow yeah he's a conversationalist right he's actually a real nice guy believe it or not uh forearms [Music] really does he has is that so yeah now that i'm thinking about it i don't think it was odin i think it was just an acid trip those mushrooms in the forest man got to keep off of them no just crack oh okay well a man of culture i see yeah oh i want you to be safe first sir you know we started with three and now it's just you [Laughter] yeah you're really you're really fishing for that tip now i was i was always your favorite right of course just give me 10 bro what the hell you guys are doing great you know i was feeling i i hate to break it to you but your car is looking a little a little worn down right now ah don't mind that don't mind the insurance recovery insurance recovery what in the world is going on over here this is why you have that uber insurance has the bush become the new driver it's not in the right position watch out i have to destroy the bush that hit in the cart there we go the card is so screwed up looking right now you're gonna break this thing no i'm not let me look at this help oh my god how do we repair it we need a workstation just build the workstation all right stay right here um i gotta get gas real quick do you guys mind yeah yeah of course yeah here looks like uh we may have gotten into some fender benders uh the back's not looking quite like it did when we got in uh good thing i have a uh dash cam uh it caught everything and we got it all covered see wow what is your insurance uh hail damage ah hell traveler hail insurance vikings if you look out in the world you'll see a world versus rocky we must perform the ceremony [Music] rob you're destroying the card again the car is break dancing wait where do you see that what is our uber driver doing look at it if you look at the elder it says it well it just gives me some sacrificials if you look at yeah you get faster wood cutting uh e to activate the power if you look a little higher at the actual thing itself our cart has become possessed is it what's so can we have two abilities at once or do you have to pick and choose i'm going to assume you can only have one what the [ __ ] but i guess i'm gonna find out yeah there's only one you only get the one so you can swap between them i cannot see what it says okay so what does it say specifically it's just ready to receive faster wood cutting all right i'm gonna keep this one though because the stamina usage is pretty pog wait while we have this pop let's just start cutting down trees i gotta wait let me get four minutes activate it you do not already have it activated oh wait maybe not yeah that's just the elder in the bottom left yeah i have 15 minutes for some reason i have eicther somebody activated that i guess so much in the top right so i wonder if we could uh as long as we're together if we sort of group up and use the correct abilities we could probably have both yeah you could probably have every ability at once if everyone can move holy crap it's like i have a chainsaw for hands all right now we have to find this big boy it's odin yes father ow what's happening oh no you don't ah get away from me you deem it rather fast should we be scared of creatures of the deep is that is that something i should be worried about hell yes when we're in the middle of the ocean our boat dies and we drown with all of our gear [Music] you
