what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we got a pretty big review for you we're going to be checking out the brand new razer black widow v3 pro wireless razer's first wireless mechanical keyboard like this and this comes alongside of a few other wireless peripherals so i figured the hype would be real especially for their black widow lineup and a lot of you guys are keyboard lovers out there so in this review we'll go through it all pros cons what i like about it what i don't like about it because there's some pretty interesting and important stuff about this keyboard in case you're interested in picking it up or finding out if it's the next keyboard for you i've tested this for around two weeks now we have their green switches in this unit and i felt like right away i got a pretty good idea of how this is gonna fare in the end so first up just taking a look at it the v3 pro like i said full size mechanical keyboard and it has some popular features found on previous releases from razer but now in this wireless variant and it does utilize razer's very own hyper speed wireless technology which is also found on some of their other gaming mice so that's going to give the v3 pro that ultra low latency it's going to perform as good as wired keyboards and i'll show you that in a little bit just first talking some physical features and stuff like that when you first power it on on the left side of the keyboard you actually have two modes of connectivity the 2.4 gigahertz with the included dongle and a bluetooth option you can also choose use this wired if you want because on the back side the port there is usbc the included dongle is also housed on the back side behind this little cover so you plug that in it downloads synapse and you'll be good to go returning on the top right of the keyboard is that multi-functional digital dial i love this plus you have the dedicated media keys i think we first saw this debut back in the huntsman elite in 2018 so happy to see those features included now yet again and that dial can be reprogrammed to be whatever you want doesn't have to just be a volume dial although volume dials are always clutch in terms of build quality here we have a mix of plastic and the aluminum top frame visually i think it looks pretty clean with the matte finish it has to it but like we've seen before this is also pretty typical keeping it clean could be an issue just because it loves to attract fingerprints and smudges the wearer becomes pretty evident on the bottom you have their shine through razer logo that also changes and glows in unison with whatever effect you have and inside the box they include a nice leatherette wrist rest it's that same memory foam wrist rest they've had on previous keyboards over the last year i definitely think it's one of the more comfortable ones out there it does butt up against the front lip of the keyboard though where the logo is so you probably will be covering that up anyways next we can move into the goods which are the switches and keycaps this unit does have those textured double shot abs keycaps which do have this nice slight texture on it adds a bit of grip and stuff to that finish the font's also nice and clean yet again some people will be sad that these keycaps aren't pbt which is understandable because razer does make a ppt keycap set so kind of confusing but then underneath the keycaps is where we have something kind of new no it's not their optomechanical switches unfortunately but a redesigned top shell to their switches so as you may notice a top shell now is see-through this is supposedly supposed to increase you know rgb lighting to make it shine brighter and stuff but when the caps are on i really didn't think it made too much of a difference and plus with that diffuser there in the switch itself that's where the main rgb glow is going to come from so it does kind of leave me scratching my head a little one because again it's their regular switches not often mechanical ones and two uh when gaming they kind of felt a bit loose to me and when i say that i mean that while i was gaming i noticed my fingers were you know moving a bit more than normal on the keycaps and that's because the actual switches themselves aren't as sturdy as i hoped and i know as dumb as it sounds a lot of youtubers like to do this thing to kind of crap on razer which is a razer keyboard shake test uh i don't get it but in this case you can hear the shaking and the rattling that's because again of the switches and when i did check yeah like i said there's a fair bit of play vertically with the stem not so much side to side because the stem itself has those walls on the side and it's just odd because i would have thought these would have been more solid and snug against their new shell they manufactured honestly in the end it's not gonna be a big deal to 90 percent of consumers out there but i did want to mention it because i noticed it now like i said these traditional green switches aren't new it's the same 50 gram actuation force with a four millimeter travel distance and a 1.9 millimeter actuation force but they're also going to be releasing this keyboard with their silent yellow switch and those are supposed to have new silicone dampeners inside like we saw on the new linear optomechanical switches so again just really doesn't make sense to me while we have traditional switches in here and not their optim mechanical switches which are a lot faster they're more reliable they're more power efficient as well since there's no metallic contact transferring that signal to your pc i just really don't get it i figured their optomechanical switches would have been the new norm so i don't know regardless we'll do a sound test of their traditional green switches here so as you heard lots and lots and lots and lots of pinging with the stabilizers and they also weren't really consistent when you press them and just due to the construction here with the housing of the keyboard that pinging really resonated and they also don't factory lube their switches so you can combine that with the old green switches and uh personally just left a lot to be desired from me and real quick i'll show you some of the rgb effects in a darker setting so you can kind of get a feel for how the rgb looks and stuff like that you have that consistent shine through with the characters on the keycaps which is nice but it's definitely not the brightest rgb keyboard on the market which again is also why i'm not really understanding the new crystal shell when it doesn't really make much of a difference because we already have that diffuser built in it's just not adding much overall and i'm not going to go over synapse again i've been showing synopsis off for what four years now you know what it is you get the idea people would skip over it anyways but obviously another big important factor here is gonna be performance that's going to be you know one of the main attractions to this particular keyboard is the fact that it's wireless and with their wireless hyper speed technology and the fact they claim is 25 faster than the competition i know for me i could say while testing i 100 did not notice any sort of lag or latency while gaming after all it is 2020 we've been seeing wireless peripherals become more the norm over the last few years or so people have kind of you know started to make that shift without worrying about their performance taking a hit you know because that's really the main reason why someone wouldn't want to switch to wireless right if it kept cutting out or was noticeably delayed uh but now those issues are a thing of the past and for me it felt as normal or as you know what i'm used to with a wired keyboard in fact i did a bit of testing i compared the input lag with my wired k95 platinum keyboard as you can see mashed the keys on each keyboard for about a minute you're seeing the inputs there real time when i was done i compiled them all calculated it and it adds up because i averaged 32 milliseconds response time input with the k95 and 33 milliseconds with the black widow v3 pro what does that mean you're asking it means there's no noticeable difference at all wired versus wireless here well then how about battery life that's also going to be another important factor when it comes to a wireless keyboard and the v3 pro is gonna boast 192 hours of battery life that's eight straight days but that's with rgb turned off so obviously rgb lighting turned on it's gonna you know take a pretty big hit to the battery life overall when enabled and it drains the keyboard in as little as five hours if you have it on 100 brightness on the static white effect but good news is when i was charging it up with their included usbc cable it goes pretty quickly seeing a 20 charge in just 10 minutes and i was mentally pretty surprised by that and speaking of being surprised i was also caught off guard at how easily this lost connection which is a bit of a bummer and when i say that uh when i'm filming you know i film right here at my desk and as you can see my pc right behind me it's probably 12 feet and it loses connection right here so i couldn't have my dongle plugged into the pc and just change the effects over there film here i actually had to plug in my dongle to a laptop download synapse and do it all right here because it just kept cutting out 12 feet behind me don't know if that's just my unit or if that is some sort of connection issue but again for a lot of people who are just using this at their desktop setup it won't be a big deal but for somebody who is maybe using this for a home theater pc or an entertainment setup in their living room and their pc is farther than 10 12 feet away or it's going to be cutting out that's a big issue uh i just found that really weird because 12 feet with no interference feel like it should have connected again could be just my unit but this review is a review of my experience so bringing this all together here okay quick pros and cons of a little recap here altogether full-size wireless keyboard with no latency or lag when it's you know not cutting out great dedicated media keys that multifunctional dial and really great battery again for a wireless mechanical keyboard but the cons okay this is 230 dollars which is a premium price tag for what they're gonna be you know labeling a premium you know flagship keyboard but it still doesn't feature their premium flagship switches with optomechanical and that i think is just a killing factor to this having traditional switches here isn't right we should have optomechanical switches in a keyboard in 2020 at a price tag this big and as you heard those stabilizers are booty so in the end for 230 dollars i i can't say i recommend it this left me scratching my head more often than not too many things i would personally change and that is just a way too hefty of a price tag for a keyboard like this right now in 2020 with these features or lack thereof necessarily with the switches and stuff like that it's just it's too pricey honestly so that'll wrap it up for my review if you want to check it out regardless i'll put a link for you in the description down below if you like this review give it a big
