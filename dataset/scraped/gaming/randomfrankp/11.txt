what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be reviewing razer's worst kept secret we've got the brand new razer viper v2 pro a lighter and updated version of the razer viper ultimate so today we'll go through it all for you guys the new updates and what changes they actually made here for this new v2 in case you're interested in upgrading from your current viper or if you're just in the market you know for a new gaming mouse and spoiler i have some uh polarizing thoughts about this today so sit tight you're gonna want to pay attention now when i first unboxed it and really my first impressions were thankfully it's more the same here but there are some glaring changes that aren't apparent right away so you'll see taking a look at it very familiar shape and dimension the overall size haven't changed at all so it's the same in that regard however you'll start to notice we have addition by subtraction let's just say there are a few things missing here from the original viper ultimate that had to be left out in order to cut down the weight to its new 58 gram weigh-in and right about now you're probably starting to notice a few of those visual changes don't worry we'll cover it all for you so as i said weighing in at 58 grams now they also have a white version which is 59 grams i personally never understood how a color can make a weight change but still then comparing that to the original viper ultimate which tips the scale at 74 grams which in 2019 when it launched was the lightest wireless mouse on the market now i've actually had the white version of the mouse a few weeks longer than the black version i sent this out first so i've had it for a bit longer and as you'll see inside their pr box there is a tennis ball next to the mouse and at first i was very confused you know like anybody would why are they giving me a mouse and a box with a ball but then it made sense it clicked a tennis ball is the same weight 58 grams as the new v2 pro so if you want to get an idea of how light the new mouse is go to your garage find a tennis ball that'll give you a good idea but where did they cut those 16 grams from well first there's no more rgb the illuminated logo on the original viper ultimate is now just a glossy print on the all matte body which helps save 2.7 grams next we no longer have the two right side buttons making this not so friendly to left-handed users and kind of takes away that true ambidextrous title that saved 2.9 grams and we no longer have built-in rubberized side grips which shed 3.2 grams the side grips were 50 50 amongst the community you either loved them or hated them personally i liked it but now for those who still want it they're an optional accessory inside the box included obviously is your charging cable which is usbc which means yes the v2 is now usbc instead of micro usb and they have the that same like sort of dongle extender with the hyper speed usb receiver then also inside the box along with a bunch of their documentation and the sticker is the set of rubberized grips with both the left and right side grips as well as an optional set for your left and right clicks as well another quick note about those side buttons they are now slightly more pronounced now instead of how flush they were on the viper ultimate you can see they stick out just a bit more making it easier to actuate but all those reductions still leave around 7 grams unaccounted for internally there are structural modifications they made to the shell to cut down on the weight but to still keep it you know from becoming flimsy we do also have an upgraded battery from 70 hours to 80 hours now however i have a feeling most of the internal weight difference comes from the lack of wireless charging flipping it over you'll see we no longer have the magnetic charging pin cutouts which also means there is no charging dock now i will say even though the charging dock was hit or miss over time you know getting it to connect spot on was definitely finicky it was still just nice to put on the dock overnight and come back the next morning to a fully charged mouse and the wireless charging was one of the things that made the viper ultimate ultimate if that makes sense and underneath you'll see there's a few more changes as well on the v2 pro there's just one button now for both the power and the dpi toggling whereas on the viper ultimate we had the power switch and then above that was the dpi toggle button so we had two versus one as a result now underneath the scroll wheel on the v2 is the led indicator this lets you know when it's powered on shows the battery status and what dpi setting you're at and also as you probably noticed we now have a different feed shape underneath the same material on the viper ultimate you can see they're more squared off where now on the v2 pro they're rounded which will give it a better glide and then lastly before we move on the v2 features their new focus pro 30k optical sensor giving this a bonkers rating of 30 000 dpi just super super unnecessary and i told you guys and i saw that nearly 80 percent of you you'll gain between 200 and 1200 dpi with the main chunk being 60 in the 800 to 1200 range so is 30 000 necessary i don't think so they said it has you know better tracking with ai which is every company's favorite buzzword now but perhaps the more appreciated change with the new v2 pro comes with their gen 3 optical switches these have a 90 million click life cycle and have improved tactility they said although i will admit it's not a world's difference to me now i'll also admit i spent way too long doing an a b test with an electric toothbrush to see if the switches were improved for actual input speed and this little toothbrush concoction pretty much showed me that they're you know they're not faster or anything i average 9.8 clicks per second both on the v2 pro and their vipre ultimate and just as comparison i usually get around 6.9 clicks per second manually but still possible of super quick clicks if you want to hear them i'll do a sound test for you and then as i said before it's the same dimension so they didn't make it any smaller to appease the viper mini crowd although i'm still hoping that comes later on down the line but at the same time since i've used this regularly for the past two plus years i'm happy the shape isn't tweaked at all since i'm just so used to this at this point i'd say since it's october 2019 release i've made the viper ultimate probably 90 percent of the time since so the big question how has gaming been how's the overall performance is there a night and day difference and my first reaction was no not really it wasn't until i went from using the v2 for about a week straight back to the original viper when the v2 was charging that's when i noticed the weight difference at the end of the day you know 16 grams is a lot to cut down on a mouse but like i said it wasn't until i went and then used something heavier the weight difference really started to stick out tracking in game though felt really great with the lighter design and those smoother feet i think personally that's the major change i noticed better for tracking in game i booted up halo infinite for the first time since it launched played probably three or four matches with this and i was at the top of the leaderboard each time i'm not saying you know the mouse is responsible for your in-game performance but the combo now of the rounded feet and the lighter body did feel better during use and i feel like made me play better so that's where i think the main upgrade lies here if you're an fps gamer at least but zero performance issues no hiccups no lagging nothing like that all good in terms of the physical performance of the mouse so that all sounds great frank where are those polarizing thoughts you hinted at in the beginning and let me say this the new v2 pro does not feel pro to me if anything i feel like this was supposed to be the razer viper v2 x and for those who don't know uh the x annotates their more budget-friendly offering from a current product out there so we had you know the razer naga x the basilisk x the siren x the kraken x x is the budget version of a product they already made and that's what this feels like because we have less features we went from eight buttons to six buttons rgb to no rgb and admittedly you know i don't care about rgb i think it's pointless as a mouse as it is but still one less feature and there's no longer a charging dock with wireless charging so what's the pro here where is that pro coming from the improved 10 000 dpi sensor again 30k isn't necessary is the weight supposed to make this pro those 16 grams is that what's pro now i say all that to say this this is a hundred and fifty dollars which is the same exact price the viper ultimate launched for with the dock so we have the same price for admittedly less pro features this should have been 79.99 which by the way is exactly what the viper ultimate with the dock is going for right now nearly half the price so 150 is completely unfair and out of touch for what this is it begs the question is 16 grams worth 70 dollars you're gonna have to answer that to me no and i feel like now razer is alienating a whole group of people not only lefties since they ditched the right side buttons they're alienating that you know ambidextrous crowd who would need this they're also alienating people who would want to upgrade from the viper ultimate to the v2 pro because are they going to want to spend that 70 bucks for 16 less grams probably not and they're also alienating a group of people who may want to get into the whole viper lineup because they're going to see 79.99 for the viper ultimates with the charging dock and they're also going to then see 150 bucks for the v2 pro a mouse with physically less features this should not be 150 it should 100 be 100 on the maximum range but it should be 79.99 to appeal to such a wider range of people that probably in the end would make this sell better than it's going to which probably means this is going to be on sale pretty soon because they're gonna see that the demand for this while it's there is probably not as hyped up right now as they think at this price again it's a great mouse for what it is i had no issues with it the cut down weight and shelf feels great for gaming but not a hundred and fifty dollars to me 16 grams is not worth a 70 upgrade i'll even boldly say this to you guys if you're watching other reviewers today and they are not making it so obvious to you that this pro mouse is not pro at all for the price if they're giving this a glowing recommendation for 150 you now know who's full of bs and who to unsubscribe to that's all i'm saying but regardless that'll wrap it up for my review of the new razer viper v2 pro hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out still have
