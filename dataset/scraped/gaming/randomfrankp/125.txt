what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be showing off my gaming setup in youtube studio tour for 2021 [Music] so sorry for keeping you guys waiting i know typically i have this video at the first week of january but shipping delays have been crazy since the holidays and yes we actually have some notable upgrades to show off in the youtube studio so we're gonna go through all of it show you what's new what's changed show you what's behind the scenes what's behind the camera literally and go through pretty much everything in the studio so you can see what i'm working with behind the scenes and i will have everything you see in this video listed for you in the description down below so you can check out all the gear and hardware whatever we show off in the studio will be down in the description so let's start it off now all right so starting off this is pretty much what i see every time i'm filming this is the main overhead desk that you guys pretty much see with like product reviews and stuff but i sit right in front of here with my camera pointing right at me as you can see and i have myself referenced and monitoring in this lily put 11 inch monitor so what we're gonna do is you know keep it short for the camera gear and this sort of stuff and then just to do like a mini tour real quick we'll go talk about the secondary setup behind the scenes uh talk about some of the keyboard stuff that you guys have not been looking forward to then we have the main desk setup over here and then the entertainment center and stuff on the other side of the office which has a brand new 82-inch 8k tv so yeah we'll just kind of bring it back and start right here so like i said this is where you pretty much see everything when i'm filming as it is and uh interested in the actual hardware i've talked about it before this hasn't changed in the last few years but my camera is the blackmagic ursa mini pro 4.6 k this isn't the gen 2 version it's the original but that's what i used to film pretty much everything and like i said i have it into this reference monitor here so i could see what i'm filming um and like i said with all the gear and hardware lists down below also put things like the actual uh lens i'm using the tripod and head and all that stuff so i'll put that down below if you can find out more about it if you want um overhead is the blackmagic pocket cinema camera 6k this is also what i use to get some you know secondary shots for overhead stuff it's pretty much my b cam and i have it hooked up to an axun sinai it's a wireless hdmi transmitter and it's all powered off right now because i'm not using it but it lets me you know transmit the video signal wirelessly to my phone or a an ipad to monitor it so i don't have to have you know more cables running down to see what i'm actually filming so that comes in clutch with that camera so like i said pretty much like a b cam for me and since it's all black magic it's in the same color science and stuff it all pairs perfectly and i have that mounted on a mini max which is a giant overhead boom arm and uh it's super super heavy duty it actually supports my ursa mini pro stuff if i want to mount it up there as well and then also for my microphone it's the sennheiser mkh416 this is what you hear uh 99 of the time on my channel pretty much for like voice overs and stuff uh but yes that's pretty much you know the main stuff going on here i can put some of the lighting gear uh down below if you want to you know learn more about that and just so right now for my audio i have the evo 4 so that's you know into a wireless transmitter so i can get better audio when i'm filming this and walking around and stuff so it's not usually set up like that but just for this video that's what we're gonna have to do to get better audio so again most of that stuff down below but yes the ursa mini pro the main workhorse that i use now this little setup as you guys saw in previous videos looks like in the last vlog and stuff this was usually just this you know fake brick wall that i had for like a secondary sort of scene you know background texture but i used my old ikea carlby desktop and made like a secondary set over here getting things organized different overhead shots again just more variety and stuff from when i'm filming so this is one of the newest additions having everything set up over here and just you know better things for organizing pretty much stuff like uh prop drawers over here so if i want to change up you know what i'm showing overhead i could have them all organized nicely in these sort of pull out drawers and uh pick a prop as i please some paper rolls again for background shots background textures and stuff or when i'm getting overhead stuff just again all variety and then over here to i mean this this used to be called the minimal setup but now since i have the samsung 49-inch g9 odyssey i guess i can't really call it you know the clean setup anymore because it's just massively overkill so i reviewed this during the summer when i got it and it is just an insane gaming monitor i don't really have a pc over here right now i have it docked up to one of the asus rg scar laptops and uh it's it works out for what it is again some background shots and stuff i want to get different variety um it still works fine for gameplay obviously but an absolutely just insane monitor my main peripherals of choice over here we have the hyperx alloy origins core with their aqua switches absolutely fantastic keyboard one of my favorites of all time hyperx is killing it with this and i have some midnight green key caps on here from tai hao uh this is a cooler master at least the m11 but again all matching aesthetically and stuff um headphones the sennheiser hd 800 s one of the holy grails to me uh love these guys and then the transparent one on course speakers from vanity again i did an entire video pretty much on this dedicated studio or setup i want to say around the end of 2019 so a lot has changed but at the same time most of it's pretty familiar and uh yes the random frank p toppo mousepad we're working on getting more for you guys so uh don't you worry over here this is a bit of a change up from recent years you should just have like camera gear and stuff but i've been working on sort of like a retro sort of shelving spot some little ps1 n64 uh some old games complete in box and stuff down here i just have a little keyboard display kind of like a transformation and evolution of an old like apple keyboard from the 80s some of the current stuff now i'll build it up more as we go along but yeah it's a little shelving unit over here and all the stuff that i had before all the camera gear and stuff i now just moved over here on this shelving unit just so it's more you know organized and easier if when i'm filming right next to it i can pretty much come over here grab a lens um that kind of stuff moving our way over to this which is probably um you know confusing to most people but yes these are all different mouse pads and yes i have them on display and mounted here got to give a shout out to dixie mech formerly known as they are now omnitype they showed this idea because they obviously have tons of different mouse pads that they sell and i get a lot in different textures different surfaces so when it comes to getting all these different mouse pads in and you know reviewing them i need a place to store them and i don't want to get damaged or rolled up or anything so i have them on display here this is like a a wardrobe rack pretty much and then over to my keyboard section this is where i pretty much store and house all my keyboard stuff to you know keep for future builds so i have my key switch wall right here in this uh i don't know what you want to call i think it's the ivar from ikea i could be butchering that you know how they are so key caps for future builds uh actual keyboards something to build accessories different stuff in here different key caps it's a nice place to keep it all organized you know and it looks nice this piece whatever like again i believe it's called the ivar but with most things ikea not the best quality and then up top here i'm going to be doing a video on this very soon this is called the prep deck and this is another great accessory for building keyboards because it's made for the kitchen for like when you're cooking and stuff but i have tons of things like different springs stabilizers switches i need the lube actual loop all my key board building accessories it's a fantastic piece that's not made for keyboard building but when it comes to you know lubing different switches and having all my stuff organized different foams it's literally the perfect piece for that so again the prep deck and that would be you know completing the sort of keyboard building section off to the side here and i guess now we can go in and talk about my main gaming setup that i've been rocking consistently since whenever i moved in here about 2018 same sort of monitor setup but i did get different monitors this year so all three of these are different completely upgraded pc and specs and then next to the setup again this also changed but now i have a keyboard sort of display shelf to put some of my custom keyboard builds on display so i think it's definitely a nice piece just to have right off to the side of the setup you know so checking it out like i said i've had this monitor orientation for a while and just to sort of like clear the air now i say it every year people don't understand i don't sit directly in front of all three at once and stare at a bezel the right monitor is my primary monitor that i sit right in front of this is my main monitor everything else is for monitoring different you like vector scopes and stuff for color correcting uh bins and stuff overhead for whatever spotify twitter i don't use usually all three at once and again just for gaming i use my primary right monitor uh so yeah just to kind of clear that so i know i'm gonna see it no the bezel is not what i stare in front of 24 7. and the bottom two monitors are the upgraded 34 inch ultra gear monitors from lg it's the i want to say the 850 model so natively it supports g-sync instead of in the past it was just free sync so those are the bottom two you may have seen in my one vlog that the monitor caught fire and the other one died so it was time to upgrade and say the least so those are what i have for the bottom two this top one is no longer the 34 inch samsung it's now a 34 inch aoc also 144 hertz and my plan with this was to have a 38 inch from dell the alienware model but uh that arrived completely broken and shattered so unfortunately uh you not the weight for that upgrade but yeah still 32 or 34 inches for that completing the trifecta there and into some of the peripherals and some of the gear and stuff these speakers that i have mounted on each side are not actually for when i'm sitting down i know they're not you know when i'm sitting down you want them right at your ears they are more up so when i'm filming around the studio and stuff i can you know have music blasting to me and just fill the studio with music so i don't use them for actual uh you know reference and stuff and gaming when i'm sitting here that's mainly for my headphones and stuff these are the kanto yu either four or five it's been a while but either the kanto yu4 or five again mounted as well a nice clean you know seamless mounts and appearance here but yes for the main peripherals this also changed significantly over the last year my main keyboard now is the steelseries apex pro tkl so it has their really quick omni type switches also have a set of just midnight green modifier keycaps on there and a nice novelty key to fit it into the midnight green kind of theme i have going on with the setup overall so i have that as my main keyboard absolutely love this i wanted to cut down from the old full-size corsair keyboards i had because i just never really used the num the numpad and stuff and this has macros built in it's got full you know volume control a bunch of different things right here with this smart dial for controlling everything on the fly the macros the switch speed lighting everything is controlled with this dial and you have the actual lcd screen here which is pretty cool uh so yes that is my main keyboard the wrist rest is from artisan labs you can maybe this really nice acrylic one that is you know kind of matching to the whole theme and then for my mouse we have the razer viper ultimate this did not change over the last year so it didn't upgrade this but i cannot get away from it i love the ambi shape lightweight form factor definitely a killer mouse um let's see what comes you know wireless so no interference optical switches and my mouse pad is the mad cat's glide 38 which is definitely my go-to such a unique rubberized texture very very fast with the pure grade feet here on the on the viper ultimate and it's just a really unique texture for a mouse pad and as you just you know saw i show off a bunch of different ones and check out different textures and i just keep coming back to the glide 38 so yes that is my main peripheral sort of set up here into some other things this is the loop deck live and it's pretty much like an elgato stream deck alternative it's for whatever you're doing photo editing video editing music production live streaming this is a really really killer versatile tool it's all touch screen has buttons and dials but i mainly use it you know for uh video editing and color correcting and stuff which is a great tool to have to learn on the fly as well you'll see more about it soon i have a video with this coming up and it definitely is a bit of a you know an adjustment you know a learning curve to kind of relearn editing with using this tool but loopback live i think it's a it's definitely worth it in the end and that's what i have you know to use in conjunction with the keyboard next to that is my amp and dac for powering my headphones this is the grace design m9xx nice you know convenient volume dial up top and my headphones of choice which has been pretty consistent the sennheiser and massdrop hd58x jubilee they're open back so they're great for gaming i love openback headphones i'm also great for studio monitoring these are what i've these i've been using these probably for two years now i just keep them on this boom arm i forgot the actual model but it's from samson and i'll have it down below that's also holding my microphone that i'll use for some like live streams and voice overs and stuff that i'll do for certain videos the shure mv7 got like a touch screen up top for volume adjustment and on this arm i could just you know swing it over in front of me um adjust the arm it's all telescopic and stuff so definitely versatile and i believe that covers most of the actual you know gear and hardware here my chair is from herman miller it's the m-body i've had this since 2016. absolutely great in terms of ergonomics when i'm sitting down a lot you know editing 24 7. a very very comfortable chair and the actual desktop also changed over the last year like i showed you on the other side of the setup i have the old ikea carlby desktop this is actually a live edge desktop that i got from home depot over the summer i did a vlog about it then it's the same size pretty much but it just has a much more natural finish to it that's all wood versus the sort of composite material on the old ikea desk so this actually natural and you know real but i also do underneath have a support arms you can see in the back keeping it up just in case it does ever sag over time but yeah it's a lot heavier a lot sturdier and it looks a lot nicer with the live wood edge i think so yes those are the main upgrades for the desk setup and peripherals then we can move over and talk about the new hardware that i have inside my pc which i just upgraded i believe back in december so it's the same case the fantax evolve x but inside all new hardware with the intel i9 10 900k cpu then one of the new nzxt kraken z aios and on the front of the cooler is actually display so i can monitor temps show things like gifs and stuff i want up there so it's cool to have that built into the actual aio itself got a vision motherboard from gigabyte so nice and white fits that sort of aesthetic i have going on inside 64 gigs of corser of engines rgb pro ram and the gigabyte vision rtx 3080 so again with their vision lineup it matches the motherboard perfectly all white and i think it just looks really nice as a whole and it's a completed build also had like an rgb uh 24-pin motherboard connector there just to give it some extra glow inside some phanteks digital fan frames so those are not actual rgb fans you see they are fan frames so they go on top of the fan and you can sync them all with the actual motherboard and the case itself since it is all fantastic the button right here in the front if i want to you know customize the lighting switch it all up all that syncs and uh it looks pretty cool just to have that you know universal syncing and stuff going on with the case itself and then everything inside automatically changes but a powerful build a nice and clean looking build a nice little shout out to gengar there on the inside but uh yeah that's the the main upgrade over here and like i showed you just you know before we started to talk about the main setup the little shelving unit i added recently with all of the recent builds that i've done for custom keyboards i got the the field the d65 the the grid 600 the nk 65 and then our custom novel keys and random frank p nk 65 with some of the topo and midnight green slash teal accents and stuff but yes the nice little section over here to have that all on display and then we can start to wrap it up and talk about the entertainment center over here in this whole entertainment setup pretty much that has definitely had a pretty nice upgrade since last year with the new samsung 82-inch 8k tv and i know gaming at this size and resolution sounds absolutely ridiculous and uh yes it is but i can promise you it is also as insane as it sounds and everything uh upscales surprisingly well to a tv like this i know there's not a lot of ak content you know that can support it and run natively on the tv uh but man things like on the series x gaming on there some upscaling and stuff that's done in the nvidia shield tv that i have it all looks really really good and then also off to the side here i have a gaming pc which is the main gear f131 a super nice custom hard line cooling pc that is just beautiful inside also has a 10 900k cpu 2080 ti and this if i want to you know get some gaming done on here some casual stuff obviously nothing you know too competitive over here could do that on the tv the wireless peripherals and stuff some other things to show off is this is a brand new entertainment center finally i used to have a very very small thin uh flimsy one this a lot more nice a lot more modern and stuff this is one of the things i was waiting on for a while to get in that arrived just a few weeks ago and here i have the little cubby the xbox series x over here is that nvidia shield tv and this is the main pretty much power box for the tv itself so nothing gets plugged into the actual tv it's all runs down just as one little cable and then you know power audio devices hdmi all plugs into the main you know box there to keep it all organized and clean but yeah definitely a fan of the entertainment center here i got this from wayfair so it fits in nicely also have this mounted as you can see behind it it's just nice and organized man super thin for a tv like this so what i pretty much do over here like i said if i'm not you know pc gaming or whatever obviously with the xbox series x it does a pretty good job at upscaling so i want to play some games on there looks really really nice even going back and playing like 360 games in the series x upscale surprisingly well to a tv at this size and resolution now the shield tv i think is just highly highly underrated it is very powerful for the size and what i use this for is pretty much just like a bunch of emulators essentially like i have a ton of emulators and roms on here i'm using arc browser it's a really nice and clean ui where all your games and consoles are laid out nicely and have it all just loaded on and i can go through and play pretty much whatever rom or emulator you know i want or that you can think of you know minus the more you know recent and current builds and stuff anything pretty much past ps1 it's not going to do it too good of a job at but it's all laid out real nicely if i want to go in and play you know n64 ps1 some more game boy games even some ds stuff like it handles tons of games really really well and even in the video shield itself it has its own smart ai upscaling that it does which again for running some of these really old games that would probably look really crappy on an 8k tv it does a really really good job at upscaling and sharpening it and making it look better and more modern for this tv which really blew me away so this has been really fun to just kick back and play some old games on here um it's also bluetooth built-in so i can use like a ps5 control or an xbox controller and just play it all on the shield tv so even though the entertainment center itself is pretty bare bones i did want to get like a sound bar and stuff eventually uh but yeah i'll eventually build that up with more stuff got the drawers for some controllers kicked back here got some more controllers and stuff uh but yes gaming at this size uh definitely insane and over here in this corner of my uh air guitar collection uh mounted on this spot over here the 1 million subscriber plaque from youtube and then just this spot over here is pretty much stuff that i have in the queue of stuff that i have to get to very soon for videos so you'll be seeing a lot of this stuff in videos very very soon and i think that about uh wraps it up and brings me right back to where we started all right so guys that'll wrap it up for my 2021 gaming setup and studio tour hope you all enjoyed like i said if so anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check out all the gear and hardware i showed and if i did miss something if you saw something you like or something i didn't really talk about but you want to know more about it drop a comment down below and i'll do my best to update the description as we go along to hopefully cover all bases here but yeah i i understand that this youtube studio is very overkill and over the top for a one-man crew like me but when it comes to you know doing youtube as a full-time job and having different spaces and different sets throughout the studio it really helps my workflow because as a one-man crew literally when it comes to spacing getting certain shots and framing certain things it helps to have different areas to film and to change up every now and then so there's more you know versatility and just more variety in my videos instead of just one static thing one shot that you see one desk 24 7 over a year so again having all the different spaces even though they're not even used 24 7 it just helps my workflow in the end so guys i hope you enjoyed hope you dig the look behind the scenes at my gaming setup and studio tour if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp at last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button i hope you all enjoyed have a good day
