what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be reviewing a mouse that i have admittedly slept on ever since it released back in january or february i want to say and that's the pwnage ultra custom wireless gaming mouse if you're interested in this and you want to know more about it before you decide to pick it up i got you covered today we'll go over it all so first things first i mean is right in its name ultra custom and one of the selling points to a mouse like this is the fact that it is very customizable and easy to swap shells with no tools or other hardware needed to change up the look with the design of your mouse they come in either black or white model variants i have both here to show you guys today for variety and as you can see from its ergonomic design and honeycomb cutouts the mouse itself is going to heavily favor those wanting a wireless airglow design or for those who are fans of the zowie ec series because it's damn near identical this shape and size and for most that's a good thing that's the king of ergo shape now included inside the box of each mouse is going to be a set of opposite colored shells and a button cover a color matching solid top shell additional dpi buttons usb receiver usb extender and a color matching usb-c paracord and this is just to get you going since the stock design has the honeycomb shell to it you now have the option to switch it up go with solid top shell or go panda design and mix and match to a black and white shell just customize it to your liking however it doesn't end there because on their website they also have nine other shell options to pick from across the whole spectrum to really customize your mouse and match it to a certain theme you like or your desk setup and i think for one that's really cool because no other company out there is doing this for their own mice swapping out shells is a breeze just takes a second the top shell just pops off from the bottom then the top button cover shell pops up there as well and the whole body uses these light magnets and plastic clips to keep the shells together and i'll tell you right now this is one of my initial concerns about this mouse in the beginning was thinking since you can swap these shells out so easily that it would be flimsy or cheap feeling but it's not just because the shelves are easy to remove doesn't really compromise the feel or the build overall to the mouse but we'll touch on that more in a minute checking it out we have six buttons in total with some subtle rgb illumination in the scroll wheel and underneath the mouse that shines slightly toward the bottom if you're using that honeycomb shell to see it and like i said that ec shape definitely becomes pretty obvious when you hold it on the front embedded is a usb c port for charging or using this wired and visually it's free of any branding on the outside minus the subtle pwnage rgb logo kind of peeking through from the inside for measurements it's 120 millimeters long 66 millimeters wide at the grip hip and stands 42 millimeters tall at its highest point but the weight is going to be a huge selling point here as it comes in at just 69 grams with the stock honeycomb shells and then from there whether you want to go solid top shell it'll bump it up to 73 grams or 74 grams on my scale or you can remove the bottom shell altogether and get it down to 65 grams if you like the fingertip grip the omron switches inside are rated for 20 million clicks and they're super tactile and satisfying we'll do a sound test but just first to point out this is using the stock dpi button even though they include an additional set of a taller dpi button this one's stock out of the box i'm also using these stock button spacers which um also inside the box come different sized height ones as well so they go pretty much underneath the top shell to help actuate and press the omron switches this is the stock size one out of the box so we'll do the sound test as you heard switch was nice and tactile nice smooth scroll wheel uh but there was that slight bit of creaking on the left side when i was pressing in and squeezing with both thumbs to the point where it actually actuate my backward button here uh but that's again using two hands both thumbs squeezing in just using one hand and even squeezing with a normal grip there is zero creaking or any weak points in the shell and again no one in absolutely any use case would be squeezing it like i did there but i just wanted to mention it because like i said in the beginning that was one of my initial concerns being build quality with swapping the shells but i think all things considered here they're doing a killer job also for the switches i had practically no post travel on my units with the exception of the back side button that one did have a bit more give when actuated flipping the mouse over on the bottom we have super nice 100 ptfe feet even though there's smaller pads in the corners and around the sensor they just feel extra smooth and i don't know what it is but as for that sensor here it's a bmw 3335 216 000 dpi optical sensor optimized for low power consumption because speaking of which right next to the sensor we have the power switch in the middle is off sliding it up is what i call office mode which has no rgb and the battery takes a bump to 65 hours turning it on the bottom setting is gaming mode with rgb lighting and tested around 40 hours now along with that in gaming mode with rgb enabled one really annoying thing this mouse does is cut off the rgb lighting whenever you use or just move the mouse this is done to you know save some extra battery life but it's visually annoying and honestly it's more distracting if anything because what's even the point then of having rgb in the mouse to begin with if it's just gonna cut off during use now it's not like a design flaw or a bug with the mouse itself but it's still just annoying let's talk about the goods now because all in all there's a lot of it so during gameplay i was smiling ear to ear because first of all that natural ergo shape just feels so good in my hand and i was immediately hitting shots and even had someone accuse me of hacking in battlefield v even though it wouldn't be a battlefield game without someone filling their diaper in game chat but also because for a mouse with this shape at this weight there's just really nothing else like this currently out there on the market and using it has been awesome also even though it's just a 5 gram difference from my current main which is the viper ultimate that's 74 grams cutting down now to 69 grams does give it that slight extra bit of added agility you know when you're quickly flicking or you know doing a quick swipe on a dime i also haven't had any issues with lager interference and from what i've seen online the 3335 sensor is already pretty optimized for wireless mice like i mentioned before so just right from the start of me using this across both my black and white units it's been great 95 of my gaming during testing was used without the included usb-c cable they call it a paracord but it's definitely not as light and as flexible as most paracords out there so it's fine for charging and use if needed but it's also nice plus that it's color matching to the mouse and another plus one for it actually being usb-c and really i have to give it to him here because for everything going on for all the customizing the shell options hardware performance this mouse only comes in at 89 for the black variant and 99 for the white version which i think is still a steel for a mouse like this in the current mouse market and an extra set of shells if you want to pick up some other colors it's just an additional 12 so it'll bring it to you know 100 bucks 112 bucks which even still is a fair price because there are still no other lightweight ergo wireless mice like this anywhere lastly i'll leave you with software which is always the more underwhelming part of a review and of the overall mass experience honestly because the software is very vanilla you can switch up what all your buttons do you have your standard settings and stuff uh for your dpi there are six different ones on board you can choose from from 200 to 1600 dpi like i said each one is color coordinated to the color of the scroll wheel dpi has changed also in increments of 100. you can do things like record macros and assign them to the buttons and for rgb lighting there's only three lighting effects from solid a breathing effect or respiration as they call it and their rgb you know wave equivalent is called streaming for me honestly set your dpi once and just forget the software exists so all in all for 90 to 100 not including the extra shelves if you want to get colored options i am just very very impressed i know in the beginning i know i think it launched as an indiegogo there were some initial concerns for the first few batches of quality control and stuff but for me like i said unless i'm actually forcefully with two hands forcing in on this left side there's no build issues no creaking or any points of concern on this mouse and again for being able to customize it so easily that was one of my main concerns and i'm really happy to report that this is durable it holds up it's lightweight it's my favorite ergo design and i'm just really really impressed what they're doing here and i wish i would have checked it out earlier because i probably would have been using this more frequently over the past seven eight months so yeah guys that'll wrap it up for my review of the ponies ultra custom hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down
