what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be checking out my brand new tv that i think hands down is the best option for gaming behind me is the lg c1 77 inch oled 4k tv and man pc gaming next gen console gaming this thing handles it all with ease so you want to check it out we'll go for you guys today i'm going to tell you pretty much you know my time with it my experience with it in terms of gaming so it's not going to be a full in-depth review of every single aspect of the tv think of this as a review for gamers so first up just checking it out yes at 77 inches this thing is massive the c1 definitely is going to take up a pretty good portion on your wall if you choose to wall mount it like i did but that will of course give it that nice beautiful seamless look when you do have it mounted and from the side this thing is super super thin like where the screen is it's literally thinner than my iphone and that is just crazy to think about um yes you know most of the computing and the the power is really going on the bottom portion of the display where it does come out a bit that's where all your connections are and stuff but just the screen itself super super thin now taking a look on the back side like i said the lower portion is where all your inputs are going to be you have things for you like hooking up cables some audio ports but what's more important is the fact that you have four hdmi ports they are hdmi 2.1 each fully capable of 4k 120 hertz you also have three usb ports so since i got it in with my time gaming with it like i said as a review for gamers we're going to talk about how i was pretty much dealing with it with the new ps5 the series x and a gaming pc so with this i have all three of them set up right underneath the tv with my entertainment console and i've say probably around three weeks i went and tested i guess i could say you know one each for each system just kind of go through and that was kind of like my testing period for this so again the next gen consoles and a current gen pc if you will doesn't really make much sense with all the you know current graphics cards coming out constantly but in here i have a 2080 ti and an i9 10 100k cpu uh so again in terms of a 4k tv the systems here in the pc they'll all go hand in hand so first up this is an oled tv like i said but the pixels are self lighting what that means is each pixel turns on and off depending on what's going on in your display so it doesn't darken the pixels individually turn on and off and i'll show you a side-by-side picture here on the left side i literally turned the tv off and the right side is showing you you know a test i pulled up on youtube just to you know run through the colors you can get an idea and since they're self-lit that means there's going to be no halo you get that literal like infinite contrast here and you could just say side by side the black portions of the display match identically to when the tv is turned off this just it's hard to fully portray through the camera and stuff obviously but in person it's just crazy to see the infinite blacks that this can represent and you cannot get this on any other sort of tv like lcds or led tvs can't do this oled's been around for a while yes but seeing this here with the self-lit pixels definitely a pretty cool experience and while that's great and all for you know watching movies and pulling up youtube videos when it comes to gaming that's just gonna give your image even more of this true-to-life representation if you will especially in combination with hdr which this tv supports so the image you're going to be getting is just going to look beautiful now one of the main important features this tv is going to boast is 4k 120 hertz one millisecond response time depending on obviously what you're using to game with right and depending on also the hdmi source there's different picture profiles and settings depending on what you have this hooked up to so for example you have you know your your usual picture profile options but over hdmi if hdr is supported it'll automatically detect that and give you select hdr picture modes like your vivid standard cinema home regular cinema which just makes the picture warmer and the game optimizer and this is where you're gonna be spending you know a lot of your time fine tuning cause it's the more important setting here to you know optimize your gaming experience this is where you can go in and adjust things like the hdr picture by fine-tuning the black and white levels uh you have different like sound options we'll talk about in a minute adjusting blue light levels motion blur that kind of stuff but like a monitor it also has different color profiles you can change up like this the standard mode that's stock you have an fps rpg and rts which is really just doing things like adding slight sharpening to some of the profiles increasing contrast rts slightly lowers the contrast you can see enemies better more of a flatter image but one of the more important settings comes with the input lag option with a standard and a boost setting so what this does is it adjusts the input lag depending on the game for standard so you know some games only support 60 fps some support 120 so the standard is going to adjust it to the game itself whereas boost just matches it to the highest possible frame rate of your console or your pc and this doesn't interfere with the picture quality at all like it doesn't cause tearing or anything like that with gaming i feel like boost is kind of a bad name for it because usually on a gaming monitor you know they'll have settings where you can boost response times and stuff but sometimes that can cause ghosting you know but here it's not boosting anything it's just matching to the frame rate of the game or the system however there is a really strange caveat with boost because it's only limited to just 60 hertz so again it's a very weird name to call it a boost setting when it's not really boosting and it's just limited to 60hz instead of 120. so what is it boosting and the reason this game optimizer is such a big deal for a tv is because in the past tvs didn't support hdmi 2.1 first off but also the input lag and response time of tv with output especially with pc gaming it really made it hard to game competitively you know it was doable for casual games sure but there was definitely a noticeable delay now another setting you might have seen when i was going through there which again is going to go hand in hand with pc gaming is g-sync and vrr and vrr stands for variable refresh rate and g-sync adapts the fragment of the game you're playing to the tv's highest possible refresh rate so 120 hertz this is the same g-sync that you do see again with gaming monitors but say your pc hooked up to this has an amd graphics card they also have an amd freesync premium mode as well and having these built-in freesync and g-sync modes in your tv is great because a lot of times say your pc gaming and it goes over the refresh rate that the tv is capable of you would get a lot of screen like cracking or like blacking out a lot of times so with this it fully prevents that and it's turned on by default well g-sync's turned on by default uh so whether you are you know console gaming or pc gaming the g-sync and vrr is what's currently going to be on now one tip i want to give you if your pc gaming which did throw me off at first is when you go into your display settings at first it just gives you pretty much like the hd resolution so it has the 4k but stock it only shows 60 hertz and what you have to do is scroll down and that's where it'll give you the 4k pc options which is kind of weird so there you can select the 4k and then adjust it to 120 hertz so if by default if it's been 60 hertz now it's where you adjust it and then also adjusting it in game is again it's no different than if you were hooked up to a monitor so you go in either the visual settings or your graphic options depending on what game you're playing and here you can match it to the 120 hertz so while pc gaming and playing things like battlefield and stuff again playing on a tv in the past was always doable but there was that slight delay that would make any sort of fps or competitive gaming really just not fun you know i was just truly blown away by how good this looks especially blowing up to the 77 inches running 4k at 120 hertz one millisecond response time and that is just so hard to sort of like visualize if you haven't seen it this big you guys know me i gave up my monitors over here my main setup where it's a 34 inch ultra wides but 77 inches at 4k is just insane with hdr turned on it just made the game look so good battlefield looks like insane as it is but now then obviously for the ps5 and your series x it's still going to look great you know the graphics aren't up to par with current gen pcs and stuff like that when you're picking between those input lag options with standard and boost i had it set to boost when i was gaming because like a lot of sports games forza for example looks gorgeous at this size and then having it run at 120 fps buttery buttery smooth and even though a lot of games are still running at 60fps again if the game doesn't support it and you're at boost mode it'll automatically just default back to standard which is you know a good idea on the tvs parts that way it's still not causing any interference or tearing and stuff on your screen um games still are you know getting upgraded i know the last of us just got upgraded to 60 fps but the fact that we have these tvs coming out we have monitors coming out that are just getting better and better and better the fact that we're getting you know console games being upgraded to support these higher refresh rates is a good thing so you've seen there's a lot going on with this tv a lot of power and there's also a lot of ai going on behind the scenes you can choose to enable or disable and that's all thanks to their new a9 gen 4 processor it's technically the a9 gen 4 ai processor 4k they call it because with some of the settings it uses this deep learning algorithm to sort of adjust to your content so we won't go over every single thing but ai brightness settings this actually adjusts your picture image and like what you're gaming or watching to the brightness in your room which i thought was pretty cool you also have something like ai sound pro the ai analyzes the audio it sort of emulates like surround sound but also separates vocals from the background audio to enhance that then you have the ai acoustic tuning setting which actually uses the microphone inside the remote that it comes with to sort of gauge you know the ambient noise level in the room going on and then it will adjust your audio from there so if you have kids yelling in the background it's pretty hectic it will adjust the audio levels for you so given all the power and everything this tv is fully capable of i think hands down for gaming whether pc gaming next gen gaming even all generation gaming this tv is the best option like 4k 120 hertz one millisecond response time hdmi 2.1 your gaming is gonna be taken to the next level i'm not just saying that at this size 4k 77 inches it's crazy uh the one con i want to bring up and i feel like it's a common con you see with tvs is the audio now it gets very very loud so when i'm down here i think i keep it at level 14 which is very low but that's loud enough um but when you start to boost up a bit um it doesn't sound fully full i guess you could say it gets loud it sounds decent but it's not a full audio quality and you know with the ai and stuff the emulated surround sound does sound decent but you would definitely benefit from a pair you know some sort of a speaker setup whether it is a full 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system that you might want to use depending on the room you're in stuff like that but what's also cool is they do actually have a bluetooth mode inside the audio settings where you can connect different bluetooth speakers so i thought that was neat but i would definitely recommend a sound bar with this just to you know have the audio level match the tv now another thing i want to bring up that's not necessarily a con but i think to keep in mind if you choose to wall mount it like i did as you saw the display itself is super super thin so wear all of the you know like the the hardware the computer and stuff inside on the bottom that's where your vase up mount is that's unlike the bottom third in the middle of the back so you're gonna need one a very heavy duty wall mount to be able to support a 77 inch tv like this but also since it's on the bottom third if you will at this size you know it's going to be a bit top-heavy because natural it's gravity when something's mounted that close to the bottom uh it's going to start to lean so because of the size because of the weight uh it does lean it's not huge but you're going to have to you know fine-tune your wall mount to make it a a straight angle if you will or hey maybe the tipping forward benefits you and your viewing angles depending on where you are but i did want to point that out because this thing's huge now speaking of viewing angles which are fantastic by the way one thing you want to keep in mind and this isn't a con but a thing to be aware of is the lighting going on in your room because the display itself you like the finish on the screen it's glossy it's reflective so if you have lights like angled across from the tv it very well may pick it up and like i said it's not a con because it's just a common thing with these tvs versus if it had a sort of like a matte finish on the tv the display would look a lot more dull you know so it's kind of a trade-off if you you know with the oled you want that beautiful image quality the screen does have to be this glossy finish so like i said just keep that in mind all right guys so that'll wrap it up for my review of the lg c1 77-inch 4k oled tv hope you enjoyed if you're a gamer if you need something this crazy at this size pc gaming console gaming whatever this is hands down one of the best options out there and it is definitely the craziest gaming tv i've ever had if
