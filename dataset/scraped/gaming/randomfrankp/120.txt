what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 240 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup and this week the clean and minimal edition if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and if you're trying to buy some new gear or hardware got something pretty convenient for you guys because this episode is sponsored by shop tagger which is a chrome plug-in and an app that's constantly using tech behind the scenes so you never miss out on a coupon code or a price drop i actually used it a few weeks ago saved 200 when i was picking up my sony a6600 camera so if you're trying to buy some new tech some new pc stuff i have a link for you in the description down below so on the chrome web store just install the shop tiger chrome plugin literally takes you like five seconds now whatever site you go to you can track items save things you're interested in and then get notifications via email or mobile push when an item you've saved goes on sale has a relevant coupon code or comes back in stock so a relevant example say you want to be alerted when a 3080 comes back in stock all you have to do is save that item it'll add it to the shop tagger plugin tell it when to alert you you can even create manage certain lists to organize all your items and you can see here all the stuff that i've saved and keeping an eye on all in the items tab in the plugin shop tagger also scans the web for coupon codes and applies them at checkout this is a special feature if you use shop tagger on your computer so the chrome extension is a must as you can see i was checking out on adidas for some new shoes and all i had to do was just press a single button and apply the coupon code it found dropping the price from 162 to 126. another cool thing is shop tagger just launched a new cashback feature so you can earn cash via paypal when you shop from select retail partners right here on the wallet if you want to check it out i have a link for you down below check out shop tagger on both your computer and your phone first up is the spencer ryan and i saw us on instagram knew i had to show it off for you guys got in contact with them because this is a super nice looking setup really hits all the criteria for me plus you got the pc there and the ps5 so console gaming pc gaming ain't nothing but a fang and i'm liking that wallpaper so for the single display here he's rocking an lg 27-inch it's her ul 650 display coming in at 4k with the autonomous smartdesk 2 you could see a darth vader creep in there off to the left side so you can tell he's a big star wars fan and those two prints behind the setup itself up on the wall match the whole setup really nice especially the stormtrooper they're like all black and white matches the ps5 to a t as well for the peripherals going mainly wireless here with a white royal clutch rk61 keyboard and logitech mx master 2s mouse and also for audio on his desktop for his speakers logitech z313 been checking out the pc inside the nzxt h510 case is an intel i5 9600k cpu the deep cool castle 240 ex cooler got 16 gigs of ram and the nice white asus gtx 1060. so liking the matching hardware inside here you know gotta go black and white so we'll call this pretty much like the stormtrooper pc with the nzxt case again tying everything together nicely i think ryan did a really great job of creating a refreshing and just chill vibe for the setup that i really like next up still keeping it simple but has the addition of some rgb is cyprian and the funny thing is going back like a lot of these setups that we have on the clean and minimal edition usually don't have rgb they stick to like one or two colors but here it's tastefully done there's limited hardware so it's not too cluttered i think he pulls it off really nicely forest displays go with the samsung 32-inch 4k monitor the ud 970q display and i like for the wallpaper how he has that color explosion uh but it's still it's with a black background so it still kind of tones it down a bit but the black's gonna match a lot of the hardware in the setup and he easily could have gone overboard with a very colorful wallpaper like this one but he didn't and i like that choice for his peripherals with the logitech g413 silver keyboard with a maria mg7517 mouse not too sure about that one and for audio he has the mackie cr3 speakers on each side of the desk now for the pc that's the game max black hole rgb case what a name with a ryzen 7 3700x cpu and an asus tough x 570 plus motherboard got 32 gigs of g skull trident z neo ram with a windforce gtx 960 g1 graphics card but the rgb ring on the fans and some of the rgb hardware definitely you know fits in with the rest of the setup and that rgb theme nice little peak underneath the desk in an absolutely great job with cable management uh this again is a desk from autonomous so sits sand desk so making sure the cables are nice and tidy is definitely the way to go here you don't want any cables ripping the whole setup down when you raise the desk for standing so all around cyprian like i said in the beginning you don't see all the rgb like this too much for a clean and minimal setup but you pulled it off really really nicely the addition of the rgb light shirt behind the desk even i think is really what makes this entire setup work so that way the other rgb splashes you have around doesn't really seem out of place now we've got jerry d going with the laptop setup here all powered by his 13-inch macbook pro and the nice 34-inch lg ultra wide just the essentials on the desktop got some prints above the wall got a plant this is what's up so this is in its daytime form you can see nice and bright got one of those monitor light bars mounted on the monitor to act as a lamp in addition to the philips hue play which are these two pretty much light pucks that he has mounted on the back of the monitor to give it that rgb splash which is definitely a nice addition i think he's got the rgb matching the wallpaper as well down to the peripherals has a keychron k6 wireless mechanical keyboard with logitech mx master 3 mouse on this simple felt desk pad his audio setup is logitech z207 speakers and like i said before this is all powered by the macbook pro so he has that docked over on the right side and then uh a webcam or his dslr acting as a webcam all seems like a very convenient work from home setup or possibly he's a student either way this is just the definition of optimal we'll say also like the little lounge chair right next to this setup got that big window for the natural lighting no issues whatsoever with this setup now is badra with the cozy setup like in that slate gray wall the autumn leaves and the wallpaper a nice wooden desk another great job by keeping it to the essentials here practically no cables really going nice and wireless for his monitor it's the acer predator x34p so a nice curved 120 hertz display that's also mounted on an arm you can see off to the right side coming down into the desk then for his speakers on each side on the stand it's the kanto yu2 in a nice matte black and for the rest of its peripherals loving the choice here going with logitech g915 tkl lightspeed keyboard got an opponent custom ultra wireless mouse that's on a steel series quick extra extra large mouse pad then also for audio the bare dynamic dt990 pro headphones powered by the sound blaster x3 amp and deck a very classy approach to everything then keeping it consistent for his pc cases the nzxt h1 also in black got an intel i7 10 700k cpu that's cooled by the h1's internal aio got 16 gigs of g skill trident z rgb ram and an rg strix z490i gaming itx motherboard with an evga rtx 2080 super gpu also loving this setup on the other side of the room you can see got a shelf off to the left side for some consoles a nice keyboard build and stuff but this tv is the sony a8f it's an oled 4k at least 55 inches i'd say he didn't drop a model number but loving the warm vibes all around there that's what it is it's the warm cozy vibes all around the setup it's the consistency it's the minimalism badger my man this is a killer setup speaking of killer we've got andy c closing us out with a big fat dub man so first up just the walnut here with the desk the riser the shelves in the back it all fits so nicely giving it that natural you know earthy vibe especially with all the plants around like next to the desk on the desk behind it and i gotta say the symmetry here also on point so checking it out for his single monitor it's an lg 32 inch a 4k panel don't know if that's his car in the wallpaper if it's one he found online but i'm liking it hatchback gang and down to some of his peripherals he has the kikron k1 keyboard i swear i'm seeing these everywhere now with the logitech mx master 2 mouse then for audio he has the phillips fidelio x2 hr headphones as well as the razer nomo speakers that he had on the monitor riser you can see yet again on the monitor itself we have one of those light bars which is pretty much replacing a desktop lamp because the lamp he's using is just pointed at the wall to throw some rgb on it so you're probably wondering where's the pc and believe it or not this is all run off as 2019 macbook pro 16 inch with an i9 intel cpu 32 gigs of ram and an amd radeon pro 5300 m for graphics so a powerful build still nonetheless not necessarily for gaming but it doesn't matter look at this setup that's all you need to know so alright guys that'll wrap it up for episode 240 of room tour project the cleaning minimal edition hope
