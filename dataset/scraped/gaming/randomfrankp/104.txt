what's up guys fjphd here back in episode 243 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup say anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out if you're interested we'll kick it off now 243. first up we have elijah giving us all the cozy vibes in a way even though the paneling on that brick wall behind the setup is fake i think the contrast here with the two different color brick looks really nice especially complementing the wooden desk here just looking real good nice earthy tones all across the board so elijah's going with the dual tetra shape monitor set up here with the primary being an hkc 24 inch and the vertical on the left side being a 22 inch from samsung now checking out the peripherals also matching the setup with a rock lamang pro keyboard with the kale box white switches inside this company's from the philippines also has some wooden accents for some of the keys to match the walnut wrist rest a steel series rival 3 mouse and then for audio we have the edifier are 1280 db bookshelf speakers the steelseries arctis 5 headset and the wooden headset stand to again match naturally wooden veneer in not only the entire setup but the bookshelf speakers as well and then we've got a nice black and white pc over on the right side of the desk with the rakhawani flow case inside the ryzen 5 3600x cpu cooled by the bike ski 240 ai oh okay 16 gigs of t-force delta rgb ram on an msi b450 gaming pro carbon max motherboard if you hear my dogs in the background just ignore them hey come on it's 5 30 to let me know it's almost dinner korg one spinny come on spinnies spinnies crazy cord number two all right where we've got the sapphire pulse rx 580 then for the gpu and a peak under the desk and man remember it doesn't have to be pretty which is definitely is not but as long as it gets the job done there's nothing really hanging on the floor if it's out of sight out of mind it'll work right what's also working is a really nice pegboard he has off to the left side of the room on the wall there nice for and stuff but also a good style piece i think it looks really nice so some really good stuff from elijah here again really like the tones and the vibes the setup has just nice and cozy i think that's the best way to describe it next is ken from singapore with a really unique looking setup big window all that natural lighting some additional rgb tons of shoes lots going on here so let's check it out for his desk setup and his monitor orientation it's pretty much the reverse of elijah still the tetra shape stuff here his main monitor is an lg 35 inch ultra wide with the vertical on the right side being an asus 27 inch for his peripherals if the kbd75 he has cherry brown switches inside with dulce keycaps logitech g pro super light mouse and also on the desktop there's still a lot going on he's a sound blaster g6 for his amp and dac and elgato stream deck seagate fire cuda gaming dock then also for audio the logitech g pro headset and the audio engine a2 plus speakers now when i first saw this setup i thought there were three total monitors that's just a print behind the primary display so i thought that was like one vertically mounted behind there as well but also keep off that rug because off-white is yes side note hanging off of his boom arm for his mic i'm really digging the pathfinder figure here a little touch like that it adds a lot of personality to his setup so i really like that and then in the background you can see his pc this is the nzxt h1 inside's an intel i7 9700 cpu with the aio's pre-built inside 32 gigs of g-scale trident z rgb ram got an asrock z390 phantom gaming itx motherboard and gigabyte aorus rtx 2080 super for the gpu and you've seen it in the background but now we got a glimpse at all those shoes that's a lot that's a lot of money right there i know i wear like two pairs on the reg so i can't relate to this that's nuts also no idea what those light bars are so ken i think it's safe to call this like you know a nice hypebeast setup i'm still liking the way it all came together would have liked to have seen some more wide shots of the room overall but either way i'm digging what you have here now is nabil the unicorn with the outrun theme setup i'll call it i've made the mistake of calling setups like this vaporwave themed and boy do people cry about that because outrun and vapor wave are so different spoilers or not anyways i can't tell if this setup is underneath a bunk bed it kind of seems like that i don't have a wide shot of the room to confirm but it does look like it is so that's pretty cool so going for this setup he has three monitors going with a samsung 27 inch as the primary and then the two mounted off to the left side are 22 inch monitors from samsung now checking out his peripherals some of these shots are like straight up so good they could be like actual product shots for razer because there's a lot of razor stuff going on here as you can see we have the razer ornata v2 keyboard with the razer mambo wireless mouse in addition to the razer tartarus v2 gamepad uh that's all on the razer goliath extended chroma mouse pad and the razer firefly v2 mouse pad and then for audio can't forget the razer nari wireless headset so a definite razer lover here but again all the rgb and stuff is synced and matching so it goes along with the entire setup even the flamingo and you would be a downright fool not to believe that his pc is also flowing beautifully matching a hundred percent inside the nzxc h510i case is a ryzen 7 5800x cpu with an nzxd kraken x53 aio even has like a little like you know those palm trees on the cooler there 64 gigs of g-scale tridency rgb ram on an aorus b550 pro ac motherboard from gigabyte i said motherboard weird and then a gigabyte rtx 3060 ti graphics card i keep forgetting those are even a thing so nabil the unicorn with the flamingo showing up with the really nice color synced setup triple monitors outrun synthwave miami vice vice city whatever you want to call it it's a really nice looking setup next up is ketlow with a triple monitor setup a super long l-shaped desk maybe it's just a crazy wide-angle lens but that's a hell of a desk that's some wood so he's got the triple monitors the little arcade machine right next to it some banana leaf rora light panels that add all the rgb to mix it in with the back lighting behind the desk all right let's dive into it because for the triple monitors his primary is a samsung 27 inch but is a 240 hertz gaming monitor and on each side he's an additional 27 inch from samsung uh those two though are 75 hertz now for the peripherals do the razer huntsman mini all white here with some black accented keycaps going along with the razer deathadder no he wrote death adder look it's looking like a lance head to me oh well and then he also has a secondary keyboard he likes to you know switch up and use the ducky one two mini and then next to this setup is a nice shelf for some retro consoles and stuff like how it's all set up and presented here um also is his headset as you can see the turtle beach elite 800x in addition to his astro a50 he also has right next to the pc which we'll dive into now the nzxt h510 elite and inside's an intel i7 10700k with an nzxt kraken z63 aio 32 gigs of corser vengeance rgb pro ram on an asus rog strix z490a motherboard and an asus rg strix rtx 2080 super in white and that is just the cherry on top here for this really nice looking build rgb blends nicely all across here and then for a shot underneath the desk using one of those ikea signals to keep everything off the ground for everything going on on the setup definitely a good job here keeping it nice and tidy so ketlow checking off all the boxes right you got the rgb you got the nice looking setup big long wooden desk the natural lighting the plants and stuff throughout the room definitely a killer gaming setup and i assume also a streamer with that ring light and stuff i mean when you got a ball and set up like this gotta be streaming right but yeah loving this ketlow and then last but not least we have rex man and i can't remember 100 if we've had him on before the setup looks familiar but what's really you know tipping it off to me is that crazy custom rgb like cloud he has made and those really cool hexagon uh like panels above the wall with the rgb backlighting and you know what if we did show it off doesn't matter you can check it out again right literally no such thing as too much inspiration okay so for those three monitors the primary is an aoc 34 inch with a 27 inch on each side from samsung now with that all black desk looks like he applied some sort of glossy finish to it so a lot of the rgb sort of like reflects and shines off it real nicely for the peripherals razer black widow elite razor death adder elite on the razer goliath's extended chroma in the back some additional rgb i think those are from govi got like an echo dot as well as some sort of those dai boom pixels you can see on display with logitech z333 speakers and of course their hs70 pro for his headset and then of course everything since you know it's all our this is a completely rgb setup here it can all be completely switched up to go from green and you know blue to just purples pinks blues that after all is the beauty of having all the rgb you can either use it to go all static or just use it to completely change up the entire feel of your setup and then going over to the pc probably the most popular case on this series the leon lee 011 dynamic this the razer edition inside of intel i9 9900k cpu with a cooler master master liquid ml 240l rgb aio always a ridiculous mouthful 16 gigs of g skilled trident z rgb ram an asus rog strix z390e gaming motherboard and an asus rg strix rtx 2070 super gpu and then a quick wide shots you can see the entire room and he also has a secondary setup over there we're not gonna go over that but you can just see all the gear and hardware he's got going on in this room and it is just an insane insane gaming setup here from rexman again loving that custom diy rgb cloud the hexagon foam panels on the wall look really cool this is rgb to the max and by the way if you're still watching at this point you know how to test new mics out every few weeks i think this one's a keeper huh all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode
