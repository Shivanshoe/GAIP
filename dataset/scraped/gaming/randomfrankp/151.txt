what's up guys i'm random frank p and it's not often i get sent something that really just changes up how i'm used to gaming especially for the better but that's the story for today because glorious just released their artisan equivalent mouse pads with the elements so we have three different mouse pads here the air fire and ice so three different mouse pads three different surfaces and it's really cool to see them kind of you know jump into a new genre really with these artisan pads so i haven't seen any videos on youtube about this i'm sure they exist but i haven't looked because i don't want to get other impressions um i doubt there's any reviews yet because they've only been out for like a week and you can't base you know a mouse padded review after just using it for a week so this will be my first impressions after a week i used um each one for two days straight testing different mice different mouse feet so we'll go over all that but yeah the first impressions of the brand new glorious elements mouse pads so first up we're going to talk about their air pad and by the way the packaging for these is really nice as well obviously they come shipped flat because you don't want to bend or sort of crease these surfaces and their air pad for me after using it for the past few days like i said is probably the least impressive because this is kind of just like a newer version of their already released helios mouse pad now just called the air and obviously i realized a lot of this is going to come down to preference some people like hard pads and people don't uh but the air itself is what you would consider a hard pad it's very very fast and the main difference between the air and their helios is the fact that this has improved durability they said but it is a super low profile pad which i really like it's just point five millimeters thick you take a look at it on your desk like it's just a part of your desk now you it's really not even you know a mouse pad because it is just so thin and low profile and it's 17 inches wide by 15 inches long and on the bottom it has this sort of like adhesive to it so it will really stick to the desk but it won't damage it over time if you remove it but it is a pretty good sticky surface like this won't be moving around and stuff while you're using it so what i'm going to do for each of these three mouse pads is do like a glide test and a sort of sound test if you will for different mouse feet so you can hear how it sounds and really likes the glide on it overall the steelseries airox 3 just has stock teflon feet nothing too fancy i'm also going to be using the new model o wireless with their stock g skates so 100 version grade ptfe and then the modelo wireless again but with their g floats ceramic feet so again i'll do that for each of these three so you could hear how it sounds to get like a general idea of how fast it is [Applause] oh so so very loud with the two ptfe feet and it's a lot more quiet as you heard when you're using their g floats it's also a lot smoother with the g floats and there wasn't any real resistance with the teflon feet like on x y axis and stuff so it was still smooth but you just here it's a lot more scratchy and kind of like grainy so who's the air gonna be for and again this is just my first impressions and everyone's play style and preferences are gonna be different but i've personally never been a fan of hard mouse pad surfaces so definitely not for me but if you are a i guess again depending on how you play if you're a low sensitivity player you're going to have that ability to just go real quick and easy with this since it is so hard just glide across it a lot more quicker than you would on a cloth there's going to be that natural resistance and stuff but if you just want a hard surface like this for 25 at this size um again improved durability over their already released helios mouse pad this could be for you but again for my first impressions uh not for me okay so next up it definitely gets more interesting with their fire pad and i use this one primarily with a mouse that's not out yet so i can't really talk about that quite yet but it's also the one that's most familiar to me because the fire pad is a hybrid cloth surface with that uniform x and y tracking to the surface here and after using it for the two days it was very apparent and this is very similar to the fnatic dash that is currently out there right now that's been the main mousepad that i've been using for the past three months on my desktop so like i said this is the one that's most familiar to me surface wise like i said all cloth here but the hybrid material feels really interesting i've always liked these you kind of see it with like the equate and even the sort of hybrid material of the madcatz glide 38 but like i said it's got 100 uniform x and y axis so when you're using the mouse you know going up and down figure eights it's all going to be smooth and they say it has a four millimeter premium foam core which is interesting because i thought the entire mouse was this fabric that's on top but they actually have a foam core and this is just like a surface material which i had no idea like the air mouse pad it's also 17 inches wide 15 inches long and then stands four millimeters tall stitching on the side very nice and tight i really didn't feel it too much on my wrist and i would say it's more um like even and flush on the sides than the top and bottom might just be my unit but i did notice the top and the bottom of the stitching did seem a bit more raised but it really didn't bother my wrists and underneath you have a rubber base it's nothing like the air pad so it's not going to like actually stick to your desk but it gets the job done doesn't budge around too much at all you so so this one oddly tells a bit of a different story because as you heard they were all pretty quiet on this hybrid surface and in terms of speed there is really no resistance on any of the feet when it's in your hand it all feels nice and smooth but in terms of just that free speed when i'm spinning the mouse is using its natural momentum and inertia with the feet on the actual hybrid surface funny thing was it's kind of in reverse order of what i would have thought the airox 3 with the stock teflon feet had the most sort of spin to it then was the g-skates on the model o and then the slowest one in that regard was the actual ceramic feet on this pad um but it's it's weird because when you're using it on here you still there's still a bit of speed to it like it's quicker than it shows in that example if that makes any sense but still as a hybrid pad i think it's going to be the best of both worlds and really regardless of what mouse you have and what feet you're using on that mouse uh this is probably gonna be one of the better options if you just want like i said a best of both worlds mouse pad since it's four millimeters if you're into that stopping power stuff where you can you know add more resistance to your hand and kind of dig the mouse into the surface to stop you have that because of the foam core you're just applying more pressure to the mouse in the end i usually play at around like 600 dpi or so um like i said with the fnatic dash which is a very similar surface to this and i do wish it was larger than just the 17 by 15 size since i am used to the fnatic dash desk version which is you know extra extra large um i did feel kind of restrained here because with this cloth hybrid surface you know i want more surface area so an interesting pad for sure especially if you haven't tried a hybrid surface but it does come out at 35 dollars which is i still think just kind of pricey for the overall surface area and the fact that it's nothing entirely new out there but you always save the best for last because they've got something extremely special with their ice pad this just needs to be on everyone's desk because it is definitely one of the more unique ones again loving the packaging you got the little snowflake there to represent the ice and the surface of this is glass infused i don't want to bend it too much um and this is going to be most often compared to a mouse pad that i already showed off in the channel which is the artisan shetinkai that had these actual glass beads embedded into the mouse with sort of like a laminate over it but the problem with that was that it wasn't the best in terms of durability and it broke down pretty easily to the point where you would see the little bits of glass beads starting to like shave off to the touch this just feels like velvet it is insanely smooth so i don't know if they're actually using like that same sort of uh beating whether it's just some sort of unreleased stuff that they've got for this uh but whatever it is it's working so glass infused it's not as dangerous as it sounds like you're not gonna get you're not gonna be cutting your hand open is what i'm saying one thing i'll obviously keep an eye on is how long it takes before it starts to noticeably break down that's the only real concern i have with this in the long haul the nas size yet again 17 by 15 would love for this to be extended like glorious if you make a desk pad version of this even if it's a hundred dollars like i don't care and i know people would definitely buy that because this is something special this is very unique if you do what we're asking you're gonna sell you're gonna move some units please and also for the size it's that four millimeter thickness again with the foam core but it just has that glass infused cloth up top uh sort of laminated into the foam core so they said because of the surface obviously you never want to roll it up or crease it because you don't want to damage this glass-infused cloth um and i will say that was honestly one of the issues with the shedinkai like when i got that in i noticed after a few days immediately my mouse feet was starting to shave that beating uh laminate that was on top but with here i haven't noticed that at all it still feels exactly like as it did day one i'm not chipping away anything not sanding anything down um super super smooth which is again it's closest competition out there right now the only thing i will say about this is it definitely shows fingerprints and like smudges from your side of your wrist or your hand uh so yeah you have to wipe it down every now and then not the biggest deal but i did notice that after just a few hours of gaming there is fingerprints smudges alright sound test all right so as you heard yet again with the teflon feet here on the air ox 3 not the best it's the loudest out of them as well and i really feel like i didn't have a lot of control with it it's just not a good combo uh kind of the same story for a lot with this mouse uh there are g skates the stock ones on here definitely smooth definitely felt nice but it kind of got overshadowed because the g floats here the ceramic feet and the glass infused cloth is a combo unlike anything i've ever tried and i've tried a lot of different mouse feet different mouse pad surfaces this combo is absolutely deadly it is by far the smoothest glide i've ever felt like you could say it's like butter sure but it's in the name it's like ice but not like a hard surface at all this does not feel anything like a hard surface it is 10 times smoother it just has this natural glide to it it is honestly insane now with that being said yes like a hard surface this is going to be very very fast um so you're having that just glass and ceramic which doesn't sound like it would be a slick surface but obviously it's different i'm not rubbing a ceramic pot on here is what i'm saying it's their g floats it is just crazy so this is going to be definitely best for lower sensitivity lower dpi because you only have 17 inches to work with here and you're gonna zoom right off your desk because this is a slick daddy so i will say by far that the ice is definitely the best surface available even though like i said you know my first impressions my opinion uh they got something really really special here and i can't think of a single reason why anybody would still buy an artist in shadikai over this because it comes in at 35 dollars and you're looking for a shankai um once you get it imported and the cost of receipts i think it's what like between like 70 to 90 bucks it all varies and it takes a few weeks to get to you this is something special like i said glorious if you're listening i hope you are please i will spend over a hundred dollars for an extended version of this and i know i'm not alone i'm not the only one saying that out there so that'll wrap it up guys you want to check them out i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below and remember these are my first impressions depending on you know my play style uh the three different mouse feet and stuff like that so everyone's preference for massmut service is going to be different but hopefully i gave you an idea of what each of the three element pads entail so yeah hope you enjoyed i'm random frank p have a good day
