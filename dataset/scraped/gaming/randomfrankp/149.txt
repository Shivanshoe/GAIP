what's up guys i'm random frank p and we are already at that time of year again we're gonna be dropping top five gaming peripherals of the year starting off today with top five gaming keyboards from 2020 tomorrow love gaming mice sunday gaming headsets so obviously i test a lot of keyboards on this channel i review a lot get a lot in this is going to be my personal list of the top five from the year plus we'll have a few runner-ups and honorable mentions so if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check them all out you know good ideas for your wish list send it to your family members and also with black friday and cyber monday coming up as well uh keep an eye on those links there might be some pretty good deals hopefully so starting us off at number five we have the corsair k100 rgb optical keyboard this is an obvious follow-up from the k95 platinum well i'm sure a lot of you probably thought this is going to be higher on my list or technically i guess lower if we're counting down the fact is there was just so many solid releases this year and at 230 dollars this probably is going to be out of most people's reasonable budget price point let's talk features and do a roundup of the board first we get the addition of their multifunctional dial that's new this year you can use this for zooming in and out or scrolling web pages windows control the lighting effects control the brightness here pretty much whatever you want this dial to be you can program it in the software we solve the six macro keys on the left side for gaming editing streaming whatever macros are always clutch and then even with the inclusion of that new dial we still have dedicated multimedia keys and for some other physical features is a brand new wrist rest this year it is much better than their previous releases finally corsair has a standard bottom row for swapping keycap sets that was always an annoying thing in the past and on the back side we have a usb pass through and a strip of rgb lighting that runs along the back and along the sides but the main goods here is going to come with their brand new optical switches known as opex they're a super quick linear switch that actuates at one millimeter and the k100 reports at a 4 000 hertz pulling rate so you factor that all together and it really does feel lightning fast most keyboards out there are a thousand so this is reporting four times quicker and you'll definitely notice that if you've never used speed switches in the past this is gonna be just an immediate difference all right so we'll do a sound test you can hear these linear opex switches and what i'll do for each of these keyboards is we'll go through and do a roughly 30 second sound test so again you could hear how that particular switch sounds in that keyboard so again it's obviously explained in a bit more detail in my actual review of the k100 if you want to check it out but the switches here just feel super smooth and the spacebar and stabilizers are finally factory lube so they're going to pretty much lose all of that pinging and rattling from years past i was definitely happy to see them address that you know in addition to all the other new features they added but i'm also a fan of their new textured keycaps which have this very simple font rather than that old like bold gamer font they used for how many years now i think these look much better and the only real reason this isn't you know rated higher on my list is the price honestly i don't care who you are it's expensive at 230 dollars but even with all that being said i think in the end it's still a killer gaming keyboard and it definitely deserved to be on this list of the top of 2020. so coming in at number four now is razer's first release of a 60 keyboard and this is the razer huntsman mini a nice 60 layout and this is really great to see because a it shows they're listening to community feedback and b the fact they're willing to push out a smaller board like this is great for the entire keyboard market so that hopefully more start to follow so i do acknowledge that not everyone's gonna like a keyboard at this size and layout and if you still you know use a numpad then yeah this isn't gonna be for you but the fact is over the last year these 60 have absolutely skyrocketed because it's going to give you more desktop space with a much smaller footprint and razer went ahead and released this with their brand new like their new improved version of their red linear optomechanical switches and why is that worth mentioning because again i do have a more in-depth breakdown in my actual uh review on the channel but these optical switches not only report to your pc much faster but these in particular were just completely redesigned and they had these embedded silicone dampeners into the actual switch so it's going to be quieter and they also applied a drive lube to the spring in the switch so that'll also cut down a lot of the pinging and stuff when you press down and bottom it out again this all just shows they're actually listening to the community and the feedback so at 60 the huntsman mini comes in either black or white color options either linear or the purple clicky optomechanical switches so between that you have four different versions and i think just all together it's a really solid board i did customize it here with a set of their own colored ppt keycaps and i used one of my own custom cables because since the actual cable is removable and usbc you have that option now you can really make it how you want it to look before this design overall i think it's really clean simple looking they're textured ppt keycaps they're still really high quality and i love just the minimal font choice here looks nice plus the inclusion of those optical switches like i said it all is a big thumbs up for me this unit like i said houses the red linear switches so here's a sound test now so the huntsman mini comes in at 120 for the clicky option and then 130 for their new linear switch option so 10 bump there and while it's still you know up in price for a 60 keyboard it still surprised me overall that it's still pretty decent it's not often a company comes out of the clear blue and just releases a brand new keyboard layout like this and don't get me wrong it does have their faults like everything else but i just think it's a total package for those who are already in the razer ecosystem you know you love razer or you're somebody who wants to save as much desktop space as possible with the addition of these new fast optical switches and this is definitely a worthy option next we have the der god venus at number three this honestly is a better version of the razer huntsman mini like i said that's for more people in the razer ecosystem this is the huntsman mini but on steroids in all the best ways so first off let me just say this is going to be for the more enthusiast consumer out there because build and quality wise this is outstanding it weighs 750 grams with the all aluminum body and the steel switch plate which again for a 60 layout that is pretty hefty for a small size so you can feel the quality right away some features that stand out to me are the clean pbt keycaps with a standard bottom row numerous built-in rgb lighting effects so you really don't even need software if you don't want they have lube stabilizers a built-in dampening pad and a plethora of switch types available to pick from so let's back it up for a second because i just threw a lot of stuff at you back to the board itself you get nice minimal bezels all around again an all-aluminum body this does come in black or white color options so you can pick between that and my unit here has gataron silent brown switches so unlike the first two boards those were linear these switches are tactile and i think having the choice between not only just you know regular browns or silent browns is really awesome but they give you the full selection between different offerings from cherry gateron and kale switches that is like completely unheard of i've never seen a pre-built keyboard like this from anyone offers so many different types of switches and going a step further like i mentioned before the venus not only features the factory loop stabilizers but the dampening pad underneath the plate and pcb to cut down on pinging and resonance when typing your gaming is something that every keyboard should have i love dampening pads it gives the board a much better feel because it's acting as a cushioning pad again while also cutting down on the harsh pinging sounds you hear in keyboards so again just to reiterate these are tactile silent brown switches so they're not going to be as smooth-sounding as the previous linear switches we showed off but either way we'll do a sound test now so all of that thrown into the derrick out of venus here and it comes in at a hundred dollars which is twenty dollars cheaper than the razer huntsman mini this has better build quality overall i'd say i think for me it's hands down one of my favorites of the year especially for a 60 layout so it just absolutely had to be included in this list i know der gods not your typical gaming brand but doesn't matter they got a killer board here okay so coming at the number two spot this keyboard has every right to be expensive and we'll go through it all this is the mountain everest max it is a fully hot swap customizable modular keyboard that really pulls off something special that no other keyboard has done in the past with these certain add-on pieces that not only can you add them and take them off as you please uh you can put them on whatever side of the keyboard you want so this keyboard was a pleasure right from the start even when they came to like their packaging and stuff it's absolutely top-notch with the the sketches of the prototype and the drawer underneath or all the add-on modules i know it's the last thing you care about but when a company goes all out and even has great packaging like this it really shows you their dedication this is just the beginning but the big selling point with this is the add-on modules they have the numpad with lcd screens and a media dock so the option is completely yours to configure this keyboard however you want however you want to use it you can build it all up to its everest max version just use a media dock if you want to have a smaller you know compact layout or change up the sides if you want to use this completely on the left side if you're a lefty you have complete freedom to change this configure it however you want and that's the overall beauty of a modular keyboard like this you rarely ever see you know additional modules on keyboards that are actually usable and actually give you you know useful features let alone the ability to put them on either side of the board this is something special so for a quick closer look at the modules themselves the media dock has this nice tactile scroll and buttons to it this gives you the on-the-fly control of you know going through different profiles macros built-in lighting effects changing the brightness volume you can set it as a picture if you want make it be a clock show your pc info for like cpu usage there's a lot of stuff built in here then for you dumb pad lovers out there again yes you know what this is for with all those additional keys but it's those four lcd screens up top those keys themselves can be programmed to be pretty much whatever you want and you can switch up the icon on that screen to you know launch programs games websites anything this is what i've been asking from corsair for about like two years now because it's pretty much like a mini stream deck but now built into this add-on module when it comes to switches underneath the keycaps the keyboard itself is also hot swap meaning you can pull these switches out of the pcb without needing to solder or desolder again giving you just complete control to add literally whatever you want to this keyboard just to make it fit your style and your gaming or work habits this unit has red switches but like i said you could swap them out and the stabilizers here are lubed and clipped for better sound overall so we'll do the sound test with the red switches then even at its core tkl layout the everest is still legit the all black brushed aluminum finish on here looks really nice it's also available in a gunmetal gray color as well i think it's all just fantastic execution here they really put a lot of time and attention into it and that does not go unnoticed other features i didn't even really get to because there's just so much else going on is you get the usb passthrough on the backside removable usb-c cable that terminates in just one output to your pc while companies like corsair and razer require two usb ports so like i said they just nailed everything here and i remember first seeing this kickstarter and thinking to myself like okay this company looks cool but they're shooting way too high then i checked out the prototype and now this final unit once it released and it exceeded my expectations in honestly every regard and i do think it's one of the best gaming keyboards out there because it's just so jam packed with really cool and useful features for the price it can definitely get a bit up there with the different configurations they sell the bare bones unit which comes without modules keycaps or switches for 130 dollars the core version which is the tkl layout without the modules is 150 then the max everest version like i've been showing you is 270. you get everything definitely a bit pricey but i think for sure it's worth it that price can definitely be justified for the overall quality of the product you're getting and just the ability to do pretty much whatever you want with the add-on modules everest really has something special here then coming in at number one for my top gaming keyboard of 2020. remember don't close out yet we still have some honorable mentions to go over but that's gonna be the hyperx alloy origins core specifically this model with their aqua switches now i've always been a fan personally of a tkl layout because you still have your essential keys but it's still going to cut down the overall desktop space for the construction here it's this really nice all powder black aluminum frame with plate mounted switches so they are visible and exposed at an angle but with the crystal switch shell and the matte frame to the board i think it does a really good job of blending that rgb together making it kind of appear brighter stock keycaps are abs with a slighter you know bold font choice to it but again with the keyboard that you're going to be using all the time you can always just swap them out with a different set which is why i went with a matching sort of aqua color to their switches these are the four screen key caps from tai hao i think it just matches perfectly and taking it a step further again for making your keyboard just your very own since this has a removable usb-c cable you could swap it to a custom one you already have and just make it look banging but to me the main selling point with this keyboard and honestly is what i think really sold it for me in the end are their own aqua switches these are technically tactile but they are the smoothest tactile i've ever tried and that's a big statement okay and it's really interesting i love what they've done here i don't know how they did it i don't know how you can make a tactile switch so smooth without it being linear but they pulled it off they have a total travel distance of 3.8 millimeters and actuate at 1.8 millimeters with an 80 million keystroke lifespan i'll also note this keyboard is available in their hyperx red linear switches as well as their hyperx blue clicky switches but like i said i think the real winner here are these aquas what's also great to see is they aren't like overcharging for this i think in fact it's the most affordable on this list at 90 if you want to compare this to it's again the direct competitor which would be the razer huntsman tkl that was 130 when it launched last year so you're saving 40 bucks with this and i think in the end it's a much better option especially with these super smooth tactiles just hands down love this my only real gripe with the keyboard overall is the fact that the software for this or ingenuity is a microsoft store exclusive which is kind of annoying i'm the kind of guy to download it set it and then forget it you know so that's a very small con to this but i think overall for 90 dollars it is a killer option out there love the tkl size absolutely love their aqua switches and this is the one i just found myself coming back to the most and loving the most so great stuff from hyperx there my number one of 2020 but now a few honorable mentions first is the logitech g915 tkl a follow-up from their slim wireless mechanical keyboard from 2019 but i absolutely love this release i feel like it kind of went under the radar and i even contemplated putting this on my top five list but what ultimately like held me back in the end was the price it is 230 dollars and yeah for a slim profile like this it might not be everyone's cup of tea but it is still technically mechanical it's wireless definitely deserved to be mentioned for sure and i really like the white variant here it looks super clean i was a big fan of this one i got it in and honestly it's one of my favorite keyboards of the year just didn't make the top five necessarily next is a pretty similar one with the brand new fnatic streak 65. i literally just reviewed this what like last week or two weeks ago and hands down i loved it but again i do realize that these sort of slim profile mechanical keyboards aren't going to be for everybody but with that said what the streak 65 gives you is still a nice compact form factor but you saw the addition of that extra column and the addition of arrow keys embedded the board has a really nice aluminum frame that does feel really solid for being so small still and for switches not only are they using um factory lube stabilizers for a better feel but these are their own fanatic low profile speed orange switches and they feel super quick as well with just a one millimeter actuation point definitely worth checking out i'm a huge fan of this board and then the last honorable mention is one you may not be too familiar with but ever since i got it in a few months ago this has constantly been on the back of my mind and i want to do something more to it i want to customize it make it really special that's the wermier k87 a hot swap tkl keyboard that's made entirely of acrylic so the rgb here is just going to be on a whole nother level it's going to look crazy when you have it all turned on and customized and blaring looking cool and again with the option to obviously swap out switches with the hotspot pcb that gives you that ability to really make this something unique also for price it's just around 85 dollars which is super appropriate for keyboard like this they're not over charging they're not underselling it either definitely still wanted to mention this probably not on a lot of people's radar but it should be this is awesome i mean like come on how could this not look cool it might be kind of hard to see on here because the lighting but it's super bright so guys that'll wrap it up for this video of top five gaming keyboards of 2020 hope you enjoyed plus the honorable mentions like i said if you want to check it out add it to your holiday wish list get some good christmas ideas all that good stuff i'll have all the links listed for you in the description down below
