what's up guys I'm randomfrankp and
today we're gonna be reviewing the brand new Samsung Odyssey G9, the 49 inch 240hz ultrawide monitor with a one millisecond response time. So if you're
interested in the g9 and maybe you want to pick one up I got you covered in this
review. First off I just want to say getting this thing unbox and setup made
me super giddy I literally felt like I was thrown in the Aperture Science and
I was building Atlas, this is the real deal. Now as you'd expect with the 5120
by 1440p dual quad HD 49 inch display this is gonna take up a good amount of
desk space as you can see with this sitting on my 60-inch desktop. in fact
the stand sticks out around eleven and a half inches from the back of my desk and
the curved ends of the monitor reach out at around 16 inches outward so just make
sure you have the desk space for this one. but man when you sit down in front of it
with that 32 by 9 aspect ratio and the 1000r curvature which matches the
curve of the human eye your setup is just elevated to the next level, even if
you barely have the room... and it is the world's first 1000R curved DQ HD
gaming monitor touting some pretty solid improvements over their previous 49 inch
models from years past and honestly well it seems extreme at first the curve
really isn't as dramatic and you get used to it pretty quickly. so at this
size it's the exact equivalent of having two 27-inch monitors side-by-side except
now without that bezel in the middle and for a visual comparison for current
ultra wide owners at 34 inches you can see you still get a pretty good amount of
extra screen real estate on both sides. before we move on on the back side for
your cables and connections they have this cable cover that kind of hides
everything on the back so the entire backside looks flush and just super
clean in this glossy white finish your cables actually get routed into the
stand and down out the back so if properly managed you won't see any
cables but on the back behind the cover we have a headphone jack to DisplayPort
1.4 ports an HDMI 2.0 2 USB 3.0 ports in a Titan b4 can take it to your PC
unfortunately no USB type-c also on the back we have a built-in headphone hanger
which folds out of the stand if you want to just place them there but it is kind
of you know out of place to reach around the whole thing when you want to use
them and yes you probably saw it glowing in
all its glory the back also houses this really futuristic looking Infinity core
lighting system that looks really nice and contrast to that black and white
exterior there are five lighting effects built into the monitor you can toggle
inside the settings plus 52 colors if you want a static look to it it
definitely looks cool I just wish it wasn't hidden on the back side and at
nighttime it does add a bit of you know subtle back low fits near the wall but
obviously not gonna be the easiest thing to see with this 49 inch panel right in
front of your face at all times okay Gaming use cases my experience let's
talk the goods because let's face it at the end of the day like 90% of you
watching this and buying it are gonna be buying this for gaming and no lie when I
got this in two weeks ago playing games at this new resolution with the curve
really almost felt like I was playing the games for the first time again so I
definitely got sidetracked more than a few times and my I should have been
filming but I just couldn't stop playing the monitor supports Nvidia g-sync and
adapt the sink over DisplayPort 1.4 as well as free sync premium Pro so I know
for me with my 20 EBT I being able to tune this to that rapid 240 Hertz
refresh rate felt awesome and I know some people will say that it's not worth
it or you can't really tell but a hundred percent I can immediately notice
a new refresh rate compared to my 144 Hertz monitors that I've used it just
feels a lot more buttery smooth now in addition to gaming I'll touch on it real
quick with all this you know new screen you can have numerous windows open so
it's going to be great for productivity in that sense you can do picture in
picture mode things like you know photo and video editing this is gonna be a
dream for that spread out my timeline you could have your bins open with all
your video files there I like to separate and monitor my vector scopes or
when I'm color correcting but I mean in addition to just gaming you know
streaming on this would be great to have your game window + chat OBS alright
they're using this in a racing rig for day trading the massive 49 inch size is
gonna give all users that extra freedom and flexibility now I will say at first
it was jarring I didn't get a headache but my eyes were slightly fatigued with
so much going on right in front of you and your peripheral view but I think it
used to it pretty quickly we as humans adapt and while it seems like a mammoth
on day one I definitely gotten used to it it's kind of like a phone screen
years ago we all had what the three and a half inch screens now those phones are
like six inches and up it also probably helps that I've been using a 34 inch
ultra wide since like 2015 see Justin really wasn't too tough
now obviously 32 by 9 ratio isn't the norm right pushing games to 50 120 by
1440p won't be an easy task for most computers especially at 240 Hertz I can
say for the majority of my time playing battlefield I'm racing around in dirt
rally scaling wise everything looked fine
and yes the resolution was supported but you'll need to be running a pretty beefy
rig if you want to touch at 240 Hertz and play still at Ultra settings
obviously games like csgo fortnight less graphically intensive titles will
benefit from the higher refresh rate but do keep in mind that not every game may
support that resolution or even scale properly to this new aspect ratio I
didn't have much of a problem on my end the one thing I want to say is yes on
the edges of the screen when gaming in your peripheral view the scaling isn't
perfect and it will look slightly warped in some titles personally I don't see an
issue with it because I'm focused on the action you know right in front of me
everything happening to those extreme left and right of my screen it's just an
added bonus now and will only add to my game awareness however one thing I found
is pretty interesting so I tried to capture as best as I could in
battlefield but if an enemy is far away in the distance but still happens to be
on the edges of the display like these guys running on the mountain they do get
sealed up pretty significantly to where they're easy to spot but if I look
they're normally in game on the center of the screen they're barely visible at
all like they're a pixel if that so that will sometimes happen with things off in
the distance maybe giving you a competitive edge even now obviously most
games and especially FPS titles you can also usually change or field of view so
that would be one of the first things I recommend doing here since the screen
ratio now is so wide you're gonna want to find a good balance to where it's not
a complete fisheye but still gives you like I said a good balance while
complimenting the new screen ratio that's the key and another thing to
mention the ambition do everything else so far is HDR with a peak brightness of
1000 nits this marks the first gaming monitor i've tested worthy of using HDR
with the cue LED panel which is quantum technology we have HDR 1000 which is
Samsung's standard to ensure peak brightness
of 1000 nits and HDR 10 plus enabling HDR and your windows display settings
then again of your game looks really fantastic here in battlefield you can
see a best in the sky in the water it holds all the detail on the clouds
versus playing its stock with a majority of the sky just gets blown out now you
may have seen a bit of flicker on-screen with HDR on at 240 Hertz but to get rid
of it I'd turn the death of sync off and the response time to either faster or
fastest and that flicker will disappear and yes at a thousand nits heads up this
monitor is super bright when I'm gaming I only keep it at around 60% brightness
in the settings because otherwise it's just too much but I mean I'd rather have
the option to always increase brightness versus a dual monitor in comparison the
only caps out at like 300 nits quickly touching back to the VA panel I did want
to measure the amount of backlight bleed levels sitting straight on with a screen
this size and as you can see the only three barely noticeable zones are on the
bottom left bottom right and top right but honestly it's barely noticeable in
pitch dark and wasn't apparent at all in gaming the last thing I mentioned is the
menu for we wrap up and thankfully they have an integrated joystick underneath
on the right side for navigating the menus it's very easy to find what you're
looking for here you can toggle the refresh rate from the 60 120 to 240
Hertz turning adaptive sync on and off response time from standard faster to
fastest and what's nice is on top of that menu there as you can see we have
this bold chart pretty much like showing you what your current settings are low
input like options and even a virtual aim pointer which is pretty much you
know common nowadays for most gaming monitors this gives you the option to
have an on-screen reticle you can customize and so I guess you know give
you better aim in games that guy doesn't have a reticle already on the screen and
then we have the built-in picture modes from high brightness modes for fps RTS
RPG cinema mode srgb and thankfully all the color modes here are actually like
usable usually on gaming monitors some of them will be completely oversaturated
or the picture will be you know crazy sharp but I can honestly say out of all
the built-in profiles we have here they are completely
visible this panel is factory calibrated at 125 percent srgb coverage as well as
95 percent of DCI coverage so the picture right out of the box is really
nice okay so wrapping this up do keep in mind
this video was filmed at 29.97 FPS so gameplay might not look as smooth as it
does in real life at 240 Hertz just throwing that out there and I want to
bring up two things first up I love everything about this monitor okay I
think hands down it's my favorite piece of tech that I've gotten this year and
in recent memory the display is gorgeous the specs are crazy gaming felt
brand-new again the light ring on the back looks sick and second if I'm being
honest 49 inches isn't too wide okay I said it yes at first it seems massive
but after a day or so you get used to it you adapt now on the other side of the
spectrum there are some things I want to bring up not cons necessarily but just
things to be aware of before you take the plunge to buy this first it's 2020 I
wish there was a USB C port on the back come on
Samsung get with it second obviously make sure you have a pretty powerful PC
you know you need a powerful rake to take advantage of this monitor and the
specs 5 2014 40 P 240 Hertz make sure you can properly run that and also make
sure the games that you frequently play could be properly scaled to that
resolution and you know just do your research on that make sure the games you
play could also take advantage of the monitor you're also gonna need enough
desk space as I showed you it takes up a large portion of your desk although you
can wall mount it which I may do and also make sure you have enough wallet
space because moment you've all been waiting for this comes in at 1699 yes
$1,700 and that is a lot of money no doubt about that the most expensive
monitor I've ever tried but it's also the most premium monitor I've ever tried
it's the craziest monitor I've ever tried and I think hands down if you
can't afford that and you want to upgrade you want to upgrade your setup
and you know your gaming experience it is hands-down worth it in every regard I
love this monitor it is the craziest thing I've ever seen
