hey wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world [Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be building and doing a sound test of one of the most annoyingly loud and harsh sounding keyboards that probably exists and i don't say that with any ounce of proudness now i've seen a ton of these loudest keyboard videos and i figured i might have the winning combination here so i wanted to toss in my few cents let's do it so today's culprit is going to be the grid 600. i first built this in august of 2019 and it's the keyboard that really got me into the whole custom community and i've since swapped the switches and keycaps about three different times since the initial build but it'll make for today's perfect disaster the all aluminum 60 keyboard has a few different properties to its construction that makes it a great keyboard for modding and customizing so let's get it naked first up i'll take it apart so i can show you what components i'm actually going to be using today it's going to add to the overall loudness of this keyboard the keycaps by the way they're also going to be swapped with an sa set because sa keycaps just provide more of a satisfying thought to the materials and as a result they're going to be louder but i will be sticking with the gather on speed navy switches that i currently have installed these provide super deep clicks with a 70 gram operating force and bottom out at 100 grams you may be wondering why i'm not going with another switch that i've talked about many times before in this channel that also provides super deep clicks box jade switches and actually the speed navies are more harsh sounding now i ran a bunch of different tests to confirm this and yes just by themselves out of a keyboard with a simple side-by-side comparison the box jades are louder but they average just 1.5 decibels louder but obviously we're going to have them inside a keyboard with a keycap on so i wanted to test them that way this is where it became more apparent the g key was the speed navy h was the box jade and when installed the speed navy averaged three decibels louder now it doesn't end there so i wanted to analyze the sound frequencies and see where in the audio these two really separate themselves so here on the left side is compiled of the audio from the navy switches right side box jades and checking out the lower frequencies of 1000 hertz and under navy had a much more obvious like metallic resonance then when it comes to the higher frequencies above 10 000 hertz pretty similar in pitch but the navy's came in yet again three decibels louder here this is definitely where that harshness comes from you can almost kind of feel it in the back your throat during these sound tests i'll run it again uninterrupted so you can actually hear how it sounds make sure you have headphones on all right so as we determine the speed navy switches are going to be what we're going with for this build and you know switches are the most important factor when it comes to the overall sound and audio coming from your keyboard but there are other components that can play a role such as the plate and we're going to be going with a carbon fiber half plate and the half plate here is also key with our half plate that means there's much less material now diffusing the internals it's going to give the sound of our switches more room to sort of escape really next step then to take it even further obviously we're going to remove the stock foam that we have underneath the pcb to absorb some of the metallic sound that the keyboard has again since the grid itself is all aluminum those properties are only going to give the final sound test more of a metallic sound and resonance with no foam and salt and the foam was originally here because taking a closer look inside the keyboard it's pretty hollow in fact there's about nine millimeters inside of empty space underneath our pcb so you combine the switches with the half plate now and now the holland is sounding underneath without the foam it's gonna give our keyboard absolutely just no materials inside to have any sort of absorbing factors when it comes to the high-pitched sounds and then i figured let's get kind of stupid with it let's fill this with pennies so like a wishing well i tossed in a handful and the thinking is hey if it's gonna be as hollow as it is why not make those slight micro vibrations when we're typing now be sent throughout the keyboard and hit the pennies and give them an opportunity to rattle as well now admittedly yes this is very dumb and admittedly does not really add to the overall sound in the end until here in just a second but once i did it it was too late to take it apart more so i didn't want to take it apart again i was too lazy to take the change out it sound better before i actually did it and the 12 cents wasn't worth retrieving okay but then as i mentioned in the beginning i wanted to use an sa keycap set with the final build so i'm with the color matching sa dream eater set i had this is going to match to only the switches underneath with the navy accents on the keycaps but also hit on the green shades with that color shifting peaks module on the top of the keyboard when you see in different lighting the top bar here is just for visual purposes by the way uh this does nothing more than just add the extra visual aesthetic factor but again at least it's gonna all match the final build and just like that our grid 600 with no foam sa keycaps speed navy switches carbon fiber plate and 12 cents and pennies is going to give us one of the loudest most annoying keyboards i've ever heard you ready for a sound test me neither oh yeah we're not going to put this on a mouse pad either because why would we want to absorb or dampen any sounds we're gonna leave it on the wooden desktop [Music] so [Music] yeah very harsh very high pitched and nasty lots of metallic resonance going on bad bad not good not only did it annoy me it didn't annoy people i was playing with online that was the goal oh my god whoever in proximity chat with that clicky keyboard just stop can you lose the goddamn typewriter hey brenda mute your damn mic bro how do i mute this i never want to hear that guy again so like i said i've seen a bunch of these different videos out there from people in the keyboard community making their version of the loudest keyboard to exist and i thought hey it's all fun and games why not like i said try it out myself and i think this combo here is definitely uh one of the most annoying you can find again all aluminum speed navy switches have a metallic high pitched resonance carbon fiber half plate no foam sa keycaps yeah a combo that would piss off even helen keller so guys that'll wrap it up hope you all enjoyed if you did if you got annoyed if you hated it give this video a thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp at last if
