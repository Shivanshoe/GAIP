what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna mod a keyboard the wish.com key cult knockoff that we bought in december if you remember that video i went on wish.com i saw a key cult for like 80 bucks and uh obviously when i got it in it wasn't a key cult your average wish.com scam however what it was was the app concor ar-87 and it was actually a pretty decent keyboard and what i paid versus what the actual retail was was like a third of the price that keyboard was over two hundred dollars i only paid around 80 for it so a few months have gone by obviously i figured today let's strip it all down let's completely change it up mod it and customize it and i know you guys you like when i kick it to the the chill vlog style every now and then so i figured we'll do a hybrid of a vlog nice b-roll stuff mix it all up so today we're going to replace the keycaps replace the switches do some sound mods give it a facelift and a paint job and really take this keyboard to the next level like i said it's pretty damn hefty but stock definitely not feeling it definitely not a key cult unfortunately for the sake of time it's not a hot swap pcb so we're gonna have to go through and desolder all the switches however my trusty hakko tool comes in clutch and this thing can desolder a switch in seconds so we'll suck up all that solder get rid of these nasty silent reds i just i can't hate these enough well i can because i do they're scratchy they're pingy they're the worst so go through it all take out all the switches but i really can't stress enough how clutch this hakko tool is if anybody's had to go through the painful process of manually desoldering a keyboard you know how rough it can be this though gets it done in no time getting these silent reds out of here i'm gonna be replacing these with a tactile mint chocolate chip switch i also had these sent out to lubed switches they lubed them and applied a switch film so it's going to have a really smooth but still satisfying tactile bump to them so the board's all desoldered and our next step to customize it is to take it from its stainless steel color to uh give it a bit more pop but in order to do that first you have to hit it with a black layer so we got some flat black here step one [Music] [Applause] nope [Music] good morning it's the uh it's the next day now i let everything dry overnight obviously i didn't want to handle it when it was still tacky and stuff and messing up it up so i have the as you saw the the mock sort of spray paint tent set up in the bathroom because the weather outside it's like crazy storming so figured i'd just do all that real quick and also to show you when i was done desoldering last night before i went to bed i also just applied a quick uh spray paint layer to the actual frame on the inside but we're gonna keep this black because that's gonna be underneath our switches not a big deal we have the top plate now fully all blacked out uh top and the sides and that's what's going to be visible same thing for the bottom which again isn't really going to be seen but still all has to be matte black because we are now going to apply our color shifting emerald and turquoise spray paint and this is what's going to give it that really cool sort of glow depending on the lighting but the spray paint only works when it's on a black surface so it can adhere properly and give it that you know ability to shift and glow so that's why we had to put on the coats of paint make it black instead of silver so that it's all dry we're going to do that today all right so to show you how it's looking so far after the color shifting paint has been applied and dried i'm really digging it i showed this paint off before i used it on my razor hyper ultimate mouse but it just looks so good it doesn't need like a finish coat or anything because the paint itself is super durable has a glossy finish as it is so depending on the lighting the board will be glistening emerald or turquoise now while the rest of the board dries time to do some internal mods as always we'll be applying the band-aid mod to our pcb or what i always use medical tape accomplishes the same thing and this just acts as that dampening pad under our stabilizer so it's not as harsh sounding during use and speaking of which the stock stabilizers here are plate clipping i don't have extras of these all i have are screw-in stabilizers these were factory lubed at least i just clipped the stabilizer's stem feet again to reduce any further rattling so before that all goes on it's going to add a little bit of dielectric grease to the band-aid mod pads and i'll probably inject a little bit more fresh grease into the stabilizer before it's all done just to freshen it up who knows how old this board actually is anything to cut down on potential rattling right okay now gotta put in our switches and begin soldering typically with these aluminum plate mount boards i like to solder down a few switches in the four corners first just so it has those connection points solidified and i can then work around the board about the plate popping up on the other side now soldering is always a topic that scares a lot of potential keyboard enthusiasts away and it's why the majority of builds out there also offer hot spot pcb options because hot swap is so much quicker and easier and it's more user-friendly again i know it seems complex and daunting and intimidating but once you learn the basics and go through the routine a few times it's extremely simple and i promise it's not nearly as scary as it seems the key is to heat up the pins first and apply the solder to the tip of our iron the heat will naturally transfer the flux and solidify in seconds you want just two little mounds then since this is a tkl board it has 87 keys so you'll be soldering each of the two pins per switch you do the math and yeah it'll take about a half hour or so but once you get into motion it gets repetitive and you're done before you know it now we went from those horrifically high pitched pingy and scratchy cherry silent reds to a nice smooth tactile mint chocolate chip switch however i did run into one user error and as someone with ocd this will make me lose sleep at night but hey it happens so i purchased these a few months back actually i believe they were sold in packs of 10 and i figured you know i'd use these for a 65 build since that's what most of my bills are i figured i wouldn't need more than 80. so i bought eight packs of 10 leaving me with 80 total switches i think i had one extra switch so 81 total i came up six short it's for the top f row there not a huge deal really i never utilize those keys anyways so i just threw in some extra glorious painted switches i had lying around since they're also tactile yeah i won't tell if you don't then to make our board a bit more poppy to complement the tactile switches just gonna do a quick tape mod on the bottom of our pcb with this scotch tape very simple very easy very nice [Music] [Music] [Laughter] all right now for the final touch the cherry on top our keycaps to bring the whole build together and that's gonna be gmk aurora polaris these were designed by s3lq i love his work a nice black keycap a green lettering some pretty nice modifiers and icons as well and you know with aurora polaris like the whole aurora borealis theme and i think that really fits the overall new paint job of our color shifting paint like it's just a really good match so uh kind of destined to be here really liking the way it looks all together and man as you can see just the different lighting the different angles the paint it all shifts it all looks different depending on how you look at it no the paint job is not perfect at all there's definitely some some rough parts to it but that's fine the final result as a whole more than happy with and again these keycaps the paint job just tying everything visually all together now get ready because we're going to do a sound test of the mint chocolate chip switches lubed and filmed by lube switches so all right these lubed mint chocolate chip switches sound so much better than those horrific horrific cherry silent red switches that were stock and the entire keyboard i think is just better than the stock ab concor ar 87 whatever it's called whatever it was but remember it was supposed to be a key cult from wish.com but not too bad for 80 bucks nice uh facelift here much better keycaps much better switches and just this color shifting paint again looks so cool depending on the lighting no like i said not perfect it was a bathroom paint job but uh all together looks pretty good but i am exhausted it has been a long long day gonna wrap this one up i'd love to hear your thoughts down below do you like it before if you like them more you know every day uh just you know mundane stock look or do you like the more flashy elevated mod look that we did drop your thoughts down below let me know how you think it sounds let me know how you think it looks all that good stuff but i hope you enjoyed the little mix of a vlog of upgrading the wish.com scam keyboard hope you all enjoyed if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp at last if you haven't already hit that
