who is and who isn't sub to the channel and obviously i'm only going to pick people who are subbed so if you want to win cover your bases tap that subscribe button now first up today we have a pretty nifty little rgb macro pad nine keys in total obviously macro pads are gonna be clutch for pretty much any scenario whether it's gaming photo editing video editing streaming you guys know me and my love for macros this one stock comes in two different keycap sets there's an all-white blank set the stock set that comes on it has the actual characters printed on it but obviously you can put on whatever keycaps you want now what i like about this is first up is usbc so you can obviously swap out that cable if you want to really customize it and have a nice coil cable on your desktop to kind of fit in with the overall aesthetic construction wise i think it looks really nice with the all frosted acrylic to it and with these nine keys it's obviously completely programmable you can go inside and rewrite what each key does make it something like playback have certain keys for certain programs and functions it's completely up to you to determine what you want these keys to be switches i have in this unit are a temu blue so when you click on them they be clacky and with it being rgb you do have some colors to pick from as well a few different effects to add some pizzazz to the desktop so for just under 30 dollars a nice tiny compact acrylic rgb macro pad add it to your desktop improve that workflow anybody out there could take advantage of extra macros and functions and while you're at it like i did custom keycap set custom cable make it look nice out to the desktop put this to use definitely pretty good for 30 and you guys also know history on this channel shows that i like me some knobs pause knobs when it comes to an amp and dac that is this usbc amp and dac from rhian i think is also a nice addition to your desktop especially if you're just using your onboard audio this will help tremendously so a little spoiler i'm gonna have an entirely dedicated video on gaming amp and dax coming up but i also ran a poll on twitter and youtube and way too many of you are doing it all wrong i really hope you do not plug in your headphones or whatever into your front io on your pc because that is just horrible for the overall sound quality coming out if you want instant results instant better audio and amp and dac will go a long way and that's why for just 35 bucks i picked this up up top you get a big old volume knob on the back you have ports for optical in usbc and coaxial then on the front side you have your left and right analog output a headphone jack and a little bass switch this will give you just a little extra oomph in your bass or in music or gaming or whatever so you take that 3.5 millimeter jack plug it right into the front obviously enable this in your pc sound settings and then instantly you will notice a major upgrade again if you're just using your stock onboard audio this will help out a lot and what i like about this for the price is a it's got a usb c port so thank you for being modern uh with the optical jack it comes with an optical cable so you can plug this into your tv a console like a ps4 and stuff and take advantage of that and also while it's not gonna you know blow your mind a little bass switch to improve it a little bit could definitely be pretty cool another idea for you if you're limited in desktop space since it is so small just tuck this right behind your keyboard run your headphone cable underneath the keyboard so it's you know nice and tidy and then it's just right there volume control at an arm's reach so for just around 35 dollars a nice compact amp and dac convenient volume dial up top adjust it on the fly and stop using that front i o in your pc damn it now next up know the ps5 isn't under 50 neither is there a dualshock 5 controller but it is hands down the best controller i've ever used for gaming whether it be you know on the ps5 on my pc there's the ergonomics the adaptive triggers the feedback it is crazy but what is under 50 bucks and something you can do to customize yours as you can see is these swappable faceplates that you can add to you know match your setup match your certain setup theme and they're like 12 bucks on amazon i found these in a bunch of different colors and finishes from different cellars you can see here we have the metallic silver and a metallic blue as well as a deep blue and a deep red color but i've seen things like gold shells green purple and so on taking the stock black shell off is very simple just using that included plastic piece for the pick you pretty much just pry it up on the bottom of the handles on both sides and then from there kind of work your way in towards the charging port then it just come out naturally it all snaps up maneuver it around the joysticks and it just slides out then attaching the new shell is equally as simple you start with those two prongs at the top of the shell that goes under the touch pad there then again maneuver it around each of the joysticks then it kind of just falls in place add some force to snap it back in you'll hear it all click and you're good to go now nice and customized pick your color adds a nice little facelift to your ps5 controller also worth noting every seller seems to be different the metallic set had two shells for example and they also included a bunch of texture joystick risers which the flat colors didn't have but as i said i know the controller itself isn't 50 but if you can afford an extra 20 bucks for a new controller like this i'm telling you even as an xbox guy there is just no beating this i play games even at my desk setup require controller only this has been my go-to and you can even take it a step further and match the rgb light bar on the controller itself to the shell you bought just to make it all match that much more you can find them anywhere from 10 to 15 bucks for a shell next you're probably wondering what that was in the thumbnail right this is a sabrin ssd dock and this is absolutely awesome because i have a bunch of ssds lying around i'm sure you know content creators gamers out there you might as well and i had just a bunch of them and i thought like how can i hook these all up at once see what's on them transfer data they should make a dock googled it separate coming in clutch you plug in your ssds into this this goes to your pc and now you have access to all four ssds or however many you have plugged into here and up top is a magnetic uh fan so when you put it on snaps into place and it'll keep them cool i definitely think it's a good idea and if you're like me you have ssds lying around and you either want to you know like i said see what's on them put them to use or just use them all pretty much now it's like this massive external hard drive with four extra slots for four extra ssds you can now do that read and write on the fly connects to your pc with a usb 3.0 cable it has a five gigabit per second transfer rate so pretty much all you do is just line up the cellular connector uh with the internal connector on the inside slide it in it'll snap into place and you're good to go now this is made for four two and a half inch ssds so if you're using a traditional hard drive like the the thick boys that's obviously not going to fit here this just fits two and a half inch drives with that magnetic fan up top it does glow blue let you know it's on pretty much and there's a button on the front where you can toggle it on and off so whether you're consolidating data transferring data pretty much whatever you want to do with this and your four ssds it's very easy very convenient there's no tools no software needed no drivers literally plug and play i picked it up for 48 dollars just checked it's around 51. definitely worth it though then lastly we have a wireless touchpad for your pc this one supports gestures as well which is really cool super thin and compact and i looked around for a while there's not a lot of wireless touch pads for your pc that don't start like at least a hundred dollars this one for 40 definitely a good desktop companion if you want so with it being wireless it connects to your pc via bluetooth and then from there once it's set up you can use it as you would any other touchpad you know use it as a mouse two fingers for scrolling and enable gestures and stuff to create certain gestures to be certain commands up top is also a dedicated strip for things like scrolling left and right on the page you have your middle click left and right clicks for the mouse obviously so you're not losing any functionality really only thing you're losing out on really is you know apple support this is not in the apple ecosystem it's just made for your pc and again have it on the side of your setup maybe not really to replace your mouse but good for scrolling navigating things you got a bunch of you know photos you want to go through use this nice and quick nice and simple um just around 40 bucks too so definitely one of the best you know in this genre of pc touch pads that you're not breaking the bank at so figured it'd be pretty cool show it off for you guys yeah that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for
