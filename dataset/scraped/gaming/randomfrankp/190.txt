hold up gotta adjust the focus and nope not yet and we're good all right smile for the thumbnail what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we have an unboxing haul for you i've had a lot of stuff stack up over the last week and i figured instead of just you know unboxing it by myself make a video of it because if you guys remember this is usually the exact weekend that i would do my amazon prime day unboxing hauls unfortunately we don't have amazon prime day this year or not yet at least and this is not to be confused with my amazon mystery unboxings stuff i've gotten in stuff i haven't unboxed yet figured i'd make a video out of it and uh should be a good one you know take a day off from reviews you can kick back and relax and just uh chill for a bit so first as you saw in the thumbnail oops lots of stuff starting off great this i have no idea what i could have ordered that's this thin and it looks like my mom's handwriting actually but it's it's not so figured get this out of the way real quick since it is so tiny and it's okay so wait a second oh hold on hold on all right so i completely forgot about this uh this should be well i should watch wrong cutting this should be a holographic gengar yes okay all right so i i bought this um actually for my novel keys nk 65 entry build and it was like a gengar themed keyboard and i was gonna have this uh didn't come in time obviously and completely forgot about it until now okay so that's that that explains what the small package was all right now we've got this from mischief and it says alexa gate on it they reached out to me they were like hey we got something bizarre for you you want to check it out and i'm like i guess so yeah definitely and i think it'd be a good fit to unbox today i don't know what alexa gate is so i assume something amazon related um okay so i know mischief they do like these random drops uh oh bye bye bezos am i gonna what is this definitely here let's just take it all out oh we got a box inside of a box okay and let's see what in is this like a is this their own like version of alexa or something some sort of echo i probably go grab mine give me one second okay so i got my amazon echo dot don't trigger it's gonna trigger i got them all over great so i tried looking at this and i believe what this does is completely just eliminate your al exa from listening or spying on you so let's see if i got this right you put this on here this goes up top this goes up okay so there's one two three four five six seven there's seven like active i guess speakers in here that once it's powered on it just creates white noise so even if you do have it on the um like mute mode it's not gonna listen to you okay so i had to run an extension cable but this like i said before uh it pretty much uses white noise to confuse the dot itself from listening and spying on you if you're big in on that stuff and you know it's true amazon's doing that and i don't want to demo it right now because everyone has one of these the actual dot itself so if i start saying it everyone's going to start going off but yeah it creates the white noise to confuse it and you can clap or tap on it to turn it into listening mode definitely bizarre so props for that alexa alexa alexa very very strange yes okay if you want to check this out or other future mischief mischief drops i'll have that down below for you but next up start rolling into it uh that took a lot longer than it might have appeared so i'm gonna edit this to make it seem like that did not take long okay something from drop i saw we got a few stuff from drop um i didn't order anything so i'm assuming they sent ooh some keyboard stuff i know you guys love keyboard unboxings i'm not gonna read what that says so drop alt and ice if this is what i think it is this is gonna be pretty cool that's upside down let me turn it this way and okay so we have the drop alt here this isn't anything new but actually i've never tried one of these or even used one i think the last one i tried was the k-type and the control so this is new to me but again what i'm excited about and something that i saw them talk about recently is they've pretty much released a bunch of new key cap sets and different plates so this is just a diffuser right here i'm pretty sure right the fuse around a bottom plate no okay so this is a silver plate so a lighter color this is the bottom plate and silver so yes for their control and their um their alts they're gonna start selling different plates you can customize it really switch it up this is the darker color as you can see this is a lot lighter so let me real quick let me see what else i got cause i know i saw more things from them drop drop not drop okay so two more boxes all right back into this so this now this should be the other one yes the control keyboard open that this video is either going to be 10 minutes or 45 minutes there's gonna be no in between yeah okay now we're cooking with peanut oil this is gonna be a mess to clean up oh my god i'm gonna have stuff everywhere okay so this is like a burgundy color which looks really nice it's dark but has that nice like metallic coating to it so this is going to be if i smash it with my ring this is going to be for the control so i'll put that over here with the alts i think you have another one here this is heavier so this is probably the keyboard yes this is the actual keyboard itself put that down there so as you can see the stock control boxes on boxes on boxes stock control kind of switches we have boxed whites again that nice dark metallic finish but here burgundy can switch it up if you want there's more in here this is i think the this is the diffuser plate for oh also the alt okay yeah so it also comes with the diffuser plates obviously to diffuse the led lights and then we have another box yes again from drop you would have thought i had too much coffee this morning actually just had mountain dew baja blast okay oh there's a lot in here so these are i assume keycaps yes judging by the box and the shape key caps okay drop is hooking us up just move it over here for a second so i know i only showed off those you know two colors but from what i saw and when i was checking it out they do have other colors available i'm really trying to get that like that dark green or the forest green color whatever it is drop if you're watching okay so again their own key cap set this is like a white and blue put that over here we're gonna get them all unboxed here white and blue and we got all white a two-tone gray this is what you see like stock on most of their keyboards as it is so that is that set you're probably pretty familiar with that okay ah yes like a dark with some red modifiers and accents very nice i'll show you some better stuff with b-roll because it's probably tough to see and last but not least what do we have in here black okay so white and blue white and white red and black gray nice stuff nice stuff so yeah they really give you that the option to if you want to just buy your keyboard whether the the drop or the uh the control or the alts now you can buy different plates different caps and start to get into more of the the custom realm of the keyboard community okay coming up top now this is obviously from asus not sure what this is i know what i'm hoping for because i haven't ordered anything from them that i could think of let's see what we got oh this is not what i thought but i know what it is okay so this is obviously their strix rtx 2060. um this is for a certain project coming up i've been in the in talks with them about getting their white 2080 ti since like november and that is on its way for another project as well thought that was going to be this got super pumped but it's 2060. oh yeah this is for a different project from asus but okay all right i'm not going to look at the names i don't want to know that hurt my finger if i get out of today with no stitches it'll be a good day whoa yeah you can't see that one all i'll say is uh but by the time this video comes out it'll probably close to the end of the month that gets released at the end of the month all i'm gonna say is it's one of my favorite headsets that i used before i did youtube like legit did youtube and uh they finally released a new version so i am super pumped to check that out next oh this is this is also from drop i must have missed this one okay so let's see it's either gonna be more keycaps or more plates ooh one of the green ones in here nope more keycaps okay caps on caps on caps susu atari m3 susu atari mt okay i'm not very familiar with susu atari if i'm saying that properly i assume they're key caps just by the shape yes you guys love when i do keyboard stuff i know probably okay um we got that again i will show you some b-roll i have not heard of these or even seen them uh but it seems like this is actually a pretty cool retro looking set android okay i see the android modifiers wow this is an entire thing here space bars icons novelties lots of stuff lots of stuff b-roll will be your friend for this portion so you can check them out and hey we're winding down look at that okay uh ooh key company guess what more keyboard stuff i love it i can unbox keyboard stuff and get stuff in all day if you're not a fan of keyboards if you just like you know if you're not into it you're probably gonna hate this video maybe i should title it something along those lines let's see oh yep i forgot about this so this is their tangerines i am very pumped check these switches out but ah forgot this was they ordered this in a separate order but they shipped it together gmk night runner so i don't want to open this yet i'm going to save it for when i do a build with this but i'll show you guys actually like what it looks like and stuff i'll throw a render up definitely pumped for that excited to check out the tangerines i've heard such good things about them i like how it comes in this little like you know branded case and stuff little cute tangerine this is all from the key company oh yeah that's nice that's smooth tangerines man nice uh like see-through orange shell light green housing oh super smooth very very excited to check this out add to the keyboard pile oh next up this is a heavy one as you can see it says took or tuck potato potato okay so i am a fan of kanto and their speakers uh these right here these speakers are the yu5 these are the kantho tuck or again took i want to say tuck and i got these i've been working on it forever uh the minimal setup in a spare bedroom that i'm working on and these are gonna be the speakers for that let's let me just get one out and show you guys i i can't open it i'm gonna have to rip it this is like a quadruple not there we go oh nope i just i just made it for oh yep okay oh my god am i like am i making progress am i tightening it some more there we go i'm not gonna admit how long that just took oh yeah this this is a nice nice speaker so obviously two of these uh in the powdered or the matte white version they come in a few different colors this is gonna look killer upstairs i've been working on that setup for a while there's been so many delays and setbacks obviously with coven and a lot of companies and their shipping and stuff but this is going to be a perfect fit this is one of the nicest speakers i've seen i should just replace those yeah okay and last but not least oh my god 700 pounds oh oh my god last but not least is a custom water cooled pc from main gear the f131 i'll do a quick unboxing i'm not gonna obviously go through and show you everything in detail it's gonna make a dedicated video on this spoiler this is my dream pc flip it
