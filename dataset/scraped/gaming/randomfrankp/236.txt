what's up guys I'm random Frank P today we're gonna be reviewing the NZXT h1 small form-factor PC case a few days ago on the channel I did a full build insights if you haven't checked that out definitely do so but today all the stuff you're gonna want to know about a case before you pick it up what I like about it what I don't like about it specs thermals all that kind of stuff so first up just checking it out the h1 is a thirteen point six liter small form-factor ITX case that stands 380 seven point seven millimeters tall and 187 millimeters wide and at diameter and I know I have in the background here but like look at this it's super compact but we're not just getting the case here included already is a 650 watt SFX 80 plus gold modular power supply that has pre routed cables a 140 millimeter a IO and that included Gen 3 PCIe riser card for your GPU so yes not just the bare-bones case we actually have Hardware included that's already pre-mounted and pre routed which is gonna save you a lot of time when it comes to building with that being said the case is 350 dollars however you figure the PSU the riser cable and the AI yo if you were to price those individually in terms of equivalent hardware including the case you would find that it is definitely meh connect with equivalent Hardware out there if you were to pick it up and buy it by yourself but also since you have more parts here not just the case itself you're probably curious about the warranty because there's more you know more opportunity for things to go wrong the case and the AI o of a three year warranty and the power supply is it extended 10-year warranty so really nice NZXT thought about that and really you know extended it in terms of visuals I do like the look of the case overall it definitely has that you know ends the XE case look to it in terms of similar design language their previous cases and while yes it's an ITX build you're not gonna be really bringing this with you in a backpack or anything it's more so meant to be a nice addition to your desktop in terms of physical features and your i/o the power button is on the top of the case and we have a USB type-c a USB type a both our USB 3.2 and then a four pull headphone jack but also inside the box that include a splitter for your headphone the microphone if you have like a headset or something like that so yeah that's definitely limiting and kind of a bummer since that's really the only accessible spot to access the ports I wish they would have had to like you know they're just to Taipei's or to type C's and maybe even include an additional dongle or like that additional dock like they did with the headphone jack so if there were type C's up top we could have an extended dongle to plug in more things now as for the actual frame itself when it comes to assembly the front tempered glass just pops off at the bottom as well as the back panel and the accident white frame comes off by just sliding it up off the integrated rails so yeah very easy disassembly is toolless as well as you saw so there's no thumb screws just popping the panels in and out the three sides are designed for air flow with perforation and inside of the interior on the left and right panels we have a removable magnetic dust filter on each side and then you getting inside to the motherboard trays as simple as taking out just these two screws up top which keep the radiator pretty much locked into place that is held on this by the swinging hinge so when you're you know building a set you keep it out of the way and when I first started building this it really was just a breath of fresh air because with those pre rattle cables already there it saves you a lot of time everything is held down with zip ties and velcro straps or better cable management and in the end it's just gonna make your build experience that much easier we do have standoffs built into the actual steel frame so you want to screw those in by yourself and as you see there's about four or five stickers inside the case that are meant to you know give you a heads up and guidance when you're building it's a nice gesture for sure but i 100% hate paper stickers when it comes to taking them off three then left behind residue I wish companies would just use vinyl stickers instead of paper but it's not just an NZXT thing this is pretty common so included stock for the AIO is the bracket and mount for Intel CPUs but since in my build video I went with a rise and chip I had to assemble the bracket with the included hardware it was very easy and then I also had to go back to my motherboard box to get the stock brackets that came with my board since I'm reusing this motherboard from a previous build that I use a different cooler on I didn't need those brackets so keep in mind if you're doing an AMD build you're gonna have to you know use them as well in addition to the included mount so once your main hardware is all installed and you realize that the blink of an eye you're pretty much almost done already one thing I didn't want to point out is that the cables are a bit snug obviously with them being pre routed and stuff this is probably all done in bulk in a factory but my 24 pin motherboard cable just barely fit they did say that after launch they're gonna be going back and extending the length of the cable just a little bit so it's not as snug making your build process that much easier and also like I said you have a gen 3 riser cable inside another thing they're gonna be changing going forward is as X 570 motherboards become more of the norm they're going to be including a Gen 4 riser as well then speaking of our GPU flippin the internal frame over is where we can vertically mount our graphics card it fits up to a 305 millimeter or 12 inch card in length up to two and a half slots so odds are your GPU is gonna fit just fine which is definitely a good thing because a common problem with ITX cases like this is a GPU size restriction and I gotta say shot to end 64 having that riser cable pre bent and pre routed can't tell you how many times in the past I've went to build an ITX PC and just the riser cable is too stiff and it's either you know just hitting the part of the frame or hitting other components thank you and for hard drive space we have a baby hind the power supply for mounting two two and a half inch SSDs and the last thing I want to mention about the actual build process the slight limitation we get when it comes to ram size not rammstein the high clears for RAM is 44 millimeters so any sort of high profile ram won't really fit when you go to close the fan and radiator back into the case I used Corsair Vengeance RGB program that's around 50 millimeters tall and then did kind of fit it was just barely touching against a fan but I just decided to ditch that and go for some HyperX Ram because I'm not gonna be needing any RGB anyways a little spoiler then just like that once everything is installed and connected to your power supply you also have this power supply cover which kind of hides those cables there you screw the radiator back into the frame pop on those side panels slide back on the top accent a panel and then just like that you are done super clean looking all around but wait a second where can we hook this up to our monitor and where's our motherboard ports well a little annoyance is that it's all underneath the actual case so any time you wanna you know plug something in and out you're gonna have to tilt it backwards to have access the cables get routed out the backside of the case since our mother it is held around three to four inches up so the cables won't get bent or anything against your desk but again I just recommended on velour a slim USB dock to hang out the backside just for convenience so you're looking at the case right now I know what you're thinking you want some tacos right now but you're also thinking well I can't really see inside yeah so really with the tempered glass it's a nice addition in all both in terms of quality and visuals but there's just no point all you really see is the glow from our twenty atti and even if someone were to install you know RGB light strips or have RGB accents from their motherboard it really just wouldn't be on display you're just looking at the right side of the inner frame facing forward so it's kind of a bummer and a big letdown when you have this you know really clean build on the inside great cable management and you turn it on you don't really see anything it's kind of a kind of a letdown in the end you know I do wish I know it's not really possible but if that internal frame could be mounted on any of the four sides so we could have something like a GPU facing forward but then again with the tempered glass it would be choking and thermal to be even worse so I understand I just wish there was more of some goods on display but yeah speaking of performance and thermals let's talk about that real quick so I went over this on my actual builds video but for my specs I'm using a rise in 939 50x CPU with a 2080 Ti and the whole thing around using that was because you know there's an included 140 millimeter AIO and the minimum recommendation for a 39 50 X is a 240 so I wanted to see worst-case scenario how this case could handle that so I did a few different tests I started playing Battlefield 5 and then an afterburner I kept my 39 50 X at 4.2 gigahertz because at 34 40 by 1440p and the highest graphical settings I was still getting 100-plus FPS we don't need the full power of the CPU and temps again capped at 4.2 gigahertz we're averaging only around 56 degrees Celsius which is definitely pretty good but it's the GPU at 83 degrees that's the main concern when gaming so it was good to see the a i/o working effectively even though we're not fully pushing our CPU but yeah that GPU is definitely going to be a problem and then what I did was I just did a full stress test on the build for the CPU I used in test v9 Pro and our GPU is tested in fear mark so uncapped our cpu got up to 93 degrees Celsius and our GPU up to 88 degrees Celsius so yeah this thing again with this hardware worst case scenario it definitely got pretty hot but then after seeing that I mainly set all the fans to 100% in the GPU cooled off significantly averaging 67 degrees Celsius but obviously everyone's not gonna be using that hardware inside so NZXT supplied their own thermal of comparisons between other popular ITX cases so this was good to see because they use a more you know popular i7 8700 k for their CPU then with the GTX 10 atti for their graphics card but they stacked the h1 against the N case m1 the ghost s1 and the fractal node 202 the hardware was the same for all four builds but with different coolers in each so the h1 had the included 140 millimeter a i/o that averaged 70.3 degrees Celsius and then for the CPU 74.6 degrees then checking out the other cases like the end case in the ghost s1 which both used a crack in X 52 which is a 240 millimeter a IO and then they no 202 which used a cryo reg c7 the results are pretty impressive and I'd say in favor of the h1 for the closest comparison here I'd say it's right up there with the ghost s1 but that also included their additional $89 for the top hat which extends the space for the radiator and I'll do it ambient sound test now so you could hear how this sounds while I was gaming and then while idle on desktop so using recommended hardware as you saw the h1 does pretty good in terms of temperatures for just using a 140 millimeter AIO but in my case and my particular build the main issue comes with the lack of external fans because the GPU gets pretty you know it's pretty hot and the reason for that is because it's getting trapped behind the GPU and the frame itself there's nothing to help kind of dissipate that heat and push it out of the case so an external fan would have definitely done this case nice but there's really not a lot of room for it which is a bummer another thing I wanted to touch on is the fact that there really is no need for NZXT cam which for a lot of people is gonna be a big plus I know for me I always had problems with cam but because the a IO doesn't connect and you know the pump and the fan doesn't connect over USB it just gets plugged into the motherboard headers there's no need for that USB integration so you don't need cam another thing I saw all throughout my build video the other day was there was one pretty much common theme people wish they would just sell the case and that's understandable because yes with that included hardware inside you are paying for that hardware so if you did have you know your own SFX power supply or a 140 millimeter a i/o you're gonna be you know spending again that same price but I really don't think 350 for everything here the case in the hardware is that bad something going forward I think that they should do and probably will do is either sell you know additional panels for this so like if I want to get rid of the tempered glass and have another you know perforated panel on the front here that would be good because we would be getting better thermals and also again since nothing's on display there's just no reason to have tempered glass even though it looks nice it's not really worth it and we're paying extra you know just to have that tempered glass so if they could sell additional panels offer this without hardware or offer this without tempered glass for a cheaper price that would be great and I have a feeling this case is gonna be very very popular there's nothing like this on the market right now that's doing it as good as the NZXT h1 is doing so in terms of a small form-factor ITX build for your gaming desk or gaming setup this absolutely takes the cake some you know Ram clearances stuff like that throughout the build yes I mentioned that but all in all great great job man zxt I could see this coming and tons different color combinations customization stuff in terms of you know accents really really pumped to see where this goes in the future and how this helps influence the market so guys out of wrap it up from my review of NZXT h1 case hope you enjoyed don't forget you haven't already check out my full build video that I did the other day using this case of 3950 X in the 28th ETI graphics card well if you like this video give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at random Frank P and
