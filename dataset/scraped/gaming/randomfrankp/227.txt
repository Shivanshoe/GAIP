what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today I have something truly unique and different than any keyboard that is currently out there on the market and it really gets me pumped for the future today we're gonna be checking out the Everest a completely customizable and modular keyboard that could fit anything you're looking for gaming photo editing video editing coding really the possibilities are endless here and they have a few tricks up their sleeves that we have not seen anywhere else this is currently on Kickstarter and I wanted to show it off because this is true innovation I review a lot of keyboards and not too many fingers gets me you know really excited so the fact that we have such unique features that you don't see anywhere else on this keyboard made me a hundred percent want to show it off for you guys so in this video what we're gonna do is run through all the features the really unique customisation and stuff you can do with Everest keyboard it won't be a full in-depth review obviously because this is a prototype and not everything is a hundred percent functional yet but all the stuff you're gonna want to know about this keyboard so real quick just to tease you don't worry we'll get into it all but we have again a fully modular keyboard an attachable numpad with LCD keys a media dock with a customizable display dial hot-swap switches here and perky RGB lighting all in this really nice brushed aluminum finish alright so first just for the keyboard itself as you can see is a 75% layout so at its core it's a much smaller keyboard which is gonna help keep a nice compact footprint on your desk this is in the gunmetal gray color option you get to the brushed aluminum accents all around and again to note since this is a pre-production model this is not actually how it's gonna look when finalized and fully completed as you can see some of the milling here is a more of just an incomplete kind of look when this is fully completed that will be kind of milled to have a more brushed look they're also gonna have a midnight black color option which I am all on board for taking a look around the Everest we also had these detachable magnetic feet if you want to elevate its backside in addition to the magnetic detachable wrist rest on the backside the USB pass-through and the actual cable itself is removable and USB type-c everyone out there with custom cables this is right in your alley and as you can see on the actual bottom of the keyboard tons of these cable channels so you can route it out whatever direction you want unfortunately that's just the beginning the first thing I want to talk about is this display dial and media dock up top which is fully detachable with it being modular you can put something left side or the right side of your keyboard and attaches via this USB C port up top so whatever side you want this on you can put it now this thing is truly remarkable and it's honestly one of my favorite things that I've seen on a keyboard not only do we have the dedicated media keys which by the way for the final production unit these keys will not be silver they'll be black but this big display dial has a ton of really cool features built-in I'll run through the options here real quick we can take a look at some in more depth we have a clock option if you want to be a actual clock your profile switching lighting which is four completely changing up the RGB lighting effects volume for adjusting your you know your PC volume the brightness for obviously controlling brightness we have PC info which is really cool for monitoring like your CPU usage GPU usage all that kind of stuff a p.m. for actions per minute in game and a custom option which is gonna be to customize this to be you know different things inside the software want this to display a photo or gif on it sure but going into the lighting tab for example everything is just at the turn of the dial you can change up all the effects on the fly which is really cool and there's you know a pretty good amount of effects built in but again also with the software you can add it to that custom option at the end and it just makes you know customizing this super simple now again for like the fourth time I'll reiterate since this is a pre-production unit not all these actual effects are fully working but it's so really cool just to see how this is working right now and again things like showing your CPU usage GPU usage your Wi-Fi speeds all right here on this dial is just unheard of for a display on a keyboard in terms of that custom option that's for things like macros shortcuts hotkeys because every single key can be reprogrammed to be a macro or whatever you but now let's talk about the detachable numpad you can put either the left side or the right side of your keyboard how is that possible you're asking well on the back side there's a sliding mechanism that puts out a USBC with these prongs and a magnetic detached point so you can have it on either the left side or the right side depending on where you slide it it docks right into the keyboard and it's automatically connected but up top you have those four LCD screens and this is like what we see on the vo gato stream deck we have four of them here built in and they're tactile much like the stream deck these can be programmed also to be whatever you want launching a program or an app you frequently use a game a website these can be assigned to anything you can change up what the actual icon is and that's the fact that we actually have these built in on a keyboard is super cool this is exactly what I wanted Corsair to do on their 2020 re-release of the kid undefined platinum xt but they didn't the Everest here pulls it off and the fact that they are tactile is really cool because you know when you're pressing them and when they're actuated I'll do just a little sound test of those against the stream decks you could hear and see the difference you still got some cool stuff to go over we have full RGB perky lighting here not only with the switches but around the entire keyboard with the LED light strip that also connects to the extended numpad so when you plug that in the RGB light ship is gonna obviously extend to that as well the effects can be all customized and stuff in their software or just conveniently as I've showed you right on that display dial and the key caps we have on here are an ABS plastic that are shining through however they just struck a deal with Ty how and they're gonna be now collabing to have an option to get shine through pv Tiki caps and I've showed off thai hockey caps and stuff in the past I have a ton of different sets and tons of different colors so the fact that they're working together is really cool because you can customize now you have that option but now we could talk about the switches and the hot-swap PCB so the ones included here are MX cherry Reds they also have blues Browns Silver's and silent reds available but the fact you do have the option to swap them out without having to desolder and solder anything is great we've seen numerous keyboards out there with these hot swap sockets and I'm a big fan of them because you could buy tons of different switches test mounts see which ones you like and then swap them put them in your keyboard to meet what you like not only that if a switch ever dies on you you don't have to just toss out the entire keyboard you can easily swap them out or if you want certain keys to be different switches like your WASD if you want Waze to be tactile everything else linear you can do that within seconds I won't be doing a sound test for this keyboard because again like I said before pre production model in this actual frame like I said is not gonna be what we get in the final unit and that's what it makes sense to do a sound test because if it's gonna be a different frame than the resident's is gonna be all different and it wouldn't be reflecting the final quality so again I don't usually you know take a deep dive into kickstarter products exception for a few out there that I'm really interested in but when it comes to a keyboard like this and coming from someone like me who is a big keyboard enthusiast and you know love all the gaming peripherals to check out when I see true vacation like this something that doesn't exist that contains features that I know I've been asking for for years as well as a community it's great to see a company listen and innovate and try to get this out there so I've already I've been talk to them for a past few weeks now and this is fully underway in terms of production so don't have to worry about production being slowed down with coronavirus and stuff currently out there this is already currently underway we've also been sharing with me some ways they are changing this to make it better as well as some stretch goals like I said before with the midnight black color option that's gonna be an option to pick from I check out and they're also gonna be selling what I think is really cool an artisan key cap this little like you know Everest mountain is sort of you know resin key cap people in the keyboard community obviously love artisan key caps in fact they're gonna be having that out there as an option to also buy it's just really cool and again it shows they know their audience they know what their audience will look for when it comes to keyboards like this that aren't just your run-of-the-mill standard gaming keyboard out there this contains things that no other keyboard has and just something like this all of the possibilities and customization right here dock to the keyboard left or right side detachable numpad built-in LCD screens got to give it to you Everest well the company themselves is mountain this is the mountain Everest you just got to give it to them this is something really really unique that I am truly excited for so if you want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the description down below I believe there's something like a little over a week and a half maybe two weeks left of the Kickstarter but like I said currently underway production is a full 100% speed ahead and I'm really pumped to check this out especially what it's fully completed and out I think your estimated time is August so that guys that'll wrap it up taking a look at the
