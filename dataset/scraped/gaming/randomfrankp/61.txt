what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out the brand new razer huntsman tournament edition v2 keyboard and the new five changes this made over the original huntsman tkl so visually they look the same but they are actually night and day so we're gonna go through it all that was too loud so we're gonna go through it all for you guys and like i said talk about the five changes they made in case you're interested in picking up the brand new v2 so first up comes underneath the keycaps with their v2 optical red switches and the switches themselves aren't brand new like this keyboard is because they actually use these switches on the huntsman mini so it's the same red optical switches but it has those inserted silicone dampeners in the switches themselves and these dampen switches were not available on the original huntsman tkl or the tournament edition same thing so you can see when deconstructed those little red silicone dampeners they just help literally dampen the sound when you bottom out a key press and it helps greatly eliminate that more plasticky high-pitched sound it has trust me we'll do a big sound test coming up so you can hear the difference between the original and the new v2 but there's a lot more going on that contributes to the difference in the sound so the second change they made comes underneath the keyboard in the pcb with a new layer of dampening foam on the top plate of the keyboard there's about 12 or 13 screws you remove all down and you pop the top of the keyboard off the pcb comes with it on the top plate and underneath you will now see this new layer of dampening foam the point of this now is to absorb a lot of that resonance and a lot of the micro vibrations that were going on underneath the keyboard inside the all plastic housing so this will definitely help contribute to a more dampened sound keyboard and now not to toot my own horn or anything but back in august of 2020 when i had the huntsman mini keyboard i did a modding video on that in which i took it apart and added my own layer of eva dampening foam that in return with those same dampened v2 optical switches improved the sound greatly back then and in that same video i gave razer a little tip but now when you add that internal dampening foam with the eva foam just having that layer now absorb all the the vibrations and the resonance and stuff when you're typing or gaming it is definitely worth it to do just even that alone is going to make a huge difference dampening foam all the way and razer if you're listening hopefully you are maybe that could be a good suggestion to add to future keyboards you're welcome now the third difference comes underneath the keyboard again you may have spotted it but you'll notice on some of the pegs when the keyboard was taken apart those little circular pegs that's where the stabilizers go and on each of those pegs is a very tiny little piece of rubber it seems that again is to help dampen and improve the sound of the stabilizers so with the keyboard they still use those costar stabilizers unfortunately and when you actuate them and press down any key with the stabilizers you'll see the plastic bits come through the bottom and that would also contribute to a louder sound because those plastic bits would hit against the bottom of the keyboard and again without the foam it would resonate make it sound louder now with the little rubber piece where the stabilizers are it'll bounce off that absorb it and again make it quieter so if you're used to like a band-aid mod for example in the modding community when it comes to improving your stabilizers very similar to that but now it's using that very tiny piece of rubber and actually with the space bar raised they included just a little bit of loop on those little rubber pads probably not doing too much but hey anything to help the sound right now before we move on to the fourth and fifth change that the v2 makes over the original we're going to the sound test you could hear how they sound in comparison back to back starting with the new v2 versus the original listen up but it won't be too hard to hear like i said this is completely night and day this is the new one this is the original now if you ask me i would say the sound profile of the new v2 version with all that inserted you know silicone dampeners rubber and the foam it sounds too dampened it's just my opinion it's more of a mushy feeling which if you're gaming is you know it's going to be fine because it's still nice and smooth you know it's that same smooth linear switch so it's going to feel nice but now the sound is just more mushier and obviously dampened in fact this sound when i was doing the recording and stuff for this the new version came in at 33 decibels with the original coming in at minus 10 decibels so the new one close to 20 decibels difference with it being that much quieter so if you're gaming stuff you know streaming or talking to your friends the odds of them hearing this keyboard is going to be significantly less because it's just that much more dampened now so you heard how that sounds definitely definitely crazy a big improvement now for the fourth change still inside the keyboard but it comes with their processor the chip they're using for the new v2 keyboard and it's actually possible of 8 000 hertz polling rate versus 1 000 hertz so this keyboard at 8 000 hertz significantly faster in terms of the pulling rate and reporting to your pc in real time now for gaming itself is that going to make a difference yes slightly even though it's 8 000 hertz versus 1000 hertz you're only doing a few inputs at once with the keyboard right and it's not as important the pulling rate when you think of something like a gaming mouse where you're doing all these micro movements every you know single second or millisecond so the polling rates can be more significant on a gaming mouse versus a keyboard but now at least you know that you know spec wise 8 000 hertz versus 1 000 hertz then the fifth and final change with this new v2 versus the original is with an inclusion inside the box now we get a tkl wrist rest included for us which the original did not have it's not magnetic but it's nice you know comfy padded uh it's like a you know it's it's not a real leather on top leather rat but still like i said comfy put it right up against it and something we didn't have on the original so you factor in the five made changes and yes this is a significantly better keyboard in the end and the five changes are definitely worth it there's no reason to get the original anymore and what's good about that is they launch at the same price the original v2 tkl or the tournament edition launched for 120 this now also 120. same price big big improvement 100 night and day and one quick note well i'm just showing off the huntsman tournament edition for you guys these same changes have also been made to the original huntsman the full-size layout so if you want the full-size keyboard with the multimedia dial and the actual dedicated media keys and the full size all the rgb you can go that or you had the smaller tkl version with the tournament edition keyboard so i figured i'd show it off for you guys and tell you the five main big differences between the original and the new v2 in case you're interested in picking it up but that'll wrap it up guys hope you all enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up show your support hope it helped you out feel free to follow me on
