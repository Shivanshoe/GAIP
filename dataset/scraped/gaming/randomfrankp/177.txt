what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for september the series will show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point and this episode is sponsored by nvidia geforce now which you'll see coming up in a minute you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out now first up is something i did show off last month in the back to school tech video and i'm showing it off again in case you missed it and it's genuinely one of like my favorite products that i've found probably the last few years that's this cable card so i'll keep this one short and sweet but just know this there are tons of useful features packed inside the cable card itself and it's more than what first meets the eye i genuinely love this thing and it's now a part of my edc so inside built-in you have a flashlight in case you need it there's a built-in micro sd card reader for actually transferring files you also have storage slots for those memory cards or a sim card with an included sim card ejector the entire device itself doubles as a wireless charger so you can just plug this in and then put your phone on top of it and it'll wirelessly charge for you or you can use the included usbc cables and any of the three adapters that it has built in to just plug this in you know power it on that you can charge your phone that way and then this has a flip out lip on the bottom you can use this as a phone stand so ultimately this is just one of the most versatile desktop backpack everyday carry gadgets that i think i've come across which is why i've been so obsessed with it and you take a look at it it's a very slim compact form factor easily have this in a bag you won't even notice you can even fit it in your wallet it's that thin so like i said i'm just a huge fan of it showed it off in the back to school tech video thinking it would be a great fit here as well the cable card is only 36 all right next up is something that i've been asked about non-stop over the last month and that's the glorious pc gaming race model d minus so the smaller version of the popular model d and i wholeheartedly love this mouse and i know that it seems like you know every month i show off a gaming mouse and i promise you hasn't been every single month but the truth is there's just been so many great releases and they've all been under fifty dollars and i would be doing you guys at a service if i didn't show these things off so the d minus definitely fits in today now coming in at just 61 grams you could choose between the matte black version or the matte white version and it pretty much has all the same physical features as the model d you have the honeycomb shell here to cut down on the weight their ascended cord a nice light flexible paracord 100 pure version ptfe feet on the bottom for the slickest possible glide they also include two larger pads that you can put on the bottom and we have the pixar 3360 sensor and you can take a look how it stacks up to the model d in terms of size but it comes in at 40 millimeters tall at the highest point right behind the dpi button it's 33 millimeters tall at the tip 120 millimeters long 67 millimeters wide at the hips and 61 millimeters wide at the inner grip and for me honestly i found it's just been the perfect fit for my claw grip and it is honestly one of the most comfortable genie mouses that i've tried and yes it's on the smaller side compared to the model d but as you see it's just slightly smaller and honestly i would go as far to call this a medium mouse not really a small size mouse and man if only this thing was wireless this would probably be my main it is super comfortable nice ergonomic grip to it and i think one of the biggest things for me with my claw grip and the ergonomic design to it it just helps me get just perfect control in games like in battlefield i can control my gun with practically zero recoil to it and this is a gun that does have a ton of recoil it's nice and controlled precise head shots with this and i just feel like i have complete control you combine the lightweight shell with their ptfe feet and their ascended cord and you just have this lightweight beast of an ergo mouse i know i just said it but it's literally the perfect size for me and i love it both the matte black and matte white versions are just 50 as well okay so next maybe you just picked up the model d minus mouse and you want to play some aaa titles but you don't have a strong enough powerful enough pc to be able to properly run them and like i said in the beginning this episode is sponsored by nvidia and we're going to talk about geforce now which i think is just a perfect fit for this series because it is now available on chromebooks and that's mind-blowing because you could play these aaa titles without having to have a beast of a pc you could own a crappy chromebook like the one i have here and still be able to play and stream those games right to your device i've showed off geforce now on the channel before people had tons of questions on how i was playing these games on my phone but just the fact you can now play these games on a chromebook is what sold me so it's actually free but for just 4.99 a month you can sign up for the founder's plan that gives you priority access to their servers and you can actually play games with rtx on without even like i said needing a powerful rig or an rtx graphics card geforce now lets you play existing titles that you already bought whether it's from steam uplay or the epic game store you just pretty much add them to the dashboard there's nothing to download which is awesome it's all just streamed right to you it also includes a ton of free to play titles so again if you don't have any games you purchased in the past but you want to scratch that gaming itch you can just now play them say you're at your grandma's house and they only have a chromebook but you still want to get some gaming done because you're bored out of your mind well you're in luck and even though you are streaming the game you still have access to really cool features like nvidia highlights so if something happens during a game you can actually capture that footage and save it some games also save like kills for example automatically it also supports nvidia freestyle so you can add these real-time filters to your game in upcoming they'll have nvidia ansel so you can take really cool unique screenshots in the game so while it's different from tangible tech like i usually show off it's still a hundred percent fits the series it's cool it's tech it's under fifty dollars you have a free plan plus the 4.99 um founders plan if you want to have unlimited gaming and again if you have a chromebook that you usually use for just school work and stuff like that now it can double as a gaming pc pretty much so i'll put the links for you down below next up we have a pretty interesting laptop cooler you know since i showed off the mouse and the laptop it would make sense to kind of do the triple play here with the cooler for it this one from brand ice kurail is pretty cool no pun intended because it does have integrated rgb lighting like around the actual device it has six built-in fans that also have led lights you have two usb ports on the back and the included phone stand is detachable so you can put it on either the left side or the right side so if you're a gaming or whatever on your phone you can just have it you know propped up right there so you can see if you're getting a call or a text could always appreciate the extra features like that and while there are a lot of these out there on amazon different brands different all that stuff this one i found for the price just had the most features so if your laptop's running a little warm you want to give it a little extra breeze to it you know cool off that bottom side all you do is flip out the two feet on the bottom to give it like a ledge to support it you can adjust the stand for up to six different height adjustments there's six different fan speeds as well and honestly the noise coming from this is a lot quieter than the actual laptop fans they show that it's clocked down at just 23 decibels you have your controls there right there on the front with the little screen that's where you change up the speed the rgb lights the power and stuff and plus everybody loves some rgb so i figured that integrated rgb light ship around it would probably uh convince some people you know this guy was only 36 dollars now last up is something that came from a vote over from the discord crews if you want to join our discord channel check down below and they wanted to see some crazy rgb light strips and fam i got you as you can see behind me behind my monitors and my desk it is a very bright blue as opposed to just the white and blue that i showed off before and that's because of these govi light strips so blue i could switch it up on the fly all for my phone whatever colors i want as well as some crazy crazy effects what i like about these are not only are they addressable meaning that you can have the full rgb spectrum as you saw but each of the rgb lights can be isolated and changed individually so you could really customize how you want this strip to look but you can also change them to different shades of white if you want like a cool white strip or a warm white temperature which not a lot of rgb light ships can do believe it or not this you get the full rgb spectrum plus all the whites now these strips also do have a built-in remote if you want to quickly just toggle the power and the effects it's only these three buttons here on it so it's very simple something easy if you're at your desktop or something like that but the strip is also wireless as you saw i had it on my phone so you compare it to your phone and then change everything up on the fly inside their app and it also ties to amazon aldxa or google assistant now inside the app you can do a ton of things like i mentioned obviously pick some static colors it has an audio visualizer if you want the strips and the effects so just pulse to music or whatever you're doing it's got the crazy rgb light wave plus 13 other built-in scenes you can pick from you got three music effects and then the ability to completely go into this diy mode and create your own effects with complete control of different you know animations different movement effects with certain colors it's very very expansive and useful because you just have that full flexibility to create whatever effect you want there is a 16 foot version for 25 dollars and this one that i have that ties between the back of my desk and loops throughout the monitors is the 32-foot version for just 44. and all right guys that'll wrap it up for this
