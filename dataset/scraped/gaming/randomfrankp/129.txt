what's up guys i'm random frank p and yes i am alive i know i haven't uploaded a lot of like reviews and stuff lately um other than like room tour project and stuff but for january it's a good time to kick back and relax uh take a bit of a break but now to swing back into it kind of to sort of you know uh just get back into the groove of youtube but figure today nice and chill we'll do a vlog kind of q and a style for this video because uh lately i've been getting a lot of these studio kind of put together upgrading some things changing some things up so we can finally get out that 2021 studio tour i know you guys been waiting for that um last month the monitor that i threw a box at caught fire so that can lead us right into uh the first question here from king which is so what happened to that lg monitor that caught fire and also dot ask 2021 setup tour when so yeah you guys remember um i just like jokingly during cool second hundred fifty tossed a box behind me it hit that monitor and it had some like dead pixels and stuff you can see where it hit and um i don't know what the hell happened but over the next few weeks the monitor slowly started to die out and then one day you know the monitor would just shut off on its own so i figured all right it's dead got to get a new one i'm sitting there getting some editing done i think and i hear it crackling and i look over and the monitor is just literally burning and i'm like oh that's not you know good that shouldn't be happening so i posted about it on twitter i got a little video of it and then it still just started to progress and then i start see like a little bit of a flame inside a little bit uh long story short yeah that monitor it never like proceeded to catch fire fully because i unplugged it from the wall and you know took it off the wall so i actually did you know get a new monitor in it's the upgraded model so i've been swapping that out but yes 2021 room tour when very soon let me show you around real quick so yes i did get that replaced uh it's kind of hard to you know film a studio tour when one of your monitors is literally burnt out so that was a pretty big hold up but yes i have uh it's it's replaced with the newer model of that so all good here i'm also gonna be replacing this old 32 inch or 34 inch from samsung i'm replacing that with a 38 inch from alienware so i have that over here again everything is a complete mess because that's been part of the delay it's just kind of refreshing adding things updating uh to the setup so it's not ready just now over here so if you guys remember the olds ikea desktop that i used to have as my main desktop that has pretty much just been like in the storage closet but i got some legs for it i got like some prop shelves and stuff this is going to be just kind of like a secondary overhead kind of shot sort of filming area mounted some of my like backdrop paper rolls and things that you see but the textured backgrounds and stuff when i'm doing some overhead shots so have this area sort of set up now this took a lot longer than you would think also got a new light dome pretty much for my aperture light so i have that mounted now and trying to really just like perfect the lighting this is a much you know bigger more powerful light so trying to get that dialed in so you guys could see you know when i'm filming here my a-roll stuff uh so that's definitely been taken up a lot of my time recently i got a new shelving unit over here for some custom keybuild and stuff or keyboard builds on display and another thing that's also been um you know taking a lot of time is so i went through a lot of different mounts mounts for the 38 inch uh mounts for the the new monitor over there and then amount for the 82 inch 8k tv so i'm gonna get that mounted to the wall because the entertainment center that's on now is just super flimsy and cheap and i don't know how it's even supported this size for so long so i'm going to mount this to the wall ditch that and then i just built the new entertainment center over here this is much nicer lots of room for the new consoles and stuff so i'm going to have that all here on display and it's going to just look a lot better once i get all the old stuff cleaned up and organized and put away and everything mounted and all the boxes sorted so definitely like i said a bit of a hold up but that's what's been keeping the 2021 room tour from coming out so lots of little changes upgrades uh but again the main delay was just having you know the monitor just catch fire oh man so yeah that's been another uh annoying thing so that overhead monitor as you can see behind me every like five to ten minutes it just shuts off and dies talk about having great luck when it comes to monitors over the last month it's not like an auto shutdown timer it's not like a power settings thing it's very old it's from 2016 or 2015. so it's definitely um dated at this point especially how much i'm editing and working back there it's on a lot so understandable that it's dying and um also let me know what you guys think about this new lighting setup like i said i have this new light that i've been trying to get dialed in probably doesn't look too different i'm looking at my monitor right now might not look too different to you guys uh but just a lot better when it comes to getting um controlled lighting as well as even lighting when it comes to overhead shots so let me know what you think about the lighting and coloring so next up from patrick like i was saying in the beginning january it's been a time to kick back and relax patrick asked how was your break ah yeah it's been uh it's been nice it's been good to not to worry about doing much and just kind of refresh reset a bit because if there's any month out of the year to have a break it's january and as you've seen probably around the tech youtube space most people aren't putting out too much content and i know i haven't done much at all there's a few reasons for that uh first off companies really aren't putting out new products in january like there's no real reason for them to put out a big launch in this month because right after christmas for after the holidays people aren't looking to buy something brand new right after christmas as it is uh so if you look around there's not a lot of big you know things coming out this month so there's not a lot of reviews to do but also it's right after the big holiday crunch for most of the tech youtube space i probably speak for the majority of you guys out there when i say this but january is the one time to relax because october november and december are crazy hectic there are tons of new products that come out during that time tons of new releases so we have to do tons of reviews it's also the time for me to do like my best of the year when it comes to like cool tech wrap-ups peripheral wrap-ups of the best of the year so those two months specifically november and december are just crazy hectic crazy busy and for me as most of you guys know i'm a one-man crew on this channel because i do everything i don't have someone working for me it's all just me who does everything by the time christmas comes i'm mentally and physically burnt out from putting out like three to four videos a week over those two months to take advantage of that crazy holiday hype uh during you know those two months specifically but yeah it's very very busy and it's just now a time we can reset relax in january and i really didn't do much of anything there's been a lot of just chilling hanging out sleeping you know that's that's what i that's exactly what i needed so yeah thank you patrick uh the break has been nice and i kind of feel like also once we get out the room tour that's like the the beginning of the year for me and the channel so the room tour coming up soon i promise and speaking of the youtube studio um i've been entertaining the idea of an external studio space and there's one not too far away there's a an open retail space i want to go scope out and check out in person to see if it has that potential and if it would be worth it or not huh yeah not looking in the best the shape good amount of space considering it has those two back rooms well that back room over there and this side room which is kind of cool definitely a lot of space but it just does not there'd be a lot a lot of work we need to be done here that's a bummer too because like i said there's a lot of space for it it's just a lot older uh the amount of work that probably have to put into it to you know get it renovated up to date and modern to look nice probably wouldn't be worth it in the end um but it's also the the name of this like plaza is like coffee run shopping plaza and nowhere in here is there a coffee shop so that's a that's a double bummer so probably going to be a hard pass so next up from bruno is how do you stay motivated to create content and it kind of goes along with what i was saying before about just having that fresh mindset and stuff you know it's why it's you need that january break to kind of reset um but one of the main things as brutally honest as i'll be with you guys is you know the money the income because obviously with youtube being my full-time job if i wasn't making money from this to support myself to support my family then i wouldn't be doing youtube full-time so that's obviously a large driving factor to keeping you know creating good content um also it just goes along with the fact that like it's kind of just like a habit um i wouldn't say you need like an addictive personality or anything like that to be a youtuber but you need to have that constant drive to keep creating content to keep putting it out and yeah while at times it's hard um when you decide like me to do it full time uh you keep blowing stop signs left and right up here literally at the four way left and right uh when you decide to do it full time you got to make that commitment keep going at it see the analytics see the numbers going up keep that drive going make the money uh but also what helps me get motivated is caffeine because i'm a big coffee guy love caffeine so on my way back i'm going to i don't think there's a starbucks around here but there should be a dunkin so i'm gonna stop and get something to drink real quick all right so i'm driving back sorry if this footage is super shaky that's those uh pa backroads for you but i had to make a stop at duncan because for the first time in a long time they have something that i'm hooked on now for a long time viewers of the channel you'll know that duncan used to be a staple right i would always go back when i was living at home every day if not every other day uh because they used to have good things now they don't have any good coffee they just discontinue all their good flavors and they make you crap in a cup and they don't have butter but anymore that's a seasonal thing for like a month out of the year um regardless butterbur can was my addiction and i say that seriously i was addicted to their butter to canned coffee now they have they uh what's it called funfetti or duncan fetty they have a confetti donuts and that thing's good so i had to stop and get one of those do you care no what's the point of this no idea killing time probably trying to make content while there's no content to make yeah all right so funfetti or dunkin fetty look at that ma'am tell you what got it um not a good thing to be hooked on this is super good um man yeah it tastes like have you ever been to a boardwalk and there's like fried food and everything smells so good when you're walking or like a a fair or something like that that's what this tastes like it tastes like i don't want to say fried food it kind of tastes like fried oreos but if it was dumped in like confetti stuff i don't know i don't know again ditching tech becoming a food review [Music] channel oh this is why it's hard to film when there's two balls of energy almost spun out there oh my oh [Music] all right jesus good girl you gotta go outside good rosie you ring the bells hey rosie can you bring the bells good girl but just look at that face not mine look at hers what a cutie what a cutie is this trippy as i spin but stay in center all right so next question well dizzy from doing that all right next question which is pretty good timing uh actually from isxel he said first video game console you ever played um i think like some of my earlier gaming memories were definitely the original gameboy back in the day but my first like console experience was with the n64 probably playing mario kart at my cousin's house uh that came out in 96. were you guys alive in 96 let me know if you were born in 96 if you were not give this video a thumbs up now i said good timing before because as you guys saw in a recent video i had this ice blue retro n64 i had that as like an overhead sort of like prop on display for the overhead shots uh but the past few days it's been been a good mail day for my ebay and mercari finds so i recently went through and i bought the entire six pack of the 23k gold-plated uh pokemon trading cards from the the burger king series in the late 90s probably i don't know but those are all brand new and sealed so the fact that i can get these in really good condition sealed i would assume over time is going to build a lot of value but then with picking up the n64 i also wanted to go through and play a lot of those you know games that got me into gaming uh for some good nostalgia so i got the n64 got a ps1 and i was gonna build like a retro sort of gaming shelf in the studio but with that i've also been going through and buying um complete in box n64 games so pokemon stadium pokemon stadium 2 and these not only do they hold their value but these also increase value over time if you can find them in such good condition like that complete inbox with everything so my recent obsession with mercari and ebay has been going through on the hunt finding all these old n64 games and just games from my childhood that i want to pick up and i've been buying two of these so i also have goldeneye on the way i have mario kart on the way complete in box so i've been buying two one for me to add to my collection and play when i want to play and then also to like i said gain value over time because these things complete in box if you can get them in good condition they're worth a lot so only imagine in the next like five to ten years how much the value would increase um some of the pokemon stadium like sealed brand new inbox go for like a few thousand so while i won't be getting that kind of value it's cool just to have these again and build the value both with me sentimentally and then in the the monetary way over time next question from our dude steve so he asked about the second studio and how that's coming along uh and that is something you're also going to see very very soon so i've been working on this for i'm sure most you remember since like may and yeah this is pretty much all but done this is also all completely filmed this should probably also be coming out like a week after the studio downstairs on that studio tour but yeah this whole secondary studio space more of that minimal vibe as you could see i don't know the lights turned on but this has been also a very lengthy project getting everything set up here organized got my home gym over there so you'll be seeing this in a video very soon uh i know i catch you guys waiting like i said probably i want to say i started this either may or june finally coming to an end see we also have a question on my dream keyboard that has got to be the geist i did put a uh not a pre-order in but i guess you can call it a pre-order you'll be seeing that all right so last stop i like this one from geo uh what is one song that's getting you through the pandemic and lockdown and i can't think of like one song in particular or anything but music is definitely important to people whether it be for you know motivation or getting them sidetracked uh nostalgic reasons music should be very important to a lot of people and i can't think of one song that sticks out but um i'm always listening to music um i can what i can do is i just pulled it up here is i can put a link to my top songs in the 2020 recap i can put my 2020 playlist down below if you guys want to check that out um i'm big into a wide variety like i i like some early like 2000s hip-hop with like d12 and stuff i enjoy that um more recent stuff like aesop rocks his last album the spirit world fuel guide is phenomenal you guys know i'm a big aesop rock fan uh obviously a bunch of mf doom stuff i like i'm like i'm big in system of a down that's like my all-time favorite band i i'll bump pretty much anything that's not like country music and stuff but i like music hooting the blowfish they're not really you know country i'd say um but yeah so i listened to a wide variety um but i would say probably you know this year more recently it's a lot of asap stuff hail mary malin but uh yes spirit world field guide came out in november killer album definitely check it out and i'll put the 2020 recap of my spotify down below as well and uh yeah this video is a lot longer than i thought it would be i should probably wrap up our little q a which is pretty much the video telling you guys that yes the studio tour is coming very soon thank you for being patient thank you for you know sticking it out through the low month of uh january as i chill for a bit so yeah i'll wrap it up hope you all enjoyed i'm random frank p have a good day
