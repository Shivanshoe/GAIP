before the video starts can I remind you guys it is the last day to enter to win the 82-inch 8k Samsung TV giveaway so if you haven't checked out that vlog yet you haven't entered yet you literally have less than a day link down below what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 215 of room tour project the series where you show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas of inspirations for your own setup if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll start off now episode 215 first up today we have Chris and I'm definitely digging the way this was shot really nice quality photos here that I think just make the setup look even better first up got to say loving the wallpaper and the nice wooden desk top kind of matching the speaker's a bit but regardless it's all looking good so for the display it is a 35 inch asus rog Strix it's the XG 35 v q if you take a look on the top of his monitor he actually has a lamp from Ben Q it's their screen bar it sits up top of the display and shines light down on to pretty much a desktop revealing the peripherals so checking it out this is the eraser huntsmen elite keyboard with a Logitech MX master 3 and 4 audio that little thing above the mouse are the jaybird vista wireless earbuds it's all the things you may notice the oh god of stream deck mini and essential and the Amazon echo spot this guy desktop gadgets then going along with the rest of his gear his speakers are the clips are 51m bookshelf speakers now believe it or not this entire setup is run from his razor blade 15 it's a 20-18 model with a gtx 1070 max-q inside but also he has two hooked up to the razor core X which is their chroma GPU enclosure and then inside there he is asus rog Shrek's r-tx 20 atti graphics card so he's taking advantage you know more so the cpu from the Razer Blade 15 powering everything getting that extra you know graphical power whether it be for video editing or gaming from the actual Asus GPU so I'm definitely digging again I love the desktop literally the actual wooden desk top and you desktop wallpaper it does seem to be under a bed it looks like with the like the mattress holder as you can see the top of the pitcher here but it's a good job utilizing this space and putting together a real nice setup now we've got space GMTV showing off the nice and pink and blue set up here pretty much again matching the wallpaper that's what you guys got to do see the lights it matches the colors primarily pink the splash of blue it all works out now for these two different monitors his primary is an Acer predator xb1 the 27-inch as the primary with another 27-inch from AOC as the vertical one on the left side now unfortunately Space Jam TV didn't really give us any shots of his overhead you know like the Shelf has peripherals so in front of us is the rode nt1 microphone and in the background we could see a Logitech G 610 keyboard in the SteelSeries rival 710 Mouse and also for audio then the beta dynamic DT 990 Pro headphones there also then sitting on a steel series extra large RGB prism mousepad prism not prison now on the right side you could see the pc purples and pinks and blues even inside so we got is matching in the colors and every way in shape and form this is the NZXT H 700 i case with an Intel i5 8600 K CPU with the NZXT Kraken X 62 a IO got eight gigs of Corsair Vengeance RGB Ram on an msi z 370 Pro carbon motherboard with an asus rog r-tx 2070 super graphics card and a little pop figure across the room I'm digging the Shelf set up got one of those IKEA peg boards up top to organize some headphones controllers definitely like this so okie dokie Space Jam TV the one big takeaway from this again you got some plants on each side which is great but I love the addition of color coding and matching those two light bulbs with a pink and blue corresponding exactly to the colors in your wallpaper spoiler you're gonna want to check out my next video it's gonna help a lot of you out either tomorrow or Friday not too sure yet next up we have Sean Kay with the stacked monitor orientation you guys know all we lovin these lots of blue RGB going out in the room overall with that red shirt behind the desk to get that you know that color pop in your face so yeah for those two displays his primary on the bottom is a dell ultrasharp it's 29 inches god I need to be reminded to mute my laptop when I film these but that overhead is a prism plus 27 inch 4k monitor for the peripherals in the Razer BlackWidow light keyboard which is very underrated I absolutely love it with the eraser Basilisk x hyper speed and the eraser of a spool of v2 mouse pad with the bose companion 5 speakers on each side look at like a real clean peripheral setup here and then over to the PC not too much info I know we have a risin 5 1600 CPU with 16 gigs of Ripjaws vram on msi be 350 tomahawk motherboard and for the graphics card all I know was the GTX 1080 GPU only real indication that I have about it is the fact that it just says right there GeForce GTX so pretty clueless on the brand he did admit that he had someone else built it for him and he has really no idea he just uses it for you know gaming and editing and stuff but it doesn't matter because altogether it's definitely a nice set up loving the stacked orientation I'll never not love it speaking of my love for being stacked talking about the monitors of course we have Brandon s and this one definitely has a really cool Japanese type theme going on you can see with the idea the cherry blossoms the temple some of the artwork looking really cool and obviously a pretty cool racing rig as well there but we'll get all into that first for his primary setup if you will the bottom one is the massive Samsung CR g9 is a 49 inch bolt ride and the top one a 27 inch Acer nitro monitor but on the left side he has another Acer predator this one the xB 27 hu their gaming 165 Hertz display for the gear here is the next level racing GT ultimate sin with Logitech c920 racing wheel then for his desktop peripherals he actually has two of each so we can use pretty much one pair on each he has Logitech G 9:15 light speed keyboard with logitech g930 play mousepad so it's never running out of battery then for audio on this sort of Deadpool mock headphone holder which is pretty cool at the audio technica ath m50x headphones with logitech g930 v headset then over to the gaming rig not the racing rig we had the Lian Li 0 11 actually it's the same thing you know what I mean the Lian Li 0 11 dynamic case inside until I 999 hundred K CPU with a courser H 150 I Pro a IO got 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Ram surprisingly not RGB I haven't seen one of these bad boys in a while with Asus hero 11 Z 390 motherboard an EVGA RT X xx atti XC Ultra GPU not even to mention the Sony 65-inch 4k TV that he has literally right next to the setup and as you can see for a relatively smaller space he's got a lot of gear lots and lots of tech going on so he comes in here and everything just you know shuts the world out its gaming time really diggin the Japanese theme as well as some good stuff Brandon and now we've got April May rain I'm liking the play on words therefore the name coming in with a crazy nice setup here giving you guys a taste with the wide shots you can see how clean the room is really really nicely put together here with the dual monitors side by side we'll get into it so this is a really nice 80 inch white desk from uplift it's the eco curve stand-up desk so motorized up or down and you can see going along with everything he has the elgato key lights so you can just pull down the green screen sit in front of the desk start gaming start streaming definitely an efficient setup so alright let me circle back to the monitors now they are each an Acer predator x 34 p held together with a white dual monitor desk mount so it's gonna blend in with the desk and the walls kind of make it seem like it's floating if you will you know helps it blend in and for audio setup you can see mounted on each side on the shelves are these speakers there's two the Cantho yu6 and for the peripherals we have the coarser gaming kid 95 platinum RGB keyboard we the coarser m65 RGB elite mouse in white also the white key caps there on the mm 350 mouse pad and then we have the custom water-cooled PC this is looking real nice wish the lights were on and shining bright but that's all right this is the corsair carbide 400 C case inside the until I 970 900 X CPU with the Asus prime X 299 Deluxe motherboard and 64 gigs of course revengeance pro RGB RAM and an asus rog poseidon GT X 1080 TI graphics card definitely a clean looking build to go along with the rest of the very very clean setup great job of cable management you could see just the two cables into the wall pretty much powering everything here but I will say again I wish the lights are on and the setup was powered with the monitors lost out so they could see and its full glory but either way it is still a bang-up job 10 out of 10 all right guys I'm wrapping up
