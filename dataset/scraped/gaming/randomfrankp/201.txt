what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna start showing off some of my favorite tech products of the month a lot of times I'll get things in it don't necessarily make it to videos or just won't be a good fit for the channel so figured it would still be cool to show you some things that I like to use behind the scenes say anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out now first up we have the razor kishi this makes for a deadly combo and this is a super compact gaming controller for your Android phone that pretty much turns it into a Nintendo switch similar economics and layout it connects to your phone via USB C so if your phone has that you'll be good to go that's gonna be good to know though because it doesn't require Bluetooth which means it also doesn't need its own battery and therefore there won't be any lag or Layton season 2 connects directly to your phone it also has the USB C pass-through for charging now I'll be the first to admit that the buttons here aren't satisfyingly tactile and the triggers don't feel anything like an actual controller triggers do but the fact that it's so tiny and compact and just instantly turns your phone into a handheld console pretty much is awesome now I'll have two beasts than my pants so there is an app for this you'll have to download to kind of like remap controls for certain games and right now not every game is even compatible which is a bummer but I love this for two things GeForce now in emulators so here I can play session literally anywhere in the world on my phone and still have those native controls with you know the familiar layout like a real controller it's responsive like I said no latency and it works out great now the phone I'm using this with is the newbie a red magic 5g which is already a monster of a phone and it's pretty much advertised as a gaming phone due to that 144 Hertz display yes you heard that right a snapdragon 865 cpu with active liquid cooling inside an in screen fingerprint reader and built-in touch sensitive triggers so yeah I guess you could say this is a gaming phone alright the 6.6 inch AMOLED screen looks crazy and it's 2340 by 1080p resolution and the phone even has built-in overclocking RGB 12 gigs of ram and a 4500 milliamp hour battery so as you can imagine the two is a combo is just crazy I could probably do an entire dedicated video with just this phone so if you want to see that let me know in the comments now writing emulators there's just one thing that I love dearly as nerdy as that sounds there's just something so fun about being able to revisit those old gameboy and 64 games and with this obviously playing those old nostalgic home runs is a breeze Gameboy even des games are played out into the split-screen here so you have that extra screen real estate it works out perfect and and 64 is also no problem and man every time I go back to Goldeneye it just blows my mind that we used to play with those janky controls but with something like the dolphin emulator which you can download I can even play some Wii and GameCube games and really due to the hardware inside this phone it plays really well there's some actual dedicated emulator devices out there that can barely handle some games and this just rolls through it like imagine a Gamecube in the palm of your hands like this there's even this built-in gaming mode you can toggle on and off which turns on this aggressive gaming OS pretty much kicks the phone into overdrive and here you can control things like I remapping all the buttons and choosing where those built-in triggers activate in game you can add certain games to the interface for quick launching monitor your CPU and GPU usage toggle the cooling fan and so on but just like I said these two together yes it's a killer duo for sure the key is $80 for Android and the red magic 5g is around 600 next is something that I admittedly can't take advantage of too much right now but that's the elgato 4k 60s plus a self contained recording device for all your gameplay you can take this to events a friend's house cap while your gameplay footage all without even needing a PC it's super compact as well as you can probably see and obviously it's not gonna be an issue for carrying around in your back you can cap 4k HDR gameplay at 60fps with 0 which beats the latency on most capture cards out there on the front you have a big old touch sensitive record button an SD card slot for saving your gameplay and an audio input for headset or headphones just plug this into your TV your monitor connected to a console and instantly cap some footage you can also use it with your PC if you want to record some gameplay on windows and with this you don't have to worry about your computer getting bogged down through the CPU usage or hard drives filling up because again it's all done inside this device with its own encoder I use this mainly when I'm building new PCs are testing monitors I can hook this up and cap any gameplay and a different setup in the studio without having to you know just transport my personal PC to the different monitors and use that gameplay in my videos it's expensive it's probably not on stock right now but it's awesome next we have the Andover spin base and I got this for my upstairs office which you guys will be seeing some time with the next month trust me this has been an awesome addition the spin base is a 270 degrees speaker platform that has two woofers and two tweeters built in to create this expansive stereo image I'm also using this with a spin deck which is their turntable and aesthetically they go together like peanut butter and jelly you can use any record player with this but I just got their spin deck as a bundle with it over the years I'd always pick up records to my favorite bands but never really once use them because I never had a record player but I saw the steel no I had to pick them up so the spin deck sits on top of the spin bass plugs right in and you're good to go the spin bass also has built-in bluetooth if you want to you know play music from your phone as well as dedicated bass and treble eq's now a lot of times you don't want your turntable on the same surface as speakers just due to the vibrations over time that could cause deep grooves and damage your records but the top of the spin bass actually has this isoh gru feedback elimination technology they call it which literally kills any vibrations on the top so you can rest down a record player and not have to worry about any potential damage it sounds amazing it gets crazy loud probably too loud for the room even and I love the minimal look to it they each come in black or white and like I said I picked this up for my studio upstairs that's going for the whole minimal vibe so this just fits in perfectly you'll see more about it in that room tour so I've been loving the spin bass another thing I've been thinking about is what if you added this to your desk set up and you use this kind of like a monitor riser and then now you have this 270 degree speaker right there in front of you on your desk I think that'd be cool as well but this comes in at 299 they're coming in at number 5 we have a game and I don't care if people complain this is legitimately one of my favorite things out there right now session and yes games are technology session as a skateboarding simulator even though they finally just announced skate 4 this will happily fill the void until then there are a lot of things I love about this and off there are some gameplay up while you listen to me rant I've had it first is actual the modding community from decks close to maps the modding community out there has helped really take this game to the next level on PC people have created some really awesome maps probably over a hundred out there I'd say but something like this hometown one which is about a guy who was like on the rise and then lost it all now he's back home revisiting his old ice skate warehouse yeah some like collectables and events that trigger it's pretty much like its own psychological trip with him dealing with the fact that he lost everything it's fun the warehouse map here is great and there is just plenty more it's cool to see someone kind of create their own story mode mod with this game due to the unity engine that they use to mod the other map I love is from MARAC this is the one that I skate pretty much daily I'd say it's just so well done his maps are great this one is more of like an outdoor park and it has different areas you could skate two ramps tons of fun Street spots you can get creative with I think that's what I love about session the most the fact that you can literally do whatever you want as a skater if you have a creative mindset when it comes to skating you'll be perfect in this game but what's also really unique about it is the fact that the controls are completely different than the skate franchise and what you're probably used to here you turn with the triggers and each foot is its own joystick I play goofy so you can kind of switch it up on how you ride but this means you can literally mimic any trick just like you would in real life with your foot movements except now they're the actual analog inputs it definitely took me some time to get used to admittedly I've been playing this at September and I'm still not that good at it but it is really fun another cool thing in this game is the full 24 hour day and night cycle so you can skate during the day skate at night which definitely provides a cool ambience to your gameplay you can manually toggle which kind of time you want to skate as well and guess what I haven't even talked about the actual maps that come with the game stock so the map you start out in is Chatham Towers which is a one to one recreation of a part of New York City let me tell you I spent the first week playing this game just pretty much running around and exploring it's huge there's same as spotlight that Brooklyn thanks one Police Plaza James Madison Plaza they've also been adding other maps of the game like an indoor four level parking garage their own creature park which you can access by be Brooklyn banks that's just like indoor 2-story park which is kind of like an old abandoned warehouse here there's some really cool spots inside they also just released a map of the Pyramid ledges which is just outside the Chatham towers map this is a very famous skate spot in real life there's also the famous Les Coleman park which is also pretty famous recently added as well this is pretty much unlike the other side of the map some of the things that touch on is you have your own apartment for watching like replays customizing your forward and skater there's also an in-game item dropper for putting down your own rails ramps kickers tables lights there's probably like 20 or so different items you can just place in-game and really even like create your own spot if you want and this is cool cuz like in real life if it's getting dark out and you want to film you can bring your spotlights set them up and scape it's only twenty dollars on Steam also just got released on Xbox early access or early preview whatever they call it highly recommend it love in this game alright guys
