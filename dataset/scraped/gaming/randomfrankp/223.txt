what's up guys I'm random Frank P and you're watching Disney Channel welcome back to episode 208 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas inspirations for your own set up in this work from home quarantine edition if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out let's kick it off 208 first we have a really nice triple monitor setup going in with a very deep purple kind of feel all around with the RGB lights behind the desk RGB in the PC the color for wallpaper purple for days so checking it out for those three monitors they're all the same model and they're Alienware 34 inch ultra wide that's a lot of screen real estate as for the peripherals we have a key cult number one this is a really nice custom build got gmk laser key caps and gather on Inc switches inside along with the logitech g502 Lightspeed mouse on a desk pad from Dixie men real nice trio going on here over to the PC inside the Intel I nine 900k CPU with ends XE Kraken X 62 ai yo 32 gigs of g.skill tried NZ r gb ram an ASUS Maximus 11 code motherboard with an asus strix RT x 28 e TI graphics card all inside the ever so the lovely fantex evolve x case i'm partial to it personally looking really nice though a real clean build again all purple and I love that kind of concrete brick look he has to the actual wall complements the floors really nicely you can see it's not like just wallpaper it actually has that depth and texture to it just giving the setup that you know extra oomph of goodness I don't know that was dumb massive l-shaped desk a little workstation off to the side one two three KS m starting us off strong here really nice stuff flipping gears we have Logan D with a really cool bedroom set up and what he did here believe with that wall off to the right side you can see all those like the lines and stuff it's probably just tape masked off to give a really cool kind of I'll cut look making it all like geometric and stuff then Dean Annalee for our light panels there lots of blue going on so check it it out who's got the stacked orientation both of those displays are an LG 34 inch ultra wide and a really good job with the clean mounting because I believe these you're on a monitor bracket so not mapped to the wall which is then hidden behind that display there which is just I believe the echo show five down to the peripherals really nice clean desk here gonna kind of complement the white keyboard which is the Razer BlackWidow X chroma keyer Edition going along with his razor basilisk mouse on the eraser Firefly mouse pad and then for audio he has the Astro 850 Wireless which he can use to switch between also console gaming and here at his PC death setup over to that PC also a really nice and clean white build really makes everything inside pop as well we have an Intel i7 6700 K CPU with the coarser h1 15i pro a i/o 16 gigs of course revengeance lpx ram in white on an Asus sabertooth z1 70s motherboard with a gigabyte gigabyte with a gigabyte GTX 1080i graphics card that has the NZXT Kraken g2 phone bracket which is then cooled but the coarser age 55 GPU cooler in a nice custom backplate all inside the corsair Carbide 275 case I love all white PC builds it's a shame that not enough companies put out white hardware and then right across the room behind his setup he has a mounted 43 inch LG 4k TV she can use for console gaming and stuff we're up to the right side there you can see the closet which she has all of his consoles there inside then routed through the wall so it has a nice seamless floating 0 cables look to it so a good idea on that but altogether yes a really cool gaming bedroom everything comes together really nicely then at night time flip on the RGB and the room comes alive really good stuff here from Logan D next we have Melo and this is one I was contemplating saving for a clean and minimal addition but we haven't had a lot of clean and minimal submissions lately so if you have a clean and minimal nice and classy setup let me know so checking it out on that nice long wooden desk as an LG 34 inch ultra wide and as you can see by the wallpaper and some things coming up big on photography guy here he works as a software engineer and does photography on the side as a hobby and you can tell cuz these pictures looking real nice now this entire work setup is ran off of a 20-18 Mac Mini which is hooked up to a Blackmagic a GPU which inside there has a Radeon Pro 580 which has eight gigs of VRAM and I'm sure in this case the external graphics card is gonna do him wonders for editing and stuff like that for the rest of his peripherals his keyboard is the ducky 1/2 RGB with cherry brown switches and opting to go the Ogier out with Logitech MX master mouse and one thing I like here you can see with the RGB light strip behind the desk and behind the monitor glowing red it matches the red RGB lights in the ducky keyboard so it's all about that coordination the little things that make your setup stand out and in terms of audio he has he sent hyzer HD 800 s headphones powered by the cord mojo amp and back this is a killer combo and then for a quick glimpse on the other spots of the room I love the minimal shelf setup here with the camera the lenses the books it really looks nice and something there's something to be said about a minimal shelf I know it sounds stupid but when you you decorate it nice it stands out even more some other little things to point out I love the addition of the tripod lamp you know it kind of fits the photography theme you got going on subtly those angled sound foam panels on the wall look really unique got a nice Herman Miller air on share a guitar mounted on the wall it all just looks really good man now we got Nick 1010 or Nick 1010 or Nick one zero one zero however you want to say it and you guys know when there's plants especially in abundance of plants all that green count me in it just adds so much to a set up it's so easy but I'm sure taking care of these are not easy but it doesn't matter cuz it looks really really nice so for the actual setup itself with those monitors I love the spanned wallpaper really nice purples oranges and blues complements the salt lamp plus the RGB light strip behind the monitors his primary is an LG 34 inch ultra wide with the vertical one on the right side being a 29 inch from gee now checking out the main peripherals it's a Logitech G 613 keyboard with the logitech g930 and that little display in the middle is actually I've had mini to kind of acting as like a third screen a touchscreen there play music check social all that kind of stuff I dig it and then for audio he has the Logitech c6 23 speakers with the Sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones hanging off the side of his desk moving on down to the PC inside we have an AMD risin 3700 X CPU with an N ZX e Kraken X 62 a IO 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws ram on asus rog streck's be 450f motherboard with an EVGA gtx 1070 TI superclocked graphics card inside the NZXT eh 500 case and you can see underneath the standing desk great job of cable management there have it all cut out nice and tidy and ratted through that like cable spine hanging down so Nick big high five man absolutely loving this massive window there all that natural lighting great for the plants great for the setup great for us and then last but obviously not least nothing is least on this setup show we have Dan with a really cool double setup going on one is his one is his wife's and we're gonna focus primarily on his which is the one off to the left side with these stacked monitors and that DIY fan kind of display up top which looks pretty cool nice piece of decor for the two displays his primary is an AOC 32 inch 144 Hertz monitor with the mounted overhead being amount of price 27 inch absolutely loving the custom wallpaper there span obviously and probably controlled something like rain meter so you can make it custom and different like that so really great job kind of even still matching that to the overall look of the setup and then down for the peripherals we have a Corsair k-50 7 RGB keyboard with the corsair dark or RGB mouse on there mm 800 polaris RGB mouse pad and for audio you could see on the headphone stand we have the status audio ob1 headphones and for his speakers they are the Logitech Z's 623 yet again but now we'll check out that PC over on the right side of the desk this is the Leon Lee alpha 5 50x case inside the risin 7 1,700 CPU with the deep cool cast in 240 X RGB AIO 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance RGB program with the asus rog Strix x4 7tf motherboard losing that voice and then vertically mounted is EVGA gtx 1080 FTW 2 graphics card then all the RGB is matching to that blue green and yellow kind of look to go along with the entire look of the setup and like I said before glimpse at his wife set off off to the right side of the room nice and simple mainly for our light panels but again a nice custom wallpaper really nice looking PC great stuff from boëthius alright guys that'll wrap it up for episode 208 of room tour
