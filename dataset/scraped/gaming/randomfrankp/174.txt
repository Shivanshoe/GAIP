so when you think of future technology one of the things i'm most looking forward to and i'm sure a lot of you can agree is when everything is wireless we don't need cables anymore to transmit power so for example i don't have to plug in my ps6 to the wall to transmit power need to charge up your wireless headphones no worries just set it down you have a wireless mouse that died don't need to plug it in just set it down it'll all charge wirelessly what if i told you that's not as far away as we think and this little guy the power spot could do that well i'd be wrong i'd be lying because this little [ __ ] bag is a step in the right direction but at the same time it's a complete failure but it has me excited so meet the power spot from power cast and their wireless charging grip for the nintendo switch these two coupled together will let you wirelessly charge and power your joy cons but their main mission is to not just stop at joy cons to power most of your peripherals and technology so the power spot transmitter is the first step at wireless power pretty much so taking a look at it it's relatively simple and compact it's a little rectangle very lightweight all plastic and this is what's going to be able to transmit power over the air right in front of you so it does all start with the power cast here you do have to plug this into the wall ironically to power this to be able to transmit the wireless power but first i want to show you the principle around this and how it works so they did an interview a few years ago and they pretty much they use these little popsicle sticks with led lights on them and the closer it would get to the actual power spot itself the brighter the light would be the farther away the duller the light would become and that's just a visual example of showing you that the wireless force field of power pretty much and how it works in terms of proximity so in our real world use with their current lineup you have this plugged in powered on then you connect joy cons to their little wireless charging grip in theory you place this down and now wirelessly your joy cons will charge up but that's not really what we're getting well it is but not how they promised so they say up to a foot away you could set this down and the joy cons will charge wirelessly but it's more like two inches okay so two inches in proximity that's where you're gonna get the best charge as you can see noted by the blinking green led light that lets you know it's the most optimal charging situation right there and the farther away you get you'll see it starts to turn yellow that's like you know hey it's not really working too well bring it back a little bit closer and then once it's in the red zone that's pretty much like zero power this thing is not gonna charge your device optimally at all and it cuts out at like seven inches which is definitely not a foot so they say you can charge your devices wirelessly within a foot of this but that's not the case realistically it's two inches with that power distance is optimal and what i absolutely love about this okay full sarcasm i don't love this on the back of the actual grip take a look at the power switch it's embedded into the whole thing you need to get tweezers to turn this on and off who thought that was a good idea so that's definitely annoying that's not the only real gripe i have about this so for example when your joy cons are dead these take three hours to charge if you just actually you know plug them in and charge them that's not the story when it comes to wireless power though now as you can see i had the joy cons on the grip right up against the power spot itself and by that clock this is a time lapse way over three hours try four and a half hours before i came down and finally gave up and stopped filming because it was still charging and who knows how long after that it would have continued charging for and i'm asking who knows because i don't because there's no real way to have a charging indicator of what percentage we're at once this just blinks green once a minute or so to let you know it's still charging okay when it's done it'll settle double blink green but there's no way to tell unless you download their app and then maybe you'll be able to see what percentage it's at if you're in the range of this i'm not downloading an app on my phone to see the status of my wireless joy cons being transmitted in this proximity here speaking of proximity they say very clearly in the manual do not operate within 20 centimeters of this to your body because you know it's not really healthy that's 7 inches they don't want you getting within seven inches of this because whatever you know not radiation but just the frequencies or maybe it is radiation i don't know but it's really not tested or deemed safe within 20 centimeters so okay um what's the redeeming quality here well in the interview i mentioned earlier they said that this will come out for 50 dollars and then you know they would extend what this is compatible with like i mentioned before with like headphones and stuff possibly even your wireless gaming mice anything like that maybe there'll be adapters for you plug it in and now you can charge these things wirelessly for 50 bucks that's pretty good but no 150 three times the price they initially said and it charges way slower than just plugging in you know wired and that makes sense sure but if it's within just that two inches what's the point what's the point of having something this close to each other when i could just plug it in and get it charged in half the time i don't really get it i don't get it now i don't know if they're going to be watching this you know i i bought this from amazon i don't have a sponsorship or whatever you conspiracy theorists out there might think i don't work with power spots uh so or i'm sorry power cast this is the power spot so i bought this on amazon want to try it out and it's a very poor product that does not really do what it says but like i said it's possibly a step in the right direction now i don't come on this youtube channel and take a [ __ ] on a lot of products very often but when i come across something that you know is positive and has me excited in which this did i definitely wanted to check it out because like i said that is the future all wireless everything worrying about cables will be a thing of the past so the fact that we have something kind of like that out there right now shows that maybe it's not that far away than we might think or hope but this isn't cutting it this isn't getting it done especially at three times the cost of their initial price so yeah all right guys that's a bit of a different video for you right hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out maybe don't i'll put a link for you in the description down below i'm random frank p hope you enjoyed have a good day
