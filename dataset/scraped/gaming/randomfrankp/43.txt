okay xbox just had their 20th year anniversary where they released these pretty cool peripherals in this special edition xbox controller and a headset definitely looks really nice the transparent shell however on the actual box itself is actually an easter egg that you can't see unless you have some sort of you know black light or uv lighting so i'm gonna kill the lights real quick and now on the box you can see pretty much a shout out to the original xbox controller with the duke controller sort of hidden on the box again only visible with black lighting and you can just see how much bigger it was obviously not to scale but versus the controller size now and what the duke controller was back then pretty cool little easter egg on the box nothing hidden on the controller would've been pretty cool but again a little box easter egg for you guys not visible to the human eye at first
