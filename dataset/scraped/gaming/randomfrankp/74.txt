what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out my top favorite gaming keyboards under a hundred dollars to save you guys some money and they're not all brand new releases or anything these are some that i've had or picked up recently that i think are definitely worthy of the recommendation if you're trying to pick up a new gaming keyboard without breaking the bank if you see anything you like today i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below so you can check them out and just two quick things before we start this video off first instead of doing the sound test for each keyboard during their segment that'd be causing a lot of breaks and you know unnatural pauses during the video we're gonna save them all to the end lump them together back to back to back so you can hear how they sound and second every keyboard here is gonna be unmodded so you know what you're getting if you choose to pick it up stock out of the box so all unmodded unless noted otherwise for certain changes something like you know what i've done is just add custom coil cables to each of them just to make it you know look better but you can always pick one up and uh starting you know right off the bat why not we'll kick it off with the very budget-friendly techware spectre pro i love what techware is doing as a brand we showed off a few keyboards from them in the past you know the phantom the phantom l they just make really great budget friendly options that punch way above their price tag and the story is no different here with the spectre pro you can see it's got the full size layout some crazy rgb going on including underglow as well as the media dial on the top right hand side to adjust volume on the fly that might not seem like a big deal but for a budget keyboard like this that is a killer addition so for its full-size layout here you're gonna have that edition of the numpad on the right side i'm not a full-size keyboard guy at all but i understand a lot of people out there still are you need the numpad so here you go for the rgb you have the full offering the lettering on the keycaps is shine through there's 18 different effects built into the keyboard plus a custom mode if you want to kind of create your own effect and have all the colors be different for each key it's always tedious but if you want you can do it techware does offer software for this keyboard but i didn't even download it and you don't need it either which is good on the middle of the back is the usbc port it does come with their own braided cable but like i said in the intro you can always just add your own custom coil cable if you have one already you want to pick one up just to spice up the looks a little bit but at least it's usbc now popping off the keycaps you'll see the switch underneath here i have a temu red and they offer three switches for you attemu red brown and blue so the full linear clicky and tactile offering from atemu and this keyboard is hot swap meaning you can pop out a switch switch it up on the fly and sort of get your own configuration going on now the pcb is north facing and three pins that's where the compromises are being made and they're really only compatible with other atenu switches however you can get it to work with kale and cherry for example if you shave the pins but honestly not too you know worth it in the end it's a lot of trouble to go through to make it fit there's still a pretty decent offering of the time you switch this out that you can use for this but hey at least you have the option with the hotspot pcb so again underglow bunch of different rgb effects the full size layout usbc volume dial up top all great features found on just a 60 dollar keyboard so a really great price for this here like i said techware always killing it next up we have the gk61s so you might be familiar with the gk61 and these keyboards are super super popular because of the fact that it is 60 so it's a nice small compact mechanical keyboard for 60. so also very good pricing here and these gk61 and 61s keyboards are also popular for the fact that they're a great starter point for kind of getting into the whole custom keyboard community with 13 switches to pick from you can swap key caps on here take it apart you know mod the inside to improve the sound atom custom cable it's just a very beginner friendly keyboard like i said to start modding and customizing i've seen a lot of people with the gk61 you know buy a nice keycap set and boom looks completely different it is made by hk gaming i don't really like them ripping off a lot of creators keycap sets and being pompous about it that's a whole different story the keyboard here is good now what also i really like about the gk61 is just the options available like i said 13 different switches to pick from including optical switches some switches will vary in price for the keyboard overall but there's also six total keyboard colors to pick from you have black red white a lavender malibu which is the blue color that i have and a pink color so it's just catering to so many different people with all these different configurations you have a bunch of different rgb effects to pick from the characters on the keycaps are also shine through and there are sub legends printed on the keycaps because again it's a 60 layout so it's a lot smaller and for those extra keys that you don't have physically you can see where they are printed on the keycap for the extra functions in my unit here i have optical black switches and also it's a hotspot pcb so you could pop out the optical blacks and swap them out with other optical switches on the stock gk61 keyboard that isn't optical you can also pop out those keys and then use other ones as well now due to the all plastic construction it's definitely a hollow sounding keyboard overall you'll hear that during the sound test but again that gives you the chance to open it up mod it lube the stabilizers add some foam maybe very very beginner friendly prices do vary from 59 to 89 depending on the board color and the switch type the uh the malibu one that i have here at optical black switches was 80. you can get them out starting for 60. next up today we have the ajazz k620t keyboard nice and wireless still mechanical obviously highlighted by the volume wheel yet again and this interesting looking tray up top so coming in at 60 and wireless also gonna be very you know spacious friendly to your desktop no cables no clutter and it's also usbc if you want to use it wired or just to charge it again you have usbc but those two main physical features here the volume wheel and the built-in tray is what really piqued my interest the most and why i picked it up to begin with the tray can be used to hold your phone maybe a tablet so you can use it with that you know it's wireless hook up to an ipad have it right there in front of you or just use as a tray you know put in a pen maybe or a stylus a usb hold your crumbs maybe paper clips desktop things put it in there now the k620t is bluetooth so there's no proprietary dongle to use of that for the wireless connection but it can also pair to three different devices at once over bluetooth also like i said in addition to using this wired if you choose so use it on your pc or like i said before hook your ipad up to it connect it all wirelessly put it right there in the tray and now you have like a little mini computer in front of you kinda built into 19 different rgb lighting modes again there's 18 to pick from plus that additional customizable one where you can make your own layer with it being all white and some of the extra color keycaps they give you it does look really cool and it pops nicely with the colors they are using their own switches here i have the a jazz pink there's also a jazz blue pinks are linears blues are clicky now they also factory lubed their stabilizers which is good to see but i was also kind of confused because they don't really sound lubes even though physically they are there were so much variants that even picked up a second unit to confirm so again i'll do a full sound test later but the space bar here is a lot louder and more rattly the second unit i had definitely quieter with less rattle so again they are lubed you can take them apart polish it up a little bit i think though overall for a wireless mechanical keyboard with a little built-in tray plus the volume wheel up top it is worth the price of admission for just around 75 however it's tough to find them in stock because they're also making a second version so i don't know if they discontinue this they're just not making as many as quick but yeah 75 bucks right around there a good price for it for sure next for another wireless mechanical keyboard we have the kikron k2 and you're probably familiar with kikron they exploded onto the scene in 2019 and they have so many different models and sizes of keyboards out there this the really nice wireless and compact 75 layout you don't see too often because it is so compact like this you still have the arrow keys on the right side plus the f row up top now over at bluetooth 5.1 you'll see on the left side there's a button to actually toggle between mac os and windows or you know windows and android mac and ios so depending on your platform you can easily toggle between and they also give you additional keycaps inside the box so again if you're using it on mac you have keycaps for that windows appropriate keycaps for that and also as you saw usb c on the left side if you want you can also use this wired so in addition to the really compact form factor here i really like the looks of it you know it's nice and muted got that like two-tone gray color plus the orange accents you can also swap those out for gray keycaps as well they're still included for you i think it's just a really nice work from home keyboard you know nice and professional looking get work done during the day switch it over gaming at night now again with it being bluetooth 5.1 there's also no dongle included no proprietary wireless system and for those worried about bluetooth connectivity like i was at first usually with gaming there's some sort of lag or you know noticeable latency but i think it was like 25 milliseconds which is right on par and actually less than the ducky uh one two mini rgb so you're not gonna notice any significant lag to interrupt your gaming it does have built-in rgb effects some other models don't have rgb like i said they have so many different models out there uh this one however is also not hot swap but they also have a k6 version of this keyboard with different keycaps that is hot swap so key crown just has their bases covered all around inside here i have the gatoron reds so the model prices do vary typically from like 85 to 95 this one was just around 85 but like i said if you want the hot swap version also drop that down below for you as well because i just really like kikron and what they're doing here nice and clean compact mechanical keyboards work during the day gaming at night they got you so from clean and minimal to crazy rgb here with the warmer k87 uh you can take a look at this thing immediately and see this is pretty nuts frosted rgb there are five studio lights in front of me so it might be blown out but yes the k87 has you rgb lovers out there covered so the construction here is this transparent pmma glass you know it's gonna look similar to like a frosted acrylic you've seen out there you know probably like a tofu keyboard but this is the pmma glass and not only is each key backlit but there's also rgb leds underneath the keyboard surrounding it so with its pmma glass it gives it this crazy just like rgb diffusion in all 360. it looks nuts there's 18 total effects on board you're seeing a pattern here it's the typical effects you're going to see on all these budget-friendly gaming keyboards now due to its unique design much like acrylic keyboards not only is it going to look cool but it's going gonna play an effect on how the keyboard sounds i will say the pmma does give like a higher resonance thaki sound to your typing or gaming it's very very unique on the back right side you have usbc and yet again we have a hot swap pcb and this is five pin so you're pretty much gonna be covered on any switch type you wanna use here you can put it in swap it out mine unfortunately has browns i bought this well over a year ago and at the time only the gatorade brown option was in stock so that's what i'm stuck with here you may love browns they're not my favorite i did see they also have gather on red blue and yellow and like i said before i get this keyboard stock and unmodded but given just the rgb here in the diffusion imagine putting some like i don't know aqua king switches and some crystal crown keycaps on here the visuals is just gonna be absolutely crazy do what you want so this version here is the clear with the white keycaps they also sell a smoked dark phoenix version which has a darker pmma glass and also uses black pudding keycaps pricing for this is just around 85 dollars i think it's a steal the overall construction the looks the layouts the possibilities like i said five pin hotspot pcb a really rgb visual friendly looking keyboard and then last but not least is the fnatic mini streak and here they give you a really slim low profile body it's nice and rounded and compact visually looks really really nice i think so thrown into the mix with the tkl layout you'll see four extra buttons up top you have one next to the escape key on the top right you have three extra ones you can configure them in their software you know it's for like muting and stuff so while it's not visually the nicest placement so they are there in case you got to utilize them finance does also have software for this keyboard if you want to configure it change up some of the keys and rgb but like i said before i didn't download any software for this video keep it all stock and it's all configurable on the keyboard itself too which is good there is already eight rgb lighting modes built in keycaps are abs and they are prone to definitely you know showing fingerprints and oils and stuff like that but the shine through legends here are pretty bold overall so the rgb is going to go and glow pretty nicely upwards as well as on the back side this little fanatic badge now in terms of variations they do offer this in cherry red cherry brown and a kale speed silver switch which is the unit i have here i love speed switches nice and fast quick for gaming low actuation point so here they're nice and smooth nice and quick so for just around 90 dollars again nice and slim low profile overall really nice construction the one thing that kind of bothers me and uh just a little you know tip out there is the usbc port is embedded underneath on the back side here so if you are using a custom coil cable uh it's not gonna work out too well cause it's gotta bend and it won't fit in the channel so with this you're gonna be better off using the stock included usb-c cable uh so yeah worthy mentioning but again for just around what i say 90 bucks the price for this definitely good with those kale speed switches now we're going to do the sound test for all six keyboards little layer and back to back to back to back to back to back you know the routine and i'll throw up some like closing thoughts on the sounds of the keyboard uh during the sound test so you can get you know a better idea and general understanding of that switch and just what i think about how it sounds like i said everything here is stock all right guys so that'll wrap it up for this video on my top favorite gaming keyboards under a hundred dollars hope you all enjoyed like i said i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below in case
