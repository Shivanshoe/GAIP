what's up guys i'm random frank p hope you're all having a glorious day because today we're going to be reviewing the brand new glorious model o wireless gaming mouse get that lotion ready so if you're interested in picking it up we'll go through it all pros and cons talk about my experience in this review of the modelo wireless so first up this is the highly anticipated release after gloria shook up the mouse market in may of 2019 and now we have the wireless version of the popular model oh and the model launched at just 50 and guess what this is coming in at just 80 which is still half the price of the razer viper ultimate 20 dollars cheaper than the new steel series air ox 3. and g pro wireless is still over 100 and corsair apparently doesn't believe in lightweight mice so glorious coming in saving everyone's wallets with just an 80 price tag on this lightweight wireless mouse while still giving you different color options by the way you love to see it you really do also real quick inside the box is the wireless receiver in the extender module thankfully the usb dongle itself that plugs into your pc is nice and tiny and compact won't be popping out anywhere and as for that extender piece this is for maybe for pc isn't like right at your desk you can plug in the included usbc cable into the extender then plug the dongle into here so it has just better range or it's closer to you and yes just like i said the cable is usbc and it's their same lightweight ascended cord and if you put two and two together then that means yes the mass itself charges via usbc and the only slight odd thing here i'll say is the included cable has these prongs on the end to fit into the mouse better so it doesn't fall out while you're charging or using it and it's not proprietary or anything all the usbc cables i have around here still fit into the mouse with no problem uh but i will just point out that if you're using this you know wired while you're charging it i'd have to assume just the extra bits of plastic here is going to add an extra 2-3 grams onto the mouse and it's not a big deal at all obviously but i didn't want to point it out because i just don't know if this extra plastic is entirely necessary and taking a look at it the shell shape and design is obviously going to be identical to the wired modelo and the only real issues people had in the past was with their cable so in theory since you're going wireless now you won't have to worry about that but gloria still gives you the option to pick it up in either black or white colors we said the glossy variants will come later on down the line and for physical features you still have the six programmable buttons the embedded rgb light strip and here for comparison's sake on the white model i have their ceramic g-floats then on the black model is their stock g skates and as you'd expect giving the lightweight ambidextrous mouse that lightweight form factor is with the honeycomb cutouts bringing it between 70 grams and 68 grams on my scale so safe to say 69 grams as they advertise is spot on and this still is really impressive considering the wired monologue is 67 grams so just adding two more onto it with the wireless technology inside is awesome to see i know with the cutouts you either absolutely just despise it or it doesn't bother you but glorious does now sell skins to cover up the mouse if you just can't visually take it but again guys this is why it's lightweight in terms of dimensions it's 26 millimeters from the front to the scroll wheel stands 37 and a half millimeters tall at its highest point and is 128 millimeters long it's then 59 millimeters wide at the middle with and 66 millimeters at the widest point four tips so it's not small i'd say definitely on the medium to larger side of a mouse and visually here it is at the left next to the wired model o then you have the razer viper ultimate the model o minus and then all the way to the right is the steelseries airox 3. so as you can see it is the larger model out of all these granted the model o next to it is the same size obviously then the model the wireless doesn't have a wireless version yet but i figured you can just see how it stacks up with the other two lightweight wireless mice out there right now and actually it's lighter than the 74 gram viper ultimate and the air ox 3 is 66 grams so yeah the model o is 3 grams heavier here but it's also 20 lighter flipping her belly up is the power button and the dpi led indicator and their very own banff sensor which was up to 19 000 dpi and i don't know if they created this from the ground up or if it's some iteration of a pixar model but i'm digging the name and they said it's designed for low power consumption and obviously you're not sacrificing performance at all because it's still a thousand hertz polling rate 400 ips tracking and the 19 000 dpi like i said for the switches i haven't seen anything regarding any changes so i assume it's the same switches from their previous model oh i'll do a sound test now so you can hear how it all sounds now for battery life they have it rated for 71 hours of gaming with no rgb enabled and that's definitely impressive i'd say out of the box it does come preset with rgb at 50 brightness with their glorious mode sort of rainbow wave going on and you can save some life if you keep the brightness at like 20 or so if you absolutely need rgb but there's just no reason to keep it at 100 and right now it's tough to get a fully accurate reading of how long the battery lasts with full rgb lighting uh because there's actually no percentage in the software to show you the battery life they had just a little battery icon with these five bars to show you the remaining life of it and it didn't actually even tell me what the percentage was until it got down to like three percent then it gave me a warning but i did reach out to them they said the percentage will be added in the future uh this is still an early version of their software so happy to hear that but i'd also like the percentage to be available in the entire software and all the tabs and not just on the main dashboard but for me over the course of my day filming some b-roll with rgb on at 100 brightness it did drain a single bar in about three hours so that's looking like an estimated 15 hours of full rgb but again not worth the sacrifice at all improve the battery life turn the brightness down and i charged it for 30 minutes and i got full battery life so that's good to see so when it arrived in and i had some time to game putting it to the test admittedly you know i felt at home because i'm so used to the model o i've used that a lot in the past so obviously the shape is going to feel very familiar i didn't have any hiccups transitioning to the wireless version so that's good to see and absolutely no issues whatsoever in terms of lag or latency nothing like that no interruptions and like i showed you before with the two different variants of their g skates and g floats i switched them up i used both and i also used them on different mouse pad surfaces primarily i used it with their brand new ice mouse pad i'll show you that more in detail tomorrow so be on the lookout for that video but i can tell you both feel very very smooth whether it is their ceramic feet or their stock g skates and primarily using it on my fanatic dash mouse pad it was just very very smooth again no issues whatsoever i think the big thing for me like when it came to just you know using this mouse again after then using the viper ultimate for the past like what eight months or whatever it is now setting it to 500 dpi in a game like battlefield which you guys know i primarily play for these like benchmarking videos and uh gaming mice reviews it's kind of my go-to you know how it is by now it just felt very precise and accurate to the point where like you can see in some of these shots like the enemies in the distance are just a pixel if that so the fact that i can identify it quickly go and shoot him in the face is a good sign while it's still not the lightest lightweight mouse that i've tried uh the shape feels good i have no issues with it the ambi design feels nice in my hands and i just really have nothing to complain about when it came to gaming even for instances in the game where i'm not sniping so instead of those you know slower controlled shots if i'm on the ground with different recoil for certain guns it all still felt just very very accurate got that pinpoint precision and in the end that's what you want that's what you expect from your wireless lightweight mouse and before we wrap it up we can talk about their new core software like i said before the like main dashboard there is the only place you can see your battery so i want that to be you know extended to all the tabs for the lighting tab this is where you can obviously go in and change up their preset lighting effects as well as changing the speed of the effect as well as the brightness but remember don't keep it at 100 the next up is key bindings we can go in and reprogram all six of the programmable buttons you can see on the right side you can change it to a key press or a mouse press change it to shift to a dpi create macro set them as multimedia keys all that stuff then for the performance tab that's where you can go in and change up your dpi and then set those stages in different leds for the indicator on the bottom of the mouse again all the way up to 19 000 you can also adjust the liftoff distance the bounce time and the polling right here but all things considered pretty clean and simple software so wrapping it up when you take a look at the overall package here for 79.99 it's honestly very hard to be cynical or find you know flaws about it great sensor great battery life great overall shape and weight at that price and in terms of the design again i know people don't really like the honeycomb cutouts but in terms of like stability and stuff there's no creaking no flexing anywhere it's just extremely hard to be cynical about a great wireless lightweight mouse like this um i i don't know what to say other than the fact that this is probably gonna be one of the top selling mice throughout the next year or so and i honestly cannot look at this and pinpoint a single you know negative thing about it again everyone's preference is going to be different whether you like the cutouts or not whether an ambi mouse is the right shape for you and your hand or your hand size the only real thing i could possibly think of is that it would have been nice them to include uh these skins already inside the box for you so you could cover up the holes if you want but again that's not really much of a con it's a great mouse glorious absolutely killing it again for just 79.99 man they're uh they're winning 2020 for sure for sure so if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below and like i said be look out tomorrow for the their elements desk pads i'll be going through giving like a first look and first impressions of those so
