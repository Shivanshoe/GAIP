[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out my favorite peripherals that i use at my setup for everything youtube related video editing streaming gaming all that stuff we're gonna cover it all for you guys mouse keyboard mouse pad audio even like a secondary peripheral for a controller so if you see anything you like today i have it all listed for you in the description down below so you guys can check it out but we'll kick it off now what's my main loadout now first visually when it comes to aesthetics i'm definitely sticking to more of like a midnight green theme because i'm a big eagles fan that's their colorway and it's been the color that i try to integrate with the channel that also means no midnight green is not teal no i'm not copying dave2d content creators don't own a color stay in school now with that out of the way let's jump right into the newest addition here with the ghost airox 3 wireless from steelseries this has a few changes versus the original aerox 3 that came out last year including pure ptfe feet now and a nice clear transparent shell hence the ghost naming to it visually i'm loving it the rgb shines through really nicely as well looks really cool i think design wise it's that symmetrical and b shape i would say on the smaller to medium side but it comes in at just 66 grams so definitely still lightweight now one of the changes i made to this which completely changes the mouse is yes like i said we do have their new ptfe feet underneath but i put on a pair of lexip ceramic feet now this thing has a crazy buttery smooth glide it's just slightly more elevated now i know some people have issues with like liftoff distance and stuff but for me the feet fix all problems now this is just a killer combo i am loving it now as a content creator i go through tons of different gaming mice i mean the viper ultimate for like two years i mean the prime wireless for a while the starlight 12 but now i am just like i said loving this combo of the ghost airox 3 wireless real quick we'll keep it here with the mouse pad this another new addition to the setup recently and that's the newer razer schreider this is a really nice hybrid mouse pad it has an evenly braided x and y axis to the surface so no matter what direction you're going in up down left right figure eights whatever it's gonna be buttery smooth and again the combo with these lexip ceramic feet is killer another really cool thing about the strider is it is super water resistant and water repellent i literally like dumped water on here left it for over two hours and it barely absorbed anything at all the repellency here is very very impressive and it's also moisture repellent as well so if you live in a more humid climate and stuff this won't get like damp and sticky i do have it in the extended version which is the extra extra l size i still believe it comes in under 50 dollars so value-wise very very good and it's often compared to the artisanahian mousepad which is also held in pretty high regards so the razer strider right now my main mousepad now moving on over to one of the more important aspects of a setup the keyboard this the steelseries apex pro tkl i've had this since january i want to say maybe even back to december and it is awesome i've definitely customized it since i put on like different sets of keycaps these i believe are like a tai hao deep forest green key cap set that i put on some of the modifier keys again just to fit into that midnight green color way also get a nice little matching artisan as well but in terms of form factor i much prefer the tkl size over a full size keyboard obviously because i don't really need a num pad for me so i like the smaller footprint and it just has you know what i need it's the it's the essentials i hate numpads don't need it tkl for the win but there's also a few other things that it has that for me just makes it worthy of being my main one very important one is a usb passthrough on the back side this is great because of all the things that i'm testing and plugging in on the desktop having a usb passthrough here is clutch whether it's like a different macro pad or some sort of desktop accessory i can just plug it in here without having to go back to my pc and plug it in behind there and then route it here i can just tuck it right in under the keyboard and be good to go you're probably wondering why i have a coil cable wrapped around the stock cable and that's because yet again it's just a way for me to plug in other hardware other peripherals if i need to that's plugged into my pc i keep the usb c side underneath the keyboard so i can just pull it out plug in something and it's all kept nice and tidy it also gives it more of that custom look hiding the stock thick rubber cable inside the coil i think it looks better but when it comes to gaming these have their omnipoint switches which are very very fast and adjustable they're really interesting these can be adjusted from 0.4 millimeters all the way up to 3.6 millimeters for the actuation point so if you think about it 0.4 millimeters you're just like barely touching the key and it'll actuate it'll register it makes gaming lightning fast with this your your input your keystrokes immediately being registered it's also all adjustable on the fly on the right side the little oled screen you have a little dial there as well so you can adjust things like volume go through create macros on the fly go in and even like you know change up your color settings your rgb lighting profiles all configurable all right here you can do things like have gifs displayed the little oled screen with a little dial is definitely pretty cool and like i said for all the things that i'm using it for these certain factors that other keyboards don't have makes it the main reason why it's my go to keyboard now a question i always get is random frank p you've built numerous high-end custom keyboards so why do you use a pre-built gaming keyboard i just mentioned it to you guys the pass-through is great the oled and on-the-fly media adjustment is awesome adjustable switches for gaming awesome all things you can't find and really do on a custom keyboard also when i'm making these custom keyboards they're really like a nice display piece that i still do use in other aspects and think of it as this someone who plays guitar and collects guitars they don't use them all at once right some of them are just for display some of them are for you know collection and stuff you're not going to use all your guitars at once same applies to keyboards so because i have you know more than a few customs doesn't mean i'm going to use them all at the same time and the last little accent piece here for the apex pro tkl is this wooden resin wrist rest that i got from novelties this is a really nice color matching like deep green to go along with the keycaps and the rgb lights that i have just static in the keyboard again just visually it ties it all together now when it comes to audio my go-to pair of headphones has been the sennheiser hd 800s i bought these in 2019 and they've always been like my personal holy grail headphones because they are just outrageous these are definitely more of a high-end luxury pair of headphones no doubt about it they feature massive 56 millimeter drivers and the fact that they're open back is really what sold me i've talked about it numerous times i love open-back headphones because when it comes to gaming they are just so much more immersive and that's the biggest thing with hd800s is like when i'm playing battlefield and stuff you are literally in the middle of the battlefield it doesn't really feel like you're wearing headphones well it does with these they're kind of you know bulkyish but the audio is all around you the soundstage is crazy and i'll admit they're not the most comfortable they're very harsh in terms of sibilance and like high-end frequencies with treble so there are some things i definitely don't like about these headphones but again just the overall sound the feeling the immersion this really does provide it's what makes them in the end my personal favorite and i mean come on they look pretty crazy too right and then lastly is a secondary peripheral from my go to controller because not every game can really you know take advantage of a mouse and keyboard a bunch of racing games are just easier with controller i like to play a lot of skateboarding games so like skater xl in session all better to be played with a controller obviously and that is my custom ps5 controller from hex gaming this one is really unique because it has a sort of color shifting chameleon paint to it so it's like a green like a purple color shift on the back you have really nice like grippy textured paddles on the side and also you'll see right here these are extra you know triggers in the back extra inputs so i showed off a different custom ps5 controller that i got from colorware but this one from hex gaming does have those extra gaming features it's the same dual sense ps5 controller but just you know heavily modified and customized so again that color shifting chameleon shell i think looks really nice in the direct light it's mainly green and on the shadows and stuff when you look around it that's when that purple starts to kick in thumb sticks are swappable they have convex concave different heights and stuff on the back side of left and right paddles it has this really nice grippy texture to it just feels great in the hand hey now by the way does this shot creep anybody out but i really dig those extra remappable triggers you get on the backside having those extra inputs is always great on a controller and again it's wireless i've seen this done on other controllers but it's wired so here you get all the customization plus it's still wireless i know i glossed over it pretty quick because again it's a secondary peripheral i don't use it too much you could check it on their website and configure your own a bunch of different customization options but i'll talk about this more in a future video once we get to the holidays about you know some of the best controllers out there for 2021 but yes hex gaming really good job here at the customization and the look and i want to hear from you guys if you're still watching drop a comment down below and tell me what your current peripherals are and guys that'll wrap it up for my go to
