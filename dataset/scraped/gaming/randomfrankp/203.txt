what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be reviewing the brand new Elgato wavelength one and wavelength three USB microphones just hit the market so if you're interested in picking up a new mic for you know voice over streaming gaming anything like that got you guys covered today we'll do a mic test for both of them take a deep dive into the software which is very very important and run over all the stuff you're gonna want to know in case you're thinking of picking these up so these have been teased by Elgato for a few months now they've definitely built some hype I'd say so I'm pumped they're finally here so once you get it in and unbox the mic itself is actually very simple and pretty small looking overall I'd say it's compact you know not gonna take up too much space on your desktop now since the one-in-three have different physical features to the actual mic itself well take a look at each one so starting with the one you had that nice sleek all-black body with just a volume dial on the front and once you plug it in with the included USB sea cable that little ring will illuminate and what this dial does does not actually control the overall volume of your mic but it adjust the actual headphone output so on the back of both mics you have like I said the USB C port which is powered to your PC and then next to that you have a headphone jack so you can plug in headphones and monitor your audio so that's that volume dial is going to control there with the actual audio you're listening to and also if you want to mute your mic you just press in that dial so now that you know that we can check out the wavelength 3 which does have some increased physical features to the mic so you'll notice a few things on the front you'll have the microphone logo a headphone logo and then kind of like a mixed logo these will let you switch up the actual microphone output volume the headphone volume and the audio mix you'll notice seven led dots underneath those and when you press in the actual dial that's how you can go to change all three of those sources if you will so if I want to change up my microphone output volume I could do that if I want to change then the audio but I'm listening to if I'm monitoring with headphones you press in the dial adjust that accordingly and then for the third one if you want to adjust the mix of your real-time PC audio and your monitoring audio you can do that then additionally on top of the microphone you have a touch sensitive mute button they each come included on there mic stand but each of them come with an adapter so if you want you can take them off this included desktop stand and use them on a larger threat if you have your own boom arm or a mic arm anything like that before we move on we'll talk about the actual microphone itself it's the same capsule used in both the one and the three and it's a 17 millimeter electric mic it is also cardioid so it's designed to pick up your vocal pattern while talking primarily into the front of it not so much picking up what's going on behind it okay so now we're gonna head back to the PC and do an in-depth mic test make sure you're wearing headphones you could hear this obviously be clearest and it's gonna be all raw unedited audio okay so like I said make sure you're wearing headphones you could hear exactly how this microphone sounds this whole test is gonna be unedited but there's a lot to go over here so sit tight because usually during a review the actual you know software is the least important most boring aspect of the actual review but in this case with the microphone the wavelength software is equally as important to the wavelength mic so a lot to touch on be patient you're gonna want to pay attention three quick things before we get into the actual test so the mic I'm using right now is the wavelength 3 I will do a comparison between the 3 and the one after this demo as you can see I have the wavelength 3 on my own desktop arm the wavelength 1 is on the included sand that these both come with using the included adapter I had this on my own arm and then point three is my headphones terminate and a quarter inch jack so I am using this with my own amp and DAC for my own streaming setup and my own sort of setup at my desk so as you can see it is not plugged into the actual microphone but everything can still be controlled in the wavelength program if you will get into in a second so right now for this sound test I have it at around 20% on the little LED indicator here it's on the second LED and this is where I think between probably two and three it sounds the best and just real quick doing some typing clicking you know kind of emulating that gaming ambiance if you will with hearing this in the background and yeah it's still gonna pick it up you're still gonna hear that because just due to proximity the nature of where this is and all my peripherals on my desk it's very close it's all bunched together right here so you're still gonna pick it up even though it's a cardioid mic picking up my vocal pattern primarily right here just again due to the space on the desktop is you're so gonna hear that now I have it bumps to around half so this is the fourth LED light on here half volume and as you heard it did get louder I'd say significantly louder and it's not to the point where it's gonna be clipping yet just checking the settings right now it's coming in at around negative 6 decibels which isn't that bad at all however they have something built in called clip guard so now I have it at a hundred percent and as you could hear it's loud it's very loud but it's not to the point where it's unusable ok usually when you're at a hundred percent and it'll be clipping and stuff there would be a lot of distortion a lot of it would just kill them like it would sound like fuzzy radio but here at 100 percent it's still usable and with clip guard if I was gaming streaming and putting on a show for my audience if I was getting roping this off someone's hacking midstream their stream sniping that was so usable it wasn't unsalvageable ok so very loud not the best but not to the point where it's gonna be just horrible again I wouldn't use it up in there I'm keeping you at around 20 to 30% volume which is where I think it sounds the best but even if you do have it all the way up you're not that you're not gonna have to worry about peaking and clipping to the point where it's gonna be too distorted for your audience now the more important aspect I'm gonna say that is wavelength the actual software you have to have a wavelength mic to use with the wavelength program so you cannot use your own mic with wavelength okay so what wavelength does is it gives you independent audio sources you can then channel into your monitor mix is what you hear but then also in so a separate stream or a separate channel called stream mix which is what the audience hears and for example I'll show you a demo real time but say I want to listen to some music while I was gaming but obviously due to copyright on like twitch and YouTube you can't listen to you know just mainstream music if I wanted to listen to that but I wanted to play something more stream friendly for you guys I can listen to what I want to listen to but play something different for you that you would hear that I wouldn't so you wouldn't hear my music I would I wouldn't hear your music but you would with wavelength you have completely different audio channels that you can then source into different channels so take a look real quick right here this headphone icon is the monitor mix what I'm hearing this sort of stream mix icon which is for this channel down here is what you're hearing you can change that up for each source so this is the microphone and what I'm doing right now for this setup I am recording independently so you're just gonna be hearing the mic you're not gonna be hearing the Sri mix but I'll still show you the levels and stuff real time so like I said for example right now I'm in Spotify I have music pop and I'm bumping some ace right now you can't hear that though okay but if I wanted to kind of link Spotify to what the stream would hear I would go over to this which is the music you click this button right here which is what's gonna let you tie all of your outputs to the wavelength sort of you know stuff in here so Spotify right here this output right now is default but I'm gonna change that where to go I'm gonna change that to wavelength music okay so now I'm gonna hit play again and you can see music is going you say I'll stop talking but you could still see the actual audio levels on the music channel is still going so usually if this was recording the actual stream mixed you would hear this but what I can do is I can turn that all the way down to the point where the stream wouldn't hear but I still would and then vice versa so I want to switch that up where I didn't hear it but you guys did I could do that but again I'm not doing that for the sake of this you're hearing a different just the mic channel same thing goes for browser say you wanted to watch a YouTube video in the background or whatever just on your internet browser you go to the the sound settings here I'm using Chrome's I would link then chrome to wavelength browser I'm gonna go over play my video you can see the audio browser it's all going you guys can't hear it I can boom boom boom you have all that flexibility now to change up all of the different audio channels and mix them into separate channels of what I'm hearing versus what you're hearing so again music going you guys can't hear it I can if I didn't want you to hear I would turn that down if I want you to hear that I turn that down if you're playing a game you would then link that game to the game sort of setting right here for this input in the wavelength all independent sources all independent channels and this is huge this is gonna make people's lives so much easier now because you can do it all with just one program and this is gonna be a streamers best friend promise you that and then whether I wanted to tell her this into OBS a different sort of streaming software or whatever all you do then is go into the settings go into audio here and then it's not gonna be your desktop audio your desktop audio is gonna be you can just you know decide whether you want to be your stock desktop audio or those independent sources but to get that stream output like you see in the wavelength settings you would go into your mic and then click right here where it says wavelength stream so the audio coming from now we can play some music play the background that is all gonna get mixed into one channel that I have the ability to change up and mix and right here as you could see this little green icon means I'm hearing the monitor mix if I want to change that to the stream I would be hearing what the stream is hearing so you have very expansive software that lets you change everything up give you independent sources for literally everything and that is awesome now we're gonna switch gears and do the mic test between the wavelength 3 and the wavelength 1 ok so now is the sound test and a comparison between the wavelength and the wave link one now they are the same exact capsule so the same actual microphone the main difference here between the two physical microphones not the construction is that the three is capable of a 96 thousand Hertz sample rate while the wavelength one is just capable of 48,000 so you pretty much get double the sample right here and I looked it up there is a pretty hot debate going on on whether it's even worth 96 thousand over 48 48 the standard can you hear a difference between the two the untrained ear probably not in a stream setting where you know there's a lot of other channels and as you saw audio sources that sample rate might not be a big deal that's gonna be more important with things like podcasting and stuff where you can go in and then edit that sound quality to enhance it take out background noise but just these actual mic quality itself this is the one versus the three again you as you hear flipping back and forth to me they really don't sound different at all and one thing to note which is pretty interesting is that OBS doesn't even have 60 96 thousand Hertz as an option OBS is limited to just 48,000 so you can't even really take advantage of that 96 thousand Hertz with the 3 in OBS so yeah figured I'd point that out but again still do a comparison between the two mics alright so as you heard right there with the mic test and yes you heard properly after listening back I did kind of mix wave link with wave length a few times because my brains just more used to saying wavelength versus wavelength so I kind of combined them but yeah either way the wavelength software very awesome very user-friendly and gives you just a tons of flexibility so that's gonna be a streamers best friend telling you right there and also as you heard between the 1 and the 3 the sound quality really wasn't too different at all and for the raw unedited audio they pretty much sound identical for the part and with the only real difference between the two being at they one is a forty-eight thousand Hertz sample rate and the wavelength three is ninety six thousand so it's double but at the same time like I showed you OBS can't even take ninety six thousand as an input it's only capable of forty eight thousand so it's gonna be up to you whether you're going to one spend the extra thirty dollars for the three for that double sample rate because the wavelength one comes in at 130 and your wavelength three is 160 and yes well you do get more you know controls and stuff like that with the three honestly with how impressively software is and the fact that I would be using that with the one for the three I don't think the extra 30 bucks is really worth it for the controls I would be you know very happy with buying the one saving the money and still getting to have all those same controls but just in now software form versus tangible button form in another case for just being attacked with the one over the three is the fact that since this is compatible with their stream Beck you can just have all the actual physical controls then on the stream deck instead of the mic so I think overall for the price it is still kind of pricey yeah it's a bit more expensive than I'd like I would love to see these start at 100 but that's just you know yeah why wouldn't I want it to be cheaper and the mic quality is very good I have heard better but again I think the main selling thing here and what's going to drive this home for a lot of people is gonna be the wave link software if that wasn't included I wouldn't say the microphone you know is necessarily worth it cuz I've heard other streaming mics out there like the rode podcaster I believe I've tried for a hundred dollars that is very very good but the software for the wavelength I think is what's gonna drive home the sales now there are two things I do want to bring up kind of on the cons end of things first is it does recommend you be two fists lengths away from the microphone when you're talking into it and if you do start to get farther away due to the pickup pattern it will start to sound kind of tinny and like hollow it out a few wheels because you're farther away that's gonna be the case for most microphone though and second on the back with the included arm that it's on when you have it powered in with the USBC cable and your headphones you will be limited and how the microphone rotates because as you can see it hits the back right there so if it was up a little bit it might have made you know more sense so it doesn't constantly hit the back again not a big deal it was probably have to unplug and replug it if you're trying to adjust it and depending on where you have angled if you have it on your own boom arm it could be an issue hope this kind of helped you out doing a sound test of each of the mics breaking it down for you and doing that deep dive into the software I got a plug out of what they're doing here because as a combo very very impressive battery up and after my review guys hope you enjoyed if you want to check them out I'll put both the links for you in the description down below if you did like this video helped you out let me know by giving it a big thumbs up show
