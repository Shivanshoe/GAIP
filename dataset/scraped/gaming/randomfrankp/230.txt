what's up guys I'm random Frank P hope y'all staying safe out there and today we're gonna be doing a quick little video on some setup mods and kind of messing with some of my peripherals little behind the scene hacks and enhancements with the weather getting nice out I've had the itch to just change some things up so we're gonna be adding one or two things to the setup itself as well as messing with two peripherals that uh hey maybe it'll help you out as well and I figured for this video we will go blog style okay so first off testing a new microphone hope it all sounds good but what I want to add to the setup is gonna be something that I've never been a fan of but have always said that if it's done tastefully and done right then it's not overkill and that's adding nano leaf Aurora light panels now before you freak out what I want to do is add them on this wall or the ceiling above my setup so it's not gonna be really you know just in your face black RGB but it's gonna add some nice glow and a nice cast to when I'm filming that's why I immediately want to do this [Music] all right so like I said gonna have a mounted above this set up here on this wall and the one thing when I reviewed these back in 2016 maybe 2017 the one that really annoyed me was the fact that they would kind of fall down a lot easier because they're heavy once you get them built up it definitely has a good amount of weight to it and they only include these well they included a bunch of them but you can see just how tiny they are these tiny little 3m adhesive strips we probably got like 20 plus there but they're still small and obviously with them being mounted on a ceiling you know gravity it's only a matter of time before they're gonna want to fall down so that's my main concern so I'm gonna use an additional set of adhesive strips I have those like those velcro pins that I use to hang that that print above my minimal setup over there so I'm gonna use those as well and just hope for the best because these fall off the middle tonight my security system that's gonna go crazy [Music] [Music] [Music] alright so the next thing I want to do is something that I saw on reddit actually for a certain pair of headphones I've talked about him I've showed him off but I am a huge fan of the Philips s HP 9500 they are only 65 dollars often around 55 on sale but these for a budget pair of headphones 100% rival headphones in the two $300 price range for just what they are they are absolutely amazing one of my favorite payers have headphones of all time especially you just at that price now I saw someone I'm ready to do a mod to these that kind of made him like a glass-like like a baby HD 820 from Sennheiser with the glass side and what they did was they were actually an optician and they said that like missable we're getting like your eye test done those little like lenses that come down when you look into that machine your doctor is like all right which one looks better one or two one or two one two you're like both the sames like nope pick one or I'm gonna kill you all right - looks better those the guy used a 58 and a half millimeter lens and then modded them into his headphones well obviously I don't have access to that unless I'm gonna break into my eye doctor which I'm not gonna do so I was doing some searching around and then I thought what about a lens filter so I picked up a 58 millimeter UV lens filter for you know cameras in South to put on your lens this one from Tiffin was five dollars I got two of them so I can put one on each of the grilles and hopefully it works in works out good I don't know figured give it a try all right so as you can see the mesh grille and the actual lens filter are almost identical in size the lens filter itself is 58 millimeters and the grill itself is 58 and a half millimeters so it should be an ideal fit but that's where some of the you know modding itself comes into play so once we take it out we could get it installed properly without any wiggle room and stuff like that now Phillips made modifying these damn near and possible and just for moving the ear-cups take an extreme amount of force like uncomfortable to the amount where you feel like you're gonna break it but the ear cuffs are held on to the ear pads by these little clips so once you pop those off you can start to have access to the actual screws which lets you open up the grill once you take the four screws out you're gonna want to use something to get in between the yoke there because you can see where it's held on you have to kind of push that grill outward if it's held in where the screws are with a little like prongs and stuff so once you push it out you now have access to the open driver itself and the mesh filter and the ring which it sits inside so once the grill itself is out we don't need that but you still want to hold on to this ring because that's where the new glass filter is gonna go and stay in place now this is where it gets tricky because for the actual lens filter there's no real easy way to separate the glass from the filter itself and this additional sort of thread on the inside which keeps the glass you know down it in place so I used a few different tools feel like a toolkit from like I fix it they have a ton of things I could help you out but you want to get something that slips in between the glass and the little thread on the inside so you can start to separate that like I said it's not easy you do want to apply some force to the thread while also being wary not to scratch or break the glass but if you should push out against the actual thread itself you'll hear it kind of sound like it's cracking what you're doing it's pretty much just separating the glue from the filter which is what you want to do and then once I started to you know make some progress about five minutes later I've got it propped up put a little piece of plastic in between it so wouldn't scratch and I just worked my way around the little internal thread itself to separate it which is gonna let us have access to the glass because once that top little ring is out like I'm taking off here now the glass just pops out which is exactly what we want so it's gonna take a while but trust me it's it's worth it because this is only way you can do it without breaking the actual glass and do make sure to have a microfiber cloth on hand because just from you touching it during the whole handle process it's inevitable it's when we fingerprint samus and if anybody doubt still watching the next par there's no real right or wrong way to do this but what I did since there was that point five millimeter gap in between I just used a few thin strips of the 3m adhesive tape like you know double-sided tape and I put it a little bit on the top and bottom of the inside of the ring there you can kind of see it up top just to give it like a sort of bed to rest on and to sit up against so it's not wiggling around on the inside and then once I did that I did add a little bit of Elmer's glue along the inside as well just so it bonds to that and I just did the side of the filter because we don't want this you know going underneath the glass and being visible because that would ruin the appearance it's just a little bit on the sides where the glass is gonna be there's gonna be that gap against the actual plastic filter that's what you want to kind of you know stick together so it looks bad on the inside but you're not gonna be seeing that once you flip it around it should look just like this nothing real visible just gotta wipe it down again and you put that back on the driver screw it back into place put back on the ear cups and you should be good to go now I'm interested to see how these sound all right so I just got done listening to some music trying these out let them dry for a bit and as you can tell yes it looks good looks great however when it comes to headphones it's not about looks it's about sound and immediately it was a different sound stage now it's to be expected because obviously with the stock pair right here as you can see with the open back grille like the mesh here this widens the soundstage now with that being closed it lessens it but that really wasn't the problem what I don't like is obviously with the sound of bouncing off glass the highs and the treble is just through the roof love decent amount of clarity lost and that's because it is so high um and it does increase bass a little bit but not as much as I was hoping because if anything the one downfall with open back phones is the lack of that punchy bass although with v's compared to this now this has better bass so this pretty much did nothing that I was hoping forward to do but like I said I saw that post on Reddit I thought it was a cool idea I wanted to try it out did it came out looking good but it didn't come out sounding good so bit of a bummer but hey cool piece to put on display maybe they do look pretty nice you look pretty nice but oh all right so it's the next morning I got a bit frustrated last night when I was trying to wrap up the vlog it's just wasn't working out like I wanted it to like you sawed off the headphones that was a miss I was working on another kind of hack which was also a miss you'll see that in a second but good news as you can see the light panels are still up they didn't fall off in the middle of the night that's a good thing but the next thing I wanted to show you guys was again kind of hit or miss here but I found this under our sink I guess I forgot we had it it's PTFE lubricant and you know someone like me who in the gaming and peripheral review community when I see PTFE lubricant that reminds me of you know Mouse feet with their PTFE 100% you know the Teflon feet on the bottom and I figured could you use this with a mouse to lubricate the feet to give it more of a glide and last night when I tried it out you know what you do is you apply a very small amount onto like a microfiber cloth kind of like buff it into the mouse feet but I was using a a cloth mouse pad and it worked for you know the first minute or so until the PTFE lubricant got absorbed into the the mousepad and then it just kind of dried off of the feet naturally so that bummed me out and I was like you know at this vlog is just a bunch bunch of fails I'm gonna end it and then overnight it kind of occurred to me what about a different textured mousepad kind of like here with my Mad Catz glide 38 this is a rubberized texture other than absorb water doesn't observe anything really so what I did was I put again a little bit of this on the bottom of my razor Viper ultimate and these feet are 100% virgin Teflon so it's the purest form of PTFE and used it on the rubberized surface and it didn't absorb and it stayed on pretty well which is good to see and it definitely gave it you know a good boost definitely had more of a glide but it's just not practical so I was just like where where is this vlog going I was contemplating even you know like posting the video or just scrapping it all together but I figure you know something like an informal video like this every now and then isn't bad just uh you know break down a quick little vlog like this where it's just easy to kick back and watch I think I'd still post anyways and well see a fort wrap the video up I will say kind of a fail of a vlog but we have a lot of content under embargo coming up so I know there's been a bit of a dip in content that's over the weekend and stuff but I've got a ton in the queue that we're working on right now which is by the background if you saw is so messy a lot of the things I'm pretty sure I had to put in boxes so you guys can't see what it is cuz they're not out yet good stuff coming though but yeah I just want to get a video out for you guys because I know really weird chaotic time in the world right now people need an escape I just want to get some videos out people who are like you know the hardcore fans of the channel who are still watching to this point who just need that escape just for 10-15 minutes to watch a video forget about stuff still wanna get it out you know but didn't turn out entirely how I hoped but don't worry it's like I said tons stuff coming up this week and some pretty interesting stuff coming next weekend too in particular very cool keyboard videos hopefully hopefully yeah that'll wrap it up guys for this little setup hacks fail vlog at this point unfortunately hope you enjoyed and last thing before I go I've been thinking of two different vlog formats for the next time I do vlog do you guys want to see more of a behind-the-scenes of my channel kind of vlog or like a day in the life kind of luck I know they're both very similar if you think about it but I could take them in two different directions a day in the life would be a day in my life from wake up to go into sleep versus behind-the-scenes if you don't want to see more of the personal stuff just all the stuff that I do in a day to get a video up films edited all that kind of stuff the gear I use so let me know down below which of the two you think you'd like to see more who knows maybe maybe I'll wind up doing both but yeah what's one throw that out there yeah I'm gonna end it there again like the second time now alright I'm Frank P hope you enjoyed have a good day
