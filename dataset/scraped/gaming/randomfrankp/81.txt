what's up guys i'm karen let me see your manager we're back with episode 250 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup big 250 already see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it all out we'll kick it off now 250. all right first up we have nothing this is certainly something because i am loving the tones going on here that nice emerald sort of darker green shade for the wall looks really nice also complimenting the wallpapers and the actual plants going on so loving the tones set for this one he's rocking a 34-inch asus monitor the pg-348q you can see he's got a mounted on the bracket off to the right side to free up some more desktop space on that beautiful wooden butcher block there just leave more room for all the gear and hardware he has going on so checking some of it out the speakers on each side of the display are the atom audio t5v and also for the rest of his peripherals we have an imk corn split ergo keyboard he has lubed alpaca switches inside and in the back he has the hadron v3 with lubed h1 switches to go along with his model o wireless then also for audio with the meze 99 neo headphones and the odyssey lcd2 loving the matching green padding he has going on for an extra mod in the odyssey cans now to keep the space really you know clean and minimal overall i don't believe the pc is on or anywhere near the desk as you can see from this shot that's a pretty you know wide angle of the desk and everything off to the left side so i believe his pc is either on the floor or somewhere near but for the leon lee 011d mini case for the ryzen 5 5600 x cpu with an octa nhd15 cooler 32 gigs of g-skill trident z ram not rgb mind you and an rtx 3080 founders edition and again you can see from this shot the pc very well hidden it does look like it's off on its own stand off to the left side of the desk under the uh the record player so who knows maybe that's it but again i'm just loving the tones here nice and earthy checking off all the boxes it's a really nice and clean setup here next up is cory b i guess you could also say a you know earthy tone setup in the literal sense because he has the print of the mountainscape above the setup and the mountains in the wallpaper but still giving us you know a warm sort of feel overall can categorize this one as cozy right so corey's also going with the single monitor approach here with an msi 32 inch 165 hertz display i'm liking the echo show 5 underneath sort of like you know a nice little smart device there with the display for those speakers on each side they are from razer the nomo chroma for his main set of peripherals we have a custom and pro 2 keyboard nice and customized with a logitech g305 a light speed mouse a steel series quick mouse pad then also for audio his headset off to the left side on its own wooden stand to sort of match the lamp and stuff as well got the steel series arctis 7. nice and wireless there freeing up some space for the cables now over to the pc he said it's a pre-made from cyber power pc but he customized some of the internals and stuff and this thing is looking nice gotta say it inside is a ryzen 7 3700 cpu with their own 120 millimeter aio 32 gigs of coresight vengeance rgb pro ram on an asus b550 motherboard an evga rtx 3070 ultra gpu but loving that like frosty icy theme going on then on the other side of the room got the display cases a nice aquarium there well i guess it's not an aquarium because there's no fish it's i guess more so a terrarium because he has a gecko inside looking nice though but all together from cory be a well organized clean put together hitting those minimal notes in terms of design and stuff good stuff all around now is dylan k hitting us with just the perfection here all monochrome super clean nothing out of order man the symmetry even on point let's dive into this beauty because he's rocking a gigabyte 27 inch 170 hertz display here the m27q also up top you can see instead of having a desktop lamp or anything to help free up some space he has one of those monitor light bars also real quick to point out i like the white shelf he has where the speakers are sitting on and you can see the actual monitor arm is also whether spray paint and white or comes white by default but helps it blend in more thor's main peripherals is the kbd fans low profile aluminum case with some pure white ducky one two mini keycaps on there for the mouse the razer viper ultimate and obviously in the mercury edition so again all white nice and matching those speakers the vanity transparent zero then also for audio his headphones are the hi-fi man sundara and they're powered by the ship magni 3 plus amp which was mounted off to the right side underneath his desk again freeing up some space now over to the pc you know it monochrome is well nice and clean we have the fractal design meshfy c case with an amd ryzen 5 3600 cpu with their stock wraith prism cooler 16 gigs of corser vengeance rgb pro ram on an asrock steel legend x570 motherboard and a sapphire nitro plus rx 5700 xt for the gpu but keeping the rgb components a pure white got the white braided cables for the hardware as well a really clean build to top off a super clean desk setup loving everything about this again the symmetrical prince above the setup just makes the actual desk setup itself look a lot more aesthetically pleasing to the eye got a little secret door there off to the left as well but man executed flawlessly and now ladies and gentlemen is a ridiculously clean and minimal office setup from matthew and cena if you're not familiar with him or his youtube channel definitely check it out i'll have the actual full video tour down below which will also then lead you to his channel obviously but he put together an absolute masterpiece of a setup i won't be able to cover everything in this setup but i'll still put some links down below for you regardless starting off as you can see for a sit stand desk it's the arrogant office sway this will give him that versatility to obviously you know sit down stand up change it up a bit but still keep it really nice and clean desktop for his monitor he has an asus pro art display it is a 34 inch and from this pro art lineup you know it is great for color accuracy and it's you know the more sensible affordable option versus something like the apple xdr pro display so really liking this and that as you can see is mounted on its own arm hanging off on the right side here this is the ergotron monitor arm really nice and flexible it's got also room for routing cables and stuff it's going to help add to the overall clean and minimal look on the desktop so things aren't you know hanging down out of sight and then as far as peripherals is using both of the logitech wireless options here with logitech mx craft keyboard which is very popular and logitech mx master mouse and they're both sitting on that nice light gray felt desk pad from grovemade these are also very popular see these a lot also on this desktop for audio are the audio engine a2 plus speakers and they're sitting on a kanto speaker desktop stand now one thing i really really like is this minimal looking desktop lamp he has i checked it out it's currently not available but it's just called a me led light and it looks super nice it's like under 50 bucks and fits in with his setup beautifully and then next to the setup to maintain that really clean office space he's got the really nice pegboards shelves the cubbies everything here is also like color coordinated which is just crazy got the orange lamp matching the print on the wall everything is just so like it has a place on purpose and empowering a setup is actually a 16 inch macbook pro so that's what's given the entire setup its wheels you can just you know unplug it he has it hooked up to a cal digit hub so let's go you know hook it up to the monitors and stuff we can just unplug it take it with him on the go come back home dock it back up and be back in business man and one thing i really love about matthew's channel is his execution of everything like this setup wasn't just put together on a whim it was thought out it was planned it was sketched out it was rendered he had a full vision and he literally brought it to life and it looks amazing just one of my favorite setups i've ever seen even though it's not you know a dedicated like gaming setup whatever you guys know we don't just show off gaming setups it's the office setups it's the work from home setups it is everything and this setup is everything like i said before his channel dedicated
