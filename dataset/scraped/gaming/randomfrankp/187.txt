what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 221 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out lots of hand gestures let's kick it off now first we have a stunner with a really nice and clean black and white setup highlighted by a beautiful wooden desk from ikea you know the carl b looking super stella you know i've been doing this setup show since january 2015. yes to all you haters out there i was first and i've definitely become jaded when i see good setups but every now and then one just like this will come across and it just makes the jaw drop you know what i'm saying okay so for the stacked orientation his primary monitor on the bottom is an acer 27-inch 144 hertz so it's gonna be great for gaming and that top is an lg 34 inch ultra wide usually you see the ultra wide as a primary here but in this case it's reversed they got the extra real estate up top down to the peripherals like i said a really nice job of going all black and white here even some custom modding so we have the steelseries apex7 keyboard with some hyperx pudding keycaps and the steelseries rival 600 in a nice custom white colorway on the steelseries xl rgb prism mouse pad i can't tell but it may be a skin on the mouse to kind of give it that white look but either way it just fits in perfect also for his headset you can see underneath is the corsair virtuoso rgb wireless and then over to the pc looking as nice as you'd expect with a setup like this a beautiful build in the nzxt h510 elite inside that intel i9 9900k cpu with the nzxt kraken x62 aio got some white braided on that as well 64 gigs of corset engines rgb pro ram and a vertically mounted gigabyte rtx 2080 super just this is perfect this is a perfect pc and hell i'd even say this is a perfect setup because when you look at it there's really nothing i would change you've got the plants you got the nice you know contrast here with the black and white and even complimenting the plants is the wooden desktop it's just super clean super nice plus one for the pupper i really have no complaints here so i gotta say this kicking off the show very very strong uh good stuff 100 next up we have jafar with this crazy pretty much console entertainment setup judging by you know the massive tv in the room but when you think of you know just the word or the phrase you know a gaming setup whatever this has got it all it's got the figures the collectibles the posters everything so this tv is a samsung q led 4k it is 65 inches from their q series and you can see in the media center all the consoles he has the playstation kind of logo there set up and for a peek into the collectible cabinets on display just some really cool stuff star wars helmets iron man this is dope but also across the room he still has his own death setup as you can see this one more so for productivity because it's all powered by a macbook pro but for the actual gear here you have a 27 inch lenovo monitor with an iclever bk 10 wireless keyboard logitech g602 wireless mouse and also the razer kraken pro v2 which is over by the tv which is chilling on the deadpool head so this is a gaming room done right the helmets the collectibles the massive massive tv got the consoles and stuff kicking back on the couch chilling playing some games the rgb lamps head to toe this one's got it all next up is max with the triple monitor gaming setup but not in the traditional sense like you'd think here we have the stacked two plus a vertically mounted on the left side setup so definitely you know not orthodox by any means but it's gonna work for him obviously if it didn't work you wouldn't have this orientation max did say this was for both gaming and you know video production work so you can split it between both and for the displays that top one to 27 inch from hp and the vertical one and the bottom one is a 27 inch from phillips i will say max it would be really great if you could possibly you know have them pushed together a little bit more there's not as many gaps and a little pro tip if you flip your top monitor see bezels on the top end they'll have a more seamless approach for the top and bottom monitor but now checking out the peripherals on the extended mouse pad from hyper x we have the hyperx alloy core rgb keyboard with logitech g502se mouse which looks pretty nice i dig their black and white colorway that one's for gaming but for productivity he also has the logitech mx master mouse and then the audio technica ath m40x headphones you could see chilling right there yes headphones chill then this is the only pc photo we have so inside the ryzen 7 1700x with a cooler master master liquid 120 aio 32 gigs of g-skilled trident z rgb ram on the rog strix b350f from asus an msi rtx 2060 super gpu and then a shot of the really nice entertainment section with a 55-inch 4k fire tv from insignia i like how it's you know mounted above that sort of like floating entertainment console got the actual xbox one there some games really great job of cable management you can see it's routed through the wall but the floating approach is really clean so good stuff max i'm really digging the moody kind of approach here with the dark walls the wooden shelves with some collectibles and stuff uh then to kind of brighten it up you have the white desk the white pc nice old lamp good stuff good stuff next we have twin skunk remember what i said for the first setup every now and then one will come across and just drop the jaw yeah this one hot damn it's just it's perfect perfect i love the seamless blending of all the monitors lined up perfectly the really nice massive overhead tv then i span wallpapers ah the rgb is also looking good the plants the plants this is great all right so there's a lot going on obviously and checking it out the three monitors on the bottom okay the primary is a samsung 49-inch monitor the left is an acer predator 27 inch 165 hertz display and then the one on the right is a 27 inch acer nitro monitor the overhead you're asking oh no big deal this is a 65 inch 4k tv from sony yeah nbd mbd okay so for the peripherals this keyboard is the wireless logitech g915 with logitech g903 mouse that's all an extended mouse pad from aukey but underneath that is the logitech power play map so he could never run out of battery for the g903 mouse and also that little mini display there i assume is some sort of tablet maybe like an ipad mini not 100 sure but you'll see now when he kind of transform it into a massive racing rig spanned across the bottom three he also has some like a little hud on that little let's just call it an ipad first you know just for the sake of this but man the racing rig really transformed the whole setup and as for his wheel it's the logitech g920 and for audio here he uses the logitech g935 as well as the audio technica ath m50x headphones and then a look at the beast powering all of this it's the leonle 011 dynamic case inside that intel i9 9900k cpu with a corsair h150i pro aio 32 gigs of patriot viper steel ram on an asus hero 11 z3 90 motherboard with an evga rtx 2080 ti xc ultra graphics card got the orange and blue color theme going on inside with the peripheral lighting and the fans damn it i got an email almost made an entire episode without an interruption all right so another wide shot at the room you can see all the sound proofing foam going on and even the vr setup here so it could you know not have any cables hanging down or rigged up on the wall and just check out the cable management as well underneath this beautiful desk it is all super organized compact man you gotta give it a twin skunk here this is a setup for the books and as you've seen in these shots he changes up the wallpaper every now and then and it completely spans across all four of the displays even color matches to the rgb going on man gimme gimme gimme gimme and then last but definitely not least is the gengar setup going all purple for the color theme even a shout out to a day to remember in the wallpaper that's a good throwback to my good old high school days when i was a young boy time's flying it's not a cliche pretty soon you'll wake up and your back will just be hurting 24 7. but that is not to take away from the fact that gengar is a probably like top five pokemon of all time uh comment down below which your favorite pokemon is mine's probably onyx but gengar is a close second but the setup here is what matters okay it's looking like a really i can't even like tell if it's like a studio or what it is but with the wood all around it's looking really killer the single monitor here is an asus ultra wide it is a 34 inch 120 hertz display and for the peripherals we have the rock lament pro keyboard with some custom keycaps the corsair dark core rgb se mouse on a custom mouse pad but again with the keycap color and the mousepad itself is blending in with that purple color theme and for audio you can see on the desktop we have the sony satss1 speakers as well as the sennheiser gsp 600 headset powered by the sennheiser gsx 1000 dac but with the lights on now we could check out the pc over to the cooler master c700p case it's an intel i7 8700k cpu with the nzxt x72 aio got 32 gigs of g-scale trident z rgb ram on an asus maximus x formula motherboard and then asus strix 2070 graphics card got the purple and blue color theme on the inside with the hardware and the fans and just realizing now that i guess that's not a gengar themed setup like i mentioned earlier there was just that print above it but yeah i dubbed it that but again like i said earlier i don't know what kind of room this is if it's like a studio or what but it is gorgeous with all the wood it's all the rgb and the ceiling got like the steel beam and stuff in the back if this is just like in your house dude then you are killing it because this is awesome i am 100 on board with this only thing you need is my gengar nk65 entry build that i did a few weeks ago on the channel shameless plug but hey i'm the captain of this ship and you can be the captain of your very own elgato wave 3 microphone
