what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out what i think is the most important mouse so far this year we're gonna review the steel series airox nine so today we'll go through it all for you guys go for my overview thoughts and opinions pros and cons all that stuff in case you're interested in picking up the new aerox 9. now obviously checking it out this is pretty unique there are not a lot of you know moba mmo mice out there really well there are you can get cheap ones on amazon but really nothing like this the airox 9 is a wireless lightweight 18 button mouse coming in at just 89 grams in the current market of moba and mmo wireless mice again nothing only comes close to this sure there's the razer naga pro and the logitech g602 but they are chunky and while the 89 grams doesn't really seem too light considering the current mouse market for a mouse with this many buttons that's definitely on the lighter side so checking it out the main features here are gonna be on the left side you have the 12 buttons there stacked right where your thumb sits but the design overall is unmistakably steel series it looks pretty much identical in terms of design language to like their airlocks 3 for example with those cutouts and stuff now taking a closer look at dimensions this is technically classified as an ergonomic mouse it stands 18 millimeters tall the highest point is 42 millimeters tall it's around 125 millimeters in total length the grip width in the middle is 62 millimeters wide and the widest point at the hips is 69 millimeters wide i would definitely say overall this is more on the medium to larger size for a mouse because it does really just have extra bulk in your hand when you're using it on my scale it came in at 88 grams which again still pretty lightweight not as light as some of the current fps mice out there but as i said before for a mouse like this that is the lightest in its class checking the rest of the mouse out again to cut down on some of that weight we do have the you know honeycomb design even though it's more like these little squares cut out still known as the honeycomb shell something i always like to see is when the scroll wheel is textured and here engraved into the rubber scroll wheel are these little lines and stuff so feels nice nice to see and a popular feature on logitech mice for example on here we now have tilt clicking so not only can you click in and obviously scroll up and down you can click to the left and to the right on the scroll wheel for extra buttons and functions below the scroll wheel is your dpi button and we do have rgb shining through the mouse and on the bottom there is an accent strip right towards the butt so it's gonna have a nice subtle glow on your desk when you're using it but yes like i said pretty identical to their aerox series lineup now when you get an unboxing setup you have three different modes of connectivity you can use it wired if you want 2.4 gigahertz or over bluetooth there is the mode switcher on the bottom side of the mouse but with my testing over at my gaming setup i strictly gamed with the 2.4 gigahertz with their usbc dongle because that is just the fastest most reliable connection with their quantum 2.0 wireless technology now you'll also notice on the bottom is another welcome change with their 100 pure ptfe skates these are that more sort of see-through white versus on the original aerox 3 they had these small black ones that were relatively scratchy overall but now with the revised arocs 3 and the 5 and now the 9 we have smoother skates which is definitely welcomed now getting back to the main purpose of this review those 12 side buttons and the fact that this is overall an mmo and moba gaming mouse as many of you probably know who have followed the channel for a while i'm mainly like an fps gamer okay so i'm really not a moba mmo player but that also doesn't mean that i can't take advantage of these side buttons because the fact of the matter is having 12 buttons well 18 total programmable buttons on the mouse but the 12 right there where your thumb sits is literally giving you now 12 extra functions macros whatever right at your thumb so for photo editing video editing it's all right there whether you're streaming you can have different keys set to these buttons i have the mouse setup configured to be pretty much an all-in-one sort of macro use case here for things even like controlling spotify on my desktop you know skipping tracks easily like i said it doesn't matter if you're an fps gamer like me having these 12 buttons now will allow you to never take your fingers off of watts so that means you know for reloading grenades cycling guns one through four like in battlefield did the gadgets and stuff as well crouching going prone sprint instead of taking your fingers off of waz to hit those extra keys they can now just be set to any of these 12 buttons and that's why this is awesome again not only for moba or mmo users but for anybody but all in all really no issues it still uses their true move air sensor which was up to 18 000 cpi i typically game at around 600 with this it's got that one millisecond 1000 hertz pulling rate and switches inside are their next gen golden micro ip54 switches they have 80 million click durability so they are nice and sharp overall but i guess that also means they're ditching their magnetic ones that we saw on the prime lineup from last year and since we have a plethora of buttons here i'll do a sound test you could hear how it all sounds on the airox 9. i will say just due to my grip overall when i was using this mouse mainly for playing battlefield one uh my thumb was constantly on the seven button so on the left side that is the bottom row and it's the third to the right now i feel like just naturally it should have been one two three four on the bottom then five six seven eight then nine ten eleven twelve up top but instead the way they have it laid out where it's one two three all the way to the left vertically i don't know kind of threw me off because for example in battlefield if i wanted to switch guns real quick i'd have to drastically move my thumb all the way up to the front of the mouse pretty much when that's just really not natural now again you can rebind these keys not only in the game but in their software but i did just want to point that out that due to my grip and how i game my thumb was always on that bottom seven key but like i just said you have the full ability to rebind this all in their steel series engine software and this is really what gives you the full freedom and flexibility now to customize this mask because you can set these to be really anything from full keystrokes and macros any sort of key on your keyboard commonly used functions just for your pc in general like i said with controlling like your media and stuff multimedia keys i have it for controlling spotify launching programs it is pretty tedious to go through and find which key you want to reprogram all these 12 to be but once you do it's not like literally having a whole extra macro pad at your thumb now that button cluster is relatively cramped i will say i know for me even though i reprogrammed it all in the software for my gaming i was constantly miss clicking the wrong buttons each of the 12 buttons sort of has this bezeled edge to them but only the 5 has that real indicator on the right side it's like on some keyboards where f and j have those little homing bars that's kind of what the five is acting at here but again just due to my natural positioning i was constantly just resting on seven so will it take you time to adjust and get used to this mouse's shape yeah probably i know it did for me like i said but will it also take you time to remember and get used to what each of these 12 buttons do or what you set them as in the software yes that's going to be the biggest adjustment here because like i said it's cramped you're going to have that quick muscle memory of naturally remembering where each button is and not miss clicking but once you do once you get that nailed down and you have all your macros functions whatever set and identified you're gonna just you're gonna love it it's gonna be a dream so a quick recap here a lightweight mmo mobile mouse at 88 grams on my scale true move air sensor up to 18 000 cpi new golden micro switches 18 total reprogrammable buttons including the 12 on the left side plus like i said before tilt clicking on the scroll wheel another thing i didn't even mention to you guys which is insane to me is the battery life on this is rated for 140 hours plus with a 15 minute quick charge you can get up to 40 hours which i mean for some people could be like an entire four days use just on a 15 minute quick charge over usbc they are doing some really really awesome stuff like i said in a space that is really unrivaled right now a lightweight moba mouse mmo mouse whatever all these buttons all this functionality at 88.89 grams untouched so all the features all the functionality that's all the good stuff what are the cons and again my personal preference well like i said before i wish these were renumbered i wish it was just one two three four on the bottom and then going up instead of having seven where my thumb sits naturally um and also the price this guy's pricey at 150. now as i've rehashed numerous times can they sort of get away with that right now because the naga pro is old the g604 is old they're heavier this is lighter probably is this massively for everybody definitely not but those who can use this and take advantage of this are definitely gonna love it so all right guys that'll wrap it up for my
