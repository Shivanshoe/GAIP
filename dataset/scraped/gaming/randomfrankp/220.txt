what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with episode 2/10 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas of inspirations for your own setup you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll start enough now to ten first up we have been with the Harley Quinn set up going along with his triple monitors here and as you can see it's more than just the actual wallpaper it stickers on the PC it's a bit of the writing on the wall which is I assume was a wallpaper but as you know with like the the Suicide Squad and the the really terrible Jared Leto Joker with the writing I feel like that also kind of fits into the theme but getting into the gear his monitors here are two different models his primary in the middle is an Asus 27-inch with the two on each side being an Asus 24 inch and then down to the peripherals the keyboard here is an asus rog Oris it's the GK 2000 RGB keyboard with the coarser m65 elite Mouse in white also on his desktop you could see the Bose solo 5 sound bar to go along with the SteelSeries arctas 5 wireless headset even got some haha stickers on there to again accentuate the Harley Quinn if you know what I'm saying now over to the PC this is a really nice water-cooled rig and again more stickers on here so it's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea definitely not a subtle kind of appearance but it's still a really nice looking PC so inside here he has a risin 930 900 X CPU with 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance RGB program on the Asus tough gaming x5 70-plus motherboard with a GTX 20/80 super graphics card from gigabyte it's their Horus lineup this is all inside the thermal take view 71 snow Edition case even have a little 5 inch Raspberry Pi screen there in the bottom right love the pastel pink and the whites again it just fits the theme to a tee got some of the coolant under the desk as well as some product boxes and as you can see for everything going on great cable management kept up and tidy in addition to the 2 RGB light strips one pink on blue and like I said a minute ago this setup is admittedly not for everybody you either love it or you hate it you think it's great or you think it's just too much and over-the-top but that's exactly what he was going for and he nailed the Harlequin theme next we have minty retro and it's all in named got retro stuff everywhere minty whether it's you know minty fresh or in mint condition either what hit his name just males hit here and I really like how different this is again while people might think you want a more clean setup this one here is going for the retro vibes all the figures that collectibles you see the old retro consoles in the case and I love stuff like this you can even think of it kind of like yes two different setups with his PC and primary setup off to the right side I think I think old classic tube TV here on the left it's all right here at the desk so checking it out for the actual setup we'll call it this is a forty three inch samsung ultra wide curved monitor with a 120 Hertz for fresh rate got the RGB above below and everywhere in between Vaness Wars peripherals his keyboard is the coarser gaming case I'm the RGV mark 2 special edition which is why it's in that nice white and silver frame with the corsair scimitar pro RGB mouse on an extended mouse pad from msi empowering this set up is not a dedicated built rig but the Intel nook Hayes Canyon this is a very tiny compact PC and inside for the specs is an Intel i7 8800 9 G not too sure of anything else but I mean it is a capable tiny powerful thing for what it is there's no doubt about that is they're pretty popular and as you can see doesn't take up much space at all and just you know some other looks that across the room at some of the figures and collectibles the consoles I just love an old retro set up like this and you can't help but get some good nostalgia when you see some of these figures and stuff so I again we don't see these too often but I love them now we've got mowie with a nice and bright triple monitor setup all black and white for the gear and hardware purple RGB lighting to bring out and accentuate that tool with the wallpaper this is either like a top floor or in an attic to get to see that massive window there then at night time the RG becomes alive even more and you gotta love it so for those three displays these are again two different models the primary is a 24-inch BenQ with a 144 Hertz refresh rate when the two on each side are also 24-inch Ben cues but not necessarily the higher end gaming model these are not 144 Hertz now as you guys know on this show rarely do I criticize but I do want to give a bit of advice here hope you're watching man I just think having the two bigger bezels on the outside monitors kind of takes away from the evenness even though all three of them are 24 inches it doesn't look it because of the thicker bezels and I would try to find a way to just get those cables that you can see drag it underneath the monitors kept up and routed out that right side I think it would really help a lot and really clean up the appearance overall now down to the peripherals give me Razer BlackWidow chroma key board with logitech g502 on the eraser of Firefly mousepad and three different things for audio here so for his headset and headphones we have the audio technica ath m50x in white as well as the Astro a40 TR headset and those big ol speakers are the yamaha HS 7 studio monitors really nice stuff and again I love how it's all matching white rarely can you find especially audio products in white so you have the trio here then as for the PC which is underneath the desk inside as if Intel i7 4790k CPU with the be quiet dark rock pro 3 32 gigs of HyperX savage ram an MSI z97 s SLI crate Edition motherboard with the appellate Jetstream GTX 970 graphics card inside the NZXT h5 10 elite case again they got the purple in the lighting and the fans to bring out the purple RGB in your setup and a really clean white and black appearance in the inside and I like how they set up is kind of tucked away as you could see in this shot here I've got like a little lounge spot with the sofa the Natalie for our light panels and you get into this gaming nook and then you're just lost from there right just sunk in game have a good time so I really like what you do with this space next up is Navi gasps with the triple monitors and as we've been seeing a lot more lately be tie-fighter set up for the monitor orientation no one calls of that I think I just call it that but you guys get you could visualize it and I love the blend of colors here with like the coral orange the light blue it looks really really good that's definitely a pretty cool wallpaper so you got it all time together really nicely the primary monitor here is an Acer 34 inch ultra wide with the two vertical ones on each side mounted being a 24 inch monitor from Philips both lamps by the way are from Ikea now down to the peripherals on this nice extended mousepad from steel series it's the quick extra-extra-large we have the glorious GM MK keyboard with those putting shine through key caps as well as a glorious model Oh Mouse in white for audio two different headphones here we have the sennheiser HD 6 xx as well as the Odyssey LCD 2 headphones two really great pair of open-back cans and powering that is the ship Matty to uber and the ship Magni to uber am this shit's really popular you got to love yourself a powerful [ __ ] stack and then like clockwork over to the PC nice and bright tons of mix RGB going on this is the NZXT s340 elite case it's at that Intel i5 86 hundred K CPU with an octal NHD 15 cooler 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport LT Ram on an Asus prime Z 370 a motherboard with an Asus GTX 1070 graphics card in white and by the way all that RGB lighting inside is supplied by the NZXT hue plus lighting kit so altogether really nice setup I love that really just really good blend of the colors behind whether you want to call it orange or Coral I'm gonna go Coral it blends really nicely in the way you have the blue separated behind the primary think looks really cool then last but not least we have Miguel with the very first Mac Pro on this series obviously due to their price tag and how powerful they are we don't see them too often on this series but the series doesn't just gaming setups that it can be just general work station setups music production setups just like this one we have here so checking it out I love the backboard we see this as well pretty frequently now but that nice wooden backboard to mouthy monitor on give us a nice separation and it goes right into the desk here so this is seemingly all DIY and I love that dark kind of stain it has it looks really really good this is a 38 inch Dell curved monitor I'm thinking the wallpaper choice accentuates the plant you have on the left side then as for the peripherals again not a gaming setup so he has the Apple magic keyboard with the Apple Magic Trackpad as well as the Logitech MX master 3 Mouse and then for audio obviously he's gonna have a lot of stuff going on so he has the Korg I'm probably pronouncing that wrong Korg Accords sorry m3 expanded keyboard with both the Yamaha HS ATM studio monitors and the creative T 42 speakers and then for his headphones not pictured here but he has the Sennheiser HD 650 and like I said the 2019 Mac Pro everyone knows about at the cheese grater but say what you want it is powerful but expensive inside here he has the Radeon Pro Vega 2 GPU with 144 gigs of RAM to go along with there 16 core 3.2 gigahertz CPU you know I don't know much about the new Mac Pro other than what I've seen online and stuff and I don't know Miguel's you know full line of work in detail but I'd assume he definitely needs to take advantage of that beast or else he probably wouldn't have it so I'm glad to see it you know put to good use in a really nice setup love the wood and backboard love the plants love this shade of the paint for the wall matches the wallpaper in a bit you got the backlighting behind the backboard Miguel I'm diggin it man all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 210 of room tour project I hope you all enjoyed don't forget you
