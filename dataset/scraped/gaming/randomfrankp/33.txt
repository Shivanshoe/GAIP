[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be taking a look at and building the beak 6.5 custom keyboard from stylo studios so today i'll bring you through the whole build process and tell you my thoughts on the beak 6.5 we'll go through the components i'll be using all that stuff now it's definitely a unique board with the beak weight underneath and a large volume knob on the right side but in terms of aesthetics i really dig it it's something different on the market and i welcome any change in innovation so first a quick disclaimer this is still a prototype of the board it's currently in the group by phase that's ending at the end of this week so if you're interested in this you want to pick it up hop on it while you can now before you begin quick little modifications with the beak weight underneath it's this heavy brass triangular piece that's held onto the frame by three screws but to make it just pop a little more i wanted to take it from its matte finish to a more glossy one so i added a clear glaze layer to it and while it's not even going to be seen 99 of the time i realize that i wanted to do it still just to match the finish of my artisan rama cap that i'll be using later on next up i do have to desolder the pcb since this prototype was already built by alex odos shout out to him he did a build over on his twitch channel he and silo studios worked it out or i'd be next in line to receive this build but i wanted to start fresh with my own choice of switches and let me tell you this hakko desoldering tool is a lifesaver i desoldered all 65 switches here in just under seven minutes total it melts the flux on the pins and instantly just sucks it up into the vacuum and that's it takes like three seconds per pin now i can pop off the polycarbonate plate and i've got a clean pcb to work with but i will be keeping the stabilizers alex already has installed here these are duroc v2s that are lubed with 205 grade zero as well as dialect of grease added on the bar so this will save me some time when i reuse these in the end switches to alex used were cherry blacks that were lubed and filmed as well so a heavier smoother linear switch for sure however i've been really into tactiles recently and i got these pulsar black hole switches that stock already super smooth as it is and provide a nice tactile and audible bump to them that i've been in love with i've always been team linear but these are definitely making me switch comment down below are you team linear clicky or tactile and i don't even know when pulsars planning on releasing these but stock they do feel amazing and visually yes they look identical to gather on ink switches now i was planning on using these stock but i know with these keyboard videos you need to go that extra mile in almost every regard or else the trolls in the comments section will just rage like there's no tomorrow so i did apply a very light sheen to the stem with some carbon gs1 grease from kinetic labs and i also added a switch film as well just to make it tighter and provide a little more thought just a little heads up if pulsar does release these then take it from me all the time that went into lubing and filming these switches results in a negligible difference so yeah they're that good already from the factory out of the bag i wasted my time so you don't have to waste yours but honestly that just speaks more to how good these are from pulsar now next i'm going to add the corner switches to our poly garment plate so you can begin to solder those down which is going to provide the stability in all four corners which will just make adding the rest of the switches that much easier that does then lead me to bring up that yes if you haven't already gotten the clue for me desoldering the switches earlier this is not a hot swap pcb and silo studios does not plan on selling a hotspot version either they do have this in both asn i and iso layouts but nothing stopping you from adding your own kl hotspot sockets if you want for beginners i know the thought of you know soldering your own keyboard seems very daunting and complex but trust me it's super simple just take some time and concentration i can then go through and pop in the rest of my switches into the plate and down through my pcb making sure the pins aren't bent and they're being led down through the pin holes and once they're all installed i can go through and then finish off the soldering process then really just like that the majority of the build is already done securing the pcb and plate to the top frame is done by eight tiny screws but before we mount it to the bottom frame i want to add a layer of pe foam inside mainly because it's not as thick and as dense as something like your traditional arts and crafts eva foam but the pe foam layer is going to be thin enough that'll still provide a thought that i'm looking for without deadening the sound profile this is usually applied between the pcb and the plate as a popular mod uh but heads up doing this way sounds and works about the same now since we have a daughter board for a usb-c connector up in the beak itself i have to reconnect that cable to the bottom back of our pcb just to give our beak some life and then we can finish the frame itself we have four larger screws in the outer four corners and one of the newer additions that they added to this prototype to help the frame close properly is the addition now of the four inner screw holes so that the board's frame doesn't rattle and you don't have any gaps in between once that's all done i'm going to be adding back our large volume knob on the top right side of the board again these aesthetic choices may not be for everybody but for me it's the functionality that counts and as i said before i really enjoy the looks of this board they do include a tiny little hex wrench so we can lock down our volume knob onto the rotary encoder this is so it doesn't just pop off obviously on you and yes as you can see the matte finish to the board definitely is a fingerprint magnet so always gotta have a microfiber cloth on hand then lastly the finishing touch is adding our keycaps from drop i picked up the white on black gmk katakana set these are obviously a very different set than what you're probably used to seeing with these japanese katakana legends but i figured they'd be the perfect pairing here for this novelty board by the way the beak 6.5 is also available in a white finish which i think these caps would look amazing on as well and no i have no idea what i'll be typing no i cannot read japanese and yes i'm doing it anyway for our final piece for the escape key which should always be a nice artisan i think i'll be going with this nice roma works cap from their gmk bushido set again i don't know what this says or what it stands for but it fits the build looks super nice and as an accent piece i think it looks gorgeous on this board here and it's complements that glossy finish i added to the brass weight underneath even though you can only see it from the sides hey it's my build don't worry about it then just like that we're all done with our beak 6.5 and i'll say it again i know this layout and design isn't going to be for everybody but i am a hundred percent all about it you got your standard 60 layout here with the additional arrow keys plus a necessity for me at least a nice volume knob above it there's no rgb to our pcb and really we don't need it it wouldn't add much overall the usbc does get seated a bit into the beak itself where that weight is at the tip but when you're talking like first impressions and looks with all the lines and angles going on here it just leads your eyes all around the board i think design wise it does a stellar job even though it's only available in black and white you know i would love to see some other colors later on down the line and i will say just for the sake of my build since i have the artisan cap i would have liked to have seen that top portion of the beak where it's black i would have loved that that was brass as well but hey that's just me all right so now we're gonna do a sound test of the beak 6.5 with my lube and switch filmed pulsar black hole tactile switches man like i said numerous times these pulsar black hole switches despite the bizarre name sound and feel fantastic yes even though i lubed them and applied the switch film honestly like i said before it's really not worth all the extra effort because stock right out of the bag they feel and sound pretty much identical to these without all the extra work they put into it or i put into it but yes this keyboard feels and sounds great to me again with these duroc v2s that alex odos also lubed and applied the dielectric grease to i'm just loving this final result again i really would love to see them possibly add different colors later on down the line even though the group by right now only has black and white available kind of a bummer but i understand for their first like you know major launch like this maybe if it does you know super well we'll see another version down the line with more colors and options and stuff and even though these keycaps are not gonna be for everybody and the board's not even gonna be for everybody uh for me personally as it being you know my build the choices that i put into this i'm loving the final results all right so as we wrap this up like i mentioned in the beginning this is still a prototype build because it's in group by it's obviously not out yet to the masses and one of the things that kind of bothers me that i would like to see them somehow change later on down the line is with the wobble it's not a big deal when you're actually using it in real use but if you do press on either of the corners because of the beak and the weight you know being more elevated on that back side and not evenly across the whole top it does sort of shift back and forth so not too sure how they can modify or change that for the final release again unless you're drastically pressing in the top corners it's not going to be an issue but it's still something i noticed when i was putting in the switches and putting on the keycaps and stuff that it did have some wobble to it so i'm really loving it again with when it comes to these custom keyboard builds and the whole keyboard community and market out there it is all down to preference that's why i built this that's why i accepted you know this keyboard to check out himself because i'm digging it i love the functionality i love the design and even though it's not going to be for everybody you might not like it guess what you don't got to buy it i know i would i'm loving it just maybe give us different colors and mix and match the knob colors and maybe add that top beak is a brass color too you know but all right guys that'll wrap it up for my build of the stylo studio beak 6.5 hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out in this last few days the group buy before it wraps up i'll have that listed for you in the description down below so you can put your order in don't miss out you know how these keyboards are they're here and they'll be gone for a while and you can't get your hands on it so don't miss the window if you like this build give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter randomfrankp at last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button hope you all enjoyed have a good day
