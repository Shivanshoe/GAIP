what's up guys i'm random frank p and today i'm super pumped because we're gonna be checking out and reviewing the brand new glorious model i gaming mouse which is their answer and direct competitor to logitech g502 so here we are 2022 glorious dropping the third installment in their odin lineup and as most of you know i've been a g502 lover since the beginning used all iterations so i was super happy when this arrived we've got both units in black and white and they come in advertised at 69 grams which is much much lower than the g502 is 124 grams on my scale it came in at 70 grams but you got to give it that one or two gram variance every skill is calibrated slightly different we'll call it 69. so once i got it in an unboxed yes the weight difference now was definitely apparent like right away obviously to cut down on that weight we still have the honeycomb cutouts on the bottom of the shell where your palm sits and underneath the mouse i would have loved this was all a solid shell you know but i get it i get it but i noticed they have a few tricks and features up their sleeve that's not so apparent right away and with such a polarizing shape to an ergonomic mouse like this you'll see on the left side you have this thumb rest and the cluster of buttons here instead of the traditional two for your forward and backward here we have four highlighted by the sniper button as it's commonly known as which on other mice you could use to quickly downshift your dpi really low if you're sniping that's why it's called the sniper button this could be whatever you want but above that you still have your forward and backward button plus the fourth which could be again whatever now the trick to this is the sniper button and the back most fourth button are removable and magnetic inside the box it comes with two separate replaceable buttons which just have a different shape and contour to them plus one that makes it pretty much flush with the shell and sort of takes away the butt you can't actuate it just to show you real quick with the stock button you can see it sticks out more easier to press the second button is a bit more flush but has a little bit of a flare out for your thumb i like this one the best personally the third option is the completely flush shell which removes this as a button pretty much i will say it's pretty tough to remove these especially for someone like me who has no nails i would recommend going forward they include like one of those plastic pick tools i've got a bunch of them for my ifixit kits but yeah i'd recommend they include something going forward which makes it easier to remove them and also keep in mind just those two are removable not the forward and backward button which i tried to remove uh yeah they're permanent now when talking shape and dimensions like i said comes in at 70 grams on my scale it's 126 millimeters in total length the tip height from the bottom of the mouse to the scroll wheel is 32 millimeters tall it's 42 in the middle at its highest point the front width is 60 millimeters the grip width in the middle is 62 millimeters then the widest point of the mouse including that little flare out where the thumb is is 74 millimeters you compare that to the g502 and it's not too too different in terms of dimension but the overall shape in the hand is where it really starts to differ the model i i think is more rounded overall then it's contoured to your palm sort of like right at the top of the mouse where if you're a palm gripper it's going to feel more rounded there comparing it to the g502 which has a more angular aggressive design to it whereas the top of the mouse is more of a rounded hump i'd say then it starts to narrow out as you go down towards the front of the mouse so again very minor differences in terms of dimensions but the shape definitely feels different in your hand there's also a few more differences in terms of buttons on the g502 thumb rest there's only the forward and backward button plus the sniper wheel so two versus three however on the g502 there are two additional buttons right next to the left paddle with the left click you have that g8 and g7 button there on the model i below the scroll wheel there are two buttons for shifting up or shifting down your dpi again these can be reprogrammed to be whatever you want but stock they are dpi buttons on the g502 you just have one button for changing your dpi but the biggest difference here is gonna be the scroll wheel yes the model i has your standard scroll wheel they've had on all their previous mice whereas on the g502 it's their famous hyperscroll not only that but the g502 scroll wheel lets you uh tilt click and stuff so a lot more functionality and it's one of the best scroll wheels out there anybody who's used a g502 definitely knows that and can agree with that i mean even the basilisk from razer had a scroll wheel that was adjustable in terms of like friction that was pretty cool unfortunately not here so it would have been cool glorious had some sort of extra flare to their scroll wheel i will point out on my white unit the scroll wheel is leaning more towards the left side it's just slightly off angle that did not happen on my black unit didn't affect performance or anything but just a minor annoyance on my end now as you notice these monolith mice are wired it's their ascended cord so it's still very very flexible it's also extremely lightweight so it doesn't negatively affect your mouse or even your gameplay really you can bunch it up push it it's not going to budge your mouse at all which is what you want out of a lightweight mouse like this so all good there now as you do with keyboard reviews and mouse reviews we'll do a sound test real quick of these kale 8.0's yeah as you heard nice and crisp no flex no creaking uh the shell overall nice and sturdy and a quick little mouse feet test for you now when it comes to gaming and my overall you know experience of using this mouse i will say and i'll admit even though i was a g502 user for years and years it took me a while to adjust to this mouse and get used to it for gaming again like i did pretty poorly at first not gonna lie at all it took me a while to adjust to it and there's probably a few reasons at play for why that is um one i just also haven't been gaming too too much over the last few months also you know i'm not used to this kind of shape this ergonomic shape is definitely one you're gonna have to use to really get used to but also something like the mouse gates that might be the biggest reason why i had a hard time adjusting as stupid as that sounds there are g skates underneath or that appear 100 ptfe they're fine they're nice and smooth but i'm just used to the pulsar superglide glass skates i've been using those for a few months and it's what i've been used to on my viper ultimate as well because i put those on so it was funny that like these while again smooth no problems they do feel a lot slower than what i'm used to it could be the reason i'm gonna chalk it up to just a mix of not being used to the shape and the overall glide on my mouse pad i would say though it probably took around a week to fully get used to it but in terms of like functionality wise you know i had no issues sensor was fine it still uses their bamf sensor goes up to 19000 dpi 1000 hertz pulling i believe on this i use around 800 dpi i will say for that thumb rest button which we can call the sniper button as it's known as like i said that was a bit harder to reach than i was expecting and also you have a button directly above that sort of overlapping that area so i accidentally clicked that a few times i found it's just a little too cramped there i will say if that thumb button was like five millimeters back or so probably would have been a perfect fit i just felt like my thumb really took up this whole area there like i could press all four buttons at once if i wanted to and that's not a problem i had on the g502 their forward and backward buttons were seated up a little bit more and they were more flush with the design but yeah no issues on my end no complaints in terms of the overall you know build and performance of how it was during gaming uh the biggest downfall here was was me honestly just having to readjust to this so wrapping this all up with my final thoughts on the model lock overall it is a great mouse and it is an awesome much lighter alternative than the g502 we do not see many mice out there with this shape and design you know that very aggressive gamer ergo design to it there's not a lot on the market especially ones that are this light coming in just around 70 grams like i said my main thing and the issue that i really you know have with it overall is that i wish it was wireless i know they're still following their you know release of the model o and model d then the model d wireless model oh wireless you know i understand they're gonna put this wired one out first and then a wireless one down the road but seeing how it's 20 22 there's so many options out there i wouldn't buy this personally because i would wait for a wireless version now if you don't care about that whether it's wired or wireless if you're one of those people who still just swear by a wired mouse then this is great and you want a mouse like this with the shape and design then no issues at all like i said before sort of rehashing my sort of slight qualms with it with that thumb rest button the thumb rest area being just too clustered and the slight annoyance with the scroll wheel being just a little bit off-center other than that i had no real issues with it it performed great and uh the price is a little bit higher it's it's still very affordable uh because the model o again model d those were 50 at launch this guy comes in at 60. so a 10 surplus here is that a cause of inflation is it because there's a lot more going on to it i don't know but it's 60 instead of 50. a great mouse really great answer to g502 it's just not for me personally i would much rather they waited and put out a wireless version but regardless if you want to check it out i have a listed for you in the description down below and guys that'll wrap it up for my review of the brand new model i hope you all
