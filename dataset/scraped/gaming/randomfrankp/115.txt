what's up guys i'm random frank p back with the episode of cool tech under 50 dollars for march the series will show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and shout out to last month's winners i've been in contact with you so you can claim your tech congrats again and if you want to win something from today all you got to do is hit that thumbs up button down below make sure you're subscribed and comment your favorite item first up is something i'm a huge fan of you all know i love my coffee and this is the dorothy rapid cold brewer which lets you cold brew coffee in just a few minutes versus the 12 to 24 hours you'd usually have to wait to make it this makes a mini tornado right in your home lets you brew in just 15 minutes it's a really simple process too once you have your water in the glass carafe and dorothy is on and spinning you then just add your coffee grounds whatever blend you're using to make your coffee um hint you can also use this for like iced teas or protein shakes as well since you know it's just mixing in with the water and this circulation and the spinning really just enhances the steeping process and speeds up the whole brew it's pretty mesmerizing to watch even if it kind of looks like a poo tornado bill paxton would be proud anyways after bruise for 15 minutes or longer if you want a deeper brew you just let it sit for a minute and use the included plunger and lid to sift through the grounds and it pushes it all into the metal can on the bottom so it's not just like floating around in your coffee and you can just easily empty it after and just like that you have 22 ounces of instant cold brew that didn't take a day to make spring and summer they're gonna be here before you know it i think cold brew is always refreshing then this comes in a penny under 50 definitely worth it i've used it for a while and i love it next up for my keyboard lovers out there i haven't showed off individual switches on this series before and i have two of my favorites here that are just polar opposites we have the thickest of the clicks with box jades and butter on a budget gather on yellows both are complete opposite in terms of sound and feel but for the price i think they're both some of the best options when building a keyboard and if you want to save some money so they're sold in packs of different counts the pack of gatter on yellows was 31. for 110 switches you can get 90 jades for 50 or 65 switches for 40. so it'll depend on the keyboard you're building or swapping out really but like i said when it comes to feel the response i love what these both have to offer jades are a super deep thick click that require 50 grams to actuate with a 3.6 millimeter travel distance but register at 2 millimeters like most switches but unlike most switches the sound of these is just insanely clicky then if we gather on yellow they too require 50 grams to actuate at two millimeters with a four millimeter total travel distance but the real beauty with gataron yellows especially with these milky housings is when you lube them they instantly get more smooth and replicate a feel of ink switches at a fraction of the cost hence the butter on a budget moniker all right so we'll do a sound test now i do have two complete builds with jade switches as well as the lubed gatoron yellow switches so we'll do about 20 seconds for each keyboard starting off with them thick clicks so again if you're building a new keyboard you have a hotspot pcb and you're swapping out stock switches depending on your preference thickness of the clicks smoothest of the smooth when it comes to a budget and you can lube the gadoran yellows i think both are just great options for the price now we have a crazy underrated gaming mouse out there i got this at launch back in october and it is a great option for the price this is the rockab burst pro at 68 grams it still comes in and fits that whole lightweight craze but they do it with a really unique translucent honeycomb inner shell so it's solid on the outer ambi shape shell but yet still cuts weight and this is great for those who hate the cutouts in their mouse here the light shines through and looks pretty cool i think the lighting is all configured in their software and at night time the diffuse shell it looks really nice with the glow rocket does use their own optical switch known as the titan switch so it's fast and accurate um i'd say it's a heavier click in general the mass also uses their phantom flex cable they call it so nice and lightweight flexible as well like a paracord and they use these heat treated feet for the glides on the bottom so it's very slick has a nice smooth glide inside is the rocket owley 16k dpi optical sensor based on the pixar 3389 and i've had no issues with performance like i said before it's ambidextrous it's on the medium to larger size i'd say so ideal if you like claw grip but obviously every hand size and preference is going to be different but you'll feel right at home here so all together i'm a big fan of the burst pro and my one gripe you know my one big con about it as stupid as it's gonna sound is just the fat large dpi button right there in the center um visually hurts me right here now this the price point for this is interesting because uh msrp is 59.99 but amazon has it for 49.99 you know making it fit the series but every week or two it fluctuates so one week you'll find it for 60 one week you'll find it for 50. we got a price chart i'll show you right here you can see how just like i think it's like every two weeks it goes up and down so if you can catch it on sale i definitely recommend it next if you're one of those lucky few to actually have a ps5 dbrand came in clutch with their dark plates which lets you swap out the stock white plates on the sides of the ps5 for their own darker black plates and i think it looks really really nice they pulled it off perfectly and these aren't skins these are actual shells that go on the outside that you swap out the stock white shells with the application is super simple it takes like 15 seconds total to do the swap it's pretty much just like these pegs and pins on the outer shells that you can just you know lift up slide out and then replace them so a really simple process that can definitely elevate the look of your ps5 i think you know just stock how it is with the white and black it looks pretty nice and futuristic but if you want that all nice matte black look nice and stealthy the dark plates are the way to go for just 49.99 and uh even if you do want to get that middle strip you know like where all the i o and stuff is they do sell actual stickers and skins that you can put on it and change out the color and stuff um i know stock is that glossy plastic which i'm not a big fan of so you can go matte you can go white they have it covered for you like i said the plates themselves are 50 bucks the skins are an extra 11 but come on definitely worth it the brand's got you covered and then last but not least is something that you know i saved for last because i've done a video on this probably three or four times and i was contemplating you know just not even doing it for this episode but i figured i'd have to the number one question i get in almost every single video no matter what it is it's about the wallpaper behind me the animated wallpaper you'll see in some videos i have a few different wallpapers yes they're animated it looks pretty interesting like i said i've done three or four videos on it but a quick little hit for you guys today a wallpaper engine 3.99 on steam you can go through it's its own app that you have to buy so it's not like you know an actual wallpaper you just download it is a steam application and they have you know the whole workshop pretty much of hundreds of thousands of different themed wallpapers stock you know just like static picture wallpapers or the nice animated ones that i have and i just get constant questions about the animated ones that i'm always showing off in the background and i will drop the actual link to the splash one that i use but the reason i'm showing this off today is because i recently discovered an option i don't know if it's new or not but they have these color options in the actual app itself which really opens up the possibility of animated wallpapers because it can let you go in and change like the saturation the hue so if you don't like the certain color of a wallpaper and you want to kind of mix it up you can very easily do that and with my blue and red unsplashed wallpaper that i have i can make it all different colors it's just really cool and it lets you really match your wallpaper to your setup theme so a lot of flexibility a lot of them have like sounds and stuff to the wallpaper different speeds so i think with those color options some of the different settings you have for animated wallpapers uh just really is a cool tool to have again number one question i always have i have a link for you down below to my personal unsplash wallpaper that i use down below hope you guys dig it so all right guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for march hope
