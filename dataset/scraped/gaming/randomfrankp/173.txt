what's up guys it's accurate frank p back with episode 225 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 2 25. starting us off today we have robert b and what i like about this one right away is just how uh what's the word i'm looking for like sterile it is like it's super clean in terms of just the white everywhere like carpet walls no scuffs and then you have just the massive pop of color with the mounted tv and the wallpaper on his monitor so checking it out for his desk setup going with the solo display there's a 38 inch ultra gear monitor from lg it's one of their newer gaming releases or it came out within the last year so it's not like brand new or anything but a nice 38 inch ultra wide and something about his glass desk with like the the mirror edges to it and the clear chair it seems very like futuristic i don't know something about it that i really really like when looking at it you don't really see a clear chair and a mirrored desk like this too much but now checking out his peripherals he has the corsair gaming k95 platinum rgb keyboard with logitech g903 hero mouse on a perix extended mouse pad but underneath that is the logitech power play wireless mouse pad for charging that g903 on the fly and then for audio his speakers are the presonus aeris e 3.5 and his primary headphones are the pioneer dj hdj 2000 mark ii i like how both the headphone stand and the speaker stands are coordinated to black and red to kind of set that color theme throughout even everything else primarily white it really makes those two colors pop especially when you have an entire chair that is seemingly red as well and the ottoman now over to the pc this is kept underneath the desk and the case is the cooler master half x i've literally never heard of that but the cpu is got amd ryzen 9 3950x on gigabyte aorus x570 extreme motherboard keeping the cpu cool is the noctua nhu12s it's the chromax version with the black fans and the accents he's got 32 gigs of corsair dominator platinum special edition blackout ram which also i had no idea existed and for his gpu he's got an rtx 2080 ti founders edition with a gtx 1070 as the second there and right next to the setup he has the massive 65-inch lg oled 4k tv the model is the e6 and i'm just really digging the way the entire room came together all white then you have the black and the red accents to really make the setup stand out a bit more just to catch your eye a little bit so i'm definitely digging it next is the return of x sphincter and i believe we had him on in 2017 i want to say and this is a ridiculous over the top 100 steampunk setup and it is really unique in the sense that pretty much everything here is custom or has a sort of diy twist on it to really you know buy into the steampunk theme things from like the copper piping everywhere on the walls the actual lining of all the monitors it's really impressive once you take a deeper and closer look at all the just the passion that went into this so there's obviously a lot of gear we're not going to go over all of it his primary is a 55-inch curved samsung tv with four 27-inch viotek monitors on the outside then if you take a closer look on the left side uh there's actually two more monitors that are lined up with like this point of view of the camera so you can't really see them and those are two 21-inch monitors from asus so he's got seven total displays here looking nuts i'll have everything for you listed down below in terms of his hardware and stuff again i'm not gonna list it all but he's got a logitech g710 keyboard an azio retro keyboard g602 mouse uh the go xlr the elgato stream deck logitech z533 speakers akg k72 headphones like i said i can't read at all we'll be here for an hour uh but that's the the gist of his main peripherals in powering everything he has two different pcs and as you'd expect they are also going to be decked out in the steampunk theme so much attention to detail that went into really customizing and crafting this build and it looks crazy cool so this primary one here inside the ryzen 9 3950x cpu it's the actual thermaltake core x9 case that's obviously modded a bit 32 gigs of g-skill trident z royal ram on an asrock x570 aqua motherboard an rtx 2080 ti all copper custom water cooling and stuff the fittings the the gauges gears inside i just love seeing stuff like this and he also has a secondary mineforge pc he calls it i'll put the specs down below uh but this one i assume is for like the streaming and stuff while the other one is primarily for the gaming so is this gonna be everyone's cup of tea no but damn it you have to appreciate it this is seemingly like a converted garage and it's just all steampunk and i just love the knickknacks and just all the customizing that went into this very very impressive now we've got manny's pixels and i kind of like to play on it like many pixels manny's pixels so we're gonna take a look at the dual setup here ultra wide with an overhead uh the wallpaper like the contour lines pink making them pop and stand out a bit and a massive 80 inch butcher block for the desk all right so for the primary display it is one of samsung's 49-inch ultra wides this is the hcg 90 model with a 50 inch 4k tv from samsung as well and in terms of actual like cable management everything you can see is routed down on the bottom right side towards those logitech oh is it the g560 light sync speakers there so he kind of has you know discreetly hidden behind those to kind of take away from the look of the cables and peep that wall of the collector's hot wheels that are all mounted there now forest peripherals going all wireless pretty much with the g915 keyboard and the g502 lightspeed wireless mouse you can also see the elgato stream deck there and also powering the g502 is the logitech power play yet again got a nintendo switch in the background some pokemon pop figures and also a shelf off the left side with some other collectibles a keyboard just a little space to you know show off some of the more pop culture side of things and then we peep the pc this is the leon lee land landcool 2 mesh case inside the intel i9 9900k cpu with a water cooling kit from ekwb got 64 gigs of core serve engines rgb pro ram on gigabyte z390 or s master motherboard and for the gpu an rtx 2080 founders edition and a cameo by darth maul let me close out this one with a wide shot of the room got some sofas in the back to kick back and watch some tv on that mounted overhead there maybe even some console gaming if you can dock the switch play it like that take a load off netflix and chill so a pretty cool gaming room for sure next we have rbs or as i like to say arby's you want some roast beef sandwiches i know i'm pretty hungry and this setup comes way of the philippines and he says this is also for gaming and for his job freelance photography always love a dual purpose setup that looks as nice as this one you guys know i love me some overhead stacks and you flip the lights off and then it just gets like an icy blue vibe to it so his primary monitor on the bottom is a 29 inch ultra wide from lg with a 24 inch asus panel up top which is 144 hertz so he really could use either one for gaming you know you're playing the game you want the extra screen real estate you use the ultrawide you want the higher refresh rate you're playing fps games go to the top monitor enforced peripherals a nice complimentary duo here with the black and white going along with the theme i'm not too familiar here but i know the company rack is a like uh i don't want to say philippines exclusive but it's very common there but for the keyboard he wrote the r-a-k-i-i-l-i-s mechanical keyboard so i don't know if he meant rock but just wrote rocky then the mouse is the logitech g304 wireless and then for audio he has the phantek hg11 space edition headset with the creative sps a120 speakers kind of tucked behind the ultra wide so really not too effective there then over on the right side we have a really nice looking pc the case is actually the rack hilaya m case again sorry if i'm not pronouncing this properly uh looks like one of corsair's cases we have a ryzen 5 2600 cpu 32 gigs of avexer ram on an rsb 450m motherboard with a zotac amp gtx 1650 gpu so rb coming in with a really nice looking setup and one thing i want to point out is i think those are actually egg cartons mounted above the setup and then painted black and white to kind of act as you know sound proofing foam in a way if that's what that is got to give your props worked out nicely and then last but not least we have brian f with the cozy battle station now i could have sworn we've had brian f on before this setup looks familiar the name bryant f sounds familiar i feel like every week we have a brian f but i went back and did a description search and we've never had a brian f on this series am i going insane someone please validate this for me so for the actual monitor setup here going with the tetra shape we have a dell 24 inch as the primary then on the left side mounted in the vertical orientation is a dell 27 inch and this is all being powered by his dell xps 75 90 15 inch laptop it's got an i7 9750h cpu 32 gigs of ram a gtx 1650 for graphics a 4k touch display so it seems like a pretty capable laptop i know the dell xps ones are very popular popular or popular and then into the peripherals we have a drop control keyboard got some blue and white keycaps from one cap inside it's got kale navy switches got the new logitech mx master 3 mouse and an xbox one controller there is like a secondary peripheral and then mounted underneath his desk for audio digging this with the bare dynamic 770 headphones plugged in and powered by the motu m2 so 100 brian f going with the cozy vibes i'm really liking it i didn't even get to mention the speakers now that i'm seeing them in this last shot they're the audio engine a2 plus on each side of the desk but yes you mentioned in the submission email it's his cozy battle station and that checks out all right guys
