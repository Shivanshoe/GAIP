what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under 50 for the month the series will show off some of the best tech you can find under that price point if you see anything you like in this episode i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but also shout out to last month's winners i commented on your post so you can claim your tech and if you want to win something from today just leave a thumbs up and comment on which you think is most useful now first we have a pair of headphones that packs a punch way above its price tag these are the status audio cb1s people have dubbed these the audio technica m50xs at a third of the price with the 50 millimeter drivers inside these studio monitoring headphones deliver audio exactly how it was intended to sound but to my surprise the sound stage here is a lot more open and expansive than most closed back headphones and yes for gaming they sound phenomenal as well now checking them out i love how simple they look no branding no logos just this gold accent and ring on the cups and it's awesome that they not only fold up and collapse into itself for travel but the ear cups also rotate delay flat on your desk or around your neck and they're lightweight as well as just around 9 ounces inside the box they also come with two nine foot cables and a quarter inch adapter now while using these non-stop past few weeks they pass every test hands down they have a nice warm base but still keeps clarity and detail in the mids and lower end a song i always like to reference when i'm testing headphones is eyes open from five one you can check it out on youtube and that sounds crazy with this these headphones just put you in the middle of whatever you're listening to telling you guys trust me these sound phenomenal for the price and will surely be a massive upgrade if you don't already have a pair of quality cans like you can just look around anyone who knows what they're talking about have all given these glowing reviews they're currently 59 on amazon but using code frank p10 at checkout will knock an additional 10 off to bring these to 49 bucks i got you guys don't worry now going right along with that you guys know i like to do these complimentary product duo's here we have the creative sound blaster g3 a usbc amp and dac for your ps4 your switch your phone obviously your pc this is an audio beast so what this does is give your headphones a boost up to 300 ohms so your headphones should definitely benefit from this and i'd say you probably get around a 30 volume boost with absolutely no distortion but there's a lot more this is going to be awesome if you don't have an amp or a dac already if you don't use a sound card or hell even with laptops because let's be real laptop audio is absolutely ass so checking it out as you can see it's nice and compact you have your headphone volume control and mixer control for balancing your game audio with your chat audio you can monitor your voice independent mic output volume and a mic mute button your inputs are on the front side plus the center eq button which in my opinion is what makes this thing a game changer so this is plug and play no drivers required however there is optional software that lets you really tweak this and get that extra boost out of your headphones or headset inside you can go through and pick between some of the preset eqs they already have from certain genres and even certain games that are eq'd this will let you kind of change up your sound signature but also gives you the ability to create your own eqs whether by fine-tuning the frequencies independently or drawing your own curve it just opens up your audio and takes it to the next level and also one thing they have is this dedicated footsteps mode which does admittedly kind of drown out everything else in game except footsteps i don't like it personally but it works so here in battlefield i could hear some footsteps you know across the way the neighboring house i knew it wasn't the guy with me so here's someone over there of course you know took him out then i had to go all parkour take out the clown in the house behind me so while it's boring the software is great you can also then save your presets to the g3 itself and use this on your switch or your ps4 because by the way it also comes with the usb adapter inside the box there's also different microphone settings inside for cutting back background noise and enhancing your voice this combined with the status audio cb1 headphones i just showed you trust me it's an absolute killer audio setup for just a hundred dollars you will love this duo next we have bischoff cookie butter which is the best four dollars you'll ever spend in your life i mean next we have a drawing tablet i've been using this lately to try to integrate it more into my editing workflow especially great for like photoshop and stuff this model i have here is a bit more expensive but they just released a v2 version of this which is 50. and obviously with a graphics tablet like this you can use it as your primary mouse if you want great for digital art and making content and stuff it's responsive feels natural and i'm really impressed with it i've really enjoyed my time using this for physical features on the right side you have a turnable touch style for zooming or scrolling 12 buttons then up top you have 16 touch zones which can be programmed as well inside the software to be other shortcuts functions macros launching programs you name it so you do have a lot of functionality with this the included stylus as well also like you'd expect you have some extra tips inside the box in case this wears out over time a standing dock for it and with the silos you have 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity so from real fine lines to you know thicker harder lines depending on how hard you press this makes creating art and content again just natural then the quick look for the software all of the buttons and the touch zones can be configured to be whatever you want from mouse presses keyboard presses you have all that flexibility to change it up reassign them really get the most out of your workflow with these macros this one i believe was 70 bucks but like i said the v2 version is 50. now last month i showed off two photography products and they did very well so i figured this month i'd show you two things that i like to use it's definitely a novelty not a necessity that's these metal body caps for your camera you know how lenses have lens caps this protects the sensor on your camera the red one i have is from global dynamics united and the silver and blue is from condor blue again this is not a necessity it's definitely just like a visual novelty to add to your camera especially if you're bringing it with you on the go you're constantly traveling with it you shouldn't have your lens attached to the body obviously this will keep it nice and protected you don't want to mess up your sensor at the same time it'll look nice and cool they were both 40 bucks and i figured you know what the hell i like them maybe you will too and then last but definitely not least is something that i've been wanting and looking for for years but never found it until piketty created it this is a custom macro pad that has a ton of flexibility you'll see what i'm talking about so this macro pad has five buttons plus an aluminum volume dial and the entire macro pad can be mounted which is really what makes this a game changer where it starts to get interesting so before we get into that this does come pre-programmed out of the box mainly for like audio and stuff you know if you think of media keys on your keyboard that's what this does but using a text editor you can change up all the functions it's very simple and we actually have 13 functions built in here so we have the five keys right but if you hold them in you get secondary functions that's 10 then the volume dial scrolling up scrolling down and pressing in this whole thing can be reprogrammed to be any sort of keyboard or mouse function so any sort of key scroll press whatever as well as actual text editing great for volume control obviously photo editing video editing gaming streaming you get the idea but like i said with this being mounted this is what's just what takes to the next level here for ease of access you can mount it underneath your monitor literally have it right there at an arm's reach or what about underneath your desk right there right at your side convenience convenience convenience but another thing i thought about is what if you want it you know right on your desktop here you can put it behind your keyboard depending on how big the forehead of your keyboard is you could even set it on it next to it anything like that and now you have these 13 extra functions right here so a detachable mountable macro pad i saw this on reddit a few months ago happily jumped it on the group i for fifty dollars and uh it answers all my prayers loving this thing from piketty and like i said since it was a group eye it's not currently active right now but if you want to check out his website to be notified for a possible second group buy or any future launches he has i will definitely put that for you in the description down below so you can check it out and guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for july hope you enjoyed and like i said along with this i'll have all the links to the products
