what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we got a first look at an upcoming keyboard from der god this is the fusion a really nice retro wireless mechanical keyboard that's definitely different from a lot of the keyboards out there so we'll check it out today and go for it all give my first impressions in the first look [Music] so I'm sure louder you're familiar with there god we've had some solid keyboard releases over the last year so this upcoming fusion board definitely takes the design turn a bit with this cool retro look to it but I think it's unique with the pewter black and red accented keys a big bold logo and a big old power switch on the right side this just sends you right back to the 80s and while it really doesn't fit in with my aesthetic I can definitely appreciate this and I'm sure a lot of you dig this as well it is a cool design so the fusion has four modes of connectivity to them or for two separate Bluetooth devices noted on Q and W yes for a 2.4 gigahertz wireless connection and Aris for a wired mode over USB C for wireless you just power on the board a pair of two whatever connection and then you're good to go you can now ditch those desktop cables now taking a look inside there are 6 screws on the frame that holds it all together plus an additional three screws on the bottom of the keyboard that are hidden underneath the bumper feet up top and yeah there you have it nothing too crazy going on here just the PCB no foam or anything like that the plate here is aluminum and then the battery pack now I haven't gotten confirmation of the milliamp-hour size of this battery I'd assume justing from their previous wireless keyboards and today's standards is anywhere from 2,500 to 4,000 milliamp hours and since we don't have any RGB or LED lights the battery should last you quite some time before we have to charge it again I will say the top and bottom housings of the fusion is 100% plastic you know so if you do take it apart just be careful and when you're putting it back together you do have to physically snap the the bottom lip here the top cover onto the bottom housing so it fits back into place nice and snug so in my unit here I am cherry brown switches and yes durgadas going full cherry on this release with black blue red brown speed silver silent black and silent red options available to pick from me personally not the biggest fan of these brown switches but I'll manage now another thing I really respect about their god is that they factory Lube they're stabilizers the spacebar left shift backspace and Enter key are all lubed you can see here in the close-up shot with the spacebar see some residue showing and stuff but he looked not only the support bar but the inside of the stem as well this is pretty much just gonna cut down on a lot of rattle it's gonna feel a lot more smooth on these keys and that a lot of companies do this for their customers select ducky keyboards Leopold for Miller boards they're the only ones that completely think of right now to do this and as we always do got a sound test for you with the cherry brown switches inside so as you heard now too bad sounding for tactile brown switches inside of an all plastic housing but those loop stabilizers are really doing work especially with no foam and no further modifications it sounds really good overall now obviously we're gonna talk about gaming with this of course that's what I primarily tested it with but I want to point something out because with testing you look at the door got a fusion in this colorway by the way they also have different colorways available I saw like a blue one an orange one but I like this colorway the best out of those it is a damn near perfect match with the extra Phi m4 it's practically the same exact colorway all across the board and it just fits that retro theme 110 percent here pretty good duo I'll put this down below if you want to check it out as well so like I said circling back to connectivity and using this one thing that kind of tricked me was under the actual durga logo that's where the two four gigahertz wireless dongle is I thought they just forgot to include it but it's Calais under there nice and sneakily I did test it out on all three the connectivities with wired Bluetooth and wireless with the dongle and I had no issues whatsoever do you want to go wireless obviously you unplug it turn it on you press function and E hold it for a few seconds it'll start the pair and the dongles plugged in it'll just connect for you and while I set them up the biggest fan of Browns I'd never really use them you know in depth for gaming and stuff other than just testing out other keyboards that had those it held up just fine I didn't notice any lag no significant delay or hiccups when I was gaming which is obviously gonna be a good thing so for those of you wanting a wireless mechanical keyboard with a really unique look this has got you covered however with a keyboard with this unique aesthetic I do think a nice custom cable would look really nice with this my said that was like coiled once there just to kind of add to that 80's look like all cables are coiled back then but yeah the dur got fusion here and the extra Phi M for a match made in heaven so as far as I know this is a very early release it's coming to Kickstarter very soon and that's really all information I have about it like I said I have reached out to them since a few emails has follow-ups to get more specs about it but I don't really know anything more cuz I never heard back from them but judging from their current landing page this will be on Kickstarter like I said three different colorways and have all those cherries switch options and it's seeming like the early bird price is $99 which is gonna be half off of the seemingly retail price of $200 wouldn't recommend it at 200 just cuz that's a hefty price for this but at $100 a no-brainer for a really unique keyboard that is just definitely gonna stand out and be a a nice piece on your desktop if you love the retro vibe like I said this nails it and you gotta appreciate a unique keyboard with factory lubed stabilizers good job they're gone so yeah I'll put the link for it down below if you want to check it out as well as like I said before the link to the perfectly matching extra Phi m4 now to wrap it up if you
