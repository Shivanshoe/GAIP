what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under 50 dollars for september one of the greatest months of the year this is a series we show off some of the best tech you can find under that price if you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but also shout out to last month's winners i commented on your comment from last month so you can claim your tech and as we always do to give back if you want to win something from today all you have to do is make sure you're subscribed i'm obviously only going to pick subscribers drop a thumbs up down below and also leave a comment on your favorite product and why you like it now first up today we have a brand new upgrade to the very popular boom pro microphone this is the new boom pro x from v-moda not only is the microphone capsule itself a new upgrade with it being unidirectional but now you can swap out the mic shield with five different colors so you want to sort of mix and match it to your setup or a certain color theme it's a minor thing for sure yeah but you know how it is nowadays with aesthetics now like the original the boom pro x is only compatible with a headset or pair of headphones has a removable 3.5 millimeter cable the mic then plugs directly into the ear cup and now acts as a pass through giving you a built-in mic and these are great because if you have a favorite pair of headphones for example you can now turn them into a headset because we all know the quality of the average gaming headset out there microphones are usually booty okay so now is the mic test for the boom pro x you could hear how it sounds plugged directly into my shp 9500 open back headphones it's just an absolutely killer value here and it's going to sound better both headset wise and microphone wise than most gaming headsets on the market uh just a great combo and again you need to have headphones to have a 3.5 millimeter removable cable so you can plug this in and now use as a pass-through and a microphone the boom pro x does in-line controls for like muting your mic you got a volume rocker on the side it comes with two cables as well one's an extender and one's a splitter and with it being now unidirectional instead of omnidirectional you can gauge how it does and eliminating any background noise so you're typing or you know gaming and stuff uh whether it's streaming or talking your friends on discord just see how it does eliminating me typing on a keyboard literally right in front of me with these tactile holy panda switches so very good value for 45 bucks if you need a microphone and also i am the glob go gab glob the schwabble dabble gobble wobble next up we have a smart home edition and that's this 20 smart dimmer that replaces your stock light switch and tell me why the switch is more satisfying a tactile than like any mouse i've ever used that's nice so installation is very simple i'm no electrician or anything but as a homeowner you learn a thing or two around the house this was cake although i would only recommend buying this if you're confident you can actually do the swap but if you're like 12 years old maybe this isn't for you this isn't call of duty if something goes wrong you won't respond but when you swap your stock light switch with the new one you now have the ability to dim your lights and control your lighting from your phone and the reason i did this is because part of the studio i had this installed i always forget to turn those lights off because it's not a part of the main panel as the rest of the lights in the studio so now i can shut them down remotely on my phone or have it set to like a timer or have siri do it automatically with the apple shortcuts another reason i bought this is because it's cheaper and more affordable at only twenty dollars it makes just more sense to buy a smart dimmer versus buying individual smart light bulbs themselves which at the end of the day would cost like over a hundred dollars versus just a 20 here i just can't tell you how many times i come down the next morning and i left those set of lights on because they're not a part of the main studio like i said so now controlling my phone if i want to dim them you know i can do that as well to get certain lighting for a certain shot also very very handy and it's just as i said 20 bucks much more affordable than buying individual smart light bulbs now coming up next is a mouse pad and yes i know a mouse pad isn't technology but it's for your tech so it still fits the series don't cry about it and the new razer strider mouse pads are a really nice texture and surface for gaming these are already compared to the artisan high-end mouse pads if you're familiar so the strider is available in two sizes this is the 940x410 extra extra large extended mouse pad i'm always a more extended person myself so that's the one i've been using but if you're limited in desk space or you just want a smaller one we have a 450 by 410 millimeter one as well uh just really loving this so much so i was actually going to do a dedicated review but how many people would actually want to hear me talk for 10 minutes about a mouse pad so i figured i'd include it here instead now what i really like about the strider is the surface as a hybrid mouse pad it's going to give you sort of different properties in your standard cloth pad when you take a look at the braiding of the strider surface you'll see it's an even x and y axis for the breeding so to give you a nice smooth glide that provides speed and low friction for your mouse check out this macro shot and that even braid means no matter if you glide your mouse up and down left to right figure eights 360s whatever it's gonna be a nice smooth and consistent glide all across the surface another benefit to the surface is the fact that it's warp resistant and water repellent so if you're clumsy and you not go over a bottle of water you're gonna see the water beat up and not fully absorb into the material and actually left the water on my mouse pad for two hours during this time lapse here you can see how well it does at keeping the water out and a pad like this is often great for people in humid climates it's supposed to not absorb humidity either i don't live in a human climate myself i'm also not like sweating and sticking to my mouth but as it is so i can't really speak to that but i mean come on got your own wormhole from donnie darko for me personally i didn't have any issues transitioning over to a new material either from using my rubberized madcatz glide 38 for the past two years but one thing that i really like about this pad is the added control you have so you can hear in battlefield i knew this guy was gonna jump down so it's just a quick little flick i could estimate his jump speed and shoot him as he's falling versus where on my glide 38 pad that had more of a harder surface to it the accuracy is going to be harder to sort of nail consistently does that make sense i still love the glide 38 don't get me wrong but again this smooth low friction hybrid surface here is definitely a nice change up so again if you're looking for a nice new mouse pad upgrade and you're still just using a standard cloth pad change that it'll definitely be worth it you have the two sizes with the large and the extended version and then next is gonna be sort of a two-in-one here because i'm gonna use one product with the other we have the whirlwind fx atom 60 mechanical keyboard but i'm also going to be putting on the brand new razer phantom keycap set and these this is the killer duo in terms of aesthetics and really improving the look of your desktop for a really nice looking keyboard so the phantom keycaps i showed these off when they came out a few weeks ago but these are really cool and it's razer's take on like a pudding keycap set for example but here the sides still have a nice glow to it with rgb turned on the difference is inside of it being like white or transparent it's a more smoky gray texture then when the lights are off or you see it from like a side shot for example it's gonna be nice and stealthy looking but then you put the rgb on and then it's gonna glow it's gonna be nice and diffused because that you know charcoal see-through sort of smoked grey bottom to the keycap but it really provides the best of both worlds stealth and then full crazy rgb and they sell this set in both black and white it's the same thing with white you know so when the lights are off and stuff you can have it all matte not seen in the characters when you turn it on the rgb just gonna look crazy with the white so it's cool they made it in both the color options but the reason i want to combine these keycaps with the atom 60 is because a the keyboard falls under 50 bucks so it's gonna fit this series i personally love a 60 form factor so here's another option for you and the keyboard is pretty low profile overall so the keycaps you can see are exposed on the sides and around the back which again with the white plate underneath and combined yet again with the keycaps it's going to provide you a crazy rgb show if you choose to go that route but this keyboard does two things in particular that are really really cool first up with their signal rgb software you have just a crazy amount of rgb effects to pick through whether it's like syncing to certain games or having like an ambient effect where whatever color is going on your screen going on the keyboard there's different presets or different games you can download so it's like syncing to that and the effects of what's going on in your game but this keyboard also has a 3 000 hertz pulling rate versus the standard 1000 hertz pulling rate on most keyboards out there so this is a lot quicker and efficient and reporting to your pc at 3 000 hertz versus 1 000 hertz in this unit i have gathered on red switches it's also available in gataron browns and blues it's not hot swap but you do have those three to pick from all right so now we'll do a really quick stock sound test you could hear how it sounds with the gataron red switches again all unmodded so both really great when combined together with the 50 atom 60 and the 35 razor fan so both just really great products when combined together here to give you a crazy keyboard with the 50 atoms 60 and the 35 razer phantom keycap set and guys that'll wrap it up this episode of cool tech under 50 for
