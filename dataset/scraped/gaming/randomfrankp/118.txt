what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out my top five favorite tech items of the month sponsored by oculus now we got five total things to go over here and these are things i've just been using lately that i haven't really showed off to you guys that have been some of my favorites lately so we'll go over them all if you see anything you like i'll have them listed for you in the description down below so you can check them out now first up is a keyboard that i love from ducky and this is i think a great step for the overall keyboard market this is their year of the rat keyboard they collab a popular taiwanese graffiti artist known as bounce and he pretty much designed the whole thing which gives it that you know very unique look usually keyboards don't look like this but it's got a few cool things going on so first off in terms of the overall design it's their standard 60 layout you know it's still their one two mini but obviously with their bounce collab you have those accents and sort of novelties on the keyboard itself that make it really stand out now yes it might be a bit you know in your face the font might not be for you it kind of like resembles that graffiti or like sharpie look on a keycap but that's not the point to this keyboard there's two things in particular that i think is a really good thing like i said before for the keyboard market first off is the fact that this keyboard has a hot swap pcb so in this unit i have cherry red switches but with them being hot swap you can freely take those switches out and then replace them if you have switches maybe you don't like linears you like clickies you can swap out these red linears then put in some box jade switches some royal navy switches it's up to you now to customize your keyboard in a whole new way something we haven't seen from ducky and that leads me to the bigger picture about this keyboard is i think the year of the rat one too many here is gonna be a bit of a trendsetter in a way so for example you don't see big companies like corsair razer steelseries have a hot spot pcb they don't have a single hot top keyboard that we can pick from so the fact that ducky is doing this and giving us a popular feature with a big brand like this i think it's only going to pave the way and have companies open their eyes more and hopefully give us a hotspot keyboard later on down the line and i say that because ducky is a very popular brand when it comes to sort of changing things up so for example the one two mini itself when that launched uh the original version you know 60 keyboards were like not unheard of but they were not common they were not the norm they were not popular at all that keyboard still to this day one of the top selling most popular and now you're starting to see a bunch of keyboard companies a bunch of big brands put out their own 60 keyboard so i think it's doing a lot of great things and also while the appearance and aesthetics of the year they're at version might not be for everybody i hope it so encourages more companies out there to take a risk for the design give us some you know cool keycaps other design choices to it other than a boring 60 with just ugly keycaps um so i just really think this keyboard as a concept and as a theory is what's really excited me about the future of keyboards not so much the tangible keyboard itself but what ducky is doing really next i can put some gaming stuff for a minute how about an alternative to a keyboard which is this crazy looking gamepad this is called the azeron classic a just ridiculous looking all 3d printed custom keypad that has crazy features i'm going to keep saying crazy because look at it that's the best word to describe this so obviously in terms of aesthetics and you know just visuals it mimics that of like a hand right but built in not only do you get a analog thumbstick you get an additional joystick plus 26 individual programmable keys so with just five fingers you have 26 keys plus the two thumb six available to you it comes in a bunch of different colors i just have it in the blue variety here but on their site they literally have just tons to pick from and like a customizable it is each of the fingers can be spaced out to you know kind of fit your hand size or your grip i guess you could say you can extend the keys bring them closer to you anything to fit your hand and what's really interesting about this is in order to press down or actuate those 26 keys it's not like a key switch like on a keyboard for example they use key switches you would find in a gaming mouse so they're easy to press to actuate nice and crisp i'll do a little sound test you can hear real quick now unfortunately you're gonna need to spend a lot of time in their software to fully go through and program this you know assign all the keys to what you want to you know hit in game just take time it's a lot i understand all different keys all different functions so reprogramming it might take some time uh but once you start to get used to it muscle memory kicks in pretty intimidating you know there's a lot going on but it's worth really fine-tuning all the keys and making them what you want them to be now with something like this that has a joystick you can use that to you know fully move around in game kind of like you would on console like the ps5 or the xbox so this is going to give you a lot of options to game one of two ways you can either game like that with your thumb on the joystick moving it around as you would full 360 then use your four other fingers to just whatever you want to assign those other keys to be you can use those fingers to take advantage of that i can see this being good for new pc gamers people transitioning from console to pc gaming this could help you out that way you can also then assign those three main fingers with your ring finger middle and pointer finger as wazzed and try to assign and learn gaming that way so yes it's intimidating it's a lot to learn but i think considering you have all these keys all these functions literally right at your fingertips next to them beside them under them above it it's insane not only for gaming but this could be just an insane keypad for photo editing video editing um i don't even know and it is just honestly one of the coolest pieces of tech i've come across in a while so needed to show it off for you guys next step at number three where did i put it oh yeah but here the whole time we have the oculus quest 2. like i said in the beginning this video is sponsored by oculus but all the thoughts and opinions are my own the quest 2 is a wireless vr headset came out a few months ago but i am loving not being tied down gaming freely like this is really cool so with the quest 2 you get some good hardware upgrades which is always important the two lcd panels inside have 50 more pixels than the original quest coming in at 1832 by 1920 there's also 90 hertz support coming soon for specs you're using a snapdragon xr2 platform which greatly improves on cpu and gpu usage as well as six gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage in this unit it's also a bit lighter as well so there's no pressure points on my head when i'm using it and also their touch controllers have also been redesigned with the buttons joysticks and triggers it's just very natural and ergonomic to use while you're gaming but also one thing they added that i think is really cool is the fact that the quest to itself uses sensors to track your hands now i just got this update and it's been really cool so you can literally use your hands and your fingers it tracks it all real time you can grab the navigate menus pinching is like pressing a on their touch controller the key word here is everything just feels natural it's really cool before gaming everything just looks so much more crisp now with the 64 gigs of internal storage have a few games downloaded and it's really cool to be able to just you know stand up some games let you walk around if you set a boundary have that freedom had that space but another thing that's really cool with this is if you do prefer you know more detailed gaming and stuff and you do want to be tied down you can use the oculus link and tether this to your pc and in there you can go in and play games you have in your oculus library your steam library for example so i can kick back and play something like half-life alex or dirt rally 2 which has been just crazy to sit down and play literally just like while i'm driving around you can look all around inside the car look around the world behind you it's been just so fun to have both those options either you know wireless gaming or with oculus link the quest 2 has definitely been a really cool upgrade i feel like once half like alex came out it kind of revived vr a bit so i've been happy to sit down get some gaming done in these new dimensions of a different world now you're probably wondering what in the world this is this is two separate products here that i picked up but they go hand in hand we're just on head we have the focally lex headphones and the momento mori amplifier which is this all cnc'd aluminum skull that is a crazy powerful amp in addition to being a pretty interesting conversation piece if you will but yes this serves a purpose more than just scaring children and you now you guys know me by now this is like not my aesthetic at all it's the complete opposite if anything but it just looks so crazy and different than any other amplifier i've seen so i wanted to check it out imported it from the netherlands and man it is just honestly overkill it's way too powerful for my needs with the focalx headphones which i'll show you in a minute i only have the amp at like 20 volume and it's still peaking the drivers here so it's just not necessary in any way but like i said it's just so different you have ports on the back side for your dac speakers sono cables but the main quarter inch jack in the front is for your headphones also serving purpose on the front is the input dial on the left and the right is the volume dial you can see when it's powered on the eyes glow red if the level meters dancing in each eye yeah definitely a one of kind product but one of my latest pickups from massdrop now just known as drop is their collab with folk out to bring the alex headphones i got these right after the holidays and let me tell you they are beautifully made and sounding most of you know i always prefer an open back design especially for gaming in the way the sound stage is widened here everything just sounds more natural and immersive rather than it sounding like i have drivers hanging off my head even though i technically do the soundstage vlax just makes you kind of think twice pretty much most other open back headphones i've tried kind of sound like you know the sound is coming from mainly your peripheral vision if you want to think of it that way some are wider yes but these really replicate that full 360 sound stage and it still maintains presence and clarity in the vocals you have a bright treble response which makes everything sound lively and crisp with certain instrumentals bass does take a bit of a hit kind of naturally due to the open back design but i'd still say it's well controlled overall it sounds better with music than it does gaming and yes getting with these has still been a blast almost literally because again just the sound stage and overall presence of these headphones make everything sound so alive and open like i'm literally there in the battlefield with everything going on around me they were a bit on the heavier sides due to the construction but they use these super soft microfiber pads that are like clouds on my head so kind of makes up for the weight are these my favorite headphones of all time no are they perfect for my needs no but there is something to be said for an open-back pair of headphones that just does sound stage right and kind of lets me you know zone out in the world and take in my gameplay and the obvious of that world even for listening to music again because each pair of headphones are going to sound different so i've definitely just been enjoying these lately they deserve some love the last but not least has been a really great addition to my editing workflow this is the loop deck live and you can kind of say it's like a stream that competitor in a way it's got 12 programmable lcd screens six knobs eight buttons all programmable switch it all up and when it comes to video editing this is definitely cool you may be familiar with loop deck they make other similar editing tools i really like this one because it's small and compact i'd say it's right about the same size as the regular elgato stream deck but still has a ton of functionality with the extra dials and buttons built in and with it being named loop deck live they really targeted this more for streamers than anything i feel so whatever you're using this for you're gonna have a lot of flexibility and control for me i pretty much just use this for editing in premiere and it took a long time like i'm still learning the learning curve is larger than your mom but having those precise dials to tune through color correction jog the timeline frame by frame it's very very useful for the 12 screens they're capacitive so you get a nice sort of vibrating response when you press them and everything can be programmed in their software now the software itself is probably the biggest con about this again since there's just so much you can do with it it takes a lot of time to learn a lot of trial and error to go through and correctly assign everything that you want to do thankfully just built into the software itself it does already have a lot of preset layers and functions for certain apps that it's compatible with so you can go through if you have any of those everything is different and unique to the certain software so like premiere photoshop ableton chrome spotify it's all there and it automatically launches those layers when you open said software but making custom functions is kind of where it gets tricky uh since there's a literally like a function for everything you can think of on your pc and for every program going through and finding the right one then assigning it that's where it gets a bit much one of the cool things about the custom functions is that you can create your own icon to be displayed on the loop deck live while it's only possible now with custom functions uh thankfully they said they're gonna be adding that in the software to be done for you know anything you can add your custom icon which is gonna be cool because that way for like color corrections and like the panels and stuff having a visual logo instead of just text everywhere it's gonna be nice i'm not messing up you know the wrong curves 24 7. so again much like that azeroth on gamepad the time spent using this and perfecting the functions and muscle memory is going to pay off huge in the end the more i use it the more i get used to it the faster i'll be able to fly through color grades in edits with precision so alright guys that'll wrap it up for my video showing you some of my favorite tech of this month sponsored by oculus if you want to check anything out i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below if you'd like to sort of video let me know i was thinking maybe doing them monthly quarterly
