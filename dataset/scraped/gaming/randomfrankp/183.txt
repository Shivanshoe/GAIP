ah yeah all right forget that what's up guys i'm random frank p and today i'm pretty pumped because we're gonna be kind of upgrading my main pc you know the rig you see behind me with the asus rog strix 2080 ti in all white this edition came out around the holidays i'm pretty sure so finally got my hands on it it's gonna fit in perfectly with the build we have a white motherboard as well a new aio so i figured why not give it a little bit of a facelift you know and also we're going to be going vlog style for this video because i haven't done a vlog in a long time so i figured you know why not got a new mic i'm testing as well but first a message from our sponsor this video is sponsored by asus powered by nvidia geforce rtx get your foot in the door with next gen graphics and performance with dedicated ray tracing cores in the ai powered dlss 2.0 and watch your games come to life i know my nephews have been going on and on about how cool minecraft rtx looks at ray tracing enabled and it really does make a graphical difference for those who want that extra eye candy in game the lighting reflections just the general atmosphere in game all get that next gen bump powered by nvidia touring asus and their 20 series rtx graphics card lineup provides not only the most advanced gpu architecture for gamers but also reliability as asus graphics cards are manufactured through an auto extreme process that's 100 automated what does that mean for you well they're not made by hand so in the end there's a stricter quality inspection and control process giving your pc the edge and reliability if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below okay so for the new hardware we're gonna be rocking the prime z390a motherboard which does naturally have white accents with some rgb uh but since our current motherboard has like a little oled screen on it with like temperatures and stuff we're going to be losing that with this so i'm going to be using the kraken z360 which has a completely customizable little display on here you can show like graphics temperatures all that stuff real time then obviously the eye candy with the whites 2080 ti let's do it well before we break down the old pc i was hoping this would have been downloaded in time i wanted to check out the new flight simulator i feel like that would be really sick for benchmarks and stuff but for the past like 30 minutes it's been stuck at 87.68 gigs which apparently is a common issue but while we wait for that to kind of you know restart just to kind of show you what we had going on before if this could focus again there's nothing wrong with this pc i just wanted to visually kind of upgrade with an all-white gpu which would look really really nice and if you remember when i first built this last year the current motherboard i have actually hey let's let's just not work autofocus the current motherboard i have is actually custom painted white but i've had some very very strange issues with this not related to the paint job so i just wanted to get a new kind of motherboard to avoid those issues and i'll show you what i'm talking about okay so i have a very strange issue with the compatibility of the motherboard and my lassie two big external hard drive it's 16 gigabytes i have it over here it's plugged in and it backs up all my video files and stuff but just for some strange reason whenever that's plugged in to the pc and i turn it on it wants to just override my nvme drive or an ssd and it tries to boot from there every single time even though in the bios i have it configured to obviously boot from my nvme first and it always says gpt header corruption so i have to go in override it again and then boot just manually from the nvme drive but it's been doing this every single time and i looked it up online and it's actually a pretty common issue for whatever reason so it's very annoying and i knew it was that because whenever i unplug the drive and then reboot the pc it boots up fine so there's just weird compatibility issues with my external hard drive so you go over to boot it's still the number one boot option which is my nvme drive so i have to go in override it again press that and then we'll boot i just don't get it [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right moment of truth i didn't manage any of the cables in behind i'm hoping everything turns on as it should fan one fan two fan three but the top fans are not that's what i was concerned about because with the actual phanteks frame oh there we go they're going and all the nice okay so what i was and i'll turn those down those are pretty loud uh the main thing i was concerned about with this was since i had to swap the fans and the fan frames that i had to give the rgb like halo around the fans i needed to upgrade to the 140s because the previous one was a it was a 360 rad so it was three 120s this is a 280 so i had to get bigger fans as well as the bigger fan frames thankfully i had those in my storage but then it when it came to connecting everything it just gets very confusing with all the different the phanteks plugs making sure that goes in with the actual fans and then syncing it to the digital rgb on the case for phanteks okay okay we're good we're good all right just powered it on so getting devices ready come on boop boop listen as long as i could boot this without the gpt corruption header we'll be good come on you're still getting ready still getting ready yes the time's off but that's not a big deal this is just looking super nice i'll have to go through and manage some of the cables and stuff now but man loving that all-white gpu and now i can go in and configure the aio and stuff as you can see it has the temp right there on it this is just super nice but i'm hungry all right so i'm running out to grab a bite to eat and a coffee and possibly a haircut time permitting what time is it it's like not even three yes yeah i got a lot of time today uh pc is coming out good so far sorry if the exposure's all messed up in here uh but i also want to take a second to appreciate the biker shirt in front of me the back of it reads whiskey not for wimps not whiskey isn't for wimps whiskey not for wimps that's is that like his personal saying you think just whiskey not for wimps all right well that was a massive fail because the coffee place closes at 1pm and the barbershop wasn't open so just able to grab some lunch um what's the point of even vlogging i don't know all right so i'm not going to make this a vlog about food but i'm very interested because i ordered a blc but the place i ordered it from is like vegan and like gluten-free and stuff instead of bacon it's coconut bacon so it's coconut it tastes like bacon berry see how this tastes wow it literally tastes exactly very surprising good stuff like if i didn't know it was coconut i wouldn't i'm not a vlogger so in terms of an actual performance upgrade that we're going to be getting now with the white 2080 ti it's not huge but it does make it a bit easier out of the box to get more out of it i know the the boosted power target is 300 watts and with that you get up to 1770 megahertz for the clock speed versus the 1665 megahertz on the stock edition so in reality you're probably going to get what like an extra 5 fps but still that could make a difference in some games and titles depending on what resolution you're playing at um but it is a boost and i know it might seem you know stupid because it's not that complicated but i'm gonna chalk it up as a personal win because you just have no idea how bad i thought this was gonna end up in terms of the fantax fan frames because just with the actual phanteks neon light strip i have inside the actual phantax light strip that's integrated into the actual case and then like i said with the fan frames having them all synced and hooked up properly and daisy chained i thought i was gonna miss something or not have something hooked up uh but thankfully everything was good to go so when i plugged it in it was all synced automatically and then again with the front of the phantex case is the little button pretty much you can control all the lighting and switch it up but i thought for sure i was gonna miss something and then it would all just be thrown off you know it's like christmas lights when one of the lights is out then nothing works i thought for sure it was going to be like that but thankfully that wasn't the case all right so i haven't used cam software probably since like 2018 and it's definitely improved just downloaded it for the aio it looks very clean a lot more user friendly but going through under lighting lcd display yes and here's where we can completely configure everything so right here is the radial radial fill which is the cpu reading um if you go up top here cpu temperatures oh there's a decent amount so the first one is gif so if you wanted to load a gif up there something with my logo maybe i could put that on now it's just like a little stock one um dual infographic okay has both cpu and gpu temps which is pretty useful and then you can go in obviously if i want to change the background i could have it white uh reading let's just make black logo we'll also do black uh visualization can you go like red okay so for a jeep cpu let's just make it like let's just make them both blue okay and yeah so very easy to customize okay then you have the cpu temp and i think with this yeah so okay so for the two visualization colors you could like have like a gradient effect going on uh cpu liquid temp the gpu uh cpu load clock speed gpu oh this carousel effect all right what's this now this looks kind of like the stock effect pretty much yeah so i guess like the stock effect to the actual carousel um tai chi tai chi is kind of like the it's kind of like their old logo or their their old kind of infinity sort of mirror on the aio which i assumed they would have had in here but i guess not because in the last effect spectrum wave which is just like an rgb ring around it i could have sworn somewhere i saw an effect where it was like the infinity mirror from their old aios but as oh maybe it was a gift someone made i don't know i don't know but i like the tai chi effect that looks pretty cool if i could put my logo in the middle maybe or honestly just keep on the dual infographic because that's very very useful nice very easy to configure too gotta give props to nzxt for making their software miles miles better because that's the reason why i stopped using nzxt um i got rid of their old aio because the cam was just constantly having issues and then i used the deepcool coolers for the past two years now and now i'm back to nzxt alright guys i think at this point that should pretty much wrap it up um again i could have done this you know on my own but i figured you know why not just do a vlog bring you guys along with me i don't vlog enough and i know people do like it every now and then so i figured i'll just make a quick little video about it and i want to hear your thoughts few things do you like the new microphone does it sound good do you like the new pc you know visually aesthetically do you dig the new hardware upgrades uh let's see do you have you ever had coconut bacon i want to know all your thoughts unfiltered down below well don't do unfiltered you know be nice at the same time and if you want to check anything out from this video i'll put it all in the description uh in case you wanna you know pick it up yourself on random frank p hope you enjoyed have a good day
