what's up guys i'm random frank p and today for this episode of room tour project we're gonna switch it up a little bit okay i've been doing this for over six years now since the beginning of 2015 and you know views have kind of been leveling off and getting stagnant a little bit i'm not enjoying it as much you're not enjoying it as much so i wanted to flip it around a little bit now every now and then on rtp we would do rapid fire editions where instead of just showing off you know 10 photos and focusing on specs and hardware i would show off one or two photos and just talk about what we like about the setup so for today i want to do more of a general reaction type video doing reactions to submissions from twitter our discord channel you can join if you haven't already and some submissions from reddit and stuff so like i said more chilled relaxed laid back more of a reaction type video to room tour project episode 259 okay first up we have samurai today digging the triple monitor set up here in that tie fighter orientation you know the primary with the two verticals on each side lots of red rgb going on to an all black and white setup obviously with his name being samurai samurai themed uh we're not going to like go over you know a bunch of specs and stuff obviously but i'll point out some of the things that i like we'll talk about them real quick i could see in the back i'm digging the pc that looking like the fantastic evolve shift 2 i believe it's called so a nice and compact itx build in the pack uh kind of on a taller side but still looks great elgato stream deck right underneath the primary monitor for quick and easy macros and all this stuff but yeah digging the whole samurai theme you know you call yourself samurai you're going to have the wallpapers the prince black red and white going on um desk space might be a little bit cramped there with that sort of l-shaped sort of extender on the left side it looks like but either way digging a space digging the setup samurai next up this one is crazy this is from the fine print definitely check out his youtube channel if you haven't already because this setup is out of his van okay i reached out to him on reddit i tried to get him on the show i haven't heard back so i figured i would just you know promote him as it is because this is crazy cool the inside looks gorgeous with all that wood uh just really nice and he can just pull up wherever because again he lives out of the van here has to set up right there he can be gaming in the middle of the woods great scenic views i love how he transformed this van into you know this mini house pretty much and can still pull off having a nice looking setup here the fine print really really awesome and really creative 100 check out his channel now is otaku man boy i believe this one was from our discord channel yeah discord down below if you want to join and this is just crazy okay um lots of things we probably can't fully show off in good detail or else we'd be demonetized you can take a look for yourself but yeah the nanoleaf panels the rgb the nudity kind of this is crazy again triple monitor setup and also kind of in the tie fighter orientation yet again i believe so yeah it looks like that but tons of collectibles ton of anime manga gente hentai i don't know what it is but otaku man boy this is a crazy gaming room so much going on very bright vibrant colors now we're gonna move on to oh sneaky this one also from discord much more scaled back and chill here that more clean and minimal vibe um last week we had a clean and minimal setup edition so check that out if you haven't already this would have fit in perfectly digging all the off-white wallpaper but a very clean desk setup got both a pc and a laptop here i look at that case that's i'm believe the meschalicious messalicious let's say that right uh from cooler master yeah so again a smaller itx build and the more vertical orientation here but still pretty scaled down definitely a nice looking set up here oh sneaky and um still you know with the nanoleaf panels up top but just four of them not overdoing it not overkill now we've got nyx and this yet again could fit in perfectly with our clean and minimal setup edition loving the plant off to the left side really nice looking wallpaper here monitor light bar organized desktop and got some little car figurines up there or car figurines you know what i mean you know what i mean but little things to add around the room to make it more you know personable to the setup so digging how just was gonna say confined but that's not what i mean uh refined you could tell this was dialed in everything here you can tell was done with the purpose and with a point and it looks really great speaking of which we got june 2 san june tucson and this is cooler the more you look at it okay and i wish i had more photos i wish we had more to take a look at here in closer detail three monitors you see the primary one you look underneath it has an elgato stream deck another macro pad and then on each side are two smaller monitors and this whole thing is like a crazy looking command center okay then you look up top i don't know what it is those two big things but a bunch of different cables going in places we could take a closer look if we dial in a little bit um i don't know what they're for but it's executed really nicely with these hdmi ports usb um and like the aviator cables we can just plug things in and then go to different places so it's labeled keyboard mouse numpad hub it's all somehow ran through up here i believe which is super creative and looks really cool you guys know i love me some knobs macro pads all that stuff and this from june 2 sand is awesome really really really cool looking moving right along this one from max glaze this is making me want to give a max glaze as well shouldn't have said that but you know what i mean it's a really nice looking setup i mean come on it's got that more moody tone to it with like the um it's black like a very deep in color could be even like a navy or a midnight paint to the wall but that complementing uh the wooden desktop with the orange rgb lighting and stuff the orange accents and the wallpaper very complementary uh very stealthy but like modern and classy at the same time so max glaze man this is something else really digging it looking like some nice peripheral choices as well uh we again again have the uh looking like the lifx beam i think it is with that sort of accent light strip on the wall behind it because i know yeah lifx has one govi has one but this one with that clean right angle pretty sure it's the uh lifx beam yeah either way looking great looking great now we've got josh with a triple monitor setup this one you can i guess you can call no you can't call it tie fighter because it is triple monitors but those very small monitors on each side of that ultra wide don't know the size of those maybe like a 15 inch because the height vertically matches the same exact height as that ultra or the ultrawide monitor almost had a stroke there what was that about so this is really well done really well thought out and just kind of looking at like a lot of the gear and hardware he has going on um great stuff loving the custom keyboard there i don't remember the exact name of that keyboard oh i even asked him on because this was from our discord again i even asked him on there and i don't remember what it is but i'm digging the wooden case with the rgb underneath so visually with the wooden accents still fits in there it's rare to see a nice rgb case i mean a nice wooden case that still features rgb but bummer i can't remember what it is uh regardless looking nice all around again the nice orange hues and stuff always look really great in a setup and this following that perfectly moving over we got gaming vibes 2 k yes not not 100 getting gaming vibes because the first thing i see is the macbook air possibly that might be but it doesn't matter i mean obviously we've talked about before on the show how there's no bias towards apple products or gaming whatever you have a cool setup we're going to show it off that's exactly what this is uh maybe there's you know another pc aspect or a laptop going on here because it does have um some pretty cool peripherals there you can see also like one of those um what are those things called where you make music uh control pad no no no i don't know what i'm talking about uh but in terms of again gear and hardware really nice looking speakers got that nice like white and like coralish theme going on you know with that macbook air and the wallpaper looks really nice together wooden accents with a monitor riser wooden sort of veneer on the front of the desk and the desktop surface itself is white so in terms of visuals matching everything beautifully here definitely nice execution now we've got fedal gotev fidol gotev possibly sorry if i'm butchering these names this is a nice apartment space pretty much and he has this set up in the living room so you can kind of see behind it there's the couch and stuff great natural ambient lighting with that massive window really getting a call why every time no calls all day i hit film and i got a call hello all right sorry about that where were we we were with fidol yeah really really nice first off just let me shut up for a second take a look at how wide or the the depth of that desk okay that's a big old desk really nice finish to that wooden desktop as well uh so tons of room to you know flail your arms get that maximum you know desk space take advantage of it even got a monitor riser there very clean space loving the prince above was throwing in some more color nice shelf off to the left side really nice apartment living room uh desk setup pretty much you know again not not screaming a gaming setup at me so i don't really know what entirely this is used for nonetheless killer stuff now we've got daddy phoenix and man look at this great cable management great job mounting the monitor there a light strip behind the desk all white makes everything else pop and be more accentuated you know because all the peripherals all the hardware everything here is white nice vibrant pc looking like the is that the uh leon lee 011 dynamic i don't think that's the mini it looks a little bit wider so that might just be the regular dynamic case i've been teasing it for a while i do have an 011 dynamic mini snow edition case build coming up we're going to be replacing the main pc that i have lots of love for this case so that builds coming very very soon you know how it is with hardware limitations this isn't about me this is about daddy phoenix and really really great execution here because again the cable management is what makes this setup if that monitor wasn't mounted or if there was cables you know hanging down it just wouldn't look as clean it wouldn't look as nice the only real cable inside here is from the mouse which is up on a mouse bungee so still routed and organized l-shaped desk bunch of room really good stuff daddy phoenix man now we've got chalky chalky i'm not getting chalky from this setup i'm getting cozier vibes which is like the opposite of chalky but i think of chalky i think i like you know powder and dust and scratching a chalkboard but this makes me want to chill this is nice and cozy and warm we've always say it but again nice wooden desktop what does it do to complement that guitar right up on the wall there also in a wooden finish so your eyes go or you're immediately satisfied because just because of those two things and the warmer tones and the wallpaper and stuff as well seems to be a nice subtle glow behind the monitors as well possibly a light strip um shining orange so very chill very cozy dual monitors mounted nicely monitor light bar right there in the middle man these monitor light bars are the trend of 2021. i haven't seen them before like 2020 pretty much right i i we showed off one in the 2020 uh back to school tech video and i feel like since then they've exploded obviously with the you know the the rise of these on uh at home setups you want to free up some desk space have a a lamp pretty much but not on the desk above the monitor there i can understand the rise of them but i feel like every setup now and then is having them and they look cool they do i'm gonna show one off next week on a cool tech hundred fifty so there you go and then lastly for today rounding out more of our rapid fire reaction type video is five percent gamer now if you remember we had him on when was i think it was towards last like the holidays last year maybe around january but his setup has completely changed since then i think he maybe had a dual monitor set up back then now going with the single monitor but just check out how again great the overall room is the wooden panels some like the foam panels as well more lifx beams with those nice and straight edges to the the light strips that are on the wall uh seemingly around the foam panels going over on that right side and the rgb here shines really bright you take a look behind that then entertainment center big old tv mounted nicely killer audio setup here i don't know what kind of mask that is i'm probably going to be uh hated on in the comments for not identifying what mass that is but looks great got the batman going up on there with the the red and the reddit red accent of the rgb and you can see switching up the colors at first it was uh more of like the orange and blues now go into like a battlefield theme with the reds and teals man oh man a five percent gamer again big changes when he when we had him on earlier this year this is killer man all right guys so that'll wrap it up for episode 259 of room tour project hope you enjoyed let me know your thoughts do you
