series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup and this week the clean and minimal edition if you see anything you like i'll have all the hardware listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out let's get into it 223. first we have mr thaibox123 with the absolute epitome of clean and minimal here a gorgeous setup right in front of this massive window the grass the trees the plants this is a dream now i know i'm gonna see a million questions about it so that chair is called the storm mark ii and as far as i've seen it's only available in the uk so sorry uh us friends we probably can't pick this up but into the actual hardware of the setup and as you can see there really isn't that much so he's definitely keeping it clean and minimal he is using an apple magic keyboard with the apple magic mouse 2 and the monitor is a dell ultra sharp 34 inch ultra wide and this entire setup is being powered by his macbook pro which is then kept up nicely on the book arc laptop sand from 12 south so really just the essentials here the mouse the keyboard the display the laptop everything right here on this gorgeous desk no idea what the desk is from but the glossy desk matches the nice glossy floor all white this is just incredible like how could you not look at this and think holy hell so i think personally this is one for the books and uh you can't get more clean and minimal than this now we have eric oh with an oh so clean setup and what i like about this is i know it's gonna sound like a broken record but again it's just simple you know that's the point of this episode it does seem to be a relatively smaller desktop so not too much room but as you can see again the essentials the mouse keyboard speakers phone dock and with his monitor being mounted on its own separate arm that gives it some space to kind of free up underneath there so speaking of which for that display it is a 24 inch aoc panel got a nice little led light strip to kind of give it some back lighting that biased lighting at nighttime is always easier on the eyes and for his peripherals he has the and pro 2 keyboard with the razer basilisk x hyper speed mouse on his steel series quick mouse pad and also for audio underneath he has mounted the focusrite scarlet 2i2 audio interface the microphone up top is an audio technica at2035 with the sennheiser hd 280 pro headphones and those desktop speakers are from edifier the r1700 bt and then over to the pc on the floor is the nzx the h510 case inside is a ryzen 5 3600 cpu with the stock cooler 16 gigs of g skill rip jaws v series ram on an msi b450 tomahawk max motherboard and gigabyte rtx 2070 super gpu a little print above the desk kind of tied the theme together simple as well shows the theory of electromagnetic radiation got the little spectrum there also maybe a shout out to uh pink floyd but more importantly a shout out to you eric because this is a very nice and well executed setup that you pulled together really nicely i like that it's the finish on the wooden desktop really nice and natural got the wooden accents and the speakers a little bit of color in the keyboard there at the accented keycaps but it all ties together nicely now we've got ariel hitting on all the concepts that i love the natural wooden desk the plant the small itx pc and a very nice looking custom keyboard build so let's get into it for the display go in simple as you know 34 inch ultra wide this is one of their g-sync monitors at 120 hertz and also another case where we have the monitor mounted on its own arm to free up the room underneath and as you can see here just a little spot to keep the laptop now for the peripherals whoa voice crack i'm recording this early saturday morning so forgive me but yes into the peripherals before i really interrupted myself the keyboard is from rama it's the kuyo in the moon colorway he has lubed tilio switches with krytox 205 grade zero and the nice epbt g-o-k-w-o-b key caps letters not even once nice custom coiled cable and then two different mice a logitech g502 light speed for gaming and logitech mx master 3 for productivity and then for audio underneath the desk he has the very dynamic dt990 pro headphones with a mod mic attached to kind of make it like a makeshift headset and that is being plugged into and powered by the audio engine d1 dac and these speakers as you can see are the audio engine a2 plus that leads us beautifully into the pc right next to it this is the loc ghost s1 or loki however you want to say it i say loc and inside is an intel i7 9700k cpu with an octa nhl 12 cooler 32 gigs of courser vengeance ram on an asrock z390 phantom gaming itx motherboard and a founder's edition rtx 2080 ti gpu everything here routed nicely in a pretty powerful build for such a small form factor that's why i love these cases and also to get some work done it's got the macbook pro this is the 16-inch model so you can go from itx pc to the mac laptop and a quick peek under the desk you can see the phenomenal job at cable management all the the bricks and the outlets are kept up out of sight and neatly managed as well so it's not hanging down on the floor so a round of applause for ariel because as you can see this does appear to be like a bedroom setup with the bed right next to the desk and at first when i first saw the submission it didn't grab my attention right away but then the more i inspected it the more you go appreciation for just how well kept and how just nice and organized setup like this can be all while keeping that fine simplicity next up we have caleb s with the thumbnail set up which is probably the reason you are here right now watching because you saw this you thought hey that's a nice setup let me check this episode out and here you are if that was correct you better leave a thumbs up down below so caleb is rocking a 27 inch lg 1440p display i'm digging the desk lamp as well i know it sounds dumb but it really kind of ties the setup together with it being pretty large but the color theme with the nice white kind of mechanical arm there fits nicely with the desk now for the peripherals on this orange leather mouse mat he has the logitech mx keys keyboard with logitech mx master 3 mirrorless wireless wireless mouse man rough morning and then for audio not pictured the anker soundcore 2 speaker and this setup is all run off of his dell xps 13 laptop it's a 9370 model as an intel i7 8550u cpu with integrated graphics and 16 gigs of ram but one thing i like in a shot like this is the there's the light wooden accents everywhere matching the desk with the chair you got the cubbies off to the right side of the room looks like an aquarium up top as well and i just dig that because with the cubbies kind of being staggered white and wooden it matches the setup perfectly even the shelves above the desk that's the kind of thing you can appreciate it's just even if it is just you know white and wooden a simple kind of matching color theme like that it's consistent it's throughout and it just ties it all together really nicely i know i've said it a million times and then rounding out the episode we have marcos with an all-white setup like head to toe yeah white and black is primarily the themes because of you know black accents naturally and products but the dedication to the all white is impressive you can just take a look like the the fake brick paneling all white pc hardware white keyboard white desktop gadgets white which leaves the door open to rgb and customizing it in that sense because at night time when the lights are off when you can't see the white then boom rgb completely changes it from monochrome to colorful i know there's that like oh unicorn puke kind of stigma out there and people hate rgb just because they need something to hate on but this is a prime example of why it is cool and useful when it comes to your pc setup because they could change something from white and black to purple and blue but now we can talk the actual hardware and stuff going on so he also rocking the single monitor by the way everyone so far has had a single monitor that's what's up with the lg ultra wide 29 inch display also on a monitor arm and for all the peripherals he has the royal clutch rk 61 keyboard with the hyper x put in key cast which is how he gets that really nice rgb glow underneath the accents with the logitech mx master 2s mouse as well as the model o mouse he can uh switch between the two you'll see him in different shots and that desk pad is the novel keys godspeed v2 reversed panda you probably can't find it in stock and then for audio sitting on his nzxt h510 case is the nzxt puck which is housing the corsair hs70 headset but a very nice pc like i said in the nzxt case is a ryzen 5 3600 cpu with a corsair h100i rgb platinum aio with 16 gigs of corsair vengeance rgb pro ram got the asus prime x 570 pro motherboard with a galax rtx 2060 super ex dual gpu that is a mighty fine looking pc also has the nzxt hue 2 for the rgb lighting inside and you got to appreciate the dedication of going all black and white trust me it is not easy finding white components and hardware for a pc but my man marcos you pulled it off in every single way and check out that bed as well that's also even black and white got the little cool pillows and stuff over there big old monkey fist this is dope really good job marcos loving it all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 223 of room tour
