what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 224 of room tour project on this glorious september 6 morning the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup and this week is going to be a quick rapid fire episode where we just blaze through about 10 different setups and instead of going through you know multiple pictures it's just going to be one picture of a setup and we're not going to be talking all the nitty gritty gear and specs and the hardware pretty much just taking a a look at a grand scope of the room here and talk about what we like about it and i do this because a lot of times i'll see really great setups but only get you know one photo or people will submit their setups and just submit like two or three so we're gonna go one photo talk about it what we like about it all that stuff rapid fire here we go this video is sponsored and quite literally powered by the elgato wave 3 microphone if you want to check out my full review i dropped it a few weeks ago on the channel but it is a killer setup if you're looking to get into live streaming voiceovers podcasts anything like that it has built-in controls for gain monitoring as well as mixing your audio and a touch sensitive mute button and their wavelength software is going to make your mixing audio a breeze if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below first up we have biggie and i was actually in talks with him on reddit about getting more photos but then he kind of just fell off the face of the earth so i figured it was still you know worthy of being shown off here because even though there's a lot of color grading to the photo going on i like the splash of the red and the teal colors with the rgb they're definitely nice compliments i know the actual desktop isn't that red but you get what i'm saying matching keyboard keycaps matching wallpaper you can see the streaming setup as well by the mounted camera utilizing two displays and both the laptop and the desktop pc with a shout out and a little shrine to g fuel over on the right side but yeah all together a really nice teal and red theme setup here would love to see more next up rja another person i was in talks with on reddit who fell off the earth because they're probably too busy just sitting in front of this and having a blast and i absolutely love what he did here the complete diy turning his monitor into a mock nintendo switch it looks really unique and beautifully done with the neon green and neon pink joy cons on each side matching the colors in his pc the peripherals and i assume the switch is probably mounted either behind it or something but just a really unique custom job that i've never seen done anywhere else and it looks flawless you guys know i love the diy side of setups and this one here taking the cake for originality next with a lord of the rings theme set up and i think the the wooden desk here is stealing the show a great great finish on that you can see the map and the wallpaper seemingly has a 32 inch ultra wide with a 27 curved monitor right next to it the stuff up on the walls and what's funny when i first saw this i thought that like foot hammock draping underneath the desk was some sort of like branch or other extension of wood to kind of like hold the desk up you know it kind of looks like that right but no it's just a foot hammock but i mean visually it kind of works in with it but we'll leave it at that so it's not quite an l-shaped desk it's one of those more so corner desks because in order to be an l-shaped desk would probably have to be a little bit bigger but it's got a nice cut out there nice and round so we can sit in front of it and have more real estate on the left side as well got a pc there right in front of them it's a good job of space management we obviously don't know how big the room is so having the corner setup like this is gonna get the most space utilized for his room so really digging it always like a lord of the rings theme and this is pulled off real nicely this next setup is a doozy and i absolutely love the minimalist approach here so quick backstory someone submitted this as their own but it was fake because i know this setup from justin say's youtube channel this was a setup makeover he did for a subscriber and i recognized it because when i saw him upload that video i just couldn't get over how beautiful of setup it was uh so pretty much what i'm saying is don't steal people's setups and try to submit them as your own because i know what this is from and i absolutely love it and a lot of it most of the stuff here is from ikea you know the desk the lamp pegboards and just the colors he has going on here really nice monochrome with the splash of color orange in the prints orange chair a little bit of green in the wallpaper so when it comes to a minimal setup this is like my ideal dream i just love everything about this so good job justin and like i said don't steal other people's stuff and submit it as your own because i will know this setup from stefus is another gorgeous natural setup with the wooden desktop all that ambient natural lighting right in front of them the plants and the warm orange tones definitely makes it feel nice and cozy you know some other notable features are the small itx pc always love a nice small form factor the two 27 inch monitors lined up perfectly and take a look at that lamp it is insane it's probably crazy overpriced i'm pretty sure it is just really liking the vibes from the setup you know i mean it's just obvious he's got taste you know the small form factor pc the open back sennheiser headphones the model o mouse seemingly some sort of custom keyboard so i really wish we could have seen more from him you want to take a guess the story of this one i'll give you a second yes you're right i was in talks with him he wanted to be on the show then he fell off the face of the earth again so official zen eyes if you're watching let's get those talks back up because it's a really cool setup but i want to see what you've done with it since we last spoke i should rename this episode from rapid fire to mia edition okay so what do i like about it first it's a very unique monitor orientation not only is it the tie fighter setup you know but they're spaced out individually and that's obviously done intentionally as it would look and i kind of really like it mainly because the cable management here is really good so you don't have a bunch of clutter and cables that are visible behind it at least so the fact that they're spaced out really doesn't bother me at all also the desktop itself is really simple he literally just has the peripherals and the nanoleaf aurora light panels they match pretty much everything here from like a teal to an orange color kind of going along with the monitor wallpaper and stuff so just everything here flows really

wilbur420 blaze it and i mean what don't i like about this one he's got the topographic wallpaper on the vertical left monitor some plants all around the room looking real nice and lively as well whether they're fake or not that's to be seen they look good a super minimal clock which literally has the nothing's on it and it's got a big old mirror right next to the setup which i think perfectly ties it all together when it comes to symmetry at least you know i feel like if my buddy billy from back home had a gaming setup it would look something like this maybe it's because of the guitar i don't know but i'm loving it i'm loving the vibes all around here god damn it next how about this setup from nana leaf and i am 110 sure this is a fake setup so it's a render but this is what they use often to advertise their nanoleaf aura light panels but if you just stop and take a look at it like if this was an actual gaming setup and just someone's gaming room how awesome would this be like i don't even know where this is like what kind of paneling or shades those are over on the right side but everything about it is really nice that triple lamp is looking pretty cool the plant right next to it the insane glow from the light panels just really brings out and kind of matches the wallpaper to those three monitors which those monitors don't look real obviously because it is a render but still don't even look like actual monitors and hey look we have the same guitar from the last setup is this are they all fake what's going on here it's the same exact guitar billy billy is this you no but all seriousness even if this is completely fake just imagine if it was real this would probably be goals for a lot a lot of people even though it is rendered they could have probably done a little bit more work on that pc under the desk come on next up from ramses is a setup that i could have sworn we've shown off before but i went back checked out the video descriptions and we actually have not so this other than being a gaming setup is also done primarily for music production that's also kind of obvious by the big speakers uh the keyboard and like the literal keyboard not the gaming keyboard but check out the blend of cotton candy with the pink and the blue the lighting is very strong as most of the room looks to be blue and that pink strip underneath the shelves there as you can see throws off on like the the accents on the the panels on the left and right side and even a little bit behind the monitor so it's just a really unique color blend of the rgb but if we're just talking the setup as a whole i did still enjoy the layout i like how it's executed like i said for a music production setup it definitely seems to get the job done and then lastly but not leastly we have smite me with ones and threes very cute now what i like about this setup is the way he really integrated his desk into the entire room so as you can see he has the shelves mounted and the desk kind of seamlessly fits in with that whole aesthetic it literally looks like an extension of those shelves and you don't often see wall-mounted desks but this one is pulled off perfectly he's got the plants there's the books everywhere got some board games and stuff it's just a very cozy but also a very quaint setup this is definitely what we call quaint okay but regardless i am loving it
