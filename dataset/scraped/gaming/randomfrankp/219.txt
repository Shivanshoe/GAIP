what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be checking out the HyperX alloy origins core gkl keyboard with their brand new aqua switches this came out a few weeks ago I've been using it pretty frequently and honestly for what it is as a gaming keyboard this is gonna catch a lot of people's attention we'll go over it all what I love about it what I don't love about it in this review in case you're thinking of picking it up so the alloy origin score comes in at eighty nine ninety nine which is $40 cheaper than the razor Huntsman tournament Edition keyboard and I think this is a killer price point for many here we have the ten keyless layout for a smaller footprint on your desktop and I said it before but this is my favorite layout of the bunch checking out the construction we have this all gunmetal aluminum body that has a sort of powder coating it looks pretty minimal with just their branding above the arrow keys but the metal frame here is nice not only for looks but the rigidity it's a solid board mounted on to the frame here we have these switches so as you can see they're exposed underneath so you'll get a glimpse at those aqua colored housings on the bottom these are those new tactile aqua switches they rolled out four new keyboards we'll talk about these more in a minute but what these switches being frame-mounted they do get a bit of a nicer blend when it comes to the RGB lighting it'll bounce off the inside of the key cast and reflect nicely onto that frame we don't have any physical multimedia keys but function f six through F eleven will let you do things like change up songs and the volume and stuff then you also have f1 through every for changing up the three profiles on the board key caps used here are an ABS plastic as you can see shine through as well the color comes through nice and bright but they're okay I'd say the font is decent used here I've definitely seen worse and they have this slight not gloss but a little shine to the key caps so keep that in mind fingerprints but as you can do with any standard layout like we have here I throw in a set of color key caps from Ty how this is they're forced agree and I believe and I got them on here to get a nice theme going on for some other physical features flipping it over on the back side we do have to flip out feet with two different levels of elevation for elevating the backside and as you can see right here your removable USB C port and this is definitely great to see that way you can get custom USBC cables like I have they include one inside the box is a braided cable but it's oddly on the right side I've never seen a cable on the right side of the keyboard before like this usually you'll have the cable on the left side or in the middle of the keyboard it's obviously not a huge deal just and awkward choice um HyperX and i don't understand why it's on the right side so let's get back and talk about one of the main selling points of the new alloy origins core those aqua switches these will be similar to those who are fans of brown switches but honestly if you're being tactile they are very smooth much smoother than I was expecting I'll say they travel 3.8 millimeters total and actually at one point eight millimeters with 45 grams of force they're also rated for 80 million keystrokes so like I said smoother the most tactile switches you still get that light bump of feedback - which actuates but overall not as physically tactile as a brown switch so who is this for then well if you like that smooth linear feel like Reds will you still let that tactile response you get in Browns this is really the best of both worlds here and now we'll do a sound test you could hear how these aqua switches sounds but I'm going to throw on the stock key cap set so you can hear how this sounds stock out of the box so as you heard they sound pretty similar to Red's like I've been alluding to very very smooth and honestly if you could buy these key switches separately to like put in your own custom keyboard I think they would be a huge hit on the market so big thumbs up to HyperX for these new aqua switches now as I kind of you know refer to in the beginning with the razor Huntsman tournament Edition with this gaming keyboard tkl size very similar keyboards overall I will say they have the advantage in terms of their red optomechanical switches because technically you know they're faster and more reliable however when it comes to sound quality those have that nasty resonance from that metal support bar inside and it's definitely annoying so I prefer the sound of these much more than that and then after those stabilizers you kind of heard they're still gonna be ratalie not the best same with the space bar but unfortunately that's pretty common with these mass-produced keyboards so how was gaming on this and I mean honestly it was fine with the 1.8 travel distance to actuate you're not gonna really notice a big difference from regular key switches that are usually around 2 so you're not gonna notice that point 2 millimeter distance but the 45 grams are nice and light and like I said you still get that slight bit of tactile feedback so you know when you're actuated I've had no issues whatsoever using this one of the last things we'll talk about before we wrap this up it is gonna be the RGB lighting and as you've seen it's bright it's nice and saturated the effects are smooth it all looks good but there is one major thing that I have to bring up right now and that is there HyperX and Genuity software I need to know what they were thinking because this is a Microsoft Store download ok yes when you go to their website you pick your product it brings you to download this to the Microsoft Store which is kind of odd because in the past you could just download their software and then be good to go so I don't know why this is on the Microsoft Store once you get it downloaded it's gonna be pretty similar to other you know software when it comes to changing up the effects they have three preset ones on the keyboard itself like I said with f1 through three you can assign different profiles to those three and the effect selection as you can see is kind of limited although it says it's in beta so they'll probably add more maybe but you can't do things like stack different effects on top of each other to create you know certain layers and stuff to have more pizzazz on your keyboard if you will and then you can also create macros and stuff like that but my main concern with this is you need to have this program open and running for your macros your lighting effects anything to be saved to the keyboard so you can't change the lighting effects and then exit out because then I'll just go back to the stock keyboard like you got it out of the box of the rainbow effect if you have any macros profiles anything saved you need to have that HyperX and Genuity software going at all times which is mind blowing lead um HyperX you gotta just no guys change that up so all together for a $90 tkl gaming keyboard like this I think it was a great option on the market right now so far as I've been comparing it to I would honestly pick this over the huntsmen tournament Edition you're saving 40 bucks in the end so altogether I love the switches I love the keyboard overall it's really great but you just got that one massive question mark with their ingenuity software I don't think it's a deal breaker by any means but hopefully going forward says it's an beta they should be making some improvements and some changes so it's not constantly needing to be open for you to even take advantage of the software so yeah for 90 bucks big thumbs up from HyperX and then a big kind of when it comes to software that's gonna be up to you to decide if that's a deal-breaker let me know down below now to wrap it up guys hope you enjoyed my review of the HyperX alloy core origins tkl keyboard with the new aqua switches you want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the description down below if you liked this review give it a big thumbs up to show your support feel free to follow me on Twitter at random Frank P and last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button hope y'all enjoy it have a good day
