be giving me crap about a sponsor placement all right kicking us off today is gonna be fortunate one he's fortunate enough to have two monitors and a really nice design to the room overall really like how he has the hexagon sound panels sort of you know paste it up and spaced out to make the room just look a bit cooler so for those two displays his primary is an asus tough 32 inch it's 1440p and 165 hertz and the left vertical monitor is an lg 32 inch now a fortunate one if you're watching i apologize to use you as the example um but guys down below is the instructions on how to submit your setup and i need you know proper just proper photos a lot of these photos from fortunate one were just unusable i said don't you know do close-up macro shots of one product i got like five photos of just one product uh not enough you know just like angles from variations so i'm gonna do what i can with this one but again please follow the instructions down below so trying to go over the peripherals this is the best shot we have of sort of all of them on the desks sort of crowded by the azeron cyborg gamepad he also has a ducky mecha ocean keyboard the 965 layout and somewhere on the desk is the g502 from logitech this shot which is powering his hi-fi man he 560s is his amp and dak the magnus and modius and also for audio up on the wall of the edifier are 1280 t's again i hate to be rude but it's like 2 am and i got to put this episode together and it's just hard to do that when there's not enough usable photos of the setup now for the pc off the right side of the desk we have the nzxt h510 case inside the ryzen 5 5600x cpu with the corsair h100 rgb aio no information on ram and rog strix b450f motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 2070 for the gpu all synced to a blue color theme on the inside all in all fortunate one the way your setups come together we got it laid out definitely a nice and chill gaming room now we've got dog of pavlov and holy holy star wars so we've had him on i'd say probably close to maybe a year or so ago maybe even longer or before i don't remember but we've had him on and he's made some killer additions and upgrades all around to wrap up 2021 with this insane insane star wars setup so for a lot of these i'm just gonna roll some photos he actually submitted over 50. typically i show off like 10 to 12 so we've definitely got some variety today so for this just enjoy the slideshow of crazy awesome looking setup for his display he's rocking two lg 27-inch 4k monitors a 27-inch 4k 120 hertz monitor with a 34 inch as the overhead from lg as well as an asus 28-inch 4k monitor which i believe is the solar display over on the left side of the setup now before we check out the peripherals i just want to show you the insane amount of rgb remotes he has on his desk he could definitely take advantage of one of the cool tech under 50 products we showed off a few weeks ago the broadlink rm4 mini where you could have all those synced to one but yeah i figured you'd get a good kick out of that just the craze amounts of rgb remotes now for the peripherals on the desktop we have a corsair k95 platinum rgb keyboard with both a corsair glaive and a corsair dark core mouse and then for checking out the pc of course also looking really cool in star wars scene that's the entire life of this setup here inside the ntxd h510 elite case is an intel i9 9900k cpu with an n60 kraken z63 aio 64 gigs of t-force rgb ram on an nzxt and 7z 390 motherboard with an rtx 2080 ti also when the room is a 48 inch 4k tv from lg and just check out all the collectibles the lightsabers the helmets the figures again i love setups like this where you dedicate it entirely to a theme the rgb ties in beautifully the prints the posters and just this is a hell of a setup crazy good job here now doing a 180 and taking more of the clean and minimal approach here really loving this one got it sort of like the japanese and off-white type of theme with some of the prints and the monitor wallpaper but again digging the way it's all laid out definitely a really chill bedroom setup so his primary display is an lg 34 inch it's from their ultra gear lineup 3440 1440p and 160 hertz refresh rate and as for that bottom monitor it's actually a 24 inch huon canvas it's a 24 inch drawing tablet but he has it there right under the main display great for that productivity and work set up here for his peripherals of the kikron k8 keyboard with the razer viper mini you can also spot the ps5 off the left side of the desk and also for audio got the bigger dynamic dt990s powered by the stack with the moddi and magne over to the pc always love a nice small form factor case this is the john's plus 110 pro case off to look that up with the ryzen 5800x cpu the leon league galahad aio 16 gigs of g-skill neo ram on an asus strix x570i and an evga rtx 3080 ti ftw3 graphics card definitely a nice and clean compact build loving the way this looks in between takes close up the case and yes definitely nice great job on cable management as well check out that under shot so this bedroom setup is a really great example of a great gaming and you know workstation he's got the ps5 and the you know the pc right there but also with the drawing tablet it's all just ergonomically laid out so we can get the work done the gaming done right here best of both worlds coming together with this really nice setup now hot damn we've got ffx iv artist is he really a final fantasy 14 artist i don't know but he's got the setup to back up the claims i don't know this is insane tons of rgb tons of color but also it's like to the point where it's not overdone the setup itself it's nice and organized everything's got a purpose gaming collectibles and figures on display just holy setup this is nuts so for the monitor layout his primary is a samsung g5 odyssey it's a 34 inch ultra wide with two samsung g5 odyssey 27 inches on the side so it all lines up perfectly down to his peripherals got a lot to tech g910 rg rocking the old orion spark keyboard with logitech g502 lightspeed wireless mouse using their power play charging mouse pad and logitech g533 speaker setup on the desktop now off to the right side behind the monitor is a very very unique looking case it's the johns bow tr03g showcase and it's a really unique looking like triangular chassis it looks very premium the price tag backs that up inside's an intel i7 10 700 kf cpu with the corsair iq h150i rgb pro xt aio corsair just adding on all the letters got 32 gigs of courser vengeance rgb pro ram on asus rog strix z590e gaming motherboard the gigabyte rtx 3080 ti or s master gpu and this is just the master of gaming what a build another shot next to the setup you can see maybe it's like a closet but it's got the all glass mirror drawers so it like just extends the room visually pretty much but man every now and then you get a true jaw dropper you get a pants dropper all right and this is definitely one of them contender for one of the best of the year no doubt last but not least we have o'neill with this ice blue theme something about it just grabs my attention uh love it again the nice stacked monitor orientation i'm always partial to that but that blue makes everything pop and stand out more he even has the ice blue color in that rgb nixie tube clock behind his top monitor which is definitely a nice touch i think so checking it out the primary is a 34-inch lg monitor kind of a trend at this point and the 27-inch dell overhead is a 2k 144 hertz g-sync display and yes that is a gpu below the bottom monitor there what he did was he actually soldered the cables from the gpu to actually go along with the rest of the rgb in his setup so the glow in the evga graphics card is going to be synced to everything for the rest of his peripherals his keyboard is the corsair gaming k70 rgb with these ymdk keycaps to give it that like pinkish purple kind of gradient going along got the logitech g502 lightspeed mouse on again the steel series quick extra large extended prism mouse pad logitech g933 wireless headset and those speakers there of the kanto yu4 and now we gotta check out that glorious looking pc the corsair 500ds case inside an intel i9 9900k cpu 32 gigs of g skill tried nz rgb ram on an asus maximus 11 formula motherboard and the evga gtx 1080 ftw which you can see is also water cooled which is why he had the shroud on his desktop but all the water cooling and stuff here looks great i love that powdered blue kind of look we have an ekwb cpu and gpu water block for the hardline cooling but a really really nice looking pc so anil you did a killer job from again matching the rgb in your tube lamp above the displays to the custom sort of what i don't even know what you want to call that like the graphics card display it's different it's unique and that's why it stands out got to give you mad daps mad daps all
