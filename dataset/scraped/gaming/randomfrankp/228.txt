what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today I got a video that I know a lot of you have been waiting for we're gonna be checking out the $3,500 T foo key cult keyboard now as you can see taking a look at it it is a bit different than the current version that T foods using that's because he was given two options during production this one is the pink and blue splatter look but he went with that more blended anodized look which does look really cool but this is literally the same board it's the same plate keycaps switches all that stuff so I figured for this video we'll take an in-depth look at it go over at all so you can see what T Foos really rockin with so for the keyboard itself this is a fully commissioned key colt number one in the 60% layout and it was built by bespoke keyboard maker tohat types if you don't know him already you should I'll put his channel down below but what makes this keyboard special is there is literally nothing else like this in the world this is a complete one-off custom build and well I'm sure a lot of you will agree that his anodizing and his board definitely looks pretty cool I'm actually pretty impressed with how the splatter looks in person with the pink base in the blue paint it just really pops and still kind of falls along with that you know fortnight kind of aesthetic after all that's like his shtick in the top right hand side of the keyboard you can see it has T foo engraved into it then along the backside right above the USBC port is the Kiko logo into some other specs about the board we have a steel mid piece and it's a really nice accent piece along the sides of it and the plate itself is aluminum this thing is super super solid it weighs just over three pounds at above 60 ounces and also flipping it over you can see we have this really nice mirror like polished stainless steel which also helps add to that weight we'll get into the switches and a sound test in a minute don't worry but one thing that I personally added was this custom coiled cable here this is from space cables and it's actually a custom kind of braid here that I think blends in and works perfectly with the colors and the aesthetic because it is a blue tech flex around it with a pink cable which you know depending on certain lighting and stuff it can look purple again just blending in perfectly with this looks and just space cables like there might go to for these customs USB C cables new these do the braid on this cable is super tight you pull it apart and it just snaps right back into place it's black magic and by the way this is the Thor mousepad from x-ray pad I had one of these lying around never really fit my style in terms of how it looks but again paired with this it works out pretty well alright now getting into the goods for the key caps here they are a gmk striker and they're from zamboula and they're actually a tribute to the japanese national football team that plays in the 2018 FIFA World Cup the color is samurai blue and again it just complements the board really nicely then underneath we have the switches these are novel Keys creams and they're actually lubed with a cry Sox 205 grade 0 to really help with that linear feel to make them really buttery smooth and the actual stem that the creams are made out of is a self lubricating palm so it'll make these linear switches even more smooth and it just gives a really unique feel they have a four millimeter travel distance actually at two millimeters and they require 55 grams of force to actuates and they bottom out at 70 grams so take out types when he was building this completely lubed all of them and as for the actual stabilizers inside we have genuine cherry screw ins which were also lubed and clipped now get ready we'll do a sound test so if you're not already completely just melted into your seat after that sound test I can tell you firsthand typing on this feels incredible now with these novel Keys cream switches again for millimeters to millimeters to actuate it's not like a speed switch or he'd be getting an advantage in fortnight it's about the actual feel and the quality of these novel Keys cream switches and to bring it all together you're probably wondering how does this cost $3500 Keith if you're watching that's a lot more than six hundred and eighty but the thing is you have to keep in mind this is completely custom built and commissioned especially for him only one of these exists in the world in addition to his completely one-off that he has right now that he's using a lot of it is coming with the custom CNC milling and the tooling for the actual keyboard not only that we have the PCB the switches the plate all of it starts to add up you then add in the cost of the anodizing that was done to the board also not cheap keycaps themselves also not cheap by any means g MK striker if you're looking at you know it builds up it adds up over time not only that but tapes who gets these parts in and build some part of the $3500 also comes into play there so in the end yeah $3500 is bizarre but for someone like t fou in his position he could you know do that no problems and at the end of the day when you have a board like this so unique slow aesthetically pleasing right you know fitting into his lifestyle and just the way it feels when typing on it it is insane and only again one of these currently exist in the world so guys I'll wrap it up showing you the $3500 custom T fou keyboard with a key colt number one commissioned bite a hot types hope you all liked this video if you want to
