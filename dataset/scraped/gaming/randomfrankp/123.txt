what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're finally gonna be checking out my clean and minimal setup that i've been working on behind the scenes and this is also sponsored by lg this setup is really a project that i've been working on probably since may now so it's taken a long time to come together really happy with the final result happy to show it off for you guys and it's just a real nice change of pace a nice change of scenery from the overkill studio that i have downstairs so we'll go over it all of everything you see listed for you in the description down below so first up from my desk this is from artifox this is their white oak and bone desktop and i love the design the construction to this it's 52 inches long and 26 inches in depth and it has some really nice features that adds to the overall productivity factor of the desk so for example along the back as you can see it has this dock built in pretty much this can be used for routing cables mounting things like a shelf or a riser also great for propping up a phone or a tablet but on the front of the legs is a peg there's one on each side this is great for holding headphones then underneath in the back side is this powder coated seal grid and this itself is honestly like one of the main reasons why i wanted to go with this unit it has all these cutouts that's perfect for like mounting power bricks extension cables everything here gets tied up nicely to avoid making like a giant mess of cables just hanging down onto the floor i just think the overall desk itself is a perfect fit when it comes to not only making a nice looking modern desk but the fact that it's also built for like a workspace primarily down for the main peripherals on the desktop let's talk some gear going with the blackout approach kind of being a contrast to the all-white desk finish my keyboard is from happy hacking it's the hhkb pro hybrid a wireless silky smooth topper keyboard it's definitely a change up from my usual mechanical keyboard builds but the topper switches here are definitely a nice touch for the mouse keeping it all wireless again i opted for the logitech mx master 3. and the reputation of this series only speaks for itself it's got great battery that crazy scroll wheel it's wireless seamless switching from mac to pc and it's you know mainly a productivity mouse i've always been a fan of the vertical scroll wheel this has and the touchpad built into the thumb rest is just you know makes this perfect for editing they're both sitting on a new orbit key desk mat this is the black medium size that they offer and again while this setup really isn't intended to be just a gaming setup like i have for downstairs in the studio uh the leather itself is still going to track just fine on the mouse if i am getting some light gaming in but what i really like about this is the sort of like hideaway felt flap underneath for like storing papers or documents and then up top is like this magnetic lip for storing pens pencils a stylus i just think the matte itself is going to be perfect for giving it that minimal look still now the centerpiece here is my lg monitor i mentioned before lg is sponsoring this video they sent out their 27-inch ultra gear 4k nano ips display it's the 27gn 950b this is great for not only photo and video editing with its 98 dc ip3 color rating and the avesa hdr 600 for brightness but it's also perfect for gaming because at 27 inches that 4k resolution is just the perfect size and combo when it comes to you know pixels per inch when you're sitting in front of it it just looks super crisp also for gaming it's nvidia g-sync compatible with amd freesync premium pro with a one millisecond response time at 144 hertz having all those things just really in my opinion makes this one of the best options out there for a 4k 27 inch monitor now while the setup is mostly intended for you know working and editing of course i'm still going to get in a fair amount of gaming and stuff when i have some downtime whether that is on the pc with my h1 build or the new ps5 everything just looks gorgeous on the screen and you guys know i have those triple ultra wides downstairs so i wanted to go the solo monitor up here because that's the main thing downstairs in the studio it is a constant work work work mindset so depending on how many projects i'm juggling when i am in the studio it could get you know a bit much so i wanted that separate clean and minimal setup up here to help clear the mind a bit because it's a nice change of pace change of scenery also one thing that's really cool about this monitor for gaming is on the back of the ultra gear monitor it's their rgb sphere lighting this can shine in an rgb rainbow wave if you please i'm not the biggest fan of that you can keep it like a static color if you want pick a breathing effect but what i really prefer is their video sync mode which shines colors as biased lighting in relation to what's happening on the screen and it shines it on the wall behind it that way at night time it's less harsh on your eyes in terms of like contrast with the bright screen against the dark wall or background behind it it works with literally whatever's on your screen so gaming youtube netflix whatever and having that color kind of just flow off behind it just looks really really cool and it's essentially just sampling the colors of what's happening on the sides of the monitor then portrays it with that rgb sphere on the back i think it looks really really cool i love this mode a great addition to a really great gaming monitor also on the desktop you can peep the lenovo smart clock i picked this up over the summer for the back to school tech video we did and honestly it's just a great little desktop gadget for the price it's very very customizable with tons of different you know home faces and stuff for the screen change up the color add certain widgets to it and to the right side for some audio gear with the sennheiser gsx 300 amp and dac this is the snow edition for the color i like it for its simplicity it's literally just a volume dial and a button for toggling you know eqs and stuff it's really small and compact great for headphones but if i'm being honest i don't really use this too frequently because when i am sitting down here this is where i usually just use the speakers these are the kanto tuck and first off just visually it looks super clean futuristic and connectivity wise it has bluetooth compared to a you know a tv console record player cd player all that sound quality wise they're a nice and crisp bright sounding speaker that definitely benefits from that unique tweeter design up top and they even internally rework the woofers here as well that handles all like the mid-range and low end and to me just really completes the overall package for this phenomenal sounding and looking speaker at this price point i've tried lots of different speakers out there these are the ones that when i turn them on i just don't want to turn them off i want to keep listening so obviously yes i bump a lot of music with these at the setup but also for gaming with the ps5 it still sounds killer so the tux definitely one of my favorite pieces of tech in the setup now for the pc on my desktop that white rectangular case is the nzxt h1 a unique looking itx build that has its own aio and power supply built into the case for specs i have a ryzen 3 900 cpu 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 2070 super gpu and again for getting some editing done in here as well as some light gaming it's honestly more than fine gets a job done i built this in march i want to say so now naturally hardware is kind of dated with all the new gpu and cpu releases but like i said for the use case here it's more than fine some other setup additions include my chair from autonomous this is the kin and for an ergonomic office chair it's like a third of the price of the hermann miller m body very nice comfy adjustable also up top is that neon sign i am the third so i wanted to have something like other than my logo on display and i thought the roman numerals was the nice personal touch this was created by a company called bright light who does custom made neon signs i think it's just a nice you know sort of overall completion piece that ties the whole setup together also next to the setup i have this ikea nightstand as you can see here i have how's my original crystal xbox i love the way this looks some old games for nostalgia and then up top the recent addition uh the ps5 so again i want to get some gaming done this comes in clutch looks gorgeous on the monitor some other white gaming accessories that fits in perfect like the psp go the vita and then up top i have one of the pegboards from ikea as well just again to house some things and just add some more visual aesthetics that i think fits in nicely up top here completes this little corner off to the side of the setup other things around the room behind the setup on the opposite wall it's just some decoration another speaker for my turntable before this combo this is the spin base and the spin deck both of them i have an all white the spin deck up top is a turntable you know for playing vinyls shot the ace i think it just looks really nice visually but what i really dig and i have shown this off in other videos so you guys remember is the spin base underneath it has this really unique sort of speaker design that hooks up to the spin deck itself amplifies the music in 270 degrees with speakers on all three sides and i know i have the tux obviously for my main setup but this thing gets you know very loud for itself sounds phenomenal as well and it has this iso groove technology that causes absolutely zero feedback or vibrations with a spin deck up top so there won't be any vibrations interfering with the vinyl playback this combo here is not only a nice aesthetic piece to tie that minimal look together over here but like i said it sounds great as well and i mainly have this going when i'm working out because this is sort of like you know a secondary home office to me so one thing i wanted to add to the room especially during quarantine was a better way to work out so order the tonal home gym in august i want to say finally got delivered last month in december this is a complete home gym built into the wall mounted system instead of using like physical weights it's all a tension system with hundreds of workouts and programs built into the ui it's all touch screen as well and you get real-time tracking and feedback on your workouts notes on your form it's all just a really really unique system and again with quarantine i wanted to get in some more workouts in but most of the gyms around here have been closed or you have to wear a mask during your workout and when it comes to weightlifting your breathing technique is like equally as important to your lifting form so i just didn't want to worry about that you know and going out anywhere so here mounted in the office the arms on it are all fully you know articulating and adjustable you can set them to whatever workout you're doing like i said hundreds of different workouts for whatever sort of muscle group you're targeting came with the bench has like a different bar and rope accessory for your workouts it's honestly just a great investment given the total package here i could do an entire video on this but i'm sure only like two percent of you actually care about it and one thing that i really like is the fact that it tracks literally everything from the beginning all your workouts all your stats it'll show like achievements and stuff from when you started you can create certain workouts and stuff on your phone even it's just really great to see that physical progress um both like digitally and physically on myself like i can notice the increase in muscle mass which is really great for just been doing this around a month um i think from when i started i've lifted near 200 000 pounds which doesn't sound like too much in the grand scheme of things but that's 200 000 pounds more than i would have lifted otherwise so it's been great i love it definitely expensive but the cost itself is also another factor that makes me want to use this more because if i'm paying that hefty price i want to obviously put it to use and not waste that money and it's definitely been worth it and then real quick when i was getting the office all together and stuff i just wanted to add some more decoration and knickknacks around the room to kind of just complete that opposite side of the setup that felt kind of empty before so above the spin deck and spin base with some shelves decorations up there and i'm sure i'll add more things as the setup evolves alright guys so that'll wrap it up for the tour of my clean and minimal office setup hope you all enjoyed again i've been working on it for so long i think i'm really happy with the final result of it and i'm sure it'll evolve and change as we go but a definite nice change of scenery up here for a more chill vibe so i
