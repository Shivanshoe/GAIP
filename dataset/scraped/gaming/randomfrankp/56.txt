what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 257 of room tour project the series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like today i'll have all the gear and hardware listed for you in the description down below in case you're trying to pick something up to upgrade your room your setup all that good stuff we'll kick it off now 257. first up today we have hector and even though it's a single monitor setup there is a lot going on definitely honing into that real gamer aesthetic here loving a lot of the accents and rgb around the setup as well with those rgb floating shelves the figures up top it all just looks and blends really good and visually ties in perfectly to his wallpaper so checking it out for his single display it's an aoc 24 inch 144 hertz and down to his peripherals unfortunately hector didn't give me any info on his mouse and keyboard so i can't really identify them just by visuals it does appear like you sort of customize them to fit in more like a black and white theme i reached out to him he never got back to me so yeah if you know what they are comment down below hector if you're watching check your email more frequently now he did provide us info on the audio we too have a bm 800 microphone his headset or headphones of the edifier w 800 wireless and also for desktop speakers logitech z213 but now checking out his beautifully crafted wall mounted pc which is made of a diy case so he personally made this with spare materials and constructed it really nicely as well again a nice black and white theme to it here for the hardware is an amd ryzen 5 2600 cpu with an ndxt x52 aio 16 gigs of courser vengeance lpx ram and an asus tough b450m pro gaming motherboard an msi rx 5500 xt for the graphics card but again a really nice job customizing it here a lot of the black and white vinyls to make it fit in really neatly done so all in all hector a very nice setup there's a lot of times where i'll see setups where i'm like oh i wish you could have done this or wish you could have done that but here i feel like you just tied the room all together really nicely with a lot of things like the collectibles the rgb it's a very cohesive and complete gaming setup you manage to pull off the fact that there's a lot going on but it doesn't seem too busy or overcrowded that's really not an easy thing to do so props to you now holy moly cannoli side story while your jaw drops growing up there was a place i think in like jersey that had the holy moly cannoli it was a 12 pound cannoli that was my birthday cake one year now does that relate to this no but they are both absolutely insane i love everything about how this setup is constructed from the nice like light wooden pegboard behind it the abundance of plants the life that really just breathes into this room the setup and natural lighting glorious so the chair here for a sit stand desk is the herman miller mira ii and forest ii monitors they are both lg ultra wide to this primary being a 34 inch and the vertical ultra wide off to the right side being a 29 inch and you'll see on top of the primary monitor he does have a monitor light bar acting as a desktop lamp down to his peripherals his keyboard is an iquinix f96 night keyboard that all stealth black with logitech g900 mouse then also for audio on his desktop with the kanto yu4 speakers in the nice matte black and for headphones the sennheiser hd 6x they're powered by a fio e10k amp and dac and he also has a hyperx solo cast microphone also on the desktop you could spot his 2018 ipad pro there right in the middle acting as that third display you know extra productivity and extra screen now we can check out the pc which is underneath the desk it is the nzxt h500 case and inside the ryzen 3 700 cpu with an nzxt kraken x62 aio got 16 gigs of g-score rip jaw v-series ram on an msi b550 tomahawk motherboard with an evga gtx 1070 ti super clock gpu visually inside great job on cable management the pc is kept off the floor so no issues with dust intake and also cable management coming out the back side very very neat and organized as well and just speaking of which check out how clean that undercarriage is we all can appreciate a damn good job at cable management and man that's a that's a good job right there how about some other shots around the room so you could just soak in how well this room is laid out and designed the aesthetic here is a 500 on a 10 star scale i love everything about this room it's designed so nicely and he even has a spot for an lg 49-inch tv here great little section for the entertainment center this entire room is just what i dream about at night i'll tell you what we barely managed to keep the very few plants alive in our house that we have i don't know how all these look so vibrant and just healthy you gotta give me some tips nick and also let's just trade rooms like i'll take yours you take mine and we'll both be happy maybe i'll be happier probably because this is super nice it's way better than mine i love you nick what next up is jamie with a triple monitor setup the first submission had one last setup had two now with the trifecta this a corner set up as well you don't see them too often but in this case a great use of space in the room there's a lot going on just in a corner which usually you know is like wasted space in a room so for his primary monitor jamie is rocking an lg 32-inch ultra gear monitor with a 165 hertz refresh rate and the two vertical monitors on each side are 27-inch aoc monitors at 144 hertz so much hurts it hurts now for his peripherals jamie's giving himself options all right he has a hyperx alloy elite keyboard in the back behind that you'll also see the hyperx origin 60 keyboard his primary mouse is the hyperx pulsefire dart but also in the back when he's not gaming he has two logitech mx master three mice and we're not done there because he's got two mouse pads with the hyperx fury extra large as the extended desk pad and on top of that is his hyperx fury ultra rgb pad and sticking with the love for hyperx for audio he also has the hyperx cloud flight s headset and his microphone the hyperx quadcast now we can check out the pc you can also see right here is his elgato stream deck but inside is a ryzen 3700x cpu with an msi mag core liquid 240r aio 64 gigs of t-force delta rgb ram on an msi mag mortar b550 motherboard an msi rtx 3070 gaming trio z for the graphics card that's all inside the corsair iq 465 x crystal case got a bunch of rgb in the pc a bunch of rgb around the desk behind the monitors as well giving us a very bright and vibrant gaming room you can also see for his entertainment center got a nice tv console gaming as well so you got both the options pc gaming console gaming gaming gaming gaming and just like that now the fourth setup has four displays with three monitors and a massive 50 inch as the overhead captain jack the fourth with one roman numeral for each display we also have a fellow corgi dad so there's a lot going on in this setup three different pcs to be exact uh but we're just gonna focus on his primary gear the primary hardware because we don't have all day right so for those three displays they are agent acer 27-inch at 144 hertz like i said before that overhead is a 50-inch samsung 4k tv but down to his main set of peripherals he's rocking logitech g915 tkl keyboard this has the tactile brown switches inside with the logitech g502 light speed wireless on logitech g power play mouse pad which is underneath the random frank p novel keys desk match nice taste here very very nice you can also spot in the background the elgato stream deck and the go xlr mini then also for audio here's the bose companion 2 series 3 speakers with the razer nari ultimate headset so for his main pc okay this is from mountain mods it's their u2 ufo custom case inside the ryzen 3900 x cpu an entirely custom cooling job on the inside with 32 gigs of course revengeance rgb pro ram on an asus ba 450 strix gaming f motherboard an evga rtx 3070 ftw 3 ultra graphics card and in terms of the other two pcs beside his primary gaming pc he has a separate streaming pc which is inside the corsair case and then a portable pc inside the nzxt h210 case each pc yes has its own dedicated peripheral set as well like i said lots of hardware and given all that it did not go unnoticed the stellar cable management job behind the monitors everything here neatly mounted power bricks it is all beautifully managed this is magic and then on the side of the samsung 50-inch tv mounted up on the wall you can see he has the consoles there mounted really nicely seems to be some special edition like ps4 and xbox controllers as well tons of like art and stuff around the room bringing the really cool gamer vibes got some rgb lining the wall going up rgb around the desk so much gear so much hardware killer job here captain jack and then last but not least we have matt r i'm gonna get cheeky with it for the fifth submission were you expecting five displays to follow the order check out the two little tablets we got five people boom and that's how you craft an episode but this is also how you craft a beautiful setup because he can completely change up the theme the colors just like that from purple to the nice coppery orange sort of effect to the setup and man oh man it's a nice one too it's funny how rgb can completely change the setup like this looks nothing like the first photo but now diving into the hardware the side by side displays on the bottom are an asus 27 inch with the overhead being an asus pro art 23 inch display got some little ring lights on each side as well for some extra lighting but down to his peripherals has the hyperx alloy origins keyboard with the aqua switches inside with the logitech g502 hero mouse and as i mentioned before with those two tablets he uses those sort of like a digital stream deck in a way where he can add different functions and macros all stuff programmed to these tablets his headphones of choice over on the left side is the philips fidelio x2hr i will say since the headphones are the only like source of audio here some nice like wood grain edifier speakers mounted somewhere up on the wall would look really nice here now over to the pc inside the leon lee 011 dynamic case by the way stay tuned to the channel very very soon we're going to be doing a build with something from leon lee that's gonna look pretty pretty cool but this is a really nice looking build we have a ryzen 9 3900 x cpu with an nzxt kraken x53 aio 64 gigs of corsair dominator platinum ram on a gigabyte aorus pro wi-fi motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 2070 super windforce gpu so gotta say matt loving this setup the triple monitor you got all the proper lighting the rgb the chameleon rgb where you can just change the setups look completely everything ties in got the little ring lights the foam up on the wall this is a really nice gaming setup all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 257 of room tour
