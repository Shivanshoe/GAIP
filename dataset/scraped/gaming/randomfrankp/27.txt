your own setup we haven't done one since november and you know kind of gets boring for me after a while but there's been a pretty good demand for the series to return so if you guys love these setups let me know down below give this video a bunch of support with all your thumbs up all that good stuff you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below in case you want to upgrade your setup but we'll kick it off now episode 262. this episode's sponsored by me and the control t keys deepsea topographic keycap set which we are launching together for any fans of this nice deep blue and teal colorway that will look great on any keyboard head over to ctrl t keys dot com to check out the full layout and compatibility and use code rfp at checkout to save five bucks now first up today we have kieran with the really nice warm and cozy theme here really liking the dark tones on the wall some of the accents highlighted nicely by some splashes of green in that rich wooden desktop color just really cozy all around here so checking it out for his single monitor going with the 34 inch gigabyte wgc it's 144 hertz one millisecond response time and you can see underneath he also has a portable monitor there acting kind of like as that secondary display and from this view kind of looks like a laptop so for his peripherals he has a royal clutch rk987 with gmk wave keycaps and for his mouse he uses a mix between the two the logitech g703 and logitech mx master three and then for his audio setup on each side of the wooded monitor riser he has the razer nomo 2.0 and then also he has the corsair hs70 for his headset now we can check out the pc inside the antec p120 crystal case is a ryzen 7 5800x cpu with the corsair iq h150i pro rgb aio 32 gigs of courser vengeance rgb pro ram and an aurus master x570 motherboard with the gigabyte aorus master rtx 3070 ti graphics card so a really phenomenal job with the execution of this sleek warm and cozy setup again the big highlight here is just the tones all around really nice colors it doesn't seem to be like a dark gray wall but almost like a dark hunter green almost and again brings out the nice rich tones in the desk highlighted by the green in the plants really nice stuff next up we're going to roll right into dan's setup with the ultra wide and stacked monitor orientation here highlighted by the monoprice 49-inch dark matter monitor again just super super wide and getting that extra real estate on top with a monoprice 27 inch display a great job of mounting as well they're actually on a desk bracket which is kind of hidden behind there on the left side you can see one of those plants that's where the arm pretty much branches out but a good job of hiding that and giving it that floating appearance now checking out the peripherals for his keyboard we have the mountain everest max keyboard with the pwning sim gen 1 mouse it has the honeycomb white shell to match the white keycaps on his everest max keyboard which is all on the razer strider mouse pad definitely one of my go-to's now he also has the go xlr audio interface which is going to be powering his streaming setup with also the philips fidelio x2 hr headphones and also for audio on his desktop you can see the fluance xl8s bookshelf speakers now over to the pc inside his leonle 011 dynamic mini case is a ryzen 7 5800 x cpu with the deep cool castle 240 ex aio 32 gigs of corsair dominator platinum rgb ram on an asus rog x570 crosshair 8 hero motherboard with a sapphire rx 6900 xt nitro plus gpu and as you can see with those leon lee fans and the rgb cables just tons of color all synced and it looks great speaking of looking great take a peek underneath that desk fantastic job at cable management and then right next to the setup is his entertainment setup as well with a massive 55 inch high sense 4k tv some more fluon speakers there those are the xlhf towers this section here is actually powered by his laptop so he's got both the laptops set up for the entertainment setup and then here the main desk setup tons of colors lots of vibrance and all together pretty well organized so a great job dan next up we have anthony p and again tons of monitor real estate here you can see we have the triple monitor set up but not in the normal orientation here is the tie fighter setup but highlighted by the samsung g9 odyssey so a massive 49 inch ultra wide and then on each side and the vertical orientation mounted are two 27-inch monitors from aoc a clean job with mounting nice rgb behind the desk as well for that extra you know glow and a nice spanned wallpaper so it's consistent across all three checking out the desktop hardware and peripherals we have the razer turret keyboard which he uses also for xbox with logitech g502 lightspeed on the razer goliathus as well as the razer tartarus v2 he also has things like the elgato stream deck and the amazon echo show 5 and then for audio yet again with the razer nomo chroma speakers and for the headset steel series arctis 7. now above the setup is this 3d printed battle rifle from halo just to add to the you know gaming collectibles around the room behind the setup he has his lg tv mounted for the entertainment center there and as you can see just some more stuff including this really cool crate he made to hold some controllers his wii it's just really nice you know accents and gaming pieces really to complete the feel of that gaming room but heading back to the desk you'd see for his pc this is the corsair spec omega rgb case inside the ryzen 9 3900x with the corsair h100i pro aio 64 gigs of g-skill trident z neo ram on asus x570 pro motherboard with actually an nvidia rtx 2080 ti which is the cyberpunk edition which he says he won in a contest pretty cool for sure and that's going to be completing the all red fiery interior inside again highlighted by those leon lee shrimmer cables to really give it some flair good stuff all around anthony again just massive screen real estate there with the two verticals on each side of the 49 inch ultra wide tv right there with you as well really crazy stuff speaking of crazy check this out from bobo mojo also known as flx tv on youtube this is a hell of a setup beautifully mounted floating triple monitors crazy rgb all around all synced all custom as well so much of this setup including the desk the shelves the the 3d panels are all diy which just makes it more personal and a lot cooler as well holy tits let's check this out the center display is an asus rg strix pg279qm 1440p 240 hertz and on the left side is an acer predator 27 inches 165 hertz and on the right side the same one as well 27 inches 165 hertz loving the custom wallpaper he has in the topographic theme spanned across all three as well now checking out the peripherals the logitech g915 tkl in white with the glorious model o wireless and the steelseries arctis pro wireless in white as well with the logitech g560 lightsync speakers and also as you can see pretty much a staple on every setup nowadays is the elgato stream deck now i just want you guys to check out these custom made drawers on each side which are highlighted by rgb they appear floating the desk underneath as well with the pretty much cable covers there which have really nice rgb cutouts this is all just absolutely insane it's a great diy desk never seen anything like this pc there also mounted under the desk and kept up off the ground over on the right side that's the leonle 011 dynamic xl case inside the intel i9 11 900k cpu with the corsair iq h-150i elite compellics aio got 32 gigs of corset engines rgb pro ram on an asus rog strix z590e and an evga rtx 3090 ft w3 ultra but an icy clean build on the inside so again one of the crazier setups we've seen from bobo mojo also as you can see on that center display flx tv is his youtube where he has a lot of the whole diy process that went into this so if you want to learn more about it and how he made those crazy you know the rgb sort of hexagon panels and just all the creativity behind this definitely check it out one of the best i've seen in a while and then rounding us out today is ronald again love seeing these nice dark rich tones with the wooden accents there for the desktop also has a matching wooden slab mounted behind the entire desk as well doesn't seem to be the normal execution in this case where usually you would see the monitors mounted to that backboard instead of the wall itself so maybe this is just another accent piece and uh the cat there is surely liking it so we have the two stacked monitors here with a dell 27-inch as the primary and adele 24-inch as that overhead and there you can see on the left side is that monitor arm which is secured to the desk not the actual backboard itself now down to his peripherals his keyboard is the drop control with the razer naga pro as the mouse and um not pictured here you'll see in a shot coming up his speakers are the edifier r1280db which are actually you know mounted on that backboard so that's where it is adding some of that functionality it sort of blends in because it has that wooden veneer on the speakers as well for his pc we have the nzxc h500i case with a ryzen 7 1700 cpu with the nzxt kraken x52 aio 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram on an msi x470 gaming carbon pro motherboard with an evga gtx 1080 sc gpu so the triple set up here because we got the desk setup on one wall the cat setup right behind that and then also two is left on the wall mounted is the massive tv he has a switch there as well for some console gaming so a really nice gaming room all around that i'm sure his cat loves as well so all right guys that'll wrap it up for the return of room tour project episode 262. hope you enjoyed like i said all the gear and hardware you saw today be listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out as
