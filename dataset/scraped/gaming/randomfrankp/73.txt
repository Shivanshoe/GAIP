lamp or something like that i actually first saw this in a room tour project submission and fell in love with it and was super shocked to see it was only like 40 bucks i mean tell me this isn't the perfect clean and minimal lamp right so built-in on the front is a little dial that's obviously for controlling the brightness as well as the color temperature all the way from 2700 kelvin to 6500 kelvin so you can really dial it in and it also says it has four different lighting modes things for like you know like a warm glow at night or when you're reading but obviously you can just you know manually turn it yourself and dial in that lighting depending on your situation and how much light you need in the room for your desk what i also really like is the fact that it's controllable through apple homekit also through siri google assistant and amazon alexa it's a lamp there's not really too many other physical features to it but like i said before the visuals is the reason why i bought it i love that super clean aesthetic and hell for 40 bucks it was a steal i currently saw on amazon it was just around 50 bucks but that's amazon for you prices are always fluctuating if you can find it definitely grab it now next is something i was admittedly thinking of not putting in this episode and maybe saving it for like a holiday edition for like a stocking stuffer or a gift idea for someone else but it really is cool and i'm sure a lot of you could definitely find it useful especially because we have back to school season coming up so maybe you can grab this for all your devices because it's this really bizarre all-in-one multi-device cleaning kit so you've probably got a dirty phone laptop a tablet this little thing will help you polish up all those ports clean all that pocket lint out so six tools are built in it also comes with a microfiber cloth and this cleaning solution but tools one through three are for cleaning the ports or like the lightning usb c port on your device four and five are actually ports uh for cleaning the pins on your cables so again with lightning ports especially uh it could get like the blackened pins over time due to just damage and corrosion these will nicely clean that up for you there's also a brush tool for again like cleaning speakers the microphone uh the earpiece you just can really polish up your phone and clean out all that lint because i know for me especially like you probably don't think about it too much but considering how often our phone is in our pocket there is just so much lint that gets crammed up into your charging port regardless of whether you just solely like wirelessly charge or what there is probably a ton of gunk crammed up in your charging port and i know for me i use the one tool right away scraped out like pretty much a belly button's worth but also i can appreciate the fact that we still do have that cleaning solution included so we can polish up the ports [Music] so if you've noticed maybe your cable's been cutting out perhaps um maybe it's not even a faulty cable it could just be because the pins and the connectors are dirty themselves so the fact that the tool has a solution and extra ports to clean up the cable i thought it was a nice little idea so definitely a useful device throw it in your bag your backpack a drawer always have it on hand and it comes in under 30 bucks that's why i said before possibly like a good you know gift idea for the holidays but uh maybe a good gift for someone else regardless of the holidays if you're feeling generous buy this for a friend next what if i told you there was a razer viper ultimate clone that was lighter slightly smaller and a third of the price meet the deluxe m800db this clone has exploded in popularity out there for that exact reason it's pretty much a smaller viper ultimate you can see it's nearly identical in shape but you're only paying 40 versus 120. inside the box it comes with a usbc charging cable a wireless dongle for and an extra pair of feet they are a stock teflon so decking this out with something like a nice hyper glides will definitely do the trick but my first impression of this just really blew me away because if you were blindfolded you would 100 think it's a viper ultimate the only physical difference really is the dpi button is now on top instead of the bottom and there aren't the right side buttons but there are still the buttons on the left side and we even have an rgb light strip with the butt now say what in terms of size it's three millimeters shorter in length a three millimeter smaller at the grip width and two millimeters smaller at its hips but the height of the front flare in the top of the mouse is the same as the viper and it also comes in four grams lighter at just 70 grams versus 74 grams it's not quite at the size of like the viper mini but hey i mean it's still smaller and lighter than the viper ultimate the main difference really is going to come in with the wireless technology they're using obviously razer is a multi-million probably billion dollar company and their wireless technology and sensor is admittedly going to be better and here we have a paw 3335 sensor that goes up to 16 000 dpi but the switches in these are kale 4.0 reds and they have a 60 million lifespan and all around the quality control here it's really a solid mouse gaming with it since i've been mating the viper ultimate since release in 2019 i mean it when i say it like switching over to this it didn't feel like a difference at all this mouse is so on par with diaper ultimate for a fraction of the price that it is really just impressive that's the best way to say it's impressive for 40 dollars so if you never wanted to deck out the money for the viper ultimate or you've wanted to really try it out but not you know take that plunge and m800db 40 bucks now moving right along you know me you know the channel you know this series you know what i like and i will never stop showing off cool macro pads dials knobs anything like that that could help people out in terms of macros and extra functions i'm telling you i'll never stop no ragrets so meet the so meet the huion kd 100 keypad it's wireless has 18 programmable keys plus a multifunctional dial up top and while it was made for their own like drawing tablets and stuff you don't need it it's not required you can use this without a drawing tablet and set it to be a bunch of different macros functions and commands controls yes so with it being wireless it actually has a 100 hour battery life which is definitely pretty impressive you could also choose to use it wired because it has usb c port thank you but since it is so compact like a standard keypad that you would buy out there or people who buy like numpads and stuff the added functionality is really impressive so for the 18 programmable keys the actual keys themselves are like the scissor keys you would find on a laptop so it's not going to be like a really satisfying like mechanical switch for example but honestly with something like this not too big of a deal but what i really like about the dial is it has these super satisfying clicks when you rotate it there's actually a button in the middle of the dial which lets you actually change up on the fly what the dial does so inside the software you can go in and really reprogram everything on here you can set each key to do things like a keyboard stroke a mouse click i'm running certain programs or system applications multimedia it's all right there just very easily configurable and like i said before with the three different features built into the volume dial you have those same options available to you so it'll say feature one through three you click on the one you want to change or adjust you'll have those same options so you can make it do things like scrolling up and down or in and out of your timeline make it a volume wheel obviously for controlling like spotify and stuff your system audio so as i said before it's only being advertised and sold along with like their drawing tablets and stuff but there's no telling you what you can or can't use this for photo editing video editing macros for gaming 3d design animation whatever you want have this wirelessly on your desk bunch of functions right at arm's reach i'll never stop showing off knobs macro pads keypads anything cool 50 bucks hell of a good deal then last but not least we have the genki shadow cast and this little hdmi device lets you use a laptop for example as like a monitor or at its own display to play and record games things like using your laptop to play your nintendo switch your xbox a ps5 really any hdmi device you can hook up to the shadow cast and now have it displayed or captured on your laptop or a pc really it's essentially a more affordable elgato capture card instead of being 200 this little guy is just 50. they do have their own arcade software you can go in and download to do things like monitor your gameplay for capturing um but also you can just use like obs and that'll work just fine as well and just like any other capture card if you want you can use it with like a dslr and have it be like a webcam type thing so i'll admit when i first saw this and picked it up i thought it turned any device into like a display not so much like a capture card like a pass-through device like this is but i just thought your laptop would be turned into a monitor which something you can't do you know uh but for being what it is again a much cheaper alternative to an elgato capture card out there 50 bucks versus 200 and i've showed off a lot of you know alternative capture cards in the past and hdmi capture cards like this uh so this one giving you a just another option out there to pick from for fifty dollars and there's like point two seconds of delay and stuff for capturing so again with a lot of your capture cards out there that's pretty standard to normal but again if you wanna find a quick and cheap way to rip your gameplay put it online genki shadowcast 50 bucks and guys i'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50
