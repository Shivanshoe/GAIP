what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under 50 dollars for august already the series will show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but also shout out to last month's winners i'll be in contact you guys can clean your tech you know the routine by now comment what you like leave a thumbs up all that good stuff now kicking off the episode we have a really great pair of budget wireless earbuds these are the anker soundcore life p2 and for what they are at just 50 they are hands down at the top of their tier for a pair of budget wireless earbuds now as you guys know there are a lot of wireless earbuds and stuff on amazon and like 95 of them are admittedly just junk but anchor got it right here for the most part so just right up front the sound quality here is good to decent i'd say there's a bit of a lackluster sparkle when it comes to the mids and higher end frequencies but they get decently loud without any distortion and i could say hands down sound better than the original airpods now airpods pro they don't really hold up to but again those are like 250 these are just 50. now for size reference you can see it's around the same shape and size as those but just now in a deep navy colorway they do have built-in controls for things like pausing and skipping tracks you can toggle voice commands with these and use it for taking calls they have a built-in slight degree of noise cancellation for blocking out background noise which is still impressive for the price they do also support a 40-hour battery life and just a 10-minute charge will give you an hour of playback which is great if you're going to be you know going out on a run needs in a pinch and for charging their house in this little charging pod comes with its own usb-c cable great for carrying around and travel again just really hard to complain for the price of just 50 bucks the quality here they sound good good features a killer airpods alternative next up pretty interesting this is a microphone isolation shield you can use this for mounting your mic attach this to a mic stand gonna be great for voice overs so this one in particular is the konski mic shield and like i said it's gonna act like a mini sound booth if you want to think of it that way and for your audio it's going to absorb and block out a lot of the noise for your voiceovers podcasts streams anything you would really use a mic for it folds up nice and compact as you saw and does a great job of just improving your audio quality you'll hear a sound test in a minute don't you worry now the way you can use this isolation shield is really in two different you know setups really first is just having it sitting on your desk with the mic attached to it since it comes with its own mount which is pretty simple you know you just mount it there it's going to be just on your desktop out of the way if you're streaming or something but the second use case is you can have this mounted to an actual microphone stand so you can either have it on a desktop stand itself or like one of those you know five foot stage stands but either way you then still mount the microphone inside it so i like the versatility it gives you alright we'll head back do a sound test you can hear how audio sounds with and without the mic shield okay so as you can see the mic shield is set up it's sitting on my desktop here and the big thing this is gonna do is eliminate a lot of the like the reverb and the echoes that you'd usually get on a desktop like this with the monitors being like two feet in front of my face my you know audio it would bounce back at me this is gonna block that out absorb it block out the noise of the pc going on and really in the end as you'll hear in a second uh versus when i do this without the actual shield on it gives my voice a like a deeper more sort of bassier kind of sound so i think this sounds very very good for the price but now i'll do a sound test without the mic shield okay so now as you can hear this is without the mic shield and yes it's propped up a bit more because my desktop stand is taller than the one on the mic shield so it's going to be higher a little bit that's really not going to make a difference overall you should be able to hear a bit more of the reverb like i said before coming from just the monitors the sound of the pc and it really isn't going to have a like that deep sort of sound i was talking about with the bass because that foam does a really good job of absorbing all of that and just giving it a cleaner sound overall so the mic shield very very good pickup if you're big into podcasts streams anything it comes in at 45 okay now following up from before we had you know the air pods alternative why not like an apple watch alternative or a budget fitness tracker this is the yame or yama or yamama fitness tracker and as someone who does own an apple watch as well as a regrettable owner of the garmin vivosport this will pretty much knock out most of your fitness tracking needs at just 20 dollars it tracks your sleeping patterns your heart rate daily steps you can log up to 14 different sports and exercises if you want to kind of track those activities it alerts you when you're getting a phone call or a text all pretty useful stuff that you would look for in a tracker but at a fraction of the cost here you can see with the vertical screen pretty tiny the ui is very straightforward with the bottom being touch sensitive so you could scroll through and navigate the menu but the point of this is really just to you know log your workouts if you don't want to bring a phone with you i know for me whenever i go on a jog i don't want my phone on me because it'll be just jumbling around in my pocket being annoying here i could just wear this and then it'll all be locked onto the tracker and then when i'm back home within bluetooth range of my phone we could transfer and sync all the workout data to that it also comes in three different color ways this is the navy color one which i dig made for men kids hi i'm a men kid you get the idea if you're in the market for one of these maybe you wanna you know track your workouts a bit more with the summer starting to wind down take advantage of the weather 20 bucks okay for all you gamers i still gotcha now we have the razer deathadder v2 mini which managed to shed 20 grams all the way down to just 62 grams and also managed to shed the price at just 49 as the name implies it's a smaller version of the regular death adder which comes in now at 65.4 millimeters wide at the hips 56 millimeters at the grip 114 millimeters long and stands 38.5 millimeters tall so good for those who palm or claw grip but one thing i like about this is they've now included and added inside the box their razor grip tape which is this textured skin that you can apply to it to give it a nicer grip overall in your hand people often use third-party rubber grips as a mod you can do to your mouse but now just razer includes the pre-cut sets inside the box for you which you can choose to apply to each of the sides plus the left and right clicks the master self contains these same left side buttons and the dpi button up top so visually it's going to look pretty much the same just now smaller and you have the added grip tape the v2 mini also features their optical switches inside which have been featured in their latest releases like the viper basilisk ultimate here they've also adopted the speedflex cable which is their lightweight paracord equivalent which will then also complement their 100 ptfe feat for a super slick glide inside the sensor being used here is the same 8500 dpi found in the viper mini i believe it's still the 3359 i haven't had any liftoff issues it's been perfectly fine for me so that's all good so yeah all together it's a really good value for the price like i said just 50 bucks it's a comfortable mouse for the size i always prefer ergo designs anyways so all good and now with their grip tape it's gonna add a new layer of conforming to your play style definitely a solid release from razer i know a lot of people have been waiting for this and then lastly something you might be able to take advantage of this is a wrist rest as you could see but for your desk so the concept here is pretty straightforward admittedly once you understand actually what it is but as a foam sort of wrist rest that you can extend to your desk what it's going to do is give you that added extra benefit of comfort now especially if you've always been like sort of cramping your arm you know if your form isn't at a 90 degree level with your desk it's going to cause some discomfort so here now you can just attach this to your desk pretty much and there you go it's 11 inches long and 5 inches wide and it is pretty sturdy for being primarily plastic once it's attached i was like hitting it and stuff and putting some force on it and it didn't break obviously that's a good thing i wouldn't stand on it obviously but i feel like rambling on about this anymore is pretty useless you get the idea you see the use case and the practicality if you need a wrist rest and you don't really want one on your desktop and you want to have it extended off your actual desk for just 13 this could be yours so alright guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for august and
