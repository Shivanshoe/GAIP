what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're back with everyone's favorite holiday roundup we have the top 10 cool tech under 50 for all of 2020 showing you the most popular tech items from our cool tech under 50 series this entire year and we're also going to have two runner-ups so think of it as top 12 from 2020 because two of them that are very popular really weren't even technology necessarily but still going to include them anyway these are judging from things like overall sales feedback and affiliate tracking to show off which is the most popular items from the year so if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out give you some good holiday wish list ideas maybe some gift ideas to buy someone else all that stuff so starting off at number 10 we'll wander way down to number one we have the humon h610 pro v2 drawing tablet this was very popular we showed this off in july which was our most popular episode of 2020 and it is still honestly one of the things that i use the most and it's pretty obvious what you can use a drawing tablet for from whether you know graphic design for photoshop or indesign just graphic design in general or even animations but what i like about this in particular is all the extra buttons and functions on the actual tablet itself now i will note the unit i have is the hs610 versus the h610 pro v2 but the one i linked in the description is the more popular item which is under 50. very similar just very minor differences as well so on my unit not only do you have those eight buttons on the left side but you have a scrolling or zooming wheel there's also a button embedded into that up top you have 16 touch buttons which are kind of embedded into the actual surface we can set those to be different tools or certain macros or functions and just press it and it'll perform that function for you that's why they call them soft buttons the stylus itself has 8192 pressure points so it's going to be great to get that real natural stroke whether you're drawing painting doing whatever having that many pressure points is going to make your photo just look that more realistic and accurate and the software is really great when it comes to functionality and customizing this making all the keys be exactly what you want them to be tie them to different software and different integrations to have certain keys be certain functions for different software very useful very customizable and that's honestly why i like a drawing tablet because it just really helps a lot on the creator side that's why they are in general just very very popular the one i'll link down below is pretty much the little brother of the one that i have but it still comes in at fifty dollars next up we have the ice kurail rgb laptop cooling pad this can fit laptops from 15 to 17 inches and obviously below it has six quiet fans embedded into the actual cooler itself but you also get things like an lcd screen to show you the speed two usb ports on the back so you can use one for charging there's an actual phone stand to prop your phone up and obviously the fact that it has sort of an rgb light strip around it for all the rgb lovers out there if you got a gaming laptop i'm sure you're gonna like this so in terms of size it's not too bulky at all it also has different levels of height adjustment if you want to just you know prop your laptop up at a certain level but the lcd screen on the bottom is what really sold it for me because not a lot of laptop coolers at this price point have this it lets you just really quickly and easily on the fly adjust the actual speed of the fans inside you also have buttons on the other side for adjusting the rgb you can make it be like a static color or do the rgb wave it can breathe in and out and believe there's seven different lighting effects total and like i said you also get that included phone stand you can put it in on either side and just use it to prop up your phone so if you're gaming and stuff and you just want to see your phone at all times if you see you get any alerts or anything the phones stand there it's pretty cool for that but obviously as a laptop cooler its main function is going to be to keep your laptop cool and kind of dissipate that heat as well as the laptop pushes the heat out and for just 38 bucks it definitely does its job it's also going to look flashy and pretty cool on your desktop as well coming in at number eight we have the daivum pixu these daivum products are always very popular because people love these customizable screens you could throw up graphics or animations on and this one's really no exception so taking a look at it it's kind of like this square picture frame but the pixels are 16 by 16 for the lcd screen so it's gonna have that sort of like retro that's the 8-bit but more like 16-bit look to it and the main functionality with the pixel is obviously going to come with their app this is where you can go in and change up the graphics make your own have it show you the time of day the weather certain social media notifications will pop up if you want there are literally hundreds if not thousands of different animations and graphics you can pick from it's updated daily constantly adding new things there's even certain games you can play on it it's a really cool desktop gadget that's why people like these but hell you could even like mount it if you want because it is kind of like a picture frame so when i picked it up it was 45 dollars i will say when i checked recently it did seem to be around 55 but the price of this is constantly going up and down so odds are you'll definitely be able to catch it at 50 or under next we have some rgb floodlights and i did not expect these to take off when i first showed them off i believe we showed these in march or april i want to say but i guess i should have anticipated that because rgb is obviously going to be very popular but the main thing with these and the reason i showed them off is because i think they're going to be pretty popular and a big hit with streamers and content creators so for example if you are streaming of the webcam up and you just want to kind of spice up your background with these two floodlights you can angle them in the background have different colors kind of just illuminate it make it more lively with the app you can obviously change the colors have different lighting effects and since the main purpose of these flood lights is for like example right now at the holidays people use these outside actually to light their house to be festive so it definitely makes sense on that front they're also waterproof that shouldn't matter to you if you're using them in your gaming room you know but yeah pretty simple product that again i think gamers and streamers can definitely take advantage of to light the background add some extra colors and liveliness to your room this two-pack was just 40 bucks so coming in at number six is our first real gaming peripheral of the year and that's the glorious pc gaming race model d this obviously a very popular mouse you know the model o is extremely popular the model d is the ergo version of that so the ergonomic shape glorious has just fantastic gaming peripherals for the price this at 50 bucks definitely fits right in but like i said the main difference between the model d and the model o is the shape and size the model o is an ambidextrous mouse that came out in 2019 so it's not gonna you know make this list but the model d the 2020 version is the ergo shape you can get either black white or glossy variants there's even a smaller model d minus if you have smaller hands or you prefer a smaller mouse you can pick up that but at just 68 grams it's definitely one of the lighter ergo mice on the market it uses their very light and flexible ascended cord as well as their g-skates which are that 100 virgin ptfe so they're going to be super smooth and pretty much just glide across your mouse pad in conjunction with the ascended cord it's going to feel pretty much wireless it's got the pixar 3360 sensor which is an esports standard and the switches inside are rated for 20 million clicks so again i've done a review on this it's a very very popular mouse you can check out my dedicated review uh but odds are you're pretty familiar with glorious so no surprise it comes in at the top 10 of the year the model d like i said you pick it up for 50 but then coming in at number five to add some competition between the two mice we actually have a different ambi mouse from razer this the razer viper mini so like i said an obvious difference in shape between the two this is more symmetrical which is why it's ambidextrous and the viper mini is obviously a follow up from the very popular viper mouse but within a mini obviously means it's going to be smaller and lighter in that just 61 grams there's real no surprise why this made the list obviously super light and again once you combine that shape inside with their speedflex cable which is also a paracord equivalent with it being very lightweight and flexible and razer's hyper glide equivalent feet i don't think they have a name for their feet but either way it is a great lightweight ambi mouse it also has rgb embedded on the backside for some underglow which also includes the razer logo there it has six programmable buttons you also have an 8500 dpi sensor which i don't really advertise but it's the bmw 3359 so again all things considered for the price this is a great mouse and it actually retailed for 40 when it first launched which is pretty crazy um you can even find it now for cheaper i believe it's been 30 bucks the past month so for that price the shape the size it is killer winding down to number four is one of the most popular gadgets i think i've ever shown off on this channel and this wasn't even in a cool tech under 50 series but this was in our back to school tech and since it also is under 50 bucks i figured i'd still show it off because you guys bought this thing a crazy amount this is the cable card and it is a super multi-functional useful gadget that is super thin as you can see so what is it right well when you open up the cable card you have some embedded adapters and cables this is so it could be a charger on the fly it has a usbc cable built in but it also has a micro usb and a lightning port adapter so you can just plug this into your pc and charge your phone it can hold some sim cards or some micro sd cards but also on the side there's a slot where if you want to plug in your micro sd card and you plug this into your pc it will transfer files and data it does include a sim card injector for you as you can see as well in the middle you have a flashlight because hey why not then when you close it up and you use the included cable to plug this into again like your pc it's actually a wireless charger so it's a qi charger you place your phone on this and it will just charge wirelessly or you can flip out the little lip on the bottom stand this up and use it as a phone stand also while charging so this thing for just 36 dollars is super super useful which is why i originally showed it off in the back to school tech video thinking you know it might be a hit but i thought it would be a useful product did not expect it to blow up like it did and man i mean i guess deservedly so right all for all the things this can do for like i said 36 bucks it is a really cool gift then coming in at number three also from the most popular episode of the year in july these are the status audio cb1 headphones and for the price the overall sound quality it packs a punch way above its price tag now in terms of design i love how just simple they are there's no logos or anything you just have that sort of brass or rose gold sort of accent ring around the ear cups but they're also super great for portability not only do they fold up into themselves but the ear cups can lay flat around your neck or on your desk which is always a welcome feature when it comes to headphones they're super lightweight and comfy as well with the memory foam ear pads and inside you have 50 millimeter drivers that are very very detailed and they provide a much wider sound stage than you might think for this price these are very commonly used in the studio for mixing because of that sound signature it's just very true to life so when it comes to mixing you're going to want an accurate pair of headphones which is why these are so popular so not only do they look and obviously sound good but you get a detachable cable which is very great because most of the time if a cable breaks on you your sol here they give you two cables that are detachable and say you hook these up to like an amp or a dac and you push these you can really get a lot out of them which again for around this price point you rarely ever see so status is absolutely killing it these usually retail between 60 and 70 dollars but we do have a coupon code to drop them down to below 50 because when i first showed these off they were on sale so i got you guys covered with a coupon code down below doing what i can to save you money you can get them under 50 bucks now next is one of the most popular microphones not only from the year but from my entire channel lifespan for just 35 dollars the five fine k six six nine b sounds incredible for that affordable price tag and we actually showed this off in last december's cool tech under 50. so i didn't even really show it off in 2020 but it sold so well that it topped pretty much everything as you can see coming in at number two from all the cool tech products from this entire year and obviously what you care about with a microphone is the mic test so we're gonna head down to the studio and i'll do that now so you can hear how it sounds okay so for the mic test this is how it sounds it's plugged right into my pc via usb um there's no extra processing or editing this is all raw unedited audio and as you can hear it sounds just really good for that price point it's kind of crazy on the front you even have a little volume dial for controlling the gain whether you want to increase it or decrease it if you're peaking just to adjust those fine volume levels it's just really really something how a microphone this affordable can sound so good for around 35 bucks even comes with a little tripod stand it's adjustable as well so very good stuff here you can see why it's one of the most popular usb microphones at this price point and then rounding on our list at number one but don't tune out yet like i said we still have two honorable mentions the most popular cool tech under 50 for all of 2020 is this super tiny hdmi capture card why did this sell so well well obviously capture cards from like elgato specifically are super expensive this for just under like 20 dollars pretty much will let you take any dslr camera and make it a webcam essentially so for live streaming you know anything on youtube twitch whatever you can have a really great camera be your webcam and instead of spending close to two to three hundred dollars you can just spend 20. now obviously during the pandemic when it came to actual capture cards they were very hard to come by because again people were picking these up for their zoom calls their meetings and not only was the price expensive as it was but it escalated during the pandemic so everybody was spending like i said two to three hundred dollars and up for elgato capture cards and then you started seeing these come to market these tiny hdmi capture cards this one from blue avh i believe was originally around 40 bucks but these have become a lot more popular a lot more companies have put these out so now you can get them for under 20. it lets you take pretty much any hdmi camera you have you plug this into your pc via the usb dongle on the front then you plug the hdmi into the front end of this and now you have that video feed it does give you a 1080p 30fps output uh but what i do and i've used it with my 4k camera and even my 6k camera and it will take that feed and pretty much you know compress it and condense it into that 1080p output and as you can see like it looks really really good it looks like you'd expect a actual dslr camera or whatever camera you're using to look but now it's just being fed to your pc via a 20 adapter instead of spending two or three hundred dollars for adapter to do the same thing okay and just to show you again a quick example of this live real-time this is how it looks straight from my 6k camera which is being just down sampled in the 1080p and if you did want a different version like the 1080p 60hz to get you know 60fps for your video you can it's only about what 10 bucks more so just really really a great alternative these things sold ridiculously well and it's pretty obvious why 18 bucks for an hdmi usb capture card so while that will do it for our top 10 of the year like i said we still have two runner-ups that weren't technology necessarily but still sold very very well first up we have these blue light filtering glasses these are anywhere between 10 to 15 i have them in this clear version as well as this regular version and the reason why i showed these off is because last summer i got lasik and the glasses i was using prior to that just naturally had the blue light filtering on the lens itself so after i had lasik and i wasn't really using those glasses when it comes to gaming and editing and stuff i did get a lot more headaches just again from not having that blue light filtering coating on the lenses so these for a very affordable price they have that blue light filtering and as you can see it doesn't have that orange tint so say you are color correcting or video editing you're not going to have that noticeable tint you can get these in all different colors different frame sizes but like i said these were pretty cheap i wanted to say anywhere between 10 to 15 and then the last honorable mention which absolutely blew my mind because i showed this off again not even in cool tech under 50 before our back to school tech video this is a 36 ounce brita self filtering water bottle so obviously you that would be understandable in a back to school tech video but the reason why this was i guess so popular is because embedded into it it has this natural charcoal filtering system so you can fill this up anywhere whether you have just nasty tap water at your house you're out at a water fountain and you just don't want that you know nasty tasting water with this it filters it automatically and you can have great tasting water just filling up wherever you want uh it comes in a bunch of different sizes as well like i said this is 36. i believe there was like a 24 ounce and an 18 ounce different colors as well i really like this darker sky blue it's called my wife has one like a pinkish lilac color i don't know but yeah like i said very very popular and i believe this was like 20 or 22 which is very affordable and i guess understandable why it sold so well you need your water you got to drink your water and now it'll taste better than just nasty tap water if you uh don't like your tap water taste at home so guys that'll wrap it up for this video on the top 10 cool tech under 50 for all of 2020 like i said check the
