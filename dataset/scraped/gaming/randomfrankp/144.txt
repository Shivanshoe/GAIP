what's up guys it's frank the tank back with episode 232 of room tour project this series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup you see anything you like i'll have all the links for you in the description down below so you can check them out got cyber monday tomorrow so maybe you can find some stuff on sale hopefully but either way we'll start it off now 2 32. first up today we have giroux and this one is one of those fan favorite closet conversion setups where maybe there wasn't enough room in the actual room so all the setup gear fits nicely in the closet for this own personal gaming space and with the use of the foam on the sides on the back i'm sure it sounds nice and you know deaded and stuff not a lot of reverb but it also makes it look really cool with the white light strip behind the monitors it uh pretty much like gives it just a really cool shadow and just depth to the background overall so for the display here he has an aoc 34 inch 144 hertz ultra wide mounted nicely and a good job on cable management which i assume is behind those foam pads and for the peripherals he's got the durgott k320 keyboard with the razer viper ultimate mouse and the razer goliath is extended mouse pad in the background you can see the razer nomo speakers then also for audio up on the shelf above this setup is his headset which is the razer nari that's then sitting on the razer base station that's their chroma stand right next to the pc this is the fractal defined meshify c case understandably we don't get the best shot at the inside because it's up so high you probably didn't want to take it down we have a ryzen 7 3700 x cpu got their stock wraith cooler on there with 32 gigs of corsair vengeance lpx ram an msi xp g570 gaming plus motherboard and an msi rtx 2060 super gaming x graphics card losing my voice there real quick all right but yeah like i said it's not your traditional setup by any means but i love seeing ones like this that just take advantage of the space they have the hardware they have creating a nice setup and putting it discreetly in a closet next up is graham and graham's talking my language with the plants the wooden desk and the toppo wallpaper almost said mousepad speaking of which i hear you guys loud and clear every single day if you want my mousepad to come back in stock just uh put your email in the little box there so you can be notified when it's back in stock and maybe it'll restock it quicker wink wink and yeah i think graham needs himself a toppo mouse pad as well so checking it out he's going with the dual monitor setup rocking both a 27 inch from asus with his primary being a dell 27 inch that's clocked at 144 hertz so the primary on the right but have them both there side by side lined up then we'll talk audio real quick because those desktop speakers they're the jbl 306p and hanging off the right side there you can see the headphones bury dynamic dt770 pro through the 80 ohm version and powering them he has the fx audio dak x6 and the focusrite scarlett solo third gen then for the rest of his desktop peripheral he's rocking a custom build with a dz60 pcb in a nice walnut case also got some gray dye sub keycaps with some of the accented walnut uh keycaps on there as well and inside he has gatter on yellow switches with logitech g305 mouse and then over to the pc this is the nzx the h510i case with a nice custom marble wrap on it to kind of fit in with the sort of theme he's got going on you know the nice wooden accents the plants the marble it ties together with those sort of earthy textures and tones you know what i mean got the intel 9600 kf cpu with an energy actually cracking x52 aio it's also custom sleeved in the white tubing there which looks really nice 32 gigs of course of engines lpx ram on an asus prime z390a motherboard and an a6 gtx 1660 super which he also custom paint in white to fit in with the rest and uh yes your eyes are not deceiving you that is artificial plants inside the pc i hope that does not get caught up in a fan because that would not be good so like i've alluded to it's all about the aesthetic yes the splash of green is definitely nice throughout but it's the little things like having the matching you know wooden guitar on the wall matching the finish on the desk i like the camera the keyboard the blueprint up on the shelves there which also match the desk and then if you want to switch it up you know go with that earthy green wallpaper and stuff and just accent the plants even more so it's a really good job in execution i just wish the white balance was better in some of these photos that's a small request now we've got havoc can we have him on probably close to a year ago at this point but i definitely wanted to see his 2020 changes because this setup is just a thing of beauty i love those hexagon panels outlined with the led lights behind it and it's just a crazy crazy setup as you can see with that absolutely massive l-shaped desk he's got the dual setups going on with his triple monitor set up towards the right side then on the left he has a single monitor setup plus a ton of mentally for light panels and just rgb everywhere so we'll check out the primary setup first featuring the alienware 34-inch 1900 r monitor in the middle with two 27-inch dell monitors on each side by the way those rgb hexagons underneath are the colo lights i've showed those off so you can check them out down below and then down to his peripherals man we got the kbd67 v2 mark ii keyboard with lubed drop holy panda switches and the novoki's vaporwave keycap set on there nice and purple vibes going on with a custom artisan labs resin wrist rest and for his mouse you could see the glorious model o also pair recorded like the cotton candy paracord to also match the coil cable on the keyboard then in the back is the razer viper ultimate it's just chilling charging ready to be called upon that mouse pad is the auramec purple storm with the elgato stream deck there and also for speakers he has the klipsch r15m then the headset peeking off the left side of your screen is the corsair void pro wireless and then checking out the beast that's powering all this this is the nzxt h710 case in black got an intel i9 9900k cpu with an nzxd kraken x63 aio 32 gigs of corser vengeance rgb pro ram on an msi meg z390 ace motherboard then the evga 2080 ti black gpu and then over to the secondary setup which of course is still no slouch with a samsung 4k 43 inch tv there being their primary monitor if you will with the dz60 rgb keyboard with tlio switches and the ducky ultraviolet keycaps for the keyboard got the model oh wireless mouse on this side on the odin gaming and alex soto zero gravity two xl mouse pad man oh man what a room i loved it when i saw it i guess probably around this time last year when i showed it off like i said and it just ah it's just so good the pinks and the oranges and the purples all very complementary colors nice and warm feeling and even in the daytime when like there's not a lot of rgb going on and it's more you know bright and alive with the natural lighting it still looks sick so my man havoc this is what's up now we've got bruno and fun fact i showed bruno off probably around three years ago and his setup looked completely different to now now this 2020 variant it's uh ridiculously cool let's see quick rundown wall mounted pc those cola lights mounted on each side of the tv and the entire desk is one of those custom gaming pc desks so man let's check this out so first we have the 49 inch nano cell 4k tv mounted above as the overhead then getting into his primary it's an acer predator x34 with both the monitors on the left and right side being a samsung 27 inch then if you look down into the desk itself there's actually an additional built-in monitor it might be hard to see but it's the one right below the middle display and that's a 25 inch from lg then above his primary display he has a sound bar mounted it's from toefl they're a german company it's the cinebar 11 and then those massive standing speakers on each side of the desk are also from toefl they're the ultima 40 active that is some serious hardware game and then into his primary peripherals on his desktop his keyboard is the drevo blademaster pro it's wireless and mechanical plus then he has logitech g903 wireless now what's really interesting about his actual desk here is as you can see with that kind of acrylic cutout it says ps4 pro he actually pretty much like deconstructed his playstation pro and has it now laid out and built into his desk and then on the right side is where he has his custom pc integrated as well this just blows my mind how cool it is for the specs there's an intel i7 9900k cpu 32 gigs of adata xpg spectrix rgb ram that asus rg maximus formula 11 motherboard with also the evga gtx 2080 ti graphics card and then for like all the cooling and actual um components and stuff to this the water blocks from ek uh the pumps are from aqua computer and the radiator from alphacool and i don't have direct specs of this crazy nice wall mounted pc but i'm pretty sure this was from his first submission um near like i said probably three years ago at this point it does seem to be a bit updated it looks like a lot more modern uh but super nice looking with the rgb lights behind it and the all white he's even got like displays built into it so you can switch up the theme as you saw before it was like need for speed now it's cyberpunk themed and he's just rocking the ps5 underneath super jealous i still can't get one but this is just an absolute crazy crazy gaming setup and one of the coolest gaming rooms uh you'll probably find out there i love seeing stuff like this and like i said the entire room is just filled with a bunch of stuff you can see he's even got like the tron arcade game a bunch of like collectors boxes and other gaming collectibles throughout the room so man i mean how could you not look at this and think to yourself damn and then lastly from japan we've got jordan m and this one i'm really liking the art on the wall it's a super tidy and clean room very nice aesthetic and even though everything's pretty much like white and black just those subtle splashes of color i think really pop and stand out in a good way so for his monitor it's an acer sigma line 24 and a half inch and this is all being powered off of his laptop which is the asus rg zephyrus g14 it's a 1080p display 144 hertz so he can pretty much game on his primary display if he wants and do some side work on here or treat it like a dual monitor setup for productivity getting work done anything like that getting into his desktop hardware and peripherals always by the elgato stream deck i like the one thing that always pops out to me immediately is when someone has a stream deck the creative pebble speakers in white with the steelseries arctis 7 headset although it's not pictured it also has the drop alt high profile keyboard with logitech g502 lightspeed mouse then forest entertainment center got an absolute massive tv and can we appreciate that hardwood flooring damn that's nice nice and rich looking you know this is also where he plays a lot of his retro games as you can see in the drawers got some old throwbacks in here game boy color ps1 and 64. even got a super boy and i'll admit too for me it's been a guilty pleasure lately to go back and play a lot of those old retro games that i played growing up so uh i could definitely appreciate when i see a collection like that but man jordan m i'm loving this style all around and i think he did a really good job pulling together the anime art and the figures and stuff just throughout the room like i said for being primarily black and white having those splashes of colors makes it look so so good so good job
