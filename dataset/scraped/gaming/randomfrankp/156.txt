what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under 50 for november i know i kept you waiting a little bit last month we did under 100 but we're back today with your favorite price point just in time for the holidays they're creeping up upon us so a great time starting to build those wish lists and gift ideas if you see anything you'd like i'll have all the tech listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and yes heard you loud and clear again in time for the holidays we'll be bringing back some of the giveaways so comment down below your favorite product why you like it leave a thumbs up all that good stuff so starting us out with the hype with the ps5 release in a few weeks as well as the xbox series x how about some cool little light up led signs whether you're a microsoft fanboy or a sony fanboy it doesn't really matter it's all love here these little light up signs can be a cool little addition to your desktop or your entertainment center really anywhere you put these hell you can even like put it on the console pretty much so for the xbox one it's pretty much just like the logo you know the xbox it does come with an acrylic stand so you could choose to stand it up you can either plug it in if you want to just like power it via usb or put in three aaa batteries on the back side and have it just light up on its own there's a power button on the back so it's not just going to drain battery 24 7. but i thought it would be cool too wall mounted because you can do that as well a nice little visual extra piece of flair on the desk and same goes with the playstation icons it's the controller layout pretty much triangle circle x and square this you can also power via usb or just use the batteries yet again there's actually three different lighting effects you have a static lighting effect one that just kind of blinks back and forth very slowly individually the logo and then one that just kind of goes back and forth rapidly uh but again these are pretty simple of a concept i just thought they were cool pickup the sony one is 35 and it seems the xbox one is around 30 bucks next up i know it seems like we're showing off a mouse each and every month but guys like this year we've seen so many great new releases when it comes to a gaming mouse that i really would be doing you a disservice if i didn't show these off and this one is no exception because it is killer for the price of fifty dollars it's the pulse fire haste from hyperx a 59 gram mouse it's got six programmable buttons it's using the ttc gold and micro switches inside so they're very sharp and tactile loving these on the bottom you get those super slick virgin grade ptfe skates the cable is their hyperflex cable so super flexible no resistance whatsoever and it's using their 16 000 pixar 3335 sensor now again at this size i'd say it's around medium it's not large it's not small or anything but at 59 grams that is super super light yes the honeycomb cutouts in the shell definitely you know help with that so if you either you love it or you hate it really i don't mind it because you get that cut down weight however in the box they do include grip tape if you want to cover up the holes on the shell as well as the sides for some extra grip which is nice and an extra set of feet so if the holes freak you out just cover them up but all together for just 50 the pulse fire haste is super comfortable light it's a great gaming mouse i've had no issues with it whatsoever you can get a little rgb lighting and the scroll wheel there and this is definitely uh it's going to be on my list for top five giving myself 20 20. so yeah spoiler alert that's coming out towards the end of the month but this mouse is awesome for the price now next i wanted to show this off because it's finally back in stock after months of seemingly not being in stock and whenever i'm doing you know a mic test or anything i get a lot of questions about my boom arm and that's this one from samson as you can see nice and retractable mounted to the side of your desk adjust it whatever way you want but what i love about this is the fact that it really frees up your actual desktop space i've used mic stands in the past where it does actually you know sit on the actual desktop and it's always either interfering with my mouse or the keyboard when i'm streaming or doing live streams or whatever but this what's really great is you could just mount it off to the side or behind your desk and with that boom arm extend it to go right in front of you right in front of your mouth it's not going to interfere with your vision again doesn't interfere with the actual mouse and keyboard on the desktop freeing up the space and that's why i love this for just 25 i've had this for probably close to a year but like i said every time i've wanted to show it off in the past few months it just hasn't been in stock on amazon so i saw it was figured all right now's the time i would definitely hop on it if i were you if you've been waiting for my stand like this like i said i get a lot of questions about it this one highly adjustable works like a charm can't recommend it enough mount your mic be good to go again 25 and then speaking of 25 next up we have the blink mini security cam which is also on sale for 25 it's been on sale probably for close to a few weeks now at this price point and for a little extra you know mini security cam you can add to your house certain rooms your setup like i have down here in the studio for that price it's pretty much a no-brainer it's super tiny and lightweight so you could literally use just like double-sided tape to mount it somewhere but it also comes in this adjustable ball head so you can mount it on either the bottom side and adjust it to a certain angle or mount it on the back side again so definitely flexible what i like about this is it also ties to your other amazon devices you could ask alexa to show you you know what's going on pull up the live feed real quick it's 1080p so it's gonna be nice and clear uh keep in mind for this video since it's 4k i did upscale it a bit so it would fit your screen so it's a bit sharper than what's showing right now and it also has you know motion detection night vision so at nighttime you can actually see what's going on in the room and you get two-way audio so you can obviously hear what's going on and then also talk back if someone just breaks in your room and they start dabbing all over the place get that out of here it's not 2018 anymore and for the overall image quality as you can see in the daytime and when there's ample lighting definitely passable 1080p so you're gonna be able to see what's going on if you need more security cams in your house you already have you know a security system you can add these for just 25 bucks definitely a pretty good pickup i think and then last but not least when i did my back to school tech video in august at this point everyone was asking why i didn't show off a webcam and truth be told there's just not a lot of quality ones on amazon this is slightly the exception okay what i like about this is as you can see it has this light ring built into it and it's adjustable with three different light levels i picked this up for 45 dollars it seems it might have been hiked back up to around uh 55 but again with the holidays coming up keep an eye on this as well as all the other prices this time of year prices fluctuate like crazy but this 1080p webcam is gonna get the job done it's not gonna blow you away in terms of you know video quality and stuff like that but odds are it's going to be a lot better than your built-in webcam i'll show you the example in a little bit but it's super adjustable you can adjust the head and turn it 360 degrees clips in the back of your monitor and you'll be good to go plug it into your pc no software needed which is always good no extra bloatware for zoom calls online schooling and lectures hopefully it'll give you a quality bump all right just for a quick demo of the actual mic quality here obviously again with these usb microphones around this price point unfortunately they're not going to blow you away but from what i've seen other ones i've tested and obviously compared to a built-in you know webcam on your laptop or whatever it is better quality and the fact you have that light ring here is an added extra bonus now this is currently at 100 so i'm gonna turn it down and you can't really even tell cause there's a lot of lighting as it is right now so this is zero one two three again it's not gonna make too much of a difference in these pre-lit conditions like this but if the lights are all off in darker conditions it will make a bit of a difference so this is the first sort of you know i guess level of brightness then is the second level so you can see starting to light it up a little bit and then you have the third level here so it adds just a little bit of something to otherwise nothing and it's not too bad all things considered for the price with a built-in light ring around it so as you saw from the quality not the greatest thing out there before the price really not too bad i tested a lot of other knockoff ones on amazon and this one was definitely the best for the price uh so yeah if you want to pick it up around that price like i said before fluctuating every now and then not too bad for between 45 to 55 bucks and the webcams are pretty much essential nowadays so this one with that light ring twist and guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under dollars for november hope you enjoyed stay tuned to the channel we got a lot of tech
