what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with another episode of cool tech under $50 for June the series where you show off some of the best tank you can buy under that price point if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and yes I heard you all out and clear to kick off the summer we'll have the return of the giveaways so if you see something you like hit that thumbs up button down below and comment your favorite product and why you like it now first I know is gonna be a huge hit which is why I'm getting out of the way right now probably gonna sell out this is the blue AVH HDMI capture card essentially a cam link from Elgato but at a fourth of the price this can turn any sort of camera into a webcam essentially it comes in at just 48 dollars versus the Ogando cam link which has been out of stock and selling anywhere from 250 to 300 dollars you literally just plug the USB into your PC HDMI and goes right into the camera you turn it on and you're good to go the setup process is very simple whether you're using this with you know OBS stream labs xsplit you get the idea this will appear as one of the video sources then you're good to go alright so just like that we are up and running under $50 for the capture card you can see the quality here with my camera is so so good ten times better than any webcam will ever give you and I've had no issues with this whatsoever no stuttering no freezing no latency anything like that we are looking good and another thing is this is actually using a 4k setting on my camera but what it does is it down sample to 1080p so essentially you're getting that higher quality overall mash into the smaller image output which is also gonna be good for things that when you're keying out of green screen having a higher bitrate with an actual camera plus the higher resolution is gonna make keying out a green screen ten times easier it's just crazy this is under $50 and I don't know how anybody could buy a cam link right now it's the fourth of the price and you're getting fantastic quality and then next as a follow up it's a pretty good combo item and that's this Z tilt tripod head as you can see it lets you get some you know extra verticality here plus some really unique shots if you want to like some overhead stuff straight up it just like I said each of that extra flexibility that a regular tripod head wouldn't give you so whether you do want to do it again like you saw with your camera as like a webcam scenario to give you an extra dangle there's just so many extra ways you could put this to use I know for me I use it with my slider to get those really tough to get overhead shots it's literally just mounted up in the ceiling but I don't have to spend too much time on this I think you guys can understand why this is useful to pretty much anybody who has a camera and a tripod it just gives you that extra level now of you know creativity if you will I got mine on B&H which doesn't seem to be available right now but I will put the newer one which is an equivalent one on Amazon for just $30 down below alright so next this will make more sense in a second trust me that's this USBC native union cable and what I really like about it is first off just the nice striped braid to cable to it but also in the middle here you can see is this not but it's pretty much like a weight you can use this in conjunction with a keyboard and really make it look cool so this cables been out for a while but it wasn't until I first saw it used with a keyboard I kind of clicked it made sense to me obviously custom coiled cables are hard to come by through they're expensive or not in an active group by face so with here if you want to kind of customize your keyboard that has USB type-c you can and I think that knot looks really cool then that is pretty much just so the cables and slide around so it's like a paperweight but I think the visual is a nice touch now obviously it doesn't have to be used solely with a keyboard you can use it to charge USB C devices and again that paperweight will help us it doesn't fall off the desk and move around but I just think with someone who does have a nice custom keyboard that's gonna fit you know the black and white theme this could be a pretty nice addition I picked it up for $34 next we have a brand new follow-up from Believe It or Not the top-selling keyboard ever from this channel which is the tech where phantom this the phantom L a low profile modular mechanical keyboard as if you see that's pretty thin these just came out and they do have the same features as the original tecware phantom but you're getting that an extra stealth factor here and that is faster due to the new low profile switches and guess what you can also use the NATO Kable on here - because it's USBC so definitely one of the main selling points to this is the fact that it has ha stop switches which not a lot of keyboards at this price point do half that means you can just pop the switches out of the socket and swap them out and with these new low-profile switches since they are shorter in height they also actually at just one point two millimeters which again is faster than a traditional switch there is software for changing up the profiles macros and RGB lighting but on the keyboard itself there are 18 different RGB modes plus whether you can go in and configure your own to create your own lights and stuff so yes it has that built in which is good because you don't need the software always a big thumbs-up and as you saw we have the red low-profile switches so we'll do a sound test so you could hear how it sounds in gaming with it with the low profile linear switches they felt quick nice and smooth so I'm a big fan of the keyboard overall for just $50 the build is nice and design I think is minimal low profile hot swap switches it's just a great option if you're looking to possibly upgrade to a mechanical keyboard if you've never had one before you've got rubber dome for the price this is a big yes and then last but not least is a brand new gaming mouse from Logitech the G 203 light sync which is a follow up from the popular 2017 G 203 prodigy and it's just $40 inside that uses a 200 to 8,000 dpi pix our optical sensor it has 6 programmable buttons and I would say sadly smaller side at 160 millimeters long 62 millimeters wide and 38 millimeters tall tad bit small for me but you know that's just me on the scale it comes around 85 grams which is necessarily a light lightweight Mouse but it's still lighter than most out there but for the size and gaming with it I had no issues whatsoever and of course yes it has RGB lighting and all that stuff but come on it's 2020 of course it does quick little montage someone yeah super rip so it's a simple compact mouse that doesn't have a fancy cable doesn't have any fancy feet but I think would be a great candidate to be Pei recorded and get some of those real nice hyper glides in the bottom because for $40 that gives you that more flexibility to kind of customize it and make it better but I mean just for 40 bucks I think it's a great Mouse I'm happy that they did release a new one as a nice follow-up from their g2 a3 prodigy like I said from 2017 definitely a good Mouse for the price and guys that I wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under $50 for June hope you enjoyed and if you think about it put everything I said today together you can use the capture card with the Z head okay and then while you're gaming you could use the phantom L keyboard with the native union cable and the mouse and you've got a whole setup for everything under $50 each see what I did there hope you all enjoyed like I said don't forget give this video a big thumbs up to show your support and check out all the products in the description down below well I'm random Frank P hope you enjoyed hope you're saying safe have a good day
