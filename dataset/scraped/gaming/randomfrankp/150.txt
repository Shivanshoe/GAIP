what's up guys i'm random frank p and yes it's finally here today we're going to be talking about and reviewing the brand new logitech g pro wireless x super light a follow-up from the g pro wireless so we'll go through it all talk about what's new what's changed and some few glaring points about this mouse if you're thinking of picking it up you're going to want to know so rounding out 2020 with the year's worst kept secret everyone knew this was eventually coming after numerous leaks from esports events it's always just a matter of when and what do they actually change from the original and given the name super light you can kind of guess it there it shed nearly 20 grams from around 80 to now 63 without any holes in the shell just think about that for a second they cut down nearly a quarter of its weight and looks wise visually not too much pops out of you right away it's that same ambi egg shape that's trusted by many and proven by many in the esports world but hey everyone's hand size and preference is going to be different but some new features i was happy to see was the new and improved feet a better sensor light scroll wheel and no rgb giving it a really clean and simple design overall with the silver logo on the all matte black body as for content inside the box you have your setup guide and some other documentation you have the wireless dongle and the extension module if you don't want to plug the dongle directly into your pc the extender will let you do that you get a set of soft rubberized skins for the left and right clicks as well as these sides and it's actually very grippy overall it's pretty surprised i'm definitely liking these there's also a microfiber cloth a ptfe replacement puck to swap out the stock puck that's on the bottom of the mouse already this now just gives you more surface area for the feet and then the same micro usb rubber cable with a trident connector which means yes unfortunately for whatever reason logitech remains one of the few companies not transitioning to usbc to charge this brand new mouse in 2020 nearly 2021 and that also means from what you saw inside the box or what they excluded this time around was that extra set of the interchangeable side buttons they used to give you and i assume that you know comes at the cost of the the redesign internals and the shell inside they probably just couldn't make it work with the new weight so i did want to point that out and also they're selling this mouse in like a really light gray or a white variant which i think you know personally looks equally as nice and then again taking a look at it the reason they suck with this shape in particular is because it's such a usable design for all different hand sizes and grips and while some people will still find it uncomfortable the fact is most users will find a grip that works for them with it but yes physically still more the same minus those interchangeable side buttons so lefties i'm sorry they alienated you this time around then flipping it over you'll notice there's no longer a dpi button underneath so that'll often be done in the software or with a macro then also as i showed you with that stock puck on the bottom of the mouse that comes out you can also house your usb dongle in there but you can swap it with all ptfe puck for that extra glide and by the way they both weigh the same so it won't change the overall weight of the mouse and it's pretty obvious the jump in size the zero additive ptfe feat made that's the same thing as the marketed 100 version ptfe but i agree i like the zero additive name more just sounds more appropriate but they're not scratchy they're nice and smooth all across different mousepad surfaces i've tried so i'm a fan of these for the sensor here it's their hero sensor with their light speed technology adjustable in increments of 50 from 100 dpi to 25 600 dpi not that anyone's ever going to main it at that speed it'll never really be necessary it's more kind of like a flex at this point i play it like 500 so yeah but all in all it's been great so far no issues with lagging no acceleration or liftoff issues it's been pretty good then for size it's still definitely on the medium to larger side it comes in at 126 millimeters long 40 millimeters tall 63 millimeters wide at the back hips then 61 millimeters at the middle grip width but the fact that you effectively cut nearly 20 grams to the internals without needing to add holes in the shell i think is really impressive now switches before we get into that we'll do a sound test you could hear how they sound with all the clicks okay so you heard the left and right clicks with our tensioning system nice and tactile overall i really like the side buttons here they're really you know discreet with the body and it fits in really like uniform in a way and they don't stick out to the point where you're gonna you know like accidentally press them but they're also like they're just right there they're a very good and satisfying click the scroll wheel itself you heard very quiet and there really isn't that sharp tactility to it when you're scrolling or pressing in but it feels good so it feels better than it sounds if that makes sense in terms of durability when i was you know squeezing the top and bottom and the sides there was no creaking uh no give at all to the body so that's very good to see because considering they cut the internal shell nearly 20 grams it didn't you know sacrifice the overall design but speaking of durability one thing i definitely noticed with my particular grip is the right click did definitely have some post travel and it was more so when i would click near the scroll wheel it would go in and sort of down to the left it's hard to replicate when i'm not like you know gaming in the moment so i'll try to show you but i did notice mainly on this side that there was just more post travel didn't really interfere with anything though okay so now that we can talk switches and using my x-ray lens here you can see we got some white omron switches it wasn't x-ray i was just angling up and i didn't want to take it apart but here's the thing let me tell you a really quick backstory okay so this mouse the g pro wireless originally released in august of 2018 and that's when my wife and i bought a house we packed up we moved all in like a two-month period so i missed a few things during those two months i missed a lot of launches this being one of them so by the time we were all settled into the house i bought one for myself and it immediately had double clicking issues so i never reviewed it i really checked it out because i was like all right i'm gonna rma that and i'll move on i got more important things to check out and double clicking has been the number one issue with g pro wireless over the last two years it's a great mouse like i said it's used widely in the esports community but double clicking is a very very big known issue so did they change that with this switch my voice is cracking here's the thing i don't know i don't know what switches they're using here because they don't openly disclose that you can look anywhere you want nowhere in their press releases nowhere on their website in their marketing nowhere will you find what switches they are are they 20 million are they 50 million i don't know all that i do know is they said that some changes were made to these switches so does that mean these are still going to have double clicking issues does that mean that they fixed it i'm not really sure but i really feel like we should know that and as a reviewer i want to know that so i can tell you guys because if the number one issue plaguing this mouse was double clicking as consumers we need to know if that was fixed but unfortunately they don't disclose that i have no idea why will this have issues in a month two months a year two years i don't know i'm really hoping whatever it was that they said that they fixed for this time around had to do with that it would be great if i had any information on just what the particular model was and again i don't want to really open it up right now because i'm going to be using this mouse for different videos coming out for the holidays and i don't want to mess with anything and i feel like you know with common sense that should have been openly addressed and they should have fixed those problems that's why it's weird that they're not openly stating yes we did fix that like the g pro wireless is one of the top selling mice of all time it's a very popular successful mouse so if we're getting a follow-up just tell us yeah you made it lighter but did you fix the number one issue i need to know now battery life on here is rated for 70 hours which is definitely a good sign and i'll save the first day when i got this a little over a week ago i used it that day for 12 hours straight between gaming and editing left it on overnight came back the next day and only drained four percent total so in that 24 hour time span from me using it for me using it and then keeping it on overnight it drained four percent very happy to see that and it's effective power management and i charged it for 30 minutes just to see what kind of a boost we'd get and we got around thirty percent so that's an average of one percentage per minute obviously and again it would have been great to have usbc because the monolith wireless that is usbc and in my 30 minute charge test it gave me full battery from being completely dead so why not have it now logitech then before we wrap up is their g-hub software it is very simple easy to use the main tab you can change up the six programmable buttons and just decide what you want them to be from macros keyboard shortcuts launching software anything like that and tied into certain programs and then for adjusting the dpi like i said increments of 50 from 100 to 25 600 but what i do like is you'll note each of the dpi steps you have are color coordinated and that'll actually then reflect to a little led on the mouse itself so you know what dpi you're at easiest way to toggle between them is just activating the g shift in their software and assigning one of the keys to do that so to recap then for me i haven't had any issues like i said gaming's been fine the nice new zero additive feat with the massive surface area underneath feels really good no issues while gaming but that's 100 what i expect so long term wise that's what we're gonna have to keep an eye on willis have double clicking issues i'm happy they physically didn't change too much because again trusted shape used and loved by many i like that they're giving us uh some color options no rgb means better battery life and this has great battery life and the new and improved feet definitely feel really good and as for switches that's kind of up in the air because i don't know if they're different don't know through the better don't know if they're the same so tough to say um for cons that's definitely an obvious that it should be usbc 2021 is next month and we're still charging with micro usb come on and then the point that's going to hit everyone right in the hearts is this still costs and fifty dollars which yeah they got away with with the g pro wireless and it's sold like hotcakes again one of the most top selling mice of all time and they did it then they'll do it now but my issue with that is the entire landscape has changed in the last two years we've had great lightweight wireless mice come out that have been significantly cheaper yeah the viper ultimate's right on par with that but you have the ponytails are custom that's a hundred dollars i think it's even down to like 80 now you have the rival 3 and the air aux 3 both under 100 the brand new modelo wireless what was that 80 and while yeah this is definitely on the lighter side of all those for sure it's very impressive how light this is still charging 150 and nearly double the price of the modelo wireless that's uh that's a tough pill to swallow so it's very very hard for me to give you guys a definite yes i recommend this mask because in the end right now it's very good i do like it a lot i've had no issues but again the main point here is we don't know what switches are being used or what improvements they've made over time and until they address that until they tell us it's it's a big shrug you know what i'm saying and if you are a g pro wireless lover if the price doesn't matter to you and you're just rolling in the benjamins you just want a lighter version of the original cutting down now to 62 grams without holes then sure you're gonna be picking this up you know regardless but for me right now it's just tough to give you guys an honest recommendation with the switches still remaining a giant question mark so alright guys that'll wrap it up for my review of the logitech
