what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for april the series we show off some of the best tech you can find under that price point see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and shout out to last month's winners i just picked your comments from last month's episode so we'll be in touch and if you're trying to win something from today all you have to do is hit that thumbs up button down below make sure you're subscribed obviously and comment your favorite item and why you like it and also this episode is sponsored by karma which is an app and a chrome extension to save you guys some money looking for coupon codes all that stuff always a good thing we'll have more on that in a little bit now first up is a 360 face tracking phone mount this is great for face timing or zoom calls where you want to keep yourself in frame but maybe you're moving around the built-in lens locks onto you and it spins around always keeping you in frame this is also really great if you're like live streaming or maybe you're making tick-tock videos youtube videos instagram live anything like that you now have the freedom to move around and stuff without having to worry about getting out of the shot or getting out of the frame here it tracks you and with this there's no manual calibration needed you don't have to download some sort of app for it to work it works with whatever sort of you know camera app you have on your phone that you frequently use and when you turn it on it'll do a quick 360 to scan the area it'll look for your face and track you from there the built-in phone holder does rotate up and down if you want to angle it a certain degree it also films both vertically and horizontally so whatever orientation you'll be good to go with that built-in mount so for my testing this does work best if you're standing a ways back from it a little bit so it can actually track your face but i did find that if i was a bit closer like here as you can see um it still did work because it was able to i guess detect my body and stuff moving around so it tracked that instead of my face but really no complaints it worked flawlessly in all my testing so again the big reason why i picked this over the other ones out there is a not only does it have the most positive reviews but there's no app needed so you don't have to use their own app their own software and stuff use whatever app you want camera tracks you automatically and it's only 40 which is definitely a really good price for this now like i mentioned in the beginning this episode is sponsored by karma which is an app and a chrome extension it's constantly using tech behind the scenes to scan the web for coupon codes price drops all that good stuff to save you guys some money and actually used it for this very episode uh we're going to show this off in a minute don't worry no it looks kind of confusing this was 50 bucks and using karma it let me know in this drop down 20 to just 40 bucks so i saved 10 on this so on the karma site or the chrome web store just install the karma plug-in it literally takes you like five seconds now whatever site you go to you can track items save things you're interested in and you can get notifications via email or mobile push when an item you save comes back in stock is on sale or has an active coupon code so just to show you real quick with that face tracker mount we just showed off all you have to do is save the item right there there'll be a little karma logo on the side of the page you click that now you can manage everything you can then set it to alert you when it goes on sale or drops in price you can create lists of other things as well you saved so you can track them all here in a nice and organized way just to show you real quick everything i've saved lately i'm now gonna be notified immediately when something goes on sale or drops in price karma also instantly scans your cart for coupon codes and this is a special feature on your computer so the chrome plugin is a must another cool thing is their cash back feature where you can earn cash via paypal when you shop select retail partners again whatever you're shopping for or trying to buy saving money in the end is always going to be a good thing which is why i want to show it off today i have a link for karma in the description down below so you can check it out next up sticking with some mobile accessories real quick we have this 1.33 anamorphic lens for your phone it comes already pre-attached to the mount so you can use this on literally whatever phone you have even with a case blend is adjustable as well so you can fit it right on the back of your phone and now you can get some really unique looking anamorphic shots these lenses are often used in movies so it gives it a very cinematic look with these really crazy light streaks pretty much every michael bay movie has crazy light streak so that's what anamorphic is these typically start at like a hundred dollars and up for a mobile anamorphic lens this one just 40. so a really good deal these light streaks are going to be better suited for like nighttime shots and stuff and there's more of a contrast with that direct light source just to show you real quick just scanning around you can instantly see that blue shriek on the light sources and yeah while it's not like the craziest effect here again this is in the studio with all the lights on but it gives you a pretty good idea of those light streaks so this obviously won't be for everybody but for those who really want to you know get in touch with that more cinematic dramatic side it's a really cool accessory for the price now with it being a 1.33 lens out of the box the footage does need to be dissqueezed it's called there are some apps out there that can do it you can also do it in like final cut pro or premiere really really easily and it'll then just squeeze the footage and make it look normal i just think if you're in the market for something like this at this price it's a no-brainer now next up i showed you just a minute ago we had this very odd looking thing this is called a base shaker okay buckle up so what this does is instantly provide you know a tactile base response to whatever sort of source you plug this into think of it as a subwoofer or if you're familiar with a company called butt kicker they make these like pretty much base shakers that you attach to your chair so when you're gaming you get that tactile response and that feedback and that's exactly what this does but it's only 40 dollars so picture this you know you're playing some battlefield you're playing call of duty whatever you're throwing grenades you're taking shots the explosions the gunfire you can now instantly feel that this really takes that level of gaming immersion to the next level these are often sold for cars or people who have crazy home theater setups they attach these like the bottom of the couch or the sofa or whatever and now whenever there's a big base impacted movie you feel it but for gaming it's definitely awesome and companies out there you know make those headphones or some headsets that have that bass response i've always loved them so when it comes to something like this that you can get that tactile response while you're gaming even more it's just crazy so you can mount this to the bottom of your chair if you want or what i did is mount it underneath my desk so now when i'm gaming that vibration and feedback is spread right into my hands through my peripherals with the mouse and keyboard it doesn't throw me off or interfere with my gameplay at all but now i just have that actual response it's it's crazy now this is not going to be for everybody because there are a few steps that you need to get this you know fully up and running you're gonna need banana plugs speaker wire some sort of sub amp to you know fully power this and control the actual tactile feedback and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack to connect this to your pc or whatever source to use this with and also you're going to have to go into your pc sound settings and enable stereo mix so you can have both audio coming from your headphones and then also to the sub amp to power and fully train with that signal to the actual base shaker so you can do that with a stereo mix in your sound settings there's companies out there like a voice meter you can download ear trumpet it can be a bit confusing so this is not going to be for everybody like i said but if you can figure it out and if you're familiar with audio stuff like this it won't be too much of a task highly recommend this next stop's gonna be a pretty hot commodity it's probably gonna sell out in the first few minutes so hop on this while you can that's this rgbw ring mood light so as you can see you can go full rgb but also for like your desk or whatever you have three different white levels of like a warm white to a medium to a cool white so on your desk this could look pretty nice but also has full rgb tons of different built-in effects so really depending wherever you want to put this in your room on a nightstand in your setup you have that full control to make this as crazy looking as you want hell if you're a streamer you want to even like mount this over or above your monitors to give you some extra crazy glow you can because this also comes with a mount to fully mount this to your wall but i think for a desk lamp you know fitting it into a nice clean setup really just like i said wherever it looks really cool so with all the effects not only do you have brightness control but you have speed control as well and i'm telling you there's more than 20 effects i didn't even count them all and i can't show every single one obviously but there are tons of different colors different animations this thing has more effects than most like gaming keyboards out there and it's just crazy everything this can do for the price of just 35 dollars now i've seen these circular you know desk lamps before but they usually only do like a white or some sort of like a warm white you know i haven't seen one that does this with full rgb and not only the fact that it does rgb but the animations are super smooth bright and vibrant it just looks crazy for the price of just 35 which i think is a no-brainer hands down pick this up right now i know it's gonna sell out this is gonna sell out almost immediately and probably gonna be one of the most bought things this year so i already contender for top tech of 2021 but man definitely a crazy light just 35 then lastly we have the gorgon which is a completely 3d printed mount under your desk for like your headset your headphones as well as a controller for me this is really convenient because i always have some sort of controller on my desk for whether it's some racing games or skateboarding games and plus hanging a headset there keeping it off my desk to clean up some of that clutter just a really good two-in-one the top of it is that 3m adhesive so once you stick it underneath your desk it won't budge you won't fall off it's good to go if you guys remember i did show off different headphone hangers in the past from brainwaves but i like this one because i haven't really seen an under dash controller mount before so a straightforward but effective product i picked this up for 19.99 so get rid of that cluttered desktop clean it all up with the gorgon and guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for april again sponsored by karma of a link for that as well as everything i showed off today listed for you in the
