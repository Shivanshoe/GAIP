what's up guys i'm random frank p here with our yearly back-to-school tech video summer flew right by before we know it and here we are but this year obviously due to the circumstances this is going to be a twist of back to school tech as well as online classes and online schooling tech and accessories regardless of what grade you're in you know middle school high school college university anything like that these things will surely help you out if you want to check it out i'll have everything going to show you in the description down below as well as a free trial to sign up for amazon prime if you haven't already they have great deals for students you can take advantage of same day shipping discounts on books textbooks movies all that stuff and stay tuned to the end because they have a pretty special announcement about this video you're going to want to probably check out now first up is something extremely useful that i wish i knew about earlier that's this cable card and there's a lot going on inside that uh might surprise you so this is a crazy all-in-one gadget that has some pretty useful things not only just for students but really anybody can take advantage of this so when you open up the cable card that's where everything is there's a lot more than what meets the eye so for starters built-in is a usb type-c cable with a type c to type a adapter an adapter for micro usb and a lightning adapter and that's pretty standard for just charging and stuff there's a sim card ejector tool some slots for holding a sim card or a micro sd memory card but built into the side is actually a memory card reader if you want to plug this in to transfer files or photos then you got a built-in flashlight because why not but also built into the actual device itself is a wireless qi charger and then it's a phone stand so all this in a really slim form factor as you can see put in your pocket your bag it's not going to take up much space at all and the charging cable and stuff like i said before pretty self-explanatory with the usbc cable and the adapters you could literally just plug this into anything in a pinch if you need to charge your phone but the fact that it also doubles as a wireless charger is awesome if you're at your desk you know just sitting down or maybe you're at the library you plug it in set your phone on top and then you have a wireless charger but like i alluded to with the stand there's a little lip at the bottom you just flip that out and now you have a phone stand you couple that with the random flashlight built in the micro sd card reader this cable card is a must-have accessory for like i said not only students but anybody who is constantly traveling or on the go and it comes in at just 35 i think it's a no-brainer next up we have an amazing sounding microphone for the price and obviously it's going to be for those who are doing a lot of online classes and stuff where you need a microphone when i asked people on twitter about online classes the most common requests they had for me to show off was a good microphone without breaking the bank obviously and that's where this fifine k669b comes in i already own this i showed it off before in the channel and it sounds fantastic for under 50 dollars it also has a built-in volume wheel as you can see it comes with its own adjustable stand and works on both pc mac and even ps4 if you want to you know use this for gaming when you have some downtime so we'll head back to a sound test so you can hear how it sounds okay so as you hear this is the mic test all raw unedited audio i'm just recording this right into the timeline so i can finish filming up and as you hear it sounds very very good it's super clean there's like no distortion and stuff going on in the background and it's one of the reasons why for the price of just 45 dollars it is an amazon top seller this used to be even cheaper for the pandemic but unfortunately they kind of hiked the price a bit even still for under 50 bucks this mic sounds phenomenal next up maybe for some college students or also students you know with online schooling we have this pretty cool desktop lamp that's actually for your monitor this is the tommen's e-reading light bar and it attaches to the top of your display and provides some lighting to cover your desktop or workspace don't worry if you're a laptop user i got something else for you coming up next but this tommen's one i think is really cool for just forty dollars so with the spring loaded clamp you pretty much just set this on the top bezel of your monitor and there are three touch sensitive buttons on top for turning it on and off you can adjust the brightness the color temperature plus a button that's an auto shutdown timer and it's powered via usb so you can just plug it into either a wall adapter or just right into your pc and now when you need to get some homework done or whatever you're typing up a paper you turn it on and your desktop is now good to go since it's angled down as well there's no actual glare on your monitor which is good and i just really like the fact that it gives you not only dimming control but changing up the color temperature from a warmer to a cool color which is nice there's also a little built-in center up top to kind of dim your lamp automatically this is just thirty dollars plus amazon has a three dollar coupon you can apply at checkout tommen's makes some really cool stuff this is no exception so as a follow-up to that like i said maybe you have a laptop and you don't have an actual monitor so you can't really use that light bar this is a dedicated desktop lamp from taptronics and not only is it cool looking but it has some pretty damn cool features as well for a lamp so first it's just very adjustable from the angle and rotation of the actual stand itself the neck is also able to rotate 180 degrees but then the light bar itself can be angled flipped up it just has some serious flexibility if you're trying to get that feng shui just right but on the base of the light itself you have six controls they're all touch buttons for auto brightness a timer a night light mode an angle button so you can adjust the actual angle of the leds inside a brightness button a color temperature button and then next to that you have a rotary knob for power you know turning it on and off but that's what you also use to adjust all those settings this lamp is definitely opie all right i mean it looks like something straight out of portal and it's definitely overkill admittedly for a desk setup but that's like 100 why i like it it's definitely gonna stand out plus you never have to worry about buying light bulbs again right and to top it all off there's a usb port on the back side so you can just plug in a phone charger set it on the base and then your phone's gonna be charging so this taotronics lamp is 69 but again amazon also has a 10 coupon if you want to click that to bring it down to just 59 bucks so whether you want this for your desktop or the tommen's one for your monitor you'll be good to go when it comes to lighting then also from taotronics i saw this listing while i was looking for that desktop lamp we have a really solid pair of wireless headphones that again not only if you're a college student you know walking around campus you want to bump some music or if you do have online classes and you need a solid pair of wireless headphones that also have active noise canceling built in so you don't hear your brother screaming his head off in the background got you covered meet the sound surge 90. these come in clutch so first off i was just super impressed with the sound quality here and really the overall quality of just the headphones themselves they fold up into each other with the rotating ear cups which is great for travel make them nice and compact they also come with their own carrying pouch and have 35 hours of playback for the battery inside are 40 millimeter drivers that all things considered sound really good when i was testing them listening to some music around the studio during filming but like i said with the hybrid active noise cancelling they feature there's a switch on the side you can just turn that on and off that's going to cut your outside ambient noise by 30 decibels they say now obviously i can't judge if that's 100 correct but it did block out the sounds of my pc fans and i was sitting down as well as the ac so i'd say that's a pretty good job also built into the ear cups are the power and pairing button you have the built-in volume controls a 3.5 millimeter jack in case the battery dies you could still use these wired but it also has a usbc port for charging and with just a five minute charge you'll get two hours of juice i'm just absolutely loving what taotronics did here with these again if you're walking around campus you want to listen to music while you're walking to class or if you're home online classes these are awesome for just 40 but again they're listed as 59 but with a generous 20 coupon code by amazon at checkout it brings the price down okay so moving right along into another desk gadget is this lenovo smart clock it's powered by google assistant so you can tie it to your music accounts video streaming accounts reminders calendars all that stuff and the four inch display is touch screen so first i just really dig the simplicity for its look the gray cloth texture it has is nice and minimal and there's only two physical buttons up top for volume there is a mute button on the backside and a usb port for charging so as a desktop gadget or maybe for your nightstand i'm really digging it you just swipe along the screen to go through their quick menus and you can change up the wallpaper to any of the eight built-in ones they have and depending on the night or day you can kind of change up whether you want to be a light mode or a dark mode certain wallpapers also have different color themes you can go in and change which is really cool they all have this sort of minimal vibe as well which is nice for a clock face and you can also add like a weather widget to it if you want or apply your own photos to the clock face you get the idea for smart clock it's pretty capable but also it's like i said since you can link your accounts to it like spotify for example the audio quality here is much much better and a lot louder than your phone will ever get and it sounds pretty good and coming from me i'm someone who's used the echo dot the echo spot the echo show all from amazon google definitely has the upper hand when it comes to ai assistant so ask it whatever questions you want it'll search the web and have you covered lenovo recently had a back to school promo where this was just 50 bucks which is when i bought it i checked recently doesn't seem to be active right now because they're backed up to 90 you can easily find these going anywhere from 40 to 50 bucks from people selling them on ebay if you want to you know check there first save yourself some money highly recommend this next up it's admittedly one of the more boring ones i think any student can agree it's a necessity and that's a hard drive or an external ssd and as you can see this thing is super tiny so you take a look at this and yes it is an external ssd so you get better speeds versus a traditional external hard drive and just look how much smaller it is compared to a regular external hard drive that we've been seeing in the market for the last like 10 years now and regardless of what kind of student you are what kind of you know subject you're studying students are always gonna need that extra hard drive space here with the seagate one touch you have this nice woven fabric material it comes in a white color as well there's also a few different designs on amazon if you want to go check them out there it still connects via whatever the name of this plug is i do wish it was usb-c but this model here is the 500 gigabyte version which is just sixty dollars they do have a one terabyte one which is a boost to 140 doesn't really add up in price but hey i think for 60 bucks 500 gigabytes for your back to school projects files all your needs this could be a great pickup for the size of like a credit card okay so next let's talk backpacks for a minute because obviously back to school maybe you want a new backpack for the year i bought five different ones different companies and this is the one that i can say is the winner so it is the adidas mid veil it's called it comes in a bunch of different colors i got it in this white and black sort of variant i'm an adidas fan so you know kind of partial to it but it's got a lot of pockets up top side pockets inside it also has like the sort of drawstring sort of opening so you open this there's also more pockets inside fits up to this is a 17 inch or a 16 inch sorry macbook pro so uh there's tons of you know just space for carrying around a laptop notebooks textbooks all that now i know where i live it's been like raining pretty much every single day in august so far so i couldn't get some good b-roll and stuff outside but yes this midvale backpack is the one that i'm definitely recommending it's got two outer side pockets for like a water bottle or anything there's also a zipper right on the front if you want to throw some stuff in there on the top cover there's also a zipper with an additional pocket up top plus the inside the additional storage you have in there like i said it says it can fit up to a 15 and a half inch laptop which is your more standard size and stuff for carrying but if it's my 16 inch macbook pro no problem so you're definitely not gonna have an issue fitting a lot of books laptops anything inside here the material is also like rain repellent or you know water resistant whatever so it'll just be right off here won't get anything inside you have wet this was around 60 i believe i know when i bought it it was just under 50 because amazon's always having sales you know how it is but yeah i'm digging the mid veil and like i said has a ton of different colors you can pick from okay so next not really tech here but it's still going to go along with back to school accessories and gadgets and water is a necessity right this is a self-filtering brita water bottle it's 36 ounces it comes in a 24 ounce i believe as well but it's self-filtering and i'm very weird about two things in particular okay i'm always buying wallets and water bottles or like you know ramblers i'm always trying to find like the next cool minimal looking one or something like that i know it sounds stupid but i'm always buying new ones and this one from brita comes in this nice nice sky color and let's be real you gotta stay hydrated here you can drink and refill all day with you know tap water fountain water not have to worry about that funky taste because it just filters it all out it has a built-in straw a carrying loop up top and the lid is sealed so it doesn't leak on you now the filters inside are good for up to two months or every 40 gallons of water you drink so hey think about it this way you're saving a lot of money because you're only going to need to really just buy this and maybe like a pack of filters instead of constantly buying a pack of water at the grocery store b it's good for the environment because there's less plastic waste and see this 36 ounce bottle is only 22 and then a pack of six filters is just ten dollars so you're literally getting over a year's worth of drinking water for just thirty dollars right again this is the night sky color my wife saw it and she wanted ones that she bought i believe the sea glass color they have tons of different ones it sounds stupid but i'm pumped about it and i wanted to show it off for you guys because i know students always have water bottles here you can cut down on the waste and fill up anywhere now next again not tech but it's a pretty interesting aspect when it comes to different notebooks these from oxford are actually stone paper might sound confusing at first i know but with stone paper it has properties that make the actual paper itself water resistant so that a if this gets wet you drop it in a puddle or you just get it you know soaked water is not going to actually seep into the paper and damage it but it also means that whether you're using like sharpie marker ink it's not gonna actually bleed through the paper onto the following page the material of the paper itself is velvety smooth when writing on it i'm a pen type of guy and it felt like i was just carving up butter with a hot knife you have 60 sheets per notebook they come in a few different colors this is the blue two pack and i guess this could also be the third exception because in addition to water bottles and wallets i buy a lot of notebooks i have a ton of them around the studio and most of them are unused and the two pack here of the stone paper comes in at 15 which yeah is kind of pricey but again the stone paper material itself is pretty damn cool then last but not least is something i'm admittedly unsure about um but it's definitely going to be useful in a time like this this is a uv sterilizing sort of box you put your phone in here your wallet your keys air pods whatever and it'll sterilize it completely from bacteria i say i'm unsure about it because there's no 100 certain way for me to verify that you know but again since it's using you know the uv lights inside which is what does actually the sterilization you can put those accessories and gadgets in here and have to worry about it getting damaged because it's just uv lights now i know phones are obviously bacteria ridden we don't think about it but it's true because we're constantly touching them using them bringing them with us in the bathroom possibly and let's be honest how often are you cleaning your phone so with the pandemic you want to be you know clean you want to be safe having a little sterilizer like this could be useful it takes only three minutes from start to finish you put whatever you want in here press the button and then it'll actually tell you when it's done it's only 20 as well so if you want to be on the safe side you can pick this up and all right guys that'll wrap it up for this year's edition of back to school and online classes tech hope you all enjoyed like i said everything i showed off will be listed for you in
