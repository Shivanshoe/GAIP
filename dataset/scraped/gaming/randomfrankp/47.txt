what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we've got a big one if you're a fan of shroud then you know this has been a long time coming today we're gonna be checking out and reviewing the brand new logitech g303 shroud edition wireless gaming mouse this has been something fans been asking for for years now especially over the last six months or so we started seeing some leaks pop up here and there but it's finally out so the story with this and how it's become so popular and relevant again is logitech originally launched the g303 daedalus apex back in 2015 for 70 dollars and it was nothing special at the time and didn't really sell too well it wasn't until shroud started streaming full-time and obviously he's grown quite the name for himself for the last few years but that was the mouse he used and would dominate with during streams and fans that would try to buy the dallas apex which was then discontinued would see prices for it skyrocket up to 400. on ebay and people were actually paying that now fast forward it's the end of 2021 they teamed up and re-released a brand new updated version made entirely with shroud's input and his hand size in mind yes more on that note in a minute but taking a look at it there are some minor visual changes to this brand new updated release this 74 gram wireless variant ditches cables and touts their hyper speed technology and the hero sensor all updates that are miles ahead of the 2015 version and hey we actually have usbc on a logitech mouse finally then real quick just to show you a physical side by side as i said earlier this mouse was made specifically for shroud's hand shape and size so we do have some differences in terms of the actual dimensions and now there's no rgb this time around they market it at 75 grams although on my scale it comes in just at 74 like i mentioned which i think in terms of the current mouse market it's still light yes definitely but more so medium sized versus others out there right now it's 117 millimeters long stands 23 millimeters at the front flare and is 40 millimeters tall at its highest point and in terms of width the middle grip on the top of the shell is 70 millimeters and towards the bottom of your fingertips grip it is 63 millimeters now it may be minor but this mouse is slightly larger in almost every dimension versus the original g303 is that gonna turn some people away probably not because the changes are small but yeah it is actually larger because they fit it to fit his hand size his grip where his thumb sits all that stuff so they really tailored it to shroud do we all have the same hand size as shroud no but hey at least we actually have it now they also said they change where the switches are positioned inside now it feels like they're more in line with the scroll wheel versus on the original g03 it was more in line with the top of the scroll wheels they're seated a little bit back definitely feels right i'd say and just a note real quick i do wish the scroll wheel was textured instead of the smooth rubber now it's not a big deal or anything because it is still rubberized i just like that extra you know tangible texture on a scroll wheel but that's just me i'm not shroud uh now with all that in mind we'll do a sound test you could hear how the g303 sounds altogether it's a very solid and compact build no squeaking no rattling to the mouse anywhere no post or pre-travel anywhere not on the side buttons not left and right clicks a very very good job in terms of construction and as for the switches inside they don't really mention it anywhere but i think it's safe to say they're using those same um omron 20 mils that we saw on last year's g pro x super light and next up speaking of which the coating here is that same matte texture from the g pro super light it's soft to the touch but it will pick up easily on some fingerprint oils and smudges it does feel smooth though but you know usually any marks will wipe off pretty easily with your shirt or some sort of microfiber cloth the left and right sides of the mouse are made up of this slightly transparent plastic which is a shame they ditched rgb because it probably would have looked really nice and diffused here but i get it they favor battery life and having rgb only would have worsened it now one of the more questionable design choices here is the magnetic usb drawer on the back underside of this mouse this is where you can store the wireless dongle if you're bringing it somewhere but to me this is just a wasted space with extra added materials only adding to the overall weight i much prefer that hollow cutout under a mouse you see on some razer mice for example you can choose to just completely remove the butt plug it does come out with some force and you'll see inside there's that little magnet but now you just have this big gaper on the back and it's not nice to look at you know with this big hole in the back honestly i really don't like this decision by logitech taking the drawer out completely will bring the mouse down to 72 grams so again you're gonna cut down a little bit of weight but you're just gonna have that hole in the back side so it's up to you they really just should have threw in a little cover or something then real quick before you move on underneath is your zero additive ptfe feet it's that same 100 pure feet we see on the g pro x super light last year we have two large pads on the top and bottom then one ring around the sensor and for that sensor logitech is still using their own hero 25k dpi it goes from 100 to 25 600 dpi in the hero center is also designed with conserving power as one of its strong points because this is rated for up to 145 hours of use again while having rgb would have looked nice you'd realistically be looking at around 80 hours max then so my personal opinion and experience and i'll say right out of the box when i first you know got it out held it and looked at it i was very very skeptical of this shape remember the original g303 didn't sell too well at all that guy discontinued pretty quickly because the shape was just so different from the usual you know ambi mice out there and it's not you know ergo in that sense um it just didn't fit a lot of people's grip but now you fast forward a few years and this shape something about it it is perfect like i said i was very very skeptical but the grip is just so natural now you know by community terms it is an ambidextrous mouse but by definition this is a hundred percent ergonomic especially for a claw grip or fingertip grip users for me i usually have like a hybrid of claw on fingertip you really cannot palm this mouse comfortably at all just the way you have the curvature underneath the top shell where it goes down that is perfect to fit your fingers it is insane how comfortable this mouse is and i get it now i get why shroud used this and loved it because it is perfect for that grip now i will say it does feel a bit back heavy it's not perfectly balanced i'd say um if you give the mouse like a nice glide on your mouse pad again with the zero additive ptfe feet it's a nice smooth glide but the mouse will sort of like spin out a little bit because the back of the mouse you know where the hips are where it starts to bow out it does feel a bit heavier back there that's not a big deal because again depending on your grip and your play style um that might be a good thing i know for me like when i'm playing battlefield the new battlefield 2042 just came out and if i'm you know like running and gunning and stuff i'm having that extra sort of you know feeling of weight in the back is great for controlling recoil and stuff because i don't need to do a quick drastic you know drag down to control my shots but man i'm telling you guys from being super skeptical to super on the boat i 100 love the shape of this mouse i really didn't think i would i really didn't now if you're curious about software it's still compatible with their g-hub software from logitech um but it's not required you know it's not like a razer mouse it's not necessary by any means in fact i don't even have it downloaded because since i have this mouse before it's initial release it doesn't pop up in g-hub so i didn't use it at all but in there's where you can control the dpi and you know adjust your pulling rate all that stuff with the 1000 hertz pulling rate adjust all that and um again if you want to charge it we finally have usbc but the battery life as i said 145 hours is fantastic really loving my time with this so again a new updated wireless version usbc omron 20 mil switches we get better feet than the original great battery life because of no rgb they're doing some really really great stuff with this in terms of cons i can sort of you know rehash what i said before i do wish the scroll wheel had some texture to it just my personal preference and this butt plug just isn't it logitech this is just too much wasted materials would have been great if you could have had some cover to put on here to take this out or like you see on you like i said razer mice it's hollowed out underneath there's that little uh cap you put over it and you're all good would have preferred to see that now this does come in at 129.99 msrp so 130. you would have loved to have seen this for 99.99 right because you take a look even the g pro x super light that was 150 when it launched but it was lighter than this this at 74 grams like i said it's that middle point in the mouse community so i think 130 is just a little bit too high that's that shroud tax though okay i don't know what kind of cut he's getting but 130 should have been 100 shroud tax do i recommend it yes do i love it yes will this sell like hotcakes when it comes out because of his fan base people who've been waiting for this new re-release yes i get it logitech i get it great stuff here so guys that'll wrap it up hope you enjoyed if you
