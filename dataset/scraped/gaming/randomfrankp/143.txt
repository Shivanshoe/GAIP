what's up guys i'm random frank p oh sorry about that today we're back with an episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for december the series will show off some of the best tech you can find under that price point right in time for the holidays now hopefully giving you some good gift ideas for yourself or somebody else if you see anything you like i'll have all of it listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and also shout out to last month's winners i've been in contact with you so you can claim your tech and if you want to win something from today all you got to do is hit that thumbs up button down below and comment your favorite piece of tech and why you want it now first up is the tribit stormbox micro and not only are these really good sounding bluetooth speakers that are 100 waterproof and dust proof but has a few cool tricks up its sleeve that i think really separates it from the rest of the pack out there for the price and first just stay in the obvious you can buy it either black or orange as you see built into it is this super tough straps you can attach to something like your handlebars a backpack this will not budge obviously you have built-in controls for volume and playback a usb-c port for charging you hear that logitech but what i really like is if you have two of these you compare them together and set them to party mode so they both play music when connected to just one device or what i think is executed perfectly here is their stereo mode stereo mode left channel right channel this means you can have one speaker be the left channel and the other be the right channel so you get actual stereo audio coming from these little speakers let me tell you what they do it right the distinction between them is really good plus they get pretty loud so if you want you can have these on like either side of you in your room it's like you have some desktop speakers but they're just a little tiny storm box all around they just really impress me i know speakers aren't like the most amusing thing to see but these just sound really really good for the price and that stereo mode functionality is honestly what sold it for me it seems like they usually retail for around 49 but they've been on sale the last few weeks for 38. next we have the cinema lightbox i thought this was a cool little pickup for people who could maybe put this in the background of your youtube videos or your live streams or just to remind yourself some inspirational quotes ah yes much inspire it can fit 24 letters on the board itself with a hundred numbers and letters included for you total and there's even a spot on the back for storage you could power this with either batteries or the included usb cable to light it up now with something like this marquee box it's obviously you know pretty self-explanatory but i thought it'd be a cool little pick up for the holidays to write little messages to your loved one around the house make it festive make it straight facts like p is stored in the balls you guys got the idea by now no need to ramble on anymore about it this comes in at 29.99 next up we have a 50 microphone that i honestly didn't have the highest expectations for and then i got it in tried it heard it and it really surprised me how good it sounds this is the razer siren mini as you could hear definitely good enough for doing voiceovers or stuff for live streaming i just did not expect it to sound this good and obviously i'll cut the background music so you could hear how it sounds and i'll use this for the rest of the product segments you can get a good feel for the mic test but man for 50 bucks this just highly exceeded my expectations so inside they have a 14 millimeter capsule that has a super cardioid pickup pattern which is really going to be good for focusing on picking up your vocals right in front of you it comes with the included stand and base it can swivel around if you want to sort of angle it in a certain direction to where you're going to be sitting in front of it and it's just super tiny and simple looking with just the led light on the front so you can know that it's on but there is no volume adjustment or headphone through it's just a tiny mic here with a 5 8 inch thread so you can put this on a mic stand or a mic boom arm you might already have and real quick just for like a general you know typing test and stuff in the background i have a keyboard with cherry red switches behind this so with that super cardioid pickup pattern you may be able to hear that in the back as i'm just typing random stuff uh but again with that pickup pattern it should do a pretty good job of eliminating that and mainly focusing on my voice now again i did not think this was going to sound this good i've tried okay i've tried other razer mics in the past and they just never really blew me away until we got this in and just for fifty dollars uh really really impressed me live streaming you know voiceovers for gaming and stuff talking to your friends this is a killer option next we have a pretty interesting one and i know you're all familiar with pudding keycaps right we'll meet the crystal keycaps from g-skill these are the same idea but instead of having the translucent side to the caps here they're completely transparent so you can see it makes the rgb shine through really intense since there's nothing there to really filter it and just make your keyboard look crazy as you see it comes in a black crystal set as well as white are you kidding me don't do what i just did look at this i busted it i busted it so with their sets it comes with 104 keys for the standard ansi layout plus you get a keycap puller as well and for those of you who aren't too familiar with keyboards yes these do fit those standard mx style stems so odds are this will fit just fine on your keyboard there are minor visual differences to the black m white crystal key set for example on the black you're also going to get that additional sort of outline around the characters and stuff or just more so around the keycap up front so you have that additional layer of rgb kind of shining through around the keycap in addition to obviously the bottom so either way like regardless of what keyboard you put this on as long as it has rgb effects it's gonna look crazy just for a side-by-side comparison so you can see how it looks versus the pudding keycaps like i said pretty much identical only difference now is that they are transparent instead of it being translucent so you can see right through it even if you just want to keep it like a static color and stuff the rgb shine through is going to be really really bright now that does mean you're also going to be able to see part of the stem and the actual switch on the sides but honestly if you're buying these for the rgb you're probably not gonna care that some of the switch is also uh visible so still wanted to point it out these g scale crystal keycaps come in at just 20 bucks which is definitely pretty good also like directly on par in competition with the pudding keycaps so same price but now more rgb next up is something i know a lot of you are going to be after that's this rgb pc panel for just 50 this gives you a ton of extra functionality to your pc and it's all completely programmable and it's really useful so first up with these four sort of rgb knobs each one can obviously be turned either left or right but each one can also get pushed in for an extra function obviously you can set these to be like volume control playback control skipping tracks in spotify you can even tie it directly to obs to change your sound settings in there on the fly which is really really cool the software 4 is really really well done and inside you can go in and change what each direction of the dial does like i said also when you press it in so if you want to use these for like color correction and stuff during video editing you can what i also like is that the software is it shows you real time the direction of the knob as you turn it which little detail but i like it the rgb on the dials can also be controlled if you want to be just a static color or change up the rainbow effects and change like the speed and the variation of the rgb but i know you rgb lovers gotta keep it flashy but for the price i'm just really impressed with the functionality and all the customizing you can do to it like i said with the four knobs make them be playback and media controls you can have each dial designated to a certain audio input or even output launch programs or commands make macros and not only is it tiny and compact you can keep it on your desktop with no problems but you can also mount it underneath your desk it does come with these two mounting pads if you want so there you can still have it at an arm's reach but tucked away underneath the desk keeping those knobs out of fingers length there's a joke in there somewhere like i said for 50 bucks this pc panel is just an absolute steal i know a lot of you could probably take advantage of something like this all right guys so that'll wrap it up for cool tech under 50 for december hope you all enjoyed don't forget so anything you'd like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out
