what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be reviewing the absolute feature-packed asus rog chakram a gaming mouse with a programmable 3d joystick you have hot swappable switches inside three different modes of connectivity qi charging the absolute brightest rgb i've seen on a mouse and the list goes on and on so in case you're interested in this mouse you might want to pick it up got you guys covered today so usually i just do a quick unboxing in the video to kind of add to the overall experience but this one's actually pretty important because there's a few things to uncover literally since the mouse just comes completely apart you can remove the cover the left and right buttons and you just have a lot going on so the total package here i'll get this right out of the way it retails for 160 dollars but that hefty price tag is kind of what i expected when you factor in everything this does and can do this the overall modularity of it i think justifies that and speaking of hefty it comes in at 121 grams on the scale sits 132.7 millimeters long 76.6 millimeters wide and that does not include the width of the fin and 42.8 millimeters tall so a big boy that falls right along with the likes of the razer bass list ultimate g502 dark core rgb and so on and also shape wise it does follow the similar design cues of those popular ergo mice but more on that in a bit let's get back to the packaging inside you have your carrying case a near 6 foot braided usbc cable for charging a usb extender that clear puck looking thing is a blank badge for inside of the mouse then you have the accessory box for the spare parts a longer joystick and a joystick socket cover if you want to just take it off a set of tweezers and two additional omron switches plus an rog badge so taking a quick look at it before we turn it on and blind you with some rgb like i said with the ergo shape and the fin off the left side of the mouse for your thumb it is very similar to the shape of the g502 razer bass list ultimate which are very very popular so this is going to fit right into that category then you turn it on and you're blinded so since the mouse is very modular with these translucent shells you can take off the back panel which will reveal a slot for the usb dongle plus that asus badge right there which comes right off and you can swap it with the the clear one which i'll show you more in a minute and the spring loaded left and right paddles come off revealing the modular switches inside and this is a pretty big feature to a lot of people but it's not really new asus has done this in the past and it's really a great thing swapping the switches out is very very simple as well with the included tweezers you literally just grip it on the side and pull them out it's pretty much like the whole concept of hot swap switches on a keyboard and the two switches that come stock inside the mouse are these blue omron switches from japan they also include a secondary pair of gray switches which are still pretty tactile but not as sharp sounding so a very simple hot swap process if you want to switch these out make them interchangeable and the advantages of this is say one over time dies to become faulty you can just easily swap them out or if you just want to mess around and try different tactility in switches you have that option they did say they're compatible with other omron d2f and d2fc switches whatever that means i'm not too up to date with omron switches out there i'm more of a keyboard guy and real quick i'll do a sound test you can hear the two different switches in the left mouse click i will have the stock blue switch then on the right mouse click i will have the secondary gray switch so like i said i don't know too much about different omron switches but it does feel like the blue switch is definitely more sharp and tactile than the slightly less cloudy gray switch i don't know if there's really different weights and stuff like that but yeah figured i'd do that so you can hear it and you saw when i was like gripping it and squeezing it for a primarily plastic mouse you know like 95 plastic i'd say it's pretty durable there's no squeaking no like crunching nothing alarming which is definitely good now let's talk about another key feature this has that not enough mice include in my opinion and that is the joystick the chakra has two different sized ones as you saw and it literally just pops out and snaps right back into place when you want to either swap them out or just remove them completely but a joystick on a mouse has a ton of advantages for a lot of people not even just gamers but people working with 3d modeling and cad and stuff like that it has two different modes analog and digital in the software analog is acting for like a joystick and digital is for mapping the inputs to be whatever you want literally like whatever function you can think of here in gta i have assigned to the up down left and right movements on the joystick are for controlling the plane and same goes for most vehicles and stuff in game if you take a close look at my thumb the joystick is controlling all the movements here now i will say that not every game is going to be the same odds are you're still going to have to go into your game control settings and assign the keys so it knows what you actually want the joystick to be so keep that in mind but just having both analog and digital options is a cool addition just for another example here i have it remapped to was so i can literally control the player movement with walking and obviously still aim and look around with the mouse now playing like this definitely takes some getting used to the coordination with all the movements on one hand isn't easy at first but it just does go to show you the flexibility you now have all with one mouse and it's literally just three fingers controlling all in-game movements so big ups for joystick on a mouse love this feature another thing i want to point out and kind of like i just alluded to you're gonna have to really get used to remapping it and assigning this in game they actually have on profile three on the mouse that's more made for your analog inputs and stuff and using this as like a controller in game so if you switch this to the third profile it'll be better for that you still have to go into steam and pretty much have it enabled so that you're like using an xbox controller so recognize the inputs kind of confusing a little bit tedious you're gonna have to mess around with your in-game settings and stuff like that but it's okay but now let's flip it over because there's still a lot going on under the mouse including the pixar 3335 sensor it goes up to 16 000 dpi in increments of 100 steps and there are four default dpi settings saved to the mouse at all times now while you can obviously program the dpi in the software which i'll show you in a minute if on the bottom you hold the dpi button in for three seconds the mouse will start to blink and you can use the scroll wheel probably kind of hard to see right now and you could use the scroll wheel to actually set what you want your dpi to be and it's color coordinated so from the uh like the red colors is your lower dpi all the way back up to the blue and green colors which are your higher dpi so it gives you that really cool on-the-fly flexibility to just fine-tune it if you kind of remember what the color scheme is to the dpi but also on the bottom obviously your on and off switch with the left side of that switch being the bluetooth mode and then right next to that is the pairing button so if you want to use this just via bluetooth you can in the back over on the right side of that switch is for using this over the 2.4 gigahertz connection with their usb dongle we do have just stock teflon feet on the bottom here there are three different pads uh so they're not gonna be like the hyper glides that you're probably used to and stuff but since the mouse does you know have a bit of weight to it just from inertia like when you just glide it along it does coast pretty well i'd say but yeah that's just because it's heavy then under the dpi where the rog chakram sticker is this is actually where they have qi charging built in and you wouldn't know it if you didn't know it that sounds stupid but nowhere on the bottom here the badge nowhere on the mouse does it really have a qi charging batch so you put this on a qi charger and it'll wirelessly charge which is definitely pretty cool so if you have one of those for your phone already you could wirelessly charge it but if not on the front side is a usbc cable which is another big thumbs up everything's moving towards usbc so the fact that it has that is definitely cool and if you plug this in for just 15 minutes it gets you nearly two hours of battery life so you plug it in real quick you can definitely get a pretty good amount of a gaming session in just off of a few minutes and speaking of battery they say with no rgb on this is rated for 79 hours which is definitely pretty good and with rgb on they say it's rated for 48. i say cut that in half though i would expect around 24 you know usage hours with rgb on because this thing gets very bright and i would assume the rgb is going to drain it a lot faster now i haven't really been able to test that fully because just unknowingly i've been placing it on the charger and stuff and then charging it overnight but like i said i would expect around 24 hours with the rgb on because it's hella bright and let's just talk about that right now the rgb here is literally one of the brightest i've seen on a gaming mouse it literally has headlights like this is straight out of tron it's like a car you have a few different modes in the software first up being static obviously keeping it one static color breathing is gonna let one color pulse in and out and note you can only pick one color color cycle is going to go through the kind of rgb color spectrum if you will reactive is going to kind of pulse you know the colors on the lighting zones when you press down on a key rainbow which is going to be the splash of all the colors at once you can see it's not really a smooth effect it is kind of choppy comets like a quick dash of lighting all around the mouse then you have partition mode which pretty much just lets you customize all three of the rgb lighting zones and either make them different colors or combine the different effects so you have some flexibility there with partition i would just keep it on one static color though that'll lead us into the last part of the rgb before we move on which is this sort of clear puck they include so you can see in the mouse right now how it has their asus logo on the bottom and this is the stock badge they give you this if you want to use a sharpie and sort of make your own design so that way you can put it in the mouse put the the shell back on and then have your own sort of logo going through it's you know it's cool they included that not really necessary um but yeah figured i'd still point that out if you want to get creative then as we wrap it up we'll go into the arm recreate software which is where you can change it all up obviously the buttons tab is where you can remap the buttons then on the bottom side where you see left and top if you click left that will give you the option to switch up the joystick from digital to analog and then when it's in digital mode you can reassign the up down left and right movements to be whatever sort of function you want whether it be a mouse function a keyboard function a gamepad function multimedia on and on the performance tabs for switching up the four dpis on the mouse with the angle snapping on and off as well as your pulling rate and a button response time and the lighting tab which i kind of showed you with the lights the calibration tab is just for lift-off distance from low to high nothing with like a calibration for your mouse pad surface and then you have the power tab which will show you the remaining battery percentage as well as alerting you past a certain percentage when it's getting low and like an auto sleep timer but one thing that really bums me out and you see this a lot and it doesn't make any sense to me here it only shows you inside the software under the power tab you can't find the battery percentage anywhere else and it only goes in increments of 25 which i think is very very dumb that should definitely be changed up even if it's just in increments of five not 25 that's no i want to know exactly what my mouse is at that's just me so bringing it all together for 160 dollars it's a hell of a mouse this thing is very very impressive and like i said in the beginning i really don't think 160 for the complete package here is that bad considering all the flexibility and modularity you have with this and everything it's capable of now the weight yes it's definitely pretty heavy it's it's a hefty mouse but honestly in all of the lightweight mouse reviews i've done i still see in the comments a lot that people still prefer heavier mice so this 100 might be for you and again due to its size and shape and from me using the g502 for like four plus years i got right used to this and it felt great now this mouse is the most expensive out of the other ones that i mentioned the dark core rgb basilisk ultimate and g502 light speed but again i think the features this has does kind of out punch those currently at this price the only real downsides or negatives that i can think of number one isn't really the mouse it's just software with not being able to see your exact battery percentage let alone just anywhere else other than inside the power tab and second i will say the qi charging is kind of finicky where you have to place it because it's just on that weird kind of side of the butt of the mouse but it's really not a big deal i would just use the usbc for the fast charging because that's going to be better anyways i will say though just because of after using now the viper ultimate for how many months and i've kind of gotten used to lightweight mice from using the then the model oh to the viper ultimate this probably isn't for me it's an absolutely great mouse but i'm just going to be more used to that lightweight sort of ambi design that i've been used to and really love gaming with so this is a fantastic mouse i won't be using it as my main but i think right now this is one of the tops on the market and one of the best you can buy for a hefty price tag but there's gonna be no buyer's remorse here i can pretty much promise you that and guys that'll wrap it
