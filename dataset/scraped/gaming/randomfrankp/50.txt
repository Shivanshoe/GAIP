too many boxes all right let's bring this down we've got a lot to unpack and go over today don't come back up i just i jus what was that about whatever what's up guys i'm random frank p and as you can see in front of me there is just too much stuff that got delivered so i figured instead of unboxing it by myself roll some cameras and uh we'll see how this goes because these unboxings are usually pretty chaotic you know but again a nice switcher from content hang out for a bit grab a coffee grab something to snack on and let's just start diving in so real quick uh my wife and i went on like a little baby moon before the baby gets delivered we went up to uh to boston for a few days had a great time walked around salem walked around boston for a bit went and saw andrew santino at the wilbur just had a nice and relaxing little vacation and when i got back this was pretty much all in my doorstep and uh it's a logistical problem okay you don't want to come home to this blocking your front door so let's uh let's start opening this stuff up but yes i don't even know where to begin so i'm just going to hop into this behind me i see novel keys stickers and that's usually a good thing and i don't believe i know a lot of times when we do these unboxings it's typically a lot of keyboard stuff i don't think that's the case because i haven't ordered any sort of you know new keycaps or anything related to keyboards for a while now so uh this will not be just a random keyboard unboxing video like these usually tend to be and okay so no overhead camera this time it just wouldn't work out today so i'll have to show you otherwise but in here this is actually an order i placed hashtag not sponsored i picked up some more wrist rests because i really like their other resin and wooden wrist rests that i showed off a few months back on cool tech under 50. really like fast orders a few different colors so i can just get a good idea of variation and i ordered these uh big switches because first off they're smaller than i thought they'd be definitely you know i mean it's bigger than your average switch i thought they were going to be like a massive switch i don't know why um i'm going to start doing a lot more giveaways coming up for the holidays i'm making a big like you know just box of random tech that we'll be giving away uh once i hit 2 million subs which is hopefully going to be very soon i want to do like a 2 million subscriber live stream member subathon where you can become a channel member and we'll do like certain rewards certain giveaways at certain tiers so yeah got a bunch of just random stuff and this is that big switch that's very clicky all right for some reason i think i'm confusing it you guys remember a few years ago when razer made their uh the brand new like huntsman lineup and in a lot of the pr packages we got that massive optomechanical switch that was literally like this big that's probably what i was expecting for this okay switches and wrist rests what else we got so this i'm not gonna lie i've been eyeing this up from 100 thieves and high grounds odds are by the time this comes out okay so by the time i'm filming this it is currently like mid-october you're probably gonna see this either end of the month or into november okay let me do a better job of stacking and making some space i should just put us all like on the floor whatever uh but as far as i know again by the time you're seeing this you probably know what this is i did see a glimpse this morning uh bad seed you guys know brian he uploaded a video on 100 thieves keyboard so i assume this is some sort of keyboard this is a very big box and i don't know what else is included all i saw was his thumbnail but yes i guess a hundred thieves bought out high grounds they've made like pretty cool keycaps in the past and 100 thieves obviously very popular how wait okay this is going to be a whole project isn't it is there a special way to open this not set up for a special unboxing all right i'm thinking like this typically you guys know this isn't the proper way that i film so i'm not used to these more wider shots with a bunch of stuff on the desk holy hell okay i want to open it like this for you guys so yeah this is a is this ah what this is like a pretty cool painted fake rock with a keyboard underneath okay so i'm digging the looks again um i saw bad seed release a video on this this morning what is even in here this is first off just a crazy package company like to go all out you know with these uh cool little pr boxings and stuff never had a spray painted fake rock with a keyboard inside i'll tell you that don't know what to do with this okay put it off to the side for now this is an instance where an overhead cam probably would have worked out what else we got we got more stuff in here okay uh high ground designed for hype geek culture hype geek went from hype beast to hype geek what a time to be alive this is just the box for the keyboard i guess um got some more stuff under here a little bag what's this foil inside man like a lanyard possibly yep oh a little lanyard for the bag these are always pretty cool again hi uh high ground they've been an established company for a while i have a few sets of their key caps in the past and i guess now you know visually and aesthetically with their branding and stuff it does fit in with the high ground and 100 thieves let's see this is what kind of switches we got here i'm gonna do that are these reds gather on reds okay i don't know if i'll do like a review on this because again just to reiterate for you guys by the time you're seeing this this is probably old news you're gonna see this most likely um either on the 30th or a week after the 30th so yeah might just be old news for you guys that was loud and we got a nice hoodie oh okay okay i can always appreciate some good merch you know oh nice guy now see on this this i would wear out sometimes you get merch and it's either like just too plain and stupid or it's kind of overdoing it and i think this this is a nice nice hoodie i put it on uh but it is hot like i am burning up right now all the studio lights yeah i'm warm i'm warm okay i'm a basketball shorts and t-shirt kind of guy i got pants on and this sort of sweatshirt so bit hot but i just knocked something off pretty cool i'll put that back over here for now stubborn box stubborn box okay we are only two boxes in and i've done a lot of rambling and not enough unboxing so now we're just gonna get into the rest of it okay okay i don't know why i don't know i should have done an overhead camera what do we got here okay so another keyboard i know i opened this up with saying there's not gonna be too much keyboard stuff and so far we're three for three with keyboard stuff um but again i don't know what all this i'm getting is so this is the fnatic streak 65 lp so a limited edition i assume or maybe like a new edition we reviewed this last year and this is seemingly just a brand new white edition speed switch speed switches low profile white coil cable it's looking like um improved pbt key cap so a nice upgrade for sure of the original streak 65 uh nice nice also check this out looking pretty cool always like a nice white and clean looking peripheral set so happy to see more white peripherals uh becoming a thing you know forgot about you hello okay next we'll hop into this one so um one thing again just a rant because who cares what i did and it is so much more efficient was i put some black medical tape over like a lot of the stuff you'll see like my shipping info and tracking info you would not believe how many times when i do these unboxing videos like in the past i would just use like sharpie or like white tape over it and you couldn't see you couldn't see my info but you would not believe how many people have this weird obsession with wanting to be the reason you delete a video it's it's so weird so like you know like i said i'll use some white tape some time and people be like uh random frank p i know you used white tape but if you look at two minutes in and if i take a screenshot and upscale it in the software and put it into photoshop and turn down the highlights i could see your shipping address you should delete this video and obviously you can't see the address i'm always like oh yeah okay where do i live you live in arizona it's like no i live in the complete opposite part of the united states but good try good effort uh put that much effort into getting some friends you know because uh i you and i i know it kind of sounds like i'm being harsh but there are always multiple people on these videos just trying to act like they see my address i need to delete the video when it's not a thing okay the epos b20 streaming mic nice so with the holidays coming up you guys know every year i do top five gaming keyboards top five mice top five headsets last year the past two years we did top five microphones i'm gonna be doing all that and more this year and another one of the things i picked up to add to the sort of spread of gaming microphones out there which i've heard some really good things about is the epos b20 is the epos epos i don't know but yes nice so i want to get some you know some more options to check out before those videos go live lots of testing coming up and uh looking nice with my heard it hurts uh did i have a stroke from what i heard it sounds very good tons of control loving the way this looks so cool happy to get to get this in finally and add it to the queue of this just there's so much tech i'm gonna have to go over in the next few weeks is that recording yeah to make the top five videos for you guys all right let me clear this section out of here looks like we have two identical boxes from pulsar um a little bit different okay different weights as well i thought they maybe doubled up and sent me to the same thing uh pulsar man i don't know don't think i've ever worked with them before um so i'm not 100 sure what we got in these boxes again this is probably an instance where an overhead cam would have been beneficial to you guys my bad my bad and okay so this is looking like tell me this is tell me this is keyboards again and i will delete this video because so far everything's been keyboards okay let me get let me get everything out and then we'll address wow wow they packed these boxes hot damn pulsar dropping stuff cables okay holy so looking like a bunch of different stuff mice keyboards different accessories what do we even have low profile ansi keycaps okay so this is the cm just i guess keycap set not gonna go over that right now the floor is an absolute disaster uh coil cable mouse mouse super glide glass feet okay so i assume for the mouse other end of the cable switches so let me check out just one of these keyboards and one of the mice i can get a general idea i had no idea pulsar made keyboards did you oh this is like a okay oh okay i did know about this completely forgot about it um complete transparent sort of i don't know what kind of shell it is probably not polycarbonate but okay so this is like a custom keyboard kit where you could start to make your own very cool again i know these custom keyboards are starting to become more mainstream which some people might roll their eyes at this is only a good thing that more and more companies are getting into this hobby giving us more options more affordably priced stuff and hardware oh that's a that is a nice switch the black hole switch tactile but super smooth hot damn pulsar okay unexpectedly loving a nice black hole switch and then we've got some i assume gaming mice i heard really good things about their hyper or their super glide glass feet i think boards he has that video of him just like messing around um and he like spun the mouse and it literally went like a hundred times just from these glass feet okay so are these gonna be what are we working with this is looking like a wired mouse not a hundred percent oh the pulsar elite okay i heard about this very unique looking i wish it wasn't wired because again as much as wired mice are still 100 fine uh just the the trend of everything is going towards wireless possibly this is a wireless mouse so i'm pretty sure they have a wireless version of the pulsar elite right that's what this is yes okay nice and light i'm gonna swap these feet out with the the glass feet i just put on the floor very cool i'll test this out looking nice heard good things and yet again um all things that will be considered when i'm doing those top five videos for all the peripherals and okay so this box this this has been getting my attention because it says snacks all right i don't know what the hell this is quick little back story uh a few weeks ago i someone sent me a lunch box insulated lunchbox filled with all of the red bull flavors and offerings for this season and i don't have a contact at red bull i don't know who from red bull or red bull gaming watches my channel or if it was even from anybody at red bull but whoever sent me that thank you please reach out because i drink red bull all the time um if you want a sponsor and we get like a red bull little fridge going on so i can always be red bulled up let's do it uh anyways snack box i don't know it says frito lay this is either a a box full of snacks which i didn't ask for but here we are uh or it's like what would be cool is those like foreign snacks you know the good kitkats stuff you can only get overseas let's see what we got in our snack box i see cables usually you don't want to eat cables not a snack okay not what i this is a box from somebody from ebay they just reuse this box for shipping making a lot more sense now this is something what happened back here why did the monitor shut off don't know why what don't know why one monitor shut off and the wallpaper stopped but this is a custom skeleton modded original xbox now funny thing about this is if you watch the last time i did one of these unboxing videos i believe it was probably july june or july i unboxed the ghost original xbox that was modded that i got from ebay that turned out to be a scam to do the light about it so i sent that ish back because uh it was not what it was supposed to be so i got the really sick looking skeleton version which is only available in japan uh but a us modder got a hold of it and we have an hdmi conversion kit on the back got a two terabyte hard drive filled with games this to me is just like 100 love like i'm super psyched about this um yeah maybe i'll do a video on it i know the 20th anniversary is this year like next month of the original xbox so if you guys want to see a video on a nice modded xbox like this that is souped up juiced up this might even have like an upgraded ram kit i don't know let me know let me know i hate when the floor gets so crazy again that's just the nature of these videos but it's gonna take me an hour to film this an hour to edit it in three hours cleaning up and reorganizing the studio okay uh this box is from glorious i could see it right here um but like right before we left i got the model d minus and model o wireless minus wireless whatever uh so that video by the time you see this should already be out not sure keycaps was gonna say i don't know if this is more mice oh yeah okay okay this is a interesting thing right now we're going to take a moment to discuss because you all know with the gmk pro they put out some pretty cool looking keycaps i like the gradients on some of them um from what i can see from these gpbt keycaps i remember they actually talked to me about this a little bit ago these are upcoming keycaps that you can get for the gmmk pro they're going to be i guess better than the original ones because they are i think double the price and what you can see is same that sort of gradient sort of look to it however uh different colors here and the colors this topic always very touchy when you talk about clones and keycaps being inspired by other keycap sets and designs and colorways the celestial ice i like it my style but does look similar and inspired by dream eater then the celestial fire is definitely inspired by alex odos you guys know alex sodos is a prominent member of the keyboard community he has his own key cap set i can't remember 100 right now i want to say it's aether but he has a key cap set that he put out that looks very very similar to this and that's just kind of iffy you know again i don't really like that 100 because this colorway again inspired not a clone necessarily but definitely inspired by his keycap set and i know he has a like a round two coming out very very soon so it is a bummer to see a company like glorious who's worked with alex very very closely it's a bummer to see them put out a keycap set that is inspired by his keycap set don't love that don't love that um again if you want to support your creator support your content creators all that stuff people in the keyboard community check out his uh set coming up i'll put a link down below again i'm apologize right now if i'm butchering the name i i believe it's aether i believe it's either but yes he is definitely the reason those exist so you'd like to see glorious not really do that you know because they're a massive company and it's just obvious they're inspired by dream eater and alex's set okay don't know this feels empty super light little box man it's gonna be a long video we're rocking about 25 minutes in ish depending on what i cut that's another thing if there's weird jumps and cuts it's because something i've showed off um hasn't been released yet or it's still under nda so if at any point anything remaining here is under nba or not out yet i will have to cut that another cable no idea what is um [Applause] this is looking like keycaps to a keyboard that i got a few weeks ago oh holy they wrote me a whole thing okay this is evan from iquinix ikeanix i don't know how to say it let me know down below okay so this is i guess more keycaps and a cable and a converter for their keyboard that they sent me a few weeks ago i guess if i ever check that out this will be more this will make more sense okay winding down winding down still got a big old box here which honestly i have no idea what the hell this is um i no idea some heavier stuff fedex tear here okay so it's funny how in the beginning i literally was like this is not going to be one of those videos where we get a lot of keyboard stuff um in my defense so this is these aren't things that i ordered except for the novel keys box and these aren't like custom keyboard stuff which these videos usually are uh but it's funny how so far almost everything has been keyboard related and you either hate that or you don't care okay so steal oh bunch of stickers here steelseries arctis 7p plus wireless so steel series droplet reverse a a revised a new version of the 7p 7p plus okay again if you're seeing this that means the embargo is lifted and you know about this as well if this gets cut well then i'm talking to myself and it's still under nda and i can't show it off i'm not going to blur it cause i was just talking about it so i'm talking to myself moving right along down to the final five-ish i am sweating people you guys know like these studio lights get hot and i've got them blaring on me all righty the razer siren v2x a brand new version of the siren microphone like i said before talking about top five videos to end the year this will most certainly be a contender because their siren mini their 40 siren mini from last year sound phenomenal and um this is the newer version an upgraded version you can see it's taller as well and this the v the kraken v3 hyper sense so again by the time you see this odds are you'll know about this because i know they have a press conference or like a stream coming up sooner they're going to reveal some of this stuff and i'm psyched about the v3 hyper sense because this has the actual hypersense technology in the ear cups that pulses and vibrates to go along with um your music your gameplay i always love haptic feedback in headsets so that's a newer version of this with the cracking lineup pumped to check this out i'm not my pants right now there's bubble wrap on the floor you can take my word for it okay let me just get this guy out of the way because i will forget about him final four what do we have i saw turtle beach on the sticker turtle beach what are they sending me oh the rock cat torch rock cat torch again another consideration for uh top gaming and streaming microphones of the year boxes smashed all hell but that's okay um yeah i forgot about rockhapp making a microphone looks pretty cool has the controls and everything um seemingly you can use this detached from the base and still have use of that that's kind of cool little live thing oh a little slider even all right nice uh this came out i don't know during the summer i want to say um i didn't really check into it too much because you know um rock hat but this ought to check it out if it sounds good if it's worthy of being in the top five of the year you will know about it next month when we do our top five videos not next month in a few weeks probably mid november right before the black friday craze what's do we got oh man more stuff from epos or epos i don't know i wanna go with epos epos uh brand new headsets i'm not gonna explain what these are gonna be for because i did it five times so far top five possibly the new h6 pro and the reason i was interested in this is because there is not enough open back gaming headsets on the market and their h6 pro comes in open back and closed back uh three different colors like a dark hunter green kind of white and this black finish which on the box looks bluish so hopefully it's black i don't know doesn't really matter but very psyched to check these out because this is seemingly not in a collaboration with sennheiser which they've done over the past few years you know it's always been like a sennheiser an epos epos whatever headset is it epos or epos i don't know i have to do more research before i talk this guy okay this is super heavy um i shouldn't even open this right now because it's just gonna be adding more and more fuel to the fire that is my floor of boxes um somewhere down there there's glass mouse feet hopefully they're not being destroyed so this is just a tv stand but it's like a rolling floor tv stand and i did i got this so i could use a tv as like a different component and set or part of filming so what i've done in the past it's been a while now but back we lived in the apartment i had a tv next to my desk and it would look cool when i would have products at the end of the desk and tv in the background so that way whatever was on the tv would look like a cool backdrop uh so i got this so i could have a tv on a rolling cart pretty much and i can line it up towards the back of the desk and have it in the background when i'm doing b-roll just add a different you know dynamic to some of the shots okay yeah this is going to be a pain in the ass i was kind of hoping it was going to come together but i should have known that wouldn't have made much sense i probably just destroyed everyone's ears oh my god not farting [Music] not farting nope all right and last but not least we have this box which i am uncertain of its contents because nothing that i was in recent talks about with companies to get sent or that i ordered would be the size of this this is actually what i was thinking the tv stand was um but as we just saw oops it is not that because i just opened that so this is a monitor oh a gigabyte monitor okay how am i gonna get this out i'm not gonna get it out right now but this is a new gaming monitor possibly it's coming out very soon uh 34 inch ultra wide let's see 144 hertz nice uh hdr 400 flicker free low blue light got built-in speakers a nice 1 500 r curvature let's take a breather for a second man when you talk we're just like you know a half hour straight seemingly to myself i know i'm talking to obviously you guys but uh that's tiring so this okay now okay so i did have talks gigabytes about this i forgot about it but it was also in relation to um an upcoming build i've been working on so i've been waiting i was now that i think about it we didn't get the graphics card so they sent out that without the graphics card which mean hopefully that's coming soon i've been waiting to finish off my leon lee 011 dynamic mini case new build it's got a hole and we're going to be replacing that guy i've talked about it if you've watched a few videos um i've been waiting for a while to finish off this build you guys know how it is with uh hardware shortages and all that stuff so it's been taken a minute um i'm was hoping they would have sent that out maybe it's in this box no there's not enough room in that box so okay maybe that'll come soon hopefully let me put this let me put this desk back up i feel naked having this much of my frame just exposed to you guys which doesn't make any sense there you go that's just better for the framing right okay so we're looking at like 30 minutes plus of me opening a bunch of stuff a lot of keyboard and peripheral stuff uh but that's what this channel is right i'm i opened this channel knowing it was gonna be a peripheral review channel and everything else is kind of just bonus over the years um and seemingly today opened a lot of great stuff definitely pumped to check out that skeleton yeah the skeleton xbox the ghost xbox was the see-through crystal one this is the smoked yeah come check that out really want to see what this pulsar stuff is about that looked really cool uh 100 thieves we'll see what that's about uh the glorious stuff again kind of a bummer there with them ripping off alex not too happy about that check out his stuff okay no snacks that's the main takeaway from this one in that snack box was not snacks well that'll do guys hope you enjoyed um it's probably episode 10 now of the mystery random unboxings hope you all enjoyed if you did give it a thumbs up show your support and i'll drop some of the links to any relevant links of stuff you want to check out i'll have the stuff down below yeah feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp
