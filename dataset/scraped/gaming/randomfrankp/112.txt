corsair if you were my girlfriend i'd probably break up with you what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be reviewing a brand new keyboard from corsair the k65 rgb mini their first 60 gaming keyboard not 65 as their name would slightly imply so today in this video we're gonna go over it all talk about their 8 000 hertz polling rate do a full breakdown of my use with it features pros and cons all that good stuff in case you're interested in picking up the brand new k65 rgb mini keyboard this does retail for 110 msrp which when you look at the rest of the gaming market that price is right on par with the other 60s out there taking a look at it typical 60 layout here the entire body of the keyboard is plastic so it's not going to hold its own in a cage match versus some aluminum 60s out there won't even stand a chance of prism rules but the board doesn't feel cheap or flimsy or anything like that also included inside the box we have a usb c cable since that's finely detachable documentation a keycap puller plus an additional escape key and spacebar now while the usbc cable is braided it's still your typical cable at 10 of the day but now at least since it's finally removable we in the keyboard community like our custom coiled aviator cable so now we can swap that out get the extra level of customization if you so please and yes i will opt to use my own on the bottom you have four rubber pads in each corner i'm unfortunately no flip out feet which made this next shot increasingly more difficult to balance now i'm about to show you something you won't unsee so i apologize in advance but when i first plugged in the usb cable it sucked out like a sore thumb the port is just off center on the back side it's 290 millimeters long exactly and the port is seated at 155 millimeters in not 145 millimeters which would be halfway so 10 millimeters off and in reality that's not too much but now that i see it it bothers the hell out of me companies usually have to pour either on the left side or in the middle sometimes on the right side but not just 10 millimeters off the center keycaps here are a nice lightly textured double shot pbt set this is great for avoiding any fingerprints and smudges and stuff like that we still do have that regular corsair font which is still kind of a bummer although they do include this cool looking radiant space bar with all these triangles and that too is textured to the touch like you can feel the actual design but i'm 99 sure the spacebar and the corsair logo keycap is abs not pbt and i do hit on this in every 60 keyboard video but you still do have all the keys you would usually have if you're used to a full size layout you know people always complain that they're missing keys now but just using the function key you still have all the additional functions you just have them printed on the front of the keycaps now so arrow keys playback and volume control rgb control macro recording it's all still here and yes onboard rgb control is thankfully included again function and c changes up the effect you can cycle between nine different on-board animations plus eight static colors that are saved on board by default then function x controls the brightness v controls the direction of the effect and b controls the speed so it's good we have that option without needing to resort to software when it comes to customizing the look of the board but we'll talk iq later on in this review this is just the stock effects on board like i said you can have up to 50 profiles saved and with their axon chip inside you compile 20 layers onto a single effect now one thing corsair is doing here with the rgb is using a white plate inside so the rgb reflects out from the crystal shell off the inside of the keycap and then down nicely onto the plate to appear brighter and this is pretty common obviously but corsair has always been one to use brushed aluminum for their cases so rgb never really shined as nicely as it does now so that plate's definitely helping out now for our switches oddly in this unit we have cherry red switches and they offer silent red and cherry speed silver options as well but i just find it very odd of course they are still using cherry switches in this like you look at the gaming market out there most brands are using their own switch hyper x logitech razer fanatic even evga are all using their own brained switch or some iteration of gadaron or kale switch so why not use the corsair opex switch the razer huntsman mini uses their own optomechanicals so why not use your very own optical switch in here instead of offering me a cherry red like it's 2010 just a hundred percent baffles me if you want to complement ak hurts pulling rate why use a cherry red switch come on that'd be like if tesla released a brand new version of their model s but instead they gave us the engine of a nissan altima like you have the technology we've seen it why not use it now in your latest release just i don't get it um now like i said i do have reds in here but they also have cherry speed silvers and i feel like if you want to complement that 8k hurts pulling rate at least with speed silvers it would seem and feel slightly faster and more noticeable so why not at least just offer speed silvers in here you just should use opex switches i just i just really don't get it dimitri from hardware canucks they did send him a unit with cherry speed silvers so we're gonna toss it to him and see what he says what is up frank and good people my thoughts on the 8 000 hertz pulling on the keyboard is that it's not necessary with a mouse it makes sense with the viper 8k for example your mouse movement is constant there's like so many more inputs that are required for mouse navigation for that precision with a keyboard like how often are you pressing on the keys for that 8 000 hertz polling to matter on top of that the switches in here are not optical they're all mechanical therefore you experience the balance delay and therefore it kind of eliminates the need to have that such high precision for pulling and also these mx speed switches feel quite scratchy i used to love speed switches on the early days of the k70 but here they feel very loud scratchy and not smooth at all my other linear switches feel so much smoother and even my mx browns which are tactile so there's that point feels so much smoother in terms of that travel up and down so yeah a bit of a disappointment here with this one all right frank back to you yeah dmitry put it perfectly 8k in a keyboard does not really make a lot of sense especially with just standard cherry mechanical switches really don't get it so as we always do we'll do a sound test with these crappy reds all right so a few things i want to point out from that sound test okay listen up uh we do have lube stabilizers here and at first that was definitely noticeable versus the years of them not lubing their stabilizers and they felt surprisingly nice you can see there was a fair bit of residue still on each stem and the bar inside and they feel just miles better than they used to but they decided not to touch the space bar for whatever reason don't know if that was an oversight in just this unit or if they decided not to lose the space bar in general but needed to point that out because the space bar did not sound or feel as good and secondly the shotgun mic that i'm using for this video and my sound test it's a very high end expensive shotgun mic so it does tend to pick up those higher end frequencies and sounds and pinging noises that are more noticeable in the sound test but not really during normal use to the human ear so i wanted to mention that but the big thing with this is it didn't like really sound too pingy to me but it felt and sounded more hollow that's the best word to describe this keyboard is hollow and give me a second i have an idea [Music] yep just as i thought so with the case being entirely plastic and literally nothing inside when you're typing there's just a lot of micro vibrations being sent throughout the keyboard instead this mounted with those 11 screws on the plastic posts all those vibrations when you're typing and gaming they spread out and resonate inside because you know where's it going to go so little eva foam goes a long way and i've been asking companies for a while now to do this some like dirt god do include a dampening foam inside and they're way better for it but this just makes a big difference and literally only cost companies like what pennies to implement in their boards just listen real quick so feeling wise definitely feels a lot less hollow now and it really helped out the space bar i think now let's talk about gaming with this and like i mentioned before it really just felt like a normal keyboard like having cherry reds did not make a difference or even a placebo effect of a difference when it came to gaming and it being faster with their ak pulling rate but what it did make a difference on is your actual cpu usage so during my testing and gaming with this it took on average a seven percent increase to my cpu for testing i played battlefield for an hour at the 8k hertz and my 10900 ks was averaging right around 60 usage without the 8k hertz at the standard 1000 hertz it was down to around 53. is that like a pc breaking difference no but in this case where it's not doing anything it's not noticeable whatsoever having an extra 7 taxing rate on your cpu really just is not worth it at all and in their iq software it is set to 1000 hertz by default so you do have to go in and change it to ak and it will alert you like hey pc might take a hit because of this but while we're here real quick let's just talk iq because it did seem to get a facelift i don't know if this is new if it's been like this for a few months i haven't used iq in a bit so it's nice to see a more modern looking refresh here but yes you can still reassign all your keys view whatever sort of key you want you have your macro recording and the rgb stuff now it has like a sort of a picture for each of the effects but you could still go in like i said before compile all those layers different profiles make your own effects because that's the one area where the axon chip does help out is saving all the different layers and stuff to create some crazy looking effects if you want but i'm always one who prefers to leave it out of static color when i'm using it so at the end of the day corsair's still giving you a usable keyboard that doesn't really have anything wrong with it you know while i would still you know prefer opex switches obviously to complement the ak polling rate what they're giving you is a standard 60 keyboard in the end and i feel like now over the past 12 to 16 months with the 60 form factor exploding and tons of companies catching up and putting out their own very good 60 keyboards corsair is just not doing enough here this is a classic example of too little too late 100 pun intended and i swear if they make a k65 mini rgb xt or a pro that does have opt-back switches and they charge more no you got the razer hudson mini they have their own optomechanical switches don't let them pull a switcheroo after you've already bought it and make you try to pay twice for it no no again it's a good keyboard at face value it's not doing anything wrong but it's just not doing anything extra that would make this worth it over the other ones out there guys so that'll wrap it up hope you enjoyed my review of the corsair k65 rgb mini keyboard if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below if you've liked this video give it a thumbs up
