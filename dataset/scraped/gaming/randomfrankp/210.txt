what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be talking about why after all these years despite all the keyboards I reviewed despite all the custom ones that I built and owned how come my main keyboard is still the corsair k95 platinum RGB keyboard there are numerous better options out there yes so why do I still use this keyboard as my main since it released what over three years ago in January of 2017 figured I tell you why I'm using it for now so I've reviewed this keyboard you can check out my dedicated review from 3 plus years ago as well as the 20/20 refresh of the k95 platinum xt but this one is the exact model that I got and it's still been my main keyboard the past three plus years so again this is not gonna be a review you can check those videos out so we'll break this video down into two segments really why I like it continue to use it and also what I don't like about it and why I eventually will be upgrading and changing so the first thing is really just the feature set dedicated multimedia Keys is becoming more common now thankfully but back in 2017 this was a really big feature and course there's always been really great about that so I think dedicated multimedia Keys plus a volume wheel is something that I definitely utilize with listening to music gaming all that stuff another big reason I love this keyboard is because of the six macro keys on the left side noted as the G keys now while many other keyboards out there can be reprogrammed so that any key is a macro this one included as well having dedicated macro keys is great for things like toggling Nvidia shadowplay toggling things to bring up certain apps would I need them just having those buttons right there that could do something that I need the press of a button is great without having to go into software and reprogram other keys I might need to use the third reason which is probably the most important to me is the USB pass-through on the back side this is utilized probably daily by me whether it is for gaming or just you know getting my usual workflow done with editing this USB pass-through is fantastic if I'm playing a game that requires controller which I often do with scanner excel session I can just plug it in right there without having to run a cable over to my PC for other things like you know wireless dongles plug it right in there even something else to add to the desktop like a stream deck or the loop deck these are two things that I still use very very frequently again pretty much daily for video editing that I could just plug in right into the keyboard and not have to worry about running any other cables throughout the desktop it's all contained right here the fourth reason cherry speed switches which this keyboard has and they do take a while to get used to especially when it comes to typing I made a lot of typos in the beginning but again for gaming since this keyboard is at my main desk setup where I do both gaming and video editing after using the speed switches for three plus years it's definitely a noticeable difference when I'm using something else I know it kind of sounds like BS but it's it's true with the name speed switch obviously they're faster they have an actuation point of one point two millimeters which does make these e fastest chary switch on the market and that is 40% faster than other cherry switches when you think about it for gaming what it comes down to is the fact that you're using a switch that is 40% faster odds are than the competitor you're playing against online so I'm not gonna say gives you a competitive advantage or anything like that because when you think about it there's other factors at play ping latency input lag for your peripherals and monitor refresh rate just internet speeds all that stuff is gonna you know be more I think important than a switch when you're playing as someone else online but after getting used to it and using it I can definitely tell a difference when I'm gaming and I love a smooth linear switch these are that they're fast and trust me I've tried numerous different switches I still gravitate more towards the Linear's it's just really hard to adjust to anything else full-time then the fifth thing which really isn't a big deal but it's a nice added bonus and that is just the crazy amount of RGB and customization that this keyboard allows for including this light strip up top and this obviously have those double shot PBT key caps on here to really you know accentuate the lighting and make shine more these aren't stock I picked these up you're probably familiar with them I'll put them down below if you're not familiar with these key caps but the RGB is nice even though I usually keep it either this teal color or a white color but it's not all peaches and rainbows and butterflies there are things about this keyboard that I do not like I think first up is gonna be the brushed aluminum finish which definitely looks nice it has the looks factor to it but when it comes to cleaning shield your eyes this is gross if this is just after not cleaning it since the beginning of March so what two months and you can see just all the buildup of dog hair if you have appe I'm sure you're very familiar with having pet hair in your keyboards just naturally in the air all the dust everything that's just in the air when it settles on this keyboard builds up in between those fine lines of the brushed aluminum finish so it looks really great but you're gonna have to keep this thing clean constantly unless you're okay with just a grody nasty looking keyboard again I'd clean this thing I try to do it monthly I haven't done it since I said March and you can just see how nasty it looks so that's the first thing I'm not a really a big fan of and while we're here I guess we could also throw and build quality again brush aluminum top all plastic casing and body underneath that's not a huge deal cuz a lot of these mass-produced keyboards and these gaming companies are gonna be plastic but again from all the custom ones that have been solid aluminum some sort of metal that can weigh anywhere from three to like six pounds for a small little keyboard you can tell the the quality difference here when you introduce plastic the second thing is over the years I definitely more gravitated towards the tkl layout over the full-size like we have here it is just too big and bulky and I'm never using the numpad that's just me and on many people do use it I don't another thing I definitely hate is gonna be these stabilizers and the actual space bar stuff like this on mass-produced keyboards they never sound good than ever you know properly done most people who are buying this for gaming aren't gonna give two shits about it honestly but there's just nothing like lubing clipping and band-aid modding your stabilizers to make them sound real nice then the last thing is more of a picky one on my end but just from being in the keyboard community over the past year so and that is the super thick permanent cable on this and again I understand that since it has the USB pass-through you do need a two separate USB is a plug to your PC I would just love it was a removable USB C cable that you know worked with one USB so I could use any of the multiples of my custom brain and coiled cables that would be great but again I know that's kind of stupid to say but hey the end of the day I wish that would be different so for those of you who are into custom keyboards and you're in the community really you know there's a lot of great stuff out there but it definitely gets expensive and I do think that trade-off is worth it because in the end you are getting quality and a custom keyboard the materials the the time put into it all the customization that you could do to build it is worth it in the end have a more personal keyboard there's a lot of keyboards out there right now that I've pre-ordered signed up for interest checks for that I'm gonna be getting in probably over the next six months or so or plus who knows what the whole pandemic and stuff going on but I will be switching eventually full time to a different keyboard so I know after everything I said after all the questions that I got it's why I made this video to let you know why I still use this but I hid it at the beginning I'm using this for now I will be swapping it out and I'm gonna have to make a few sacrifices a lot of the features aren't going to be available on those custom keyboards but I think just to make up for that I'm gonna have to use other peripherals and other hardware to still get that fix you know what I'm saying but yeah like I said tons of questions figured I'd make this video hope you guys liked it if you
