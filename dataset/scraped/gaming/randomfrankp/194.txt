what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today I have a very exciting keyboard built for you and I have a feeling that a lot of people are gonna be pumped for this we're gonna be checking out the novel Keys NK 65 entry an entry level mechanical keyboard to get you into customs so the NK 65 entry is one of the more interesting and dare I say groundbreaking keyboards on the market right now because it gives everyone a chance to kind of get started in the custom keyword community for just ninety five dollars except on launch day it's sold out in 40 seconds so keep your fingers crossed for a restock as you can see it comes with its own carrying case for storing or bringing your keyboard with you on the go which you rarely ever see included with a keyboard and inside that top sleeve of a via card which is information on their software and it coiled the USBC cable we'll talk about that stuff more in a second but first I really dig the atomic purple polycarbonate case the black aluminum plate and the PCB also looks nice and stealthy and flipping it over there are no fluid about feet but the case is designed with this eight degree angle you have two large rubber pads so doesn't slide around on your desk but man visually I am loving this I even went out of my way to pick up the 1998 original Thome gang cart figure from when I was a kid in the atomic purple Game Boy Color all good vibes but real quick that's a touch on it with that included coil cable as you can see it's probably a bit different than the quill cables you're used to seeing on this channel and in the keyboard community it definitely has this landline look to it and it's a glossy dark brown I want to say I don't know if this is my eyes playing tricks on me but it's not black so needless to say I'll be using one of my own cables for this build okay so as they pre-built hot-swap keyboard that's meant to get your foot in the door the only thing you have to really pick up on your own are switches and key caps no building no soldering but I will take it apart to show you real quick what's inside and how its constructed and it's pretty straightforward there's just five screws holding the top of the case to the bottom of the PCB and plate are screwed into the top case as well and this design allows for no visible screws once it's assembled you kind of just push through the PCB to separate the two and I will say one of the screws holding my PCB to the plate was stripped when I first went to unscrew it so I did have to strip it even more unfortunately to take it out thankfully I already have some leftover screws from previous builds so wasn't a big issue for me but I'll chalk that one up to like a factory flaw if you will but then again it does come pre-built for you and once the PCB was out of the case the plate is still screwed into that top housing if you need to remove that but underneath the PCB and laying on the bottom housing there's something that I think every keyboard could take advantage of hands down and that's this silicon dampener this insert is really meant to absorb those micro vibrations and your switches and justly case overall when you're typing or gaming and it'll definitely help lessen the audible resonance and stuff so it'll be a quieter board obviously depending on your switches of course by the way comment down below who is your favorite pokemon the included stabilizers are factory lubed thumbs up and their plate mounted so if you did ever want to pop them out and mod them even further it'll be easy to do so our PCB has these switches south-facing and sharing all cheery profile key cap and switch compatibility and with the PCB supporting three and five pin switches you aren't limited in terms of your selection either cherry gather on kale at MU plate mount PCB mount Mount Everest you get the idea now as for our switches we're gonna use since we have you know an affordable keyboard here at the N K 65 I wanted to keep prices low all around if I could so I went with gather on yellow you can find these anywhere from like 10 to 20 bucks sometimes a little bit more with shipping but they are very affordable they are linear and pretty similar to red so just a 5 gram difference in terms of the weight and with a little extra TLC you can really take these to the next level because for being so inexpensive they are very smooth I did add milky tops to my switches as well as applying a switch film and lubed all my switches with krytox 205 grade zero so again for being some of the cheaper ones out there now they're honestly kind of up there with inks I'd say after these modifications like I said they are kind of hard to find right now but the paint on how many you need you can get them anywhere from like 20 to 30 bucks and another reason why I went with yellows well first off I just prefer linear switches but second I am like I'm a freak I want my keyboard to be matching my switches even though you won't see them so with the yellow stems in our gather on yellows it's gonna perfectly complement the atomic purple case because yellow is a complement of purple I'm sick guys send help then since the PCB is hot swap usually just pop them right into place okay so next up is where the entire keyboard process comes together it could take a turn for better or for worse and ask keycaps okay so with the NK 65 entry being so affordable this is gonna give you the option to still stick to a budget build or splurge on your key caps and the thing with key caps is some of them if you do some research you might find it so I said that you really love but it's either an interest check group by phase there are years away from ever coming to your doorstep so the struggle is real but I know that the Razr PBT key caps the newer ones 30 mm 30 bucks which are not a bad option if you wanted to go like all-black for this novel Keys even sent over their novel Keys vaporwave key cap set which is nice it's only $50 as well so still affordable in the end but I'm not the biggest fan of the colorway here with this purple I think it's too much purple and like the different hues of it so what I did was I pretty much just reused I said that I already had that in the end I think looks really good and that's gmk Tokyo Nights but I really like the primary black key caps with some of the accented colors and just a little splash of purple I do think it's a perfect fit but when it came down to it one thing was missing like I said before shot the Gengar I knew this keyboard needed an artisan to tie it all together and that's where this key from s craft Studios come into play this handmade Gengar key cap I think it looks perfect they make some killer stuff over there they have a few different Pokemon available as well but they also sell in group buy so there aren't really available right now unfortunately you'll have to scour the after markets but for being handmade it looks perfect you can see I'm chilling in there he's got like the purple smoke around them it just fits this keyboard perfectly and yes in terms of height it is a bit taller than the stock cherry profile we have on the keyboard but a lot of artisans are either Oh II am where the sa profile but I honestly don't mind it at all because I want it to stick out as an accent piece that's the point of artisans and also since the top is that clear resin you really can't even tell when you're looking at it straight on okay so the moment you've all been waiting for will do the sound test now with these gather on yellow switches again I apply to switch film and Lube them a krytox 205 grade zero but we're gonna see the true beauty in the work of that silicone dampener inside get ready that's some butter so as you heard I do think these lube and switch films gather on yellow sound very good and again helped out by that silicon dampener inside and the stabilizers also sound pretty good as well and that's without any further modifications now yes like I said I did lube my gather on yellows and I did apply that switch film and honestly it's from my testing and comparing back and forth I don't think these switch film is worth it in this case that's just my two cents but really impress here I love that silicon dampener here and I can just tell it did a lot cutting out that resonance and also depending on your key cap set and what switches you use it'll sound a lot different but this is me and my use case in my building so wrap this up let's just talk pros and cons real quick about the NK 65 entry I mean pros goes without saying but for a prebuilt $95 keyboard that all you need to do is apply switches and key caps to it is a fantastic price and you know value overall you Tomic purple I think looks killer I love polycarbonate cases and this just is my the via software that you can use to change up all the lighting and stuff is very easy to use it also has like a switch tester and stuff built in you can't really see the RGB on this build you know you're looking at overtop or top down you know it does slightly shine through on the side of the cases because again it's polycarbonate so do keep that in mind I know for me it's the absolute last thing I care about what the custom builds is RGB and I'm sure 95% of the keyboard community out there could say the same RGB is just not a necessity when it comes to this yes you can still see it shining through on the bottom of the case but since we have the south facing switches and the LED light is on the bottom and our key caps don't have any shine through characters or anything it's just a solid ppt key cap there is no RGB illuminating really so you're not gonna see it but again I don't mind it at all with the software I just kept it purple other than the sock RGB light wave you saw before I downloaded a program to it but yeah that could be a con to some people definitely not me another thing I'll say is they do have it as a quality control statement out there with these polycarbonate boards saying that there may be some zin a slight defect somewhere I know for me it's invisible to the eye at all there's a slight chip on the top and bottom with the inside but again that's you can't see it so I don't care but honestly guys for $95 for a pre-built entry-level mechanical keyboard you cannot get a better value out there right now I challenge you go find a custom keyboard like this that is a better value so in the end it's gonna come down to pretty much what else you do to complete the build so if you buy cheap key caps and cheap switches although I wouldn't you know recommend that the cheapest airily it's gonna still save you a lot of money I know for me with the case itself gmk Tokyo Nights was 175 which Gadahn yellows were 20 I believe and the Gengar key cap was I think around 60 bucks when they released it I already had the quill cable so that's around 40 to 50 if you don't so the absolute north end of this keyboard altogether is around $400 but again you don't need to spend near 200 on a key cap set there's more affordable options out there you don't have to get an artisan and switches you can find pretty affordable pending on which type but man Naville keys big thumbs up NK 65 entry one of my favorite builds that I've done so far and I love the looks of it my voice is starting to go and hopefully this gets restocked soon because like I said this sold out in 40 seconds that's some demand now let happen up guys hope you enjoyed this Bill's if you did give this video a big thumbs up to
