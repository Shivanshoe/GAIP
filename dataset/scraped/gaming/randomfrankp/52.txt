what's up guys i'm random frank p and today i got a pretty cool one because ikea and asus rog just released their own lineup of gaming hardware and furniture do you know about this it means now you can go to ikea and fully pick up all the stuff you're gonna need to complete your gaming setup so i wanted to share an overview of all these new products today they sent it all out for me so more so an overview of these new releases and man it's definitely exciting to see ikea team up with the gaming company like asus in the republic of gamers product line you know as rog to create these gaming you know hardware and furniture and accessories without breaking the bank obviously this just launched at all ikea stores globally including here in the us you can check out your local ikea store or on the website to learn more about when the range is arriving to your location so you can go and pick it up but first up let's check out their matchspell gaming chair ikea sells other office chairs and stuff but now obviously with this gaming lineup we have a brand new release and visually it's black and red to fit in with the rog aesthetic so i did see they also sell this in white as well which looks really clean and still gonna also fit in with that whole gamer aesthetic vibe on here you've obviously got the full height adjustment there's a lever underneath so depending on your height or the height of your desk you can adjust accordingly you have about five inches of height here so you can set it to armrests they can also be adjusted in height to reduce strain on your arms or shoulders when you're playing plus you can move the armrest forward and backward as well then up top for the headrests that can be tilted up and down just for that extra added neck support but most importantly the chair is comfortable there's ample cushioning underneath the headrests and the back are mesh so it'll kind of form to your back naturally when you lay back and mesh is also obviously breathable as well so you won't get that heat sort of trapped up over long gaming sessions in terms of construction the frame is made of a carbon fiber steel frame so it's going to be nice and solid but light at the same time and the frame also naturally contributes to being a lumbar support which is something i always look for in a chair and the chair is on those caster wheels so you can move around you know roll in and out and grab a drink if you need it so the matchable gaming chair again either in this black with red accent or a white color option definitely a nice addition to their lineup and one of the more important parts of a setup but speaking of which probably the most important aspect of building your desk setup is obviously the desk and here we have the utzbare gaming desk i apologize if i'm butchering these names but i'll tell you right now this is one of the more impressive desks all in all that i've owned and yeah it sounds cheesy but you can tell this was designed with gaming in mind with how it's made first the desktop is nearly 64 inches wide and 31.5 inches in depth so you're going to have plenty of room here and this is notable because most deaths out there you know you take a look at one of the more common ones they're usually around like 48 inches wide sometimes like 24 to 26 inches in depth yeah there's some 60 inch wide desks out there too but with this you get that extra space both in width and in depth and with the size it's also going to lead into your overall vision for how you want to design your desktop because the way this gaming desk is made you can actually position the tabletop in two different ways so you'll see when i'm sitting here the front is contoured but when building it you can turn it around so the contour is inward for routing cables and speaking of which another killer feature here is the metal mesh back side of the desk so in this space you can use like cable ties or straps to route cables underneath but also in between the desk and the metal mesh is an additional mesh fabric that hooks up and again down here you can store power bricks other cables usb docks all things integrated here to prevent just that cable spaghetti lying down on the floor the fact that we have both the mesh components built in is awesome will definitely improve your cable management and just how clean your desk is going to look another feature to the ut spare is the height adjustment so when building it the legs can be manually adjusted in six different heights from 27 inches to 30 inches tall so again depending on your height and what's most comfortable to you and your setup you can actually adjust the desk itself with that in mind knowing that at any time you still have three inches of vertical flexibility now with it being such a large space you know it's a deep desk you have room for your arms when you're gaming to fidget around to get comfortable get up and close in the heat of the moment when you're gaming or just kick back and ease the eyes a bit i'm just really digging what they did here with the gaming desk tons of different configurations that you can set it to to match your overall setup the best whether it's the height adjustment the different you know different contours you can have either inside or outside built-in cable management all nice matte black it's very impressive big and wide enough for tons of you know comfortability while you're gaming enough space on the desk and you know if you want to have your pc on the actual desktop itself you can still plenty of room but they actually have a solution for that which we'll talk about in a minute now next to the desk mounted on the wall is their oops spell glass door cabinet and this is cool to have for things on display or to store things here so you have a bunch of collectibles or figures maybe even like your physical game collection i've got some lenses in here you can keep it all protected from getting dusty the glass panel slides side to side the glass shelves inside can also be removed if you have a larger item but i like how it's designed similar to their scotus pegboards you pretty much have the metal version of this built in in the back so if you want to do things like mount cables pitchers anything like you would on a pegboard already you can still do it here on the back something you can also do is add leds if you want they sell their own rgb leds there's even a cutout lip on the bottom for routing the cable if you need to just to add more visual flair to the cabinet definitely think this is a really nice piece moving right along is their oop spell drawer unit on casters and this guy is a tank let me tell you so obviously right by your side of your desk you're going to need some sort of drawer unit right with this you can load it up with tons of gear whether you're storing stuff up top there's a hook included as well so you can hold like cables or a headset here the top drawers for smaller things i don't know maybe throw in like you know stacks inside more cables dongles desk things you know then the bottom drawer is larger for storing yet more and more stuff that you don't want actually around the room or on your desk then what's cool is on the back side there's additional compartments so depending on really what you're storing in here you can have like a power brick out the back if you want say like a laptop you can store books here whatever you can think of then if you don't want to actually next to your desk if you want to free up some space you can always just you know store it under the desk slide it under there since it is on those casters next stuff since we're gonna be bouncing around a bit we have the chair the desk the shelf the drawer so what about your pc and as you've seen you can easily keep the pc on your desk like i said but if you're trying to have the most desk space possible they make a cpu stand with casters this is so you can keep the pc on your floor but not to worry about it getting you know clogged up with dust the stand is a powder coated metal so it's nice and durable it's adjustable in width as well to fit the size of your tower so it's able to be 9.5 inches wide or expands over 13 inches wide and again with those casters you can position it wherever you want say if you have like an htpc moving around the living room all that stuff while we have the bulk of the setup construction out of the way now we can move back to some of the things you may have spotted on the desktop that ikea and rg also made this is all to complete your desk setup underneath my mouse and keyboard is their luna sparelab mouse pad it's a nice extended size feels nice and smooth to the touch and i'm digging that subtle geometric design it has to it in the corner is an interesting one and that's this ring lamp and phone holder this two-in-one can be great for streamers or just making mobile content so you have the ring light on this flexible gooseneck so you can position it or angle it however you want and that ring light itself is going to give off that nice flattering reflection in your eye and also soften shadows on your face and with the phone mount here also on a goose tank you can mount your phone vertically or horizontally and now you can stream video right from here or shoot video with your phone and the ring light the light itself is usb powered so you can just plug it right into your pc and it's an led light so it's not going to get hot or anything and the color temperature the light can also be adjusted from a cool to a warmer light as well as dim so it's not as bright some other products we now have are this mouse bungee so if you're not using a wireless mouse you still you know have a wired one with here you can use it to route your cable through this is to prevent any you know snag or resistance to your mouse that would you know interrupt your gameplay but it's nicely made you have the metal spring here nice and flexible and underneath doesn't slide around or damage your desktop there's a metal base so it won't move around obviously and these little rubber pads so again it's not scratching or moving then something i think is a cool accent piece is this wooden articulating hand this can be used for like holding your headphones maybe to free up some desktop space maybe even use it as like a phone holder or a tablet holder but definitely a cool little piece for sure if you get a head shot in game give it a high five so all in all i'm just really impressed because again a company like ikea teaming up with a gaming company like asus and the republic of gamers product line it's great to see this collaboration giving gamers more accessible hardware furniture and just accessories to complete your setup without breaking the bank so all great stuff now you have no excuse not to have a really cool gaming setup with still some money in your pocket so you want to check any of it out i have it
