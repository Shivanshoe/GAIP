[Music] oh man what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out the razer 2020 all-star bundle this is their holiday bundle and it's actually ridiculous but before we jump into it this video is sponsored by nzxt next week for the nzxt build black friday sale you can save ten percent off any order of a custom or prepro gaming pc including other hardware like monitors mice and keyboards their nzxt build program is one of the simplest ways out there to choose a gaming pc without having to build it yourself you just choose the games you want to play set your budget and then from there their build configurator will pretty much put a curated pc together for you i was even eyeing up some of their builds because they do have 30 80s and 30 90s in stock plus all the builds are back with a two-year all-in-one warranty on the parts labor and ram overclocking i'll put the sale link down below thanks again to nzxt for sponsoring so i've done unboxings of holiday bundles in the past i know steel series has them corsair had them razer's had them for a while now last year when i did the unboxing it was pretty underwhelming so they definitely seem to have redeemed themselves this year because with the all-star bundle it says it contains the razer black shark v2x headset which is top of the line for the price the ornata v2 gaming keyboard mecha membrane switches but you get the extra extra large razer gigantis v2 and then the razer viper mouse so while you can look at this as a budget offering the total package here is just nuts on chin you got the black shark v2x which is 50 the ornata v2 keyboard is a hundred the gigantic mouse pad is 30 and the viper is 80 bucks and the total package here costs 150 if you were to buy everything separately it would have come to 260 so you're saving a hundred dollars for this bundle um i bought it from costco like i said as far as i know that's the exclusive deal for this year which is kind of a bummer to people who don't have a costco buy them or you don't have a membership already but it is still a ridiculous bundle i don't know how they could even afford to do this but um wow all right so we're gonna go through and check it out there's like 40 stickers on here to keep it closed okay let's see how they have this all mashed into this box all right so we'll just go through and really do a particular order but we'll get the mouse pad out so we can lay it down and then unbox the other products um but i just i really can't believe again we've seen holiday bundles in the past but to be saving this much money with something is pretty crazy let alone getting one of their newer gigantis v2 extended mouse pads this thing is very very large comes in at 940 by 410 millimeters so uh definitely on the extended side like they say extra extra large and it's a really smooth you know um soft surface so for gaming it's gonna be great on your mouse definitely going to complement the feats on some particular mice that are out there if you have like hyper glides like g-skate equivalents so let's check out now the razer viper and when i first saw this like i just found out now it's the viper i was under the impression it was gonna be the viper mini which is only usually um well i think either 40 or 50 bucks but this the actual viper and man oh it even says in the bottom all-star bundle that's pretty interesting instead of just saying you know the viper so i guess they have this specifically made for here okay but yeah i love the viper i did a review on it on my channel last year when it came out um i wish they would have upgraded to the you know zero additive ptfe feet on the bottom but it's still really smooth on the gigantic v2 mouse pad surface while we're at it we'll just go ahead and then get the ornata v2 unboxed so this is not a true mechanical keyboard it is their mecha membrane which is again the budget sort of cheaper alternative because it's utilizing their their own sort of hybrid switch where it's like a mix of rubber dome and mechanical probably making a lot of noise with all this stuff let's get the included wrist rest out okay pretty good this out of the way put this down there and yes so i haven't checked out the the ornata series in a while but you can tell right now wrist rest magnetic really nice extends the full width of the board nice and soft and comfortable like to see that and one thing i'm really happy about which i didn't again know this even existed is the built-in scroll wheel or volume dial here and i assume with razer synapse this can be reprogrammed to be also whatever you want and like i said mecha membranes let me just do real quick a little sound test so it feels on par with like a tactile brown switch but definitely still has that softer uh feel to it so again not fully mechanical it's their hybrid sort of in between a rubber dome and a mechanical switch uh but again it's only what did i say before a hundred dollars but now into i think also the star of the show uh this is a little spoiler i have my top headsets of 2020 coming out this week and you guys know from my review and it's really no secret that from all the other tech reviewers that checked out the new black shark series the v2x which was their budget option out of the two um i think is one of the greatest of the year and you're gonna see that again like i said when i drop my best of 2020 video um man i'm just very surprised that this gets included let's take off this bag off the microphone there they got the cable all packaged up come on okay have the extender uh they do also include which is an actual benefit to this is they're a code for their razer surround sound and from most reviews and stuff you know when i review headsets typically surround sound you want to turn off because it's emulated but again i've said numerous times that razer does it right so they give you a code with this you can download the 7.1 surround sound and enable it with this which sounds really really good and you still get a little carrying case for the black shark v2x but i'm telling you like this is such a quality headset and it's not even like i'm looking through you know what do they say rose tinted glasses uh because i love the original black shark back in like what was it 2012 2013 when that came out i loved that gaming headset and i was really bummed that they discontinued it over the year uh years i should say that was what eight years ago at this point uh so the fact they rebooted it and you know it still has that nod to that old like pilot look to it you know the helicopter headset they call it um i am just loving this this is a crazy bundle let's uh get this all powered on show you some of the chroma and stuff okay so i got it all powered on and you can see right now just the rgb shining through the keycaps it's overall pretty slim low profile for the keys it's not that standard like uh cherry profile so they're a bit slimmer uh overall i'd say and i don't know what surface are using for the actual um like top plate and stuff for the keyboard i can't really tell it's probably some sort of higher grade plastic but the material itself it looks like a powdered i don't know it just reflects really nicely it doesn't show fingerprints or oils or smudges which is really good i definitely like that coating they have with most of their razer products you can see with the rgb you can go in through synapse and download it customize the effects and the colors it's the 16.8 million rgb we've been used to this stuff for like five years now and what's funny is i completely overlooked it because i was just so uh sidetracked by the actual wheel i didn't even see and acknowledge that right next to it you have dedicated multimedia keys for playback control so you know play and pause uh backtrack forward track didn't i don't know how i missed that but we have that integrated here as well and for a closer look at their actual mecha membrane switches it kind of uh visually resembles the old roamer g switches where you have that light tube sort of around it for the structure that's what's gonna hold the stem of the keycap and stuff in place and then in the middle is that rubber dome uh which is what actually gets actuated and sent that signal to your pc you can see that little metallic piece towards the top that's the click bar and then the rgb embedded in the middle of that light tube to shine the lighting up and evenly let's do a sound test real quick so all right so now we get to talk a little bit more about the razer viper mouse uh this launched sometime last year comes in at 69 grams which is still pretty lightweight all things considered especially given the fact that there's no holes in the actual shell of the mouse so it's still gonna feel nice and solid lightweight it uses their 16 000 dpi 5g optical sensor in here and their own optical switches for the left and right clicks it's a nice ambidextrous shape and it's symmetrical because you have side buttons on both the left and right sides so lefties righties this is a good option for you on the bottom you do have a dpi switcher and again it does have the stock sort of teflon feet i wish it would have upgraded to the newer feet they use on the viper ultimate and stuff on the bottom of here and even the viper mini i believe uses those but again it's tough to complain all things considered for the package uh it does feel nice and smooth on their gigantic v2 mouse pad so man nice last thing to talk about then is going to be a little run through of the black shark v2 x 50 is just a crazy value it has their newer razer triforce 50 millimeter drivers um on the actual left ear cup there's a built-in volume knob which is really cool for on-the-fly adjustment then on the back of the ear cup you have then a mic mute button and for the actual microphone it's not removable but this is their hyper clear cardioid mic and just for the sake of time and getting it all set up i'm not going to do a mic test right now you can check that out in my actual review but the mic on this actually sounds better than the more premium i think it was what just the v2 pro or just the v2 version of the more expensive option uh so this budget one has a better sounding mic overall like i said you can check out my review for the actual mic test and i also did say it in that review but by far these are the most comfortable headphones i've ever ever tried headset headphones you know what i'm saying i don't know how they pulled it off it's such an even balance here for the weight there's no pressure points at all nice cushioning up top and the actual ear pads against my head it's super comfy so i think that pretty much covers it all for the razer 2020 holiday bundle here known as the all-star bundle um again a seemingly costco exclusive this year that's where i bought it it's only the place i really found it as well uh so if you want to hop on it if you have a costco membership if your friend does or family member does and you want to give them the money for this and save what did i say 100 and what was it 110 dollars you save still just ridiculous but yeah i've done the unboxings of their holiday bundles in the past so i figured at least 2020 gives us a much better option than we've had before uh with some crazy deals and crazy good peripherals in this box so hope you guys enjoyed if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp and lastly if you haven't already
