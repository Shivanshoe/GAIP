what's up guys some random Frank P back another episode of cool tech under $50 for March the series view off some the best tech you can buy under that price point if you see anything you like I'll

anything from this episode all you gotta do is comment down below what your favorite product is and why and give this video a big thumbs up now first not a part of this episode per se but as a little bonus wouldnt let you guys know it the random Frank P and novel Keys topographic mousepads are back in stock it's only 20 bucks still fits the series technically like I said just a little bonus to get you going but first up we have the boom band which is definitely a pretty interesting device I found on Amazon this is essentially a mini speaker that you can wear as kind of like a watch but it's just the speaker and you know spring is coming up warm weather right around the corner whether it's from you know like biking jogging and camping anything like that and I feel like it's a benefit to having the speaker on you instead of wearing earbuds or something so you could still have that spatial awareness you can see it looks pretty simple just the driver there inside it's also waterproof so if you get to sing wet you'll be fine you can take calls on it it's also got a built-in microphone has a six hour battery life and they say you can get up to three times louder than your smartphone and I'd say that's about right when I had it on I probably kept at around 75 percent volume it did start to get a little distorted at 100% but I mean for what this is and what its intended for it still sound more than fine so if you don't have a smart watch and don't want to be wearing earbuds when you're jogging biking whatever take advantage of the nice weather one of those do some music the boom band I think for what it is it's a pretty cool little gadget and it comes in at 50 dollars next up bear with me a bit we have some RGB floodlights you're probably wondering okay why would I need this what's it even for well these are actually intended for like you know decorating your house like the holidays and stuff shining lights on your house get you all festive but for gamers and streamers or people just trying to light their room in a unique way these have come in pretty handy so the ones that I have actually came in a pack of two you can also get them in differ variety's as well as different wattages but the 2-pack I got were 15 watts of peace they were $34 but they can get cheaper or more expensive depending on how many watts you pick so the whole concept here as I kind of explained you could choose to use these in a unique way for photography videography if you want to get some really cool you know colored lighting going on to make your shot sort of separated from the rest for streaming if you want to add some color to your background make it more interesting this could be a pretty cheap and efficient way to light your room for you know under 50 bucks so the reason I picked these is because there's actually an app that you pair these two so you can control them with your phone instead of one of those remotes so you can pick all the different colors have different effects and stuff a pulse to the music set up timers everything is controlled here inside the app so that's the most interesting thing I've showed off but you know for the reasons I mentioned I think they can come in handy for those people who would need something like that and for 15 watts I definitely get pretty bright if they're meant to light a house around the holidays they could definitely light your room and just around 30 bucks so not bad at all next up is the latest release from Razer and yes if you follow the channel I just reviewed this mouse on Tuesday and we've got the 61 gram Razer Viper mini if you haven't checked out my dedicated review definitely do so so the Razer Viper is by far one of razor's best releases in terms of a lightweight Mouse and this only gets lighter but without getting too deep into it I'll do a rundown on the features we have that 61 grams shell with no holes in it it was a smaller size as well solve the speed flex cable brand new 100% PTFE feet for the real nice and smooth glides it complements the cable and the weight of the mouse perfectly a 3359 sensor that goes up to 85 hundred dpi the new zone of RGB lighting for under glow the DPI button right beneath the scroll wheel and we did loose things like the rubberized side grips and the side buttons on the right side still on the left but for all things considered here for anybody who was wanting that Razer Viper but maybe you didn't want to you know drop the 60 70 bucks that it was at the time you can get this for just $40 which is an amazing deal that I think hands down is gonna shift the market of these lightweight mice big props the Razer the value here is insane so I definitely want to show this off because like I said there's not much like this out there I know last month I showed off the SteelSeries rival three which is also a great budget mouse but I do think at the end of the day this beats it out you can't be different 40 bucks and also I'll put my review down below if you want to check it out more in detail but ya had to show it off today next up is a very very interesting mod that you can do to your gaming mouse this is the photon wire an extremely fin talking point three millimeters diameter this literally feels Wireless it is insane if you thought a paracord was real lightweight and flexible this thing blows it out of the water I've seen people post these on Reddit in the past so I was definitely curious and one to check it out so I picked up a few of these to add to my Razer Viper my cone pure ultra and the mana low can on their site you can get them at different lengths and colors and stuff I just haven't been black and then a clear one but it's pretty obvious right away how different this is the fact that it is so thin and lightweight means it's never gonna be an issue in terms of causing you know resistance or snagging on your desktop because I'm telling you it literally feels Wireless so I've done a video on modding and paracord in your gaming mice I'm not gonna really do a tutorial here that's not only what this is about but I did add one of these to my Razer Viper like I said and hey you can even pick one up for your Razer Viper mini which by the way that did us a huge favor by do longer putting these screws underneath the mouse feet now they're just under that base sticker you take those off and the screws are right there and you can see right here the Jurassic difference of thickness between the photon wire and the stock speed flex cable on the Viper I mean there's so thin that you can barely even see it like on your desktop yes it does kind of bunch up a bit towards the edge because it's just you know it's a longer cable this is the six-foot option I believe but even though it's still on my desktop there's still zero resistance highly recommend if you're into modern gaming my something like that you want to just keep your mouse a little bit definitely recommended now these are from an independent maker kind of like when we show it off these face cables a few months ago this is one person making these so they will be opening their order forms but stock will be very limited again so that's just one person making these so if you want them definitely hop on it while you can and the last but not least is something that I've picked up to use personally and a lot of you have been seeing it on my set up the past few video so I figured also show it off this is the karpio from delta hub it's essentially this very tiny compact wrist rest for your mouse so I know for me I am always at my desk set up whether it's for gaming video editing scripting web browsing whatever I am always at my setup and carpal tunnel is a legit thing it's actually the six most frequent occupational disease in the world and what this wrist rest does is essentially reinforce positive pressure on your wrist so it's not fatigued but what I really like about this over other wrist rests out there is the fact that a it's contoured to the bottom shape of your wrist but also it moves along your desktop so while they're using your mouse it's naturally just gonna move with you and I know you're gonna ask technically if you want you could use it with gaming I wouldn't recommend it's only gonna kind of like slow you down and stuff when it comes to getting those like quick flicks and stuff so I only use it when I'm browsing video editing i legit saw an ad on instagram picked it up for myself like I said a lot of you have spotted at the background of my videos so I figured I'd show it off it is 29 heroes or thirty two US dollars it comes in different sizes and colors as well whether you want to pick this up for you know work at your office or at home I definitely think it's a cool pickup you guys how to wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under $50 for March hope you all enjoy like I said don't forget check the description down below for everything you saw let me
