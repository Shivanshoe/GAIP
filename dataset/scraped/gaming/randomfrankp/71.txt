[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p and razer sent over a keyboard upgrade kit and um i don't know what that means all they told me is everything is under 50 dollars so i imagine these are things you'd be able to upgrade either your keyboard at home maybe a custom keyboard or some of their razer keyboards they did send me a briefing guide you know but i didn't look at that because i want to be as surprised as you so as we go along i'll update you on prices and specifics but let's check this keyboard kit out [Music] and of course it's the other way around all right so i'll clear some of this out and right away we have the eraser black widow v3 mini hyperspeed i reviewed this when it came out if you want to check it out so i assume a lot of this keyboard starter kit as you can see is gonna be for customizing this keyboard and i assume a lot of their other keyboards as well but again with keyboards um they're pretty standard in terms of you know design and the stem and stuff um keycaps also pretty universal this is heavy uh so there's nothing stopping you from i assume using whatever is in here on your keyboard at home it's got some half to it man all right so again everything supposedly under 50 dollars let's hop in and we get a breakdown right here right in front of us words words words phantom keycap upgrade set so i assume some new form of keycaps pvt keycap set plus coiled cable so razors hopping into the coiled cable market uh starting to become saturated but again coil cables they were bound to catch on and start to become mainstream and then ergonomic wrist rest okay i'm sure there's more detail here and i got time to read and look at that layout that's a fancy that's a fancy layout huh okay so it's looking like we got the phantom keycaps and then the pbt keycaps plus the coil cable so interestingly now we'll open everything and check it all out for you guys but interestingly it looks like this is bundled so you can't just buy the cable but it's also paired with their pvt keycap set and what's surprising about that is um they said everything individually is under 50 each so i'm assuming that also bundles this in so you can get a pvt keycap set plus a coil cable for under 50. and if you look at like a lot of the custom coil cables out there um from like glorious for example i believe they are 50 msrp so just the cables 50 here you get keycap sets different colors i'm interested in these phantom keycaps and then we got some wrist rests here we got an ergonomic we have uh oh okay so this is full size 10 keyless and i assume they're supposed to be maybe a smaller one for like the the huntsman mini 60 or even the uh v3 mini hyper speed oh wait wait wait wait wait i just fell look at that it just fell down it's in its own crevice there we go it's in its own crevice but we got it we got it out look at that okay let me first just open up the the black widow v3 mini hyper speed just so we can see how it looks you know just plugged in loose as a reference keyboard um again if you want to check it out more in detail i did review it when this released in may it's a very oh so i just saw actually this says phantom edition and okay so just real quick for you guys the v3 mini hyper speed is a am i in frame so it's weird i always say this when i do these videos when i have a really wide shot like this i don't want to be too out of the frame so i'm used to like standing in a split but now i have it up higher over there so i could stand a little bit normally without cutting my head off anyways a 65 wireless mechanical keyboard and hot damn these phantom keycaps again i'll give you a closer look of b-roll and stuff as this video goes on there's still no stabilizer upgrade though huh these are something so i'm definitely interested to check out in closer detail what the phantom keycap set is and you know what i run the show we're gonna start off with that because uh i cannot wait any longer now my interest is peaked so judging from like the picture and stuff i think this is sort of similar to like a pudding keycap set but given the name phantom in black and they also have it in white it looks a bit different so you know the pudding pbt keycap stats are just the pudding sets in general tons of companies have them out there it's the top then the bot and like the sides are in the keycap are like clear or they'll kind of translucent so you can see through and the rgb shines real nice and bright around it you know but with the keycap or with the phantom set oh okay yes so with this phantom set the top doesn't have really legends printed on it so it's kind of like a really matte stealth look but it's sort of shine through there and instead of it being clear on the sides it's like a smoked like gray or like familiar with like ink keycaps how it's like a real smoked housing that's what this is so super stealthy but also gonna allow some rgb shine through as we can see uh like the legends and the characters will shine through nicely but with no lighting on all matte and stealth these are nice not groundbreaking by any means you know it's not going to shatter someone's world but at least it's a nice change up from a regular you know standard pudding keycap set out there and uh definitely gonna give it like i said a more matte stealthy look so that's really cool i actually have a really damn near perfect build comment i can use these with i might get made fun of in the keyboard community for using these razer keycap sets i like a really high end build but i do not care it would look damn nice so like i said black we also have it in white here and we'll see if these are more of like a traditional pudding keycap set as well because that's you know kind of what a lot of them look like with the transparent see-through sides um oh these no so these are also a bit different than i thought but super interesting gg razor okay so actually first glance looks very similar to like those uh jelly palm keycaps and the side again not completely see-through you can see again where the legends are gonna shine through and stuff and the characters uh so but again with the rgb lights off we have your leds off it's gonna look really clean but with on they shine through we're definitely gonna hook this up again i know i said it five times i'll show you a b-roll as this goes on when i film it in the future now i'm interested in the pricing of this so i am gonna pull up real quick uh the reviewer guide that they sent i didn't want to look at it because like i said i wanted to be surprised here but is this really all under 50 or am i like making that up is that in my head that i read that wrong reviewer's guide let's pull this up and okay so the phantom key cap sets in both black and white 35 oh okay so this is actually this is very useful i didn't even mention it but obviously you saw that it does come right here on the blackwidow v3 so they also include keycaps if you're just using like you know the 60 with their huntsman mini your keycaps are going to fit on that this is a full universal kit and also you see we have the uh the keys here like the smaller shift and stuff and the uh the one you know that like the one two five you have on other keyboards down here for the uh the bottom row so you have these extra key caps to fit either the 65 percent the tkl full size or the 60 didn't even think of that but now that i see it's a full universal kit that's very very good 128 keys in total so we'll run through here real quick 35 bucks for the phantom keycap set these pbt plus the coil is 50 total very good deal uh the razer ppt keycaps if you want to buy them by themselves are 30 i believe they're already out there on the market because i remember seeing them with the huntsman mini review and okay here we go pricing for the wrist rest the mini version 20 bucks leatherette with memory foam 20 bucks for the tkl and 20 bucks for the full sized and they apparently have a wrist rest pro which has a cooling gel infused memory foam for a little bit more money but i don't believe we have that unless like this one it caved in somewhere okay wrist rests aren't too fun though that's not the fun stuff so i want to check out the quality of these coil cables because again we're familiar with their pbt keycap set i remember they released them when the huntsman mini came out so we're not going to take a too close of a look at them because by now you know who really cares i am definitely interested in the coiled cable oh it's on the bottom kind of concerning would like this to be a bit more you know secured during shipping okay so they're giving us coil cables it's not the best quality uh so just kind of show you real quick you guys can see obviously there's no aviator cable or anything like that uh the connection here is usbc the coil itself may be like what six inches or so but it's a very small coil and the cable itself really not too long you know it's like smaller than my wingspan of course if i want to stretch it out then you're going to be ruining the the tightness of the coil here let me get an actual coil cable i have and show you the difference in thickness here of the cable real quick okay so you'll see a pretty immediate difference this is the glorious 50 cable so i'm just showing you the the thickness in the coil here around the same size so again probably around six inches but uh it's about double the thickness here and uh also shout out to space cables this is where i usually get mine from they're really nicely done custom colors uh yeah so the thickness from razer not really on par with what i was expecting or uh hoping i guess you could say but i guess it's better than nothing you know it's a way to kind of spice up the look of your keyboard you know the keyboard upgrade and again i guess it kind of makes sense now why it's included with the keycap set and why it's not sold on its own because i feel like if it was sold on its own it probably wouldn't blow people away and uh do too well on the market so let's bust out real quick just to get it all you know cover the bases we'll take a look at the green black pink and white cables okay so we have the black we have the white and you know if you just need a reference point for example if you look at the kind of cables that are already included with their keyboards it's that same sort of braiding to it uh so the black the white the baby pink which is going to match their uh what quartz so i guess white would be the mercury right that is that say that you know quartz mercury matching the rest of their colors and then the razer green definitely a small little caterpillar braid here unfortunately well there you go there's their coil cables plus the keycap set for 50 bucks so far uh stealing the show are these phantom keycaps set and by the way so like i said before when i kind of first acknowledged this the phantom edition of the v3 mini hyper speed i assume now is its own version you can probably buy this with the phantom keycaps on it so yeah you can buy it with or without get the more standard one and a quick peek at the wrist rests again not the most exciting thing all righty so yes what you'd expect from a uh an appropriately sized you know coordinating wrist rest set so the sixty percent or for the sixty five percent uh not magnetic you know it doesn't really feel like it it's gonna be a little bit smaller than uh what would be you know perfect for a 65 percent didn't only make 65 wrist rests um and honestly it's a matter of what an inch on the side so this will be just fine why didn't i turn this on i'm so stupid all right so this will give you an idea of the rgb the phantom set you saw it in b-roll okay i'll leave it here inside got distracted tkl wrist rest again even though it's like a leatherette memory foam still pretty comfy overall there's not too much padding um it's it's a good amount you know it'll it'll be just fine and then this uh this thicker one here which does have the angled lip as you can see to butt up against the angular design of the full-sized uh black widow keyboard so it'll be like that this obviously comically too big you get what i'm saying okay very very interesting stuff so i think like i said before the biggest thing for me is the phantom keycap set can i remember how to switch the lighting effects on the fly is it function in that no there's a way to control the lighting on the fly so i can switch up the effects and show you the full rainbow show right now but i can't remember but yes this phantom keycap set for 35 dollars is what's stealing the show i really like how just matte it is and stealthy without rgb lighting and you turned it on and it's still kind of stealthy at the same time it shines through on the sides but not as bright and vivid uh looks really cool this would be a fantastic addition to something like like a black polycarbonate keyboard out there you got like an nk65 entry any sort of black you know whether it is acrylic or polycarbonate these keycaps would go perfectly with that for 35 bucks and like i said you saw the uh the coil cables and the quality of that not too bad so yeah phantom black or white both a nice change up of the traditional you know uh putting keycaps out there that are very very popular so razer with their own sort of spin on it i don't think razer ever sold their own pudding keycap sets i know like i'm pretty sure steelseries did i know hyperx did uh glorious does a lot of keyboards sort of putting out their own putting keycaps so i really like razer's more stealthy phantom edition of it good stuff there so uh yeah that'll do it for the keyboard upgrade kit and obviously everything you've seen here can be used on any keyboard not exclusive to just razer stuff the keycaps the coil cables the wrist rest you can use it with whatever you have whatever you have currently or whatever you're planning to buy keyboard upgrade kit pretty pretty cool pretty good pricing as well so that'll wrap it up for the big unboxing a little bit of a you know christmas in july but it's it's august now i'm random frank p hope you enjoyed have a good day
