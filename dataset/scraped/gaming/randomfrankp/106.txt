what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be going over my super clean custom gmmk pro keyboard build as you probably saw last week when it released i did my full review of both the black and white version but mainly in that review i just showed off the black gem mmk pro but most of the comments were about my white version so i figured for this video we'll go through it all talk about the build the switches the plate the keycaps all that which completes my super clean gmmk pro so if you haven't already seen the actual review i highly recommend doing so some of this footage you will have seen in that video if you did check it out but there's a lot more to fully unpack here so with the gmmk pro coming as a bare bones kit which means it's you know pretty much fully assembled out of the box you just need to buy your own switches and keycaps that's what really lets you start to customize and fully complete the look of your build so stock out of the box this did come with an aluminum plate inside but i wanted to swap that out and go with their alternative polycarbonate plate they also sell for 19.99 as of right now most of their accessories aren't available to the public yet those are sort of reserved for the people who did already reserve their units but yes for this white version i did want to go acrylic for the plate for a few reasons and we'll get into that so disassembly while pretty tedious is rather straightforward on the bottom of the keyboard there are eight screws to undo the top and bottom of the chassis you then have two center screws and posts in the middle of the sandwich which is the pcb and the aluminum plate which you're gonna be swapping out and then keeping that all together even more are 12 additional screws so once it's all removed we just easily swap plates with the polycarbonate one now inside the keyboard there's a layer of dampening foam underneath the pcb but there's an additional layer of foam between the plate and the pcb as well i'm going to opt not to use that for the acrylic plate mainly because it's going to help the rgb diffusion shine even brighter but also even though it's a gasket mount it's pretty stiff as it is so i do want to give it more give if you will another thing i did was since there are like i showed you those 12 screws keeping the pcb in place together instead of putting back all 12 i left every other screw out and i did not include those two center screws that's just going to give a softer typing experience so once that's all fully built back up our next step is switches and this is where it gets interesting so a few months ago i think at this point on drop i saw these super nice looking completely see-through polycarbonate switches called everglide aqua king switches they were linear switch and they come in three different weights with 55 62 and 67 grams i picked up a pack of 90 in the 62 gram variant but these everglide aqua kings are super super interesting so like i said they're linear and it's pretty much your standard travel distance four millimeters total they actuate at two millimeters inside you have a gold alloy leaf and a stainless steel spring which is also gold plated so with it being completely polycarbonate and see-through having those gold accents with the metallics on the inside shine through looks killer and i'll admit the looks is the reason why i actually bought them in the first place but i'm super glad i did because these instantly became my number one favorite switch so these do come factory lubes and typically you'd want to you know manually lube your own switches that way you know the consistency and how much you're putting on each one a lot of times the problem with factory loop switches is inconsistency but with these they just all across the board super consistent and extremely buttery smooth i'm talking these feel identical to already lubed gather on ink switches that i've tried these just stock out of the box right on par with that and i was just blown away about how satisfyingly smooth and good these feel but then what also impressed me even further was the stability of the switch there was practically no wobble to the stem and this is something you really don't see too often a lot of times you know the stem's going to have a fair bit of play if you will but these it was it was stiff which is you know it is just an insane switch i don't know how they pulled it off i assume it's because of that polycarbonate material so you don't really get much wobble but it's still just super consistent and smooth every time you actuate a key and then obviously with the rgb it just looks crazy you combine that with the polycarbonate plate inside the full rgb to the white pcb and it glows super bright and vivid but gets diffused nice and evenly it is just an insane color show on this keyboard pretty much now shining through those aqua king switches but the keycaps is our next component to the build and that's really what got everybody talking everyone was asking what are those keycaps on that white build i picked these up from kbd fans they're the enjoy pbt kuro shiro it's a really nice and clean looking black on white kit with japanese modifiers and sub legends people are often familiar with gmk striker you can kind of think of it like that those are a nice deep blue this a black and white variant and i just figured with that white or pretty much silver version of the gm mk pro it looks really nice when it's fully built up and complete there's also some additional keys inside the box obviously i didn't include them all because it's a 75 built here but a few of the extra keys are black like the arrow keys enter key escape keys a few others but i think having that as a nice sort of contrast to the all-white build looks really nice in the end and since on the gmk pro we have the rotary knob which can easily be swapped out they have the silver gold and black available the stock silver one looked really nice but i figured again just to complement add some contrast i'd add the black one here then topping it all off we have the custom coiled aviator cable this is another accessory that glorious offers they make in cellies in four different colors again not available right now to the public but they will be very soon for just 50 bucks so i wanted to add that to this as well at first i tried it out with the black coil cable but the white definitely looked much cleaner on the end so i went with that and i covered it in the reviews i'm not going to talk about their software their glorious core but just real quick their rgb effects that they have both on board and in the software i believe there is like 18 or close to 20 tons of different effects a bunch of variation and they're all just so smooth which is what i think is really impressive here because a lot of times you know you can have rgb on a board but it'll either be you know choppy or the effects just won't look really nice in the end but here that's not the case everything super smooth and very vibrant which i've probably said like 10 times by now right but you get the idea and you can see firsthand for yourself and then just like that the super clean custom jim mmk pro build is complete and i usually have the rgb lights inside pretty much just shining you know white so it looks cleaner in the end uh but i just wanted to show off right now and show you guys the full you know rgb and all the effects it's capable of and just how crazy it looks with that acrylic plate and those polycarbonate ever glide switches so speaking of which yes now we'll do a sound test you can hear how this sounds in all its glory with those crazy switches from everglide the aqua kings so what do you think how does that sound it's very hard to put into words you know a feeling of how smooth these aqua king switches actually are in person so hopefully that's kind of portrayed through the sound test but i think it's also definitely helped out by the fact that like i said before i went every other screw instead of all 12 and i left out those center two posts but with the polycarbonate plate it's just it feels crazy and uh yeah like i said i also don't have that center layer of foam between the pcb and the plate so all together i am just absolutely loving this keyboard loving the final result with those keycaps the switches and of course the final product that we have from glorious with their gmmk pro bare bones kit very impressed very happy with it hope you guys dig it and like i said check out my review if you haven't already of the full gmk pro keyboard you'll find out a lot more there and as the accessories start to come available and stuff i'll drop all the links down
