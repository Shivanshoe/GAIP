rgb you either love it or you hate it but there's really no denying that it could really add a lot to a setup and really bring it to life what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be going over a bunch of different cool looking rgb products you can add to your setup to take it to that next level visually pretty much see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out a bunch of different things all different prices all different things for everybody now first up is this govi rgb immersion kit for your tv which is going to give you ambient bias lighting for your tv and what's kind of interesting with this is it has this little camera module which is going to do all the capturing and rgb portrayal for you so once you strap on the entire rgb kit behind your tv i believe it's good to up to like 65 inches it says over my tv is 77 inches it works out just fine you put on the rgb and then you put on the little camera it's all hooked up to a controller on the back of the tv but that camera is what's constantly going to be reading whatever is on your tv then it will scan whatever you're watching playing whatever's on the tv to control the rgb so if you're familiar with the channel i've showed off things the past like the dream screen which does something similar phillips has their amber light kits and stuff but this does it all for you and it's just around 75 dollars which is crazy and it works really really well so you can configure inside the app there's a bunch of different effects you can pick from do like solid colors if you want just crazy rgb you can do that but this dynamic sort of backlighting for your tv this is what i keep it on 24 7 because when you're gaming and stuff or watching movies it just looks so cool and it's really immersive again what's great with this is it doesn't matter like really what you're doing it doesn't like require an hdmi source or anything like that whatever's on the tv will be betrayed behind it so the camera is pretty much just scanning all the corners of your display and then it will correspond to the rgb going on behind us so if you have explosions going on on top and on the bottom i don't know you're running around in battlefield for example you'll get the corresponding colors and it just looks crazy i mean no other way to put it right i've been a gobi fan for a while i use their rgb strips for behind my monitors and they have a bunch of cool rgb products some of which we're still going to show off again today because they just have a lot of really cool things but this one hands down one of my favorites again for just around 75 they constantly have sales so the prices are fluctuating and stuff but definitely worth it again they say it's four round a 65 inch tv mine's 77 and it still works just fine just configure it in the app and you'll be good to go next up so you want the same sort of principle but not for a massive tv you want one for behind your monitors this is the whirlwind fx kit and it pretty much does the same thing but for your gaming pc well it doesn't have to be gaming you get what i'm saying so in my case here as you can see i had them mounted behind a 27-inch monitor and as you're looking at the screen for the gameplay you'll see in all four corners pretty much what's going on is also being reflected behind the monitor onto the wall just really adds an extra level of immersion to your gameplay which is always really really cool to see and it's also going to be easier on your eyes because now there's not as much of a harsh contrast between the dark wall and the bright screen now it kind of extends the screen and blends that difference in most cases with a product like this it's hdmi reliant but in this case it's controlled by the external device you can use this with whatever whether you're console gaming pc gaming watching videos on youtube movies it doesn't matter whatsoever literally just whatever's on your screen will still be reflected behind it and that's because of their signal rgb software there are a bunch of different effects you can download different rgb light modes this is the ambient lighting effect and by the way you will have to download their dedicated drivers in addition to the software to make this work properly so that's also gonna be listed for you guys down below i don't want you to think it's defective if you buy this because you definitely need the drivers but again in their software it's pretty powerful what you can do you can also do things like tie your other rgb products in your setup like your different peripherals and also have them go along with whatever's on your screen or sync it to whatever rgb effect you have on it'll recognize it you can sort of configure all the lighting for that as well there is oddly a paid subscription tier in the signal rgb software if you want different integration with certain games it'll definitely look cool but i'm not really a fan of paying a subscription for rgb lights so i just use the free tier but again if you want those extra added effects for certain games you can choose to pay that but i'm just using it with the ambient lighting mode for free it looks cool it's the most useful i think definitely the most immersive and you're not going to regret it i mean come on tell me it doesn't look cool the strips themselves are pretty long i have this on a 27 inch monitor as i said and even have it kind of bunched up in certain areas so they're probably going to be better fit for like a 32 inch monitor possibly but you can see here in my case the result it still works okay so next up you've probably seen these in the background of other youtubers videos right these rgb light bars they're very very popular big bulky well made tons of different rgb control uh it has it all here it's very very cool for what it is but it's also very very expensive this two pack of the nand light pavlo tube was like 600 so on amazon i found a cheaper alternative that pretty much does the same thing it's nearly identical wireless waterproof rgb uh this was like right around 150. so while these are primarily you know advertised for like photography and videography and stuff there's no telling you what you can and can't do with them right and i know a lot of times when you're watching streamers on twitch or youtube or whatever they have a lot of rgb going on in the backgrounds a lot of times this is a really efficient way of getting that back glow when i'm not using them down here in the studio i bring them upstairs in my minimal work office and i mount them behind my tonal home gym just to give that some extra ambient lighting as well and again it has a built-in battery so it's wireless it comes with a little mounting kit a little gooseneck you just stick them on the wall it works great it looks really cool if i'm feeling like you know i need an extra workout into red light therapy i'll throw them up in a red rgb that's where i primarily use them and i just use them recently for my tv review i had a blue strip on the wall throw some color behind me and the second one behind the entertainment center now speaking of adding some rgb to your room of your setup whether it's just for you or for your audience to see in the background while you're streaming check out this really cool looking sunset lamp as well as this galaxy nebula projector i found these on amazon and again it's just a little extra something to add to the overall ambience of your room whether it is for you or your viewers so the sunset lamp is going to sort of kind of portray a nice warm glow or a sunset on your wall and while the device itself is pretty tiny overall the glass is like magnified so the rgb and leds inside the actual lamp itself get projected and thrown pretty largely onto a wall it's kind of impressive how bright and big this gets for being so small there is an app so while it is like a amberish red and orange kind of glow you can have a bunch of different colors and shine them all on your wall around your setup write your roof whatever you want you can do it with this and it looks really really cool again it's so tiny but it's super super bright so you can have a nice warm glow a nice cool glow whatever you want and then for the galaxy projector i i've said this about like what five times so far whether it's for you or your viewers on twitch you're streaming this just kind of throws up some like blue and green galaxy esque looking thing on your wall or throw it at your setup have it look nice and cool get a whole vibe going on i don't care what you do but make it look cool right that's kind of what this does now there's like thousands of these different sunset lamps available on amazon uh the one i got is 30 bucks there's also like a discount code you can apply a checkout and then for the galaxy skylight projector that was a little bit pricier at 50 bucks but again add that extra glow and just color to your room or your setup next is another cool product from govi and this is the govi glide a cheaper alternative to the lifx beam and it's actually what i've been using during this overhead shot to line the frame of my desk to give some extra glow and stuff to some of the shots so the kit itself comes with six total pieces plus a corner piece if you want to have them on like a right angle this could just be a really cool addition to add to your setup you know on the wall behind it to sort of frame your desk setup they get really nice and bright great color saturation again with gobi and their app there are tons of different effects and scenes you can add you can create your own sort of color effects which is really cool but they have a ton of preset ones already for you you can even configure and use this with google assistant or amazon a-l-e-x-a again you've probably seen this in the past with the lifx beam this a more affordable alternative and so far a lot more reliable my beam lasted for like two weeks before two of the modules died out on me and this has been going for around a month now no problems whatsoever now built into the cable is a little module with a built-in microphone and that's cool because say you want to use these with music you can have it actually pick up the ambient audio going on and pulse or shine different colors to the audio going on in your room so again with music it can pulse to it look really really cool sort of like a real time audio visualizer these come in at a hundred dollars and for this overall just you know rgb decor for your setup for your room really really cool and definitely affordably priced given the competition and then lastly something i showed off previously in a cool tech under 50 that everyone was loving and again it's from govi because they got the best rgb stuff out there these the govi flow so built-in is a module we can control the lights but obviously with the govi app like everything else we've seen so far today you can customize the effects and the colors to just visually get the most out of these flow light bars and again like we saw with the glide they too have the preset scenes you can go in but also make it pulse to go along with the music whether it's playing on your phone or with the built-in microphone on the actual device it can also go along to music in your room now obviously with the majority of us here being gamers in this episode you know being for like set up rgb products you can still add this to your setup but also things like your entertainment center i think it's gonna be you know just fine it'll fit in for both situations but to get them set up included in the box is four stands two of them are for sending the lights up vertically so you can shine them and blast them onto the wall behind your monitor this way the lights shine behind it and it'll blend nicely just to give that ease of contrast we talked about earlier when they're powered on you can see just the extra glow they provide for your setup i think it looks really nice and you can also choose to use these without the stand if you want and just lay them down on your desk then shine them forever you can really do you know whatever you want with the layout but what i'm more of a fan of what i think is definitely the smarter choice here is to use these with the other included stands and mount them to the back side of your monitor because the two extra mounts has a 3m adhesive on the backside so you can just stick it on the back your monitor this again will throw the lights up on the wall blend it all nicely lots of rgb going on and this way you're gonna be freeing up some more desk space if you don't want them physically sitting on your desktop i think the flow bars can really just elevate the look of your setup overall and again give you that added extra rgb option at the end of the day so bringing it all together lots of different rgb products for different situations and different setups whether your desk setup on your monitor entertainment center your tv or just your room in general hopefully all these different ones will be you know helpful to you if you're looking to take the look of your setup to the next level and really elevate it and bring it to life like i said i've all listed for you
