what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out a keyboard that's been highly requested and man it's definitely pretty awesome we're gonna be reviewing the asus rog falcon 65 wireless mechanical keyboard there's a lot of really cool stuff going on here so we'll go through it all the features do a sound test all that good stuff in case you're interested in picking up the falcon now this isn't brand new i think it was announced last summer and started rolling out towards the holidays but it admittedly floated my radar a bit and when it comes to you know gaming keyboards especially a small compact form factor like a 65 that definitely hits a sweet spot for a lot of people out there because it still got your main keys plus the addition of dedicated arrow keys which is something i know i personally can't live without and yes taking a look at it it's very sleek and the fact that it's wireless also is going to hit home for a lot of people because you rarely see a wireless 65 gaming keyboard like this let's talk features taking a look around on the left side is a touch bar and this is crazy awesome you can use it for volume control media playback really whatever you want it's completely programmable there's five input functions so this touch sensitive strip can be anything and above that you'll see this light bar this is a real-time battery level indicator so you can see how much juice you got left so it'll also pulse to let you know when the battery level is getting below a certain percentage um where you can just have it synced to the rgb lighting effects it's all customizable in their software which we'll talk about in a little bit also during the intro unboxing you may have seen me take it out of this case it was packaged with and that's because it comes with a polycarbonate keyboard cover this is to keep it protected when not in use or to shield it from collecting dust it's a really nice idea from asus and also you can use it to set your keyboard and kind of diffuse that side rgb lighting but they thought it had enough to still have a cutout on the left side for access to the touch bar and a cutout on the back side for the power button and usb c port and honestly while most people might just like not even realize it's included it'll just say in the packaging i think it's a really nice addition the top is like this brushed aluminum it looks exactly like the design on their scar laptop so i appreciate that you know consistent design language and the inside is this grippy rubber so it won't scratch the keyboard when you're using it so while it's not like mind blowing or anything it's so just really nice to see that level of innovation with a keyboard tray and a cover as well as a touch bar on the keyboard little things like that go a long way because it's different it's something new keycaps used here are pbt but the quality of these is definitely on the lower end of pbt you can tell that it's not that double shot mold injection because they are a bit on the thinner side but for the texture it is very very slight um it doesn't have that shine or gloss which is good so it's not gonna pick up on any fingerprints and yes the font they use here is definitely that aggressive gamer font like there's no doubt about it this is definitely a gaming keyboard in terms of looks and visuals but also i'm not like i'm not gonna knock asus for that because they've never really tried to go for that clean minimal look like some gaming keyboards do asus is very you know well known for being a gaming company so this aggressive font while you know not my cup of tea it's like i said before consistent with their design language i will say though i'm not the biggest fan of the republic of gamers on the space bar but speaking of which since it is 65 on the front of some keys you still do have those secondary functions printed right there for you you have your f keys up top you can see media controls macro recording rgb light controls all printed on the front of some of the keycaps so you can see what those secondary functions still are then popping off a keycap they are using cherry red switches and if you just saw my corsair or is that the k whatever review it was 65 they also used cherry reds and i knocked them for it mainly because those switches did not feel very smooth they were definitely scratchy for a linear switch but here even though they're still using cherry obviously i would prefer them to use either their own sort of branded switch or maybe some sort of optical switch at least here in this unit they're not scratchy whatsoever they're actually smooth linear switches like reds are supposed to be reds have the 45 grams force to actuate at two millimeters and have a four millimeter total travel distance so pretty much you know your standard linear switch out there these are you know nothing different but like i said they're not scratchy they actually feel pretty smooth all right so now we'll do a sound test of the falcon with the cherry red switches inside okay so as you heard definitely a fair bit of pinging going on in this board um like i said before the reds here do feel a lot smoother than other reds i've tried out there so this particular batch of cherry reds is thankfully pretty good but the reason we're getting that pinging itself is because of the frame so the top plate is all aluminum so when you're naturally you know typing and stuff and it's exposed keyboard like this that's going to ping and resonate a lot more a master the stabilizers here they do slightly lube their costar stabilizers what they did was since they are plate mounted they lube the bar where it snaps into the actual stabilizer themselves so it's not doing too much in terms of sound technically since there is that lube there it's making it a bit i don't know there's less resistance when you press on those keys but yes that aluminum resonance is definitely pretty strong here so now for my time gaming and using this uh really for a wireless keyboard it was more than fine it's not a like bluetooth connection or anything it does come with a usb dongle that you plug into your pc so it's your standard like one millisecond 2.4 gigahertz connection but yeah i had no issues in terms of like you know it lagging or cutting out or any sort of noticeable delay um it felt just like a standard you know wired keyboard does which is always good you know any sort of disconnect should obviously be a deal breaker for most keyboards but here all good stuff again for gamers yes i know it's a more small compact form factor so you are missing out on like the numpad and stuff but for those who really don't use that i know not a lot of games and gamers really utilize a full numpad the fact that we have 68 keys in total here we still have those three dedicated arrow keys on the right side of the board is definitely a great thing i know for me like when it comes to video editing and stuff um that i definitely need dedicated arrow keys for jock in the timeline and certain key frames so having those there is definitely a life saver for me uh but again i've never been a fan of full-size keyboards i'm more of a tkl guy myself so a 65 is the best of both worlds you combine a 60 plus some extra keys here now let's talk battery life because this is pretty damn impressive it boasts a 450 hour 4 000 milliamp hour battery that's definitely on the higher end and pretty impressive when it comes to a battery for a wireless keyboard like this and obviously that 450 hours is rated with no rgb on so depending on your brightness level or what effect you have going it's going to drain it more quickly and with the usb c port on the back you can use this also wired if you want this also supports quick charging so a quick 30 minute charge gets you over 30 hours which is still that's you know more than the entire 24 hour day you're gonna be living and hopefully not gaming that entire time span but yeah quick charge on a keyboard also pretty cool now check out the software so armory crate is what they use that's consistent with their other like pc hardware and stuff so it all synced together uh the first tab for the keys is pretty much going in and reassigning what you want each key to be creating like certain macros and stuff can all be assigned to whatever key you want then you have the touch panel tab which lets you get full control of that side touch panel like i said before you have five different input functions that this can all be and these stock just like show you real quick if you just tap it in the middle it pretty much does nothing so i can go in and set that to be something like you know pausing music or muting music so you have full control of what all those five functions can be for tapping and swiping definitely easy to configure as well then you have the lighting tab on board itself like you can control without the software uh with the arrow keys again in the function key but there are 11 effects in the software itself you can go in and configure and change up like speeds and certain colors depending on what the actual effect is it's all your pretty standard effects and unfortunately if you want to sort of like create your own custom effect and layer and stuff like that you have to download their special or a creator which is separate from this software so that's kind of a bummer and then lastly you have the power tab which is just for controlling like the power consumption in terms of like when you want it to go idle after not being in use save some battery and stuff like that then a firmware tab to update your keyboard so at the end of the day i'll leave you guys with this the rog falcon for what it is is very very impressive i know i referenced it a few times in this video when i just reviewed the corsair k65 mini um i admittedly you know knocked that pretty tough because it didn't do anything special and i said numerous times for that price it needs to do something more and for what this is it is doing something more it's giving you innovation a touch sensitive side panel here very cool to see on a keyboard a light bar let's see alert that alerts you things like battery and stuff very cool to see as well the fact that it also has the keyboard tray that doubles then as a protective cover it's great to see because companies they stay safe they don't really try new features so the fact that we have an included carrying case or a protective case and a touch bar i think is really great now it is 150 so it is you know a bit more pricey than your standard 60 wireless keyboard out there uh but also you get the extra key so 65 keyboard so it's doing a lot of good stuff that for me really impressed me right off the bat from my time unboxing it to using it it's been all good things there are some cons yes like i said before uh there's a fair bit of pinging and stuff that's just naturally due to the material of the keyboard itself uh the gamer font you know not for me not a big con necessarily everyone's going to have their own opinion on keyboard aesthetics but the one thing i will say is it's not a really standard keycap set for the backspace enter and right shift since the keyboard is doing a good job of staying compact and adding those extra keys on the side um it did sort of cut down on the actual size of those keys so if you did want to buy your own keycap set you would probably have to stick with these i guess you know depending on what sort of set you get it may have smaller ones like that uh but those aren't your standard size of what i'm saying but yes at the end of the day i know 150 is a bit more pricey but man i have to applaud asus for putting out a new keyboard like this hitting on all the good stuff the wireless 65 and innovation all of all love for me and guys that'll wrap it up for my review of the asus falcon rog or rog
