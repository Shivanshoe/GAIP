what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with another episode of cool tech under $50 for February the series were you awesome the best tech you can find under that price ladies valentine's Day is coming up maybe some gift ideas for your man's who knows you say anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and I heard you loud and clear by popular demand we'll be bringing back the giveaway so comment down below what you think the coolest tech here is give the video a thumbs up and I'll pick five people next month starting off real quick getting the more boring thing out of the way so we can move on but as always the boring thing is gonna have a twist so everyone's familiar with a wireless charger by now you know obviously when they charging dock like this you set it up against it and it'll charge for you but what about one that can actually come apart and act as a separate wireless battery bank for when you're on the go so for the first use case you know on your desktop on your nightstand drop your phone against it it's gonna charge it wirelessly but the battery bank itself can next to the dock review these pogo pins on the bottom then once you take it off at this own separate charger it's 5,000 milliamp hours and up top is that USB port plus a USB C port so you can use it wired but again the beauty of a wireless Qi charger like this is the fact that you don't need wires it's a wireless battery bank so you know put them together in your pocket have a charge that way set it down somewhere you get the idea again an interesting kind of take on a traditional charger thought it was pretty cool I picked this one up for $20 next is a brand new Mouse from steel series I just reviewed this yesterday on the channel this is a rival three a $30 lightweight gaming mouse it comes in at 77 grams so it's really cool to see if they can accomplish something like this for a very affordable price and it doesn't have holes in the shell so for those looking to pick up a new gaming mouse on a budget this is definitely a good option I'm really impressed with it it's an all matte black body it's got three zones of RGB lighting their true move sensor goes from 100 to 8500 CPI and has onboard storage you could save those levels on the mouse so for a more in-depth look to check out my review but for what it is at this price it is phenomenal for anybody looking to save some money on a gaming mouse it's really remarkable at SteelSeries did here for just $30 can't recommend this enough next up is definitely gonna be a popular item that's a dive on pics ooh I showed off the like real small version of this back when I first started the series in 2016 or 2015 this is a bigger 16 by 16 pixel version so it's pretty much this multi use smart display you could either choose to hang it up like a picture if you want prop it down on your desk top it has a little stain on the back as well but you could display a ton of things on the actual display here you can do things like show obviously the time acting like a clock it could simulate the weather outside it could be a calendar for you once you download the app there are probably over thousands and thousands of different animations and little visual things you can add to this tons of different effects from music visualizers you can make your own effects you can use this to show text countdown check stopwatch check alarm check you can even have it show your notifications from like Instagram Facebook snapchat Twitter text messages all that stuff but the gallery in the app is extremely expansive people are constantly making you know new effects and new visuals every single day and uploading them there's even a little like minigames you could choose to play on here if you want but the fact that there are so many different use cases and integrations with the app that you could choose to display on here is reason why I think it's a really cool pick up I feel like these LED desk gadgets also do really really well in the series this will probably be a fan favorite so the typhoon picsou comes in at 50 dollars some days I'll check it'll be 55 52 I picked up 450 next up is a brand new gadget from Sony for your ps4 controller and that's this back button attachment for using you know back buttons on your games as well as PC this is something really cool and I'm happy if they actually put something official out like this because for only $30 this taps into the market of you know scuff controllers third-party add-on attachments and those kind of things so little module itself is pretty compact it snaps right on to the actual bottom of your controller locks into place there and you have two tactile buttons acting like those two back paddles now and you can configure them to me whatever you want the OLED screen there is also a third button and that's how you pretty much configure everything tapping on it you can go through the four different profiles that are saved onto here and then you can just remap whatever you want those two back buttons to be it's very very simple very easy to use for FPS game I like using one for reloading my weapon and the other for like sliding or jumping depending on what the game is so I don't take my thumbs off the thumb sticks and for racing games you can use this for a life shifting or your handbrake it's a great way to now remap them so they're just right there for you very easy to press they're nice and tactile buttons too and for those who use a headset you don't lose out functionality at all because there's actually a built-in headphone jack on the bottom of the device so definitely happy they thought of that this might be giving us a little sneak peek at what the PS 5 controller might be like you know having like a screen and these side buttons integrated naturally but all together it is still very small and compact as you can see doesn't take up much space in the bulk here just on the bottom and now you have the ease of use of remapping buttons to this and having the OLED screen there so you can see or profiler on and what buttons you're on as well so it comes in at 30 dollars it might be out of stock right now because it's brand new and it's a very hot commodity but keep it in mind and then lastly for number 5 I like to kind of show off different things for this last one and this one's definitely pretty unique this is a mini handheld espresso maker it's called the mini press ogr so for you coffee lovers out there I got you back now this isn't made to like replace your espresso maker or your coffee pot and stuff like that but a travel or a espresso maker on the go if you're camping this will be clutch if you're going on you know trips this will be clutch everything you need actually comes in the capsule itself from the actual scooper to a integrated Cup which just comes off on the top the instructions might be pretty intimidating at first but once you do it a few times you get the hang of it it is very very simple the piston just pops out so you hand pump it a few times to get the water going and then it'll go through obviously it make it inside for you all you have to do is just pour in hot water and you're good to go pump this thing and now you got some espresso so I understand this is not gonna be for everybody you know I get that but I thought it was really cool I'm definitely gonna use it as well and I'm sure some people out there could appreciate it he's come with different models for like different prices and stuff bigger sizes different colors and all that but again I feel like camping this would be really cool for if you're going in a long car ride you'd want to bring coffee with you put water in this when you get to work when you get to class pump your coffee and you're good to go this model comes in that just around 50 I believe it was 45 when I got it but again different models color sizes that stuff a mini espresso maker right in your hand and guys I'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under $50 for February hope you want enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up show your support and don't forget
