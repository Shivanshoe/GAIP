what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be reviewing the new hyperx alloy elite 2 rgb keyboard recently came out and hyperx has been doing some really good stuff lately so if you're in the market for a brand new gaming keyboard you might want to pick one up got you covered today this is the newest addition to their popular keyboard lineup and has some pretty cool stuff going on including their very own new hyperx pudding keycaps for maximum rgb the new line of hyperx switches these are their red linears in this unit and honestly look at the last year hyperx has done some great stuff in the market so i was pumped to check this out so first impressions when i got it unboxed and plugged in holy hell this thing is super bright with those shine through pudding keycaps now mind you i shoot at 200 iso and the lights were still peaking my zebras here so anyone looking for the brightest of the bright when it comes to keyboards this hands down is top of the line helping that out obviously is going to be those pudding keycaps and they've been pretty popular for the last few years if you're not really familiar with them they have the the four sides that are all translucent so it allows more rgb to shine through but hyperx has truly been the one company to adopt them and improve them over the years they're still abs but they're a surprisingly thick cap and for the font up top it's nice and bold kind of has that gamer-ish look to it not too much though but honestly to me it looks more than fine now in terms of the goods for some other physical features on the top left-hand side of the keyboard you have three buttons one is for brightness which has five levels of brightness three profile switchers and a g gamer key which can let you do things like disable windows and stuff in the software then on the top right hand side you have dedicated multimedia keys and an aluminum volume wheel these are always clutch the media keys again are shine through so at least you know being unison with the rest of your keyboard in terms of lighting effects and interestingly if you pop off the caps on the top left hand side those three buttons are rubber dome switches it's not a big deal they didn't have to be mechanical but figured i'd point that out but yeah physically the construction here this keyboard does look identical to the eye to their 2018 release of the original alloy lee rgb some other quick notes that rgb light strip that runs along the top side of the board does add some extra visual flair to it especially at nighttime will become more apparent since it's a pretty thin strip then on the back side we do have a usb passthrough you need to have both of the usbs plugged in to take advantage of this but obviously great for plugging in flash drives peripherals wireless dongles all that stuff now the pass through is unfortunately still limited to usb 2.0 so just keep that in mind in terms of transfer speeds so when i first unboxed it and saw it i did think it was plastic until i picked it up because it's a completely stainless steel frame construction here so it's definitely pretty solid i think it comes in a little over three pounds uh so it's no you know key cult number two obviously but still a pretty solid board with no rattle or anything no flex definitely sturdy some other things to note about the frame the switches are plate mounted so you will see the bottom of the red switches you can't see them if you're like looking at it from an overhead angle but on the sides and stuff you know you will see those red accents peeking out not a big deal but it could trigger people's ocd if you just don't like the color red and also for it being a matte stainless steel frame that's a really good job of not picking up fingerprints or oils from your hands usually you would see them like caked in this but they did a really good job here at the coating okay so now let's talk about those hyperx red switches these are from like i said before their newest you know switch rollout over the last year or so with the red linears the aqua tactiles and the blue clickies and i even said in my hyperx ally origins core review with their tactile aqua switches that they were by far the smoothest tactiles i've tried they were even smoother than some reds that i've tried and these obviously being linears in this unit they follow suit super super smooth they have a total 3.8 millimeter travel distance and actuate at 1.8 millimeters so 0.2 millimeters shorter than most switches out there and they're definitely light as well at 45 grams but yes really big fan of these very satisfied with their switches so hyperx if you're listening it wouldn't be a bad idea to possibly think about selling these switches on their own people can buy them and put them in their own custom boards i think you'd be surprised at how good they would sell in the market because they're very very good but yeah now we'll do a sound test of the hyperx reds so what you guys think are they as smooth as you thought and as for the stabilizers as you heard not too shabby they don't rattle too much or sound like there is a loose rock in your engine like corsair boards it's just really hard to complain here with what they're giving us now while gaming for me since i'm used to linear switches no issues with the transition whatsoever and i always say for viewers who don't know i'm used to speed switches when gaming at my main setup but these red linears man i just i love them i'm being serious now the board doesn't come with a wrist dress as you can tell but it does have a slimmer profile overall to the board so i wasn't too bothered by that but what's strange is their original alloy elite did come with one so what's up with that and i'll also say i really wish i could cram all these features and this look into a tkl layout because you know for a gaming keyboard how often are you using a numpad yes maybe for work and stuff but for a gaming keyboard do you need a numpad i am all for the transition in the tkl who's with me then as we roll into the rest of the bullet points let's begin to close this one out you can also see i have the rgb here kept static inside their ingenuity software which i do have some gripes with the rgb effects are all right there to pick from and the selection overall is pretty limited but what i do like is the fact that it shows you the animation and colors real time to the software for you i can definitely appreciate that and yeah with these keycaps rgb just looks insane and very bright saturated vivid all the words but in here you can also do things like create macros and reassign the keys with different functions the usual stuff you know but the one thing i don't like with this software is that it's a windows store exclusive or whatever microsoft store exclusive and in order for you to actually save whatever effect that you're currently creating or using just hitting apply won't actually do it you have to hit apply save it to the keyboard and then assign it to one of the three presets if you don't do that and you close out the software it's just gonna go back to the stock rainbow effect so make sure you save it assign it to a profile and then go to that profile to have that effect it's annoying they could make it easier a little bit more straightforward so in the end following up from their 2018 release the new alloy elite 2 is a pretty damn good keyboard overall mainly being you know accentuated by the new pudding keycaps and their new own hyper x switches those two things together i think will make this not only a worthy upgrade of that but it'll make it a pretty good option right now on the market it does come in at 130 and for that price you know it's just like i i would just love to see like every gaming keyboard be like 100 or less so 130 for this is kind of tough to say because it didn't even include the wrist rest like it used to so it's a little bit higher than i would like and in terms of some other cons there really isn't too much about the board i don't like that i could complain about it's still with their ingenuity software polish that up a bit make it easier to export you know programs or the effects and stuff like that but all together it's not a bad option whatsoever good features good switches in the end that's what you want from a keyboard right so if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below and as far as i know like i said with the linears in here they're also going to have the aqua tactiles and the blue clickies available for this unit so you get to pick between the three and you're gonna love the switches i guarantee it thought to wrap it up guys hope you enjoyed this
