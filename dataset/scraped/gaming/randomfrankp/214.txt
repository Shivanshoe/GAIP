what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 212 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup say anything you like I'll have it I'll list it for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now episode 212 all right first up we have stations and tendo's for PlayStation and Nintendo's as you can see by the theme here tons of retro throwback classics I am loving the overall theme and just a style to this room he really give you that nostalgic feel touch with all those cartridges and stuff definitely adds to the room the setup overall so for his primary death setup here he has two displays be primary white one is he's a lead to be in a series that is a 25-inch and the vertical one on the left side is a 24 inch Acer predator display at 144 Hertz forest peripherals he's got kind of two keyboards on display here as you could see the red one underneath his primary monitor it's a ducky year the pig keyboard with the master off alt as his main and for his mouse it's the pwnage ultra custom and Ice Wireless lightweight Mouse in white speaking of white that seems to be the color theme going on a little White's not really a color but you get what I'm saying because the PC has some really nice white accents and I just love the way it all came together so inside here this is the NZXT eh 500 case you got a rise in 730 700 X with a deep cool gam ax 400 cooler 32 gigs of course your vengeance LP x ram an msi be 350 tomahawk motherboard with the EVGA GTX 1080 TI graphics card white LED fans white braided cables all looking good and like I said before tons of the throwback consoles you can see his collection here and obviously everything has kind of behind it on the display shelves as well even that Xbox like arcade display console they would have in like Game Stop or EB games back in the day if you remember that the point is this is a killer gaming room and it all just comes together beautifully really good stuff man this is a dedication to the Hobby you love to see now we've got Tony J hey Tony J and this setups rolling with two ultra-wide something you don't really see too often I you know you really see two ultra-wide side-by-side but if you've got the desk space you could obviously utilize it all the extra real estate for those pixels it's a free real estate and as you can see lots of RGB going on that he could mix and match so for each of those displays his primary one is an Asus 35 inch with the display on the left side being a 34 inch ultra wide from Dell it's got you know the whole kind of cyberpunk theme going on in this pic now Forest peripherals we have the cursor County 5 platinum RGB keyboard and we have a lefty here because on the left side is the razor or boast Mouse and for audio that's the sennheiser GSP 500 headset powered by the Sennheiser GS X 1000 amp and DAC definitely a killer combo there now I am loving this hardline custom water-cooled PC looking really fresh I don't use that term too often but I think it's appropriate here this is the cooler master see 700 p case inside the intel i7 8700 k cpu with 32 gigs of g.skill Triton z r gb ram an ASUS Maximus 10 hero motherboard with asus rog r-tx 20 80 TI graphics card and obviously with me the white cooling and stuff you could switch up the RGB lights to match everything else it's just a really clean build this is something something of beauty so good stuff Tony J and I gotta say I like the dark wall here it makes everything else really stand out even the the wooden desk looks super nice I'm not like we claimed wood or something but that is also a thing of beauty and also I gotta say shout out to the left-handed gamers I probably can think of less than five ever on this show that we've had it's not really a big deal just worth pointing out y'all exist now we've got Andres and this log roll my heart's too hard there I tried to make it sound natural but it just didn't but he's rolling with a quadruple monitor setup with a very unorthodox orientation there plus a massive TV so we've got five displays in total here let's check this out so I gotta say I have to say list of this I'm not too sure which is which I'm gonna try to name him for you guys so he has listed an asus 27-inch model I assume that's his primary then we have an Asus 24-inch which is probably the overhead and then also a list of two Asus other 24-inch models which I assume are the vertical ones on each side I'm feeling pretty good about that prediction but I gotta say that spanned wallpaper is looking hella nice very very colorful for the peripherals we have the Razer BlackWidow elite no that's not the Razer BlackWidow it's a Huntsman you gave me the wrong specs man so he wrote Black Widow elite that's the Huntsman elite with the Razer Mamba Elite Mouse got the massive Elgato stream deck XL with the [ __ ] hell that's the amp and DAC and those headphones peeking off the left side are the Philips s HP 9500 rolling over into the PC we have a bit of an older one here inside the Corsair obsidian 750d cases and Intel i7 4790k CPU with 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix ram and look a good bite gtx 1060 graphics card and then also which is also hooked up to his setup is his laptop the Dell Inspiron 15 so he's just got a lot of gear a lot of tech in this setup not to mention his entire like console setup as you can see here the switch the Xbox ps4 tons of other headsets here some VR hooked up to that nice massive TV and actually I stand corrected that laptop I'll hook up to the TV as well not the rest of the setup but the point is he games and he's got a really nice setup I'm diggin the orientation I feel like this wouldn't have worked if the wallpaper didn't span as nicely but since it does it's just more visually appealing to us and it clicks in our brain so all together good stuff now we've got my man Udo and I gotta say if you're gonna put like my logo and my name on a setup I'm gonna love it and you did it here you did some magic cuz you guys take note look look at this setup the way he has the Lions in the wallpaper matches up with the design behind the displays on his wall this takes time and dedication and he's a master at this stuff he calls it his side junk setup but my man this is anything but junk is easy even they got a really nice wall-mounted PC this is what's up so for those three displays mounted on one arm to make it look a lot more clean they are Samsung 24 inch monitors all three the same model they are curved as well and again just appreciate the work that went into this this looks so good for the peripherals his keyboard is the logitech g930 900 chaos spectrum mouse with Logitech G 810 Orion spectrum keyboard matching the RGB lights and the peripherals to green to match everything else and then also completing the trifecta for audio is the Logitech G 633 Artemus spectrum headset and before we check out that delicious PC you got to take a look at the cable management because underneath everything is kept up real nice and tidy and organized which is why when you like a look at his setup from head on and even on the side you really can't see any cables anywhere so a great job with cable management which does lead us over to the PC because even still all the cables are routed efficiently which is not easy to do not with all this gear not with a wall mounted PC so the fact you did a super clean job with the build on the mounting is phenomenal so for this this is the thermaltake Corp e1 case use arisin 2700 X CPU with a thermal take ring flow 240 RGB a i/o with 16 gigs of g.skill tried and z-r GB RAM on the asus rog Strix x4 70 i motherboard with asus rog Strix RT x 2060 graphics card so I could talk about this for another hour but it's just a good-looking PC a good-looking setup and I just love all the detail you put into this I don't know how long the supposed of taking you but the fact you have the wallpaper lined up with your display and the RGB lights and your logo even it all is a 12 out of 10 and I've only given out 11s before and then rounding it out we have Johan and this is a really clean triple monitor setup and as you could see there's not a lot going on on the walls when I first saw the submission I did feel like it was kind of empty in terms of the space but it did say he's gonna be adding more to it and stuff like that so happy to see it's always a work in progress but I mean when as I setup ever completed am i right so for those three displays they are a 24-inch model from Asus they're all 144 Hertz and I'm happy to see they're all the exact model even though he can't really utilize hundred forty-four Hertz on the outer monitors because now they all line up perfectly making it look better in the end when he's streaming that light right there is from vil trucks and you could see his headset mounted off the side of the desk that is the HyperX cloud to into the rest of his peripherals at the ducky one-to-many RGB keyboard with the razer deathadder chroma mouse on the HyperX fury extra-large mouse pad and then over to the PC this case is from fractal it's the define mini inside Intel i5 8600 K CPU with a be quiet pure rock cooler we got 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport ram on an msi z 370 m mortar motherboard with an msi gtx 1070 gaming x graphics card so RGB light strips inside as well to accentuate whether you wanted to add the whole blue theme going on or here red could switch it all up and it all flows so yeah good stuff man diggin your streaming setup very clean and organized and I'm looking forward to seeing possibly a late 20 20 or a 20 21 rendition if you're set up to see the improvements and changes you make and all right guys out of wrap it up for episode 212 a room tour project I hope you all enjoyed don't forget you saw anything you like I have it all listed for you in
