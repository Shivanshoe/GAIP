what's up guys I'm random Frank P with the return of episode 5 of switch it up the series we show off some custom mechanical keyboards to kind of open your eyes and ease you more into the neverending Hobby that is keyboards so as we always deal we'll go through the submissions include a 30-second sound test you could hear those switches and stuff like that but we'll kick it off now episode 5 first up we've got bt i'm sure you're familiar with Brandon Taylor and his tech YouTube channel and this is a sneak peek at his upcoming video of his brand-new space 65 cyber Voyager it's a really nice 65 percent build and I am digging the color way all around here got it all matching which is really nice so the plate itself is made of aluminum and in between the layers he has a four millimeter layer of foam to kind of no dampen it a bit and on each side of the keyboard there's this tiny strip of RGB to let it kind of have like a side glow which looks pretty cool so for this he's using GM caimito laser caps and underneath he's got holy pan of switches lived with three 2:03 so they're gonna sound very very nice and smooth we'll do a sound test now so you could hear how they sound yeah I love some linear switches but also built-in is a brass weight which is gonna be on that backside there that's gonna give it some nice weight and heft on your desktop and also you know fit in with a color theme that you go with with the keyboard I know when I saw this was available there were different colorways and different weight options and stuff like that so he really futuristic but minimal build with the space 65 cyber Voyager from Brandon Taylor again check out his channel who's gonna have any more in-depth you know detailed build on this very soon you're not gonna want to miss that next we've got Tiki Tillman with a complete custom build here this is really cool and I love custom stuff like this it's an SM keyboards tkl seven layer acrylic keyboard so it's all made of acrylic in the top right hand corner here you can see it's actually like a custom Nautilus logo which is going in with the key caps you'll see in a second but the work done here is remarkable so you're taking a look right now at that copper plate you're probably thinking what is going on but this is by design using ammonia insult it gives it that kind of like rusted look underneath and it's still gonna be under that top layer of acrylic so you can kind of just see it between the key caps but again when you're talking Nautilus the underwater type theme that just looks really really cool and then obviously it's gonna fit in with his gmk Nautilus key caps so you see what's going on here and 40s switches he has 67 gram koala switches that he actually custom painted and they are lube with krytox to a4 grade zero and the springs are also lubed differently with krytox 105 we'll do a sound test so a killer project Nautilus build from tiki Tillman and SM keyboards really loving custom stuff like this you don't see it too often but when it's all done like this DIY matching a theme it looks great in the end it makes a lot more personal to the owner next up we have mentally and she's actually the creator of these very own key caps you're looking at so a very well-known person in the keyboard community and I'm loving this build all the artisans and just the colors it all looks so good so the board itself is an e white satisfaction 75 with a brass plate built-in what I love is with the brass gonna kind of match that escape key not only that but you have that built-in dial on the right side which I assume can be programmed and stuff but I would definitely use it as like a volume knob and it all just looks so good together I don't know much about the artisans but it definitely fits the board and like I said before she's the creator of these key caps they are called sa bliss and her switches are alpacas lube with Christo 1:29 from their swish films with T X films oh yeah get ready for this one [Applause] [Applause] man it does not get better than that it's a combo of the the lube apakah switches and the sa key cap so the resonance is all affected and it just sounds so awesome probably one of my favorite sounding switch combos with the key caps here a great job from manually loving this board next up we got prominent member of the community Alex Otis and I got to say before I even got into the keyboard community pretty much I would always see these super nice pictures on Instagram being recommended and every time it was Alex and as you could see he also modded his ultra light too to fit the keyboard theme so it's 110 percent dedication now for the board itself it is a candy bar premium this is from the key company the layout won't be for everyone with the split space bar isn't like a numpad and stuff on the left side but I for one absolutely love it and just the color the artists install so vibrant looks really good for those key caps they are in finicky Laffy Taffy PB T's and the switches he's using are the tangerine switches 67 gram lubed with krytox 205 grade zero I've got a shipment of these on the way as well super pumped for them and it stabilizers our gmk lubed also with 205 grade zero and dielectric grease now let's do it oh yeah like I said I am pumped to get those tangerine switches in loving the sound and as you can see he's got a lot more than just the keyboard going on the nice Ivey macro pad tons of the artists and the key caps which I love love that Gengar one coil cables from space cables needless to say Alex knows what's up good stuff my men and then last but not least we have Johann with his DZ 65 RGB keyboard from KBD fans but he went the extra mile again to custom paint it and all fit it to the theme which is really cool and I'm diggin the kind of mint accents he has going on so inside for his plate it's aluminum which he also custom painted mint green as well as the actual case of the board as you can see on the sides on the back there we're just gonna make it fit in more with his overall setup aesthetic now for those key caps they are DSA Dolce and those mint green accented keys RDS a milkshake there the fruit key caps in forest switches he has a bit of a mixture going on underneath so his primary switches are milky top got around blacks they are 70 gram Luba krytox to a5 grade zero and switch filmed then for his spacebar it's an alias and his modifiers are gather on Browns definitely a nice sounding board with those milky top gather on black switches I feel like they're very underrated but they always sound really really good and again shout out to you for the custom painting and stuff like that nice and clean lines always love the dedication here you got to fit it to a theme just makes it better and all right guys I'll wrap it up for episode 5 of switch it up hope you all enjoyed if you want to see an episode 6 if you're loving this stuff you want to see me continue it let me know by
