what's up guys I'm random Frank P back of episode 205 a room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup say anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but let's start it off unnecessary hand movements episode 205 am i wearing pants you'll never know alright first up we have Matt and you might remember this guy in a minute had him on over two years ago around Halloween you'll see what I'm talking about going with these stacked mounted monitors on that nice wooden backdrop else forest primary display that bottom one is a 34 inch LG ultra wide with the overhead being a 23 inch from Asus I like the spanned wallpaper you have so good job people have been taking notes I see now for the peripherals not the best shot to see what's going on but is the corsair k70 RGB keyboard with both logitech g502 hero and the coarser m65 Pro RGB mouse and then for audio HyperX cloud alpha for his headset in the speaker's of the krk VX t 6 now unfortunately we don't also have an addict ated shots of the pc just these wide shot ones over to the right side it's a fan Tex Eclipse p400s case inside his mental I 770 700 K CPU with a courser H 100 V 2 a IO 32 gigs of course err vengeance lpx RAM on a sub Z - 7 th motherboard with an Asus GTX 1080 Strix graphics card definitely a clean build for the most part going with like a blue and red LED lighting theme on the inside but man I love that wooden backboard he's got going on then over on the left side of the room he could see just a little chill workspace right by the window all that natural lighting little laptop and stuff going on over here and then this might be some hints to what I was talking about before this was the Halloween themed setup where he's got tons of the masks and stuff you could see just the actual Michael Myers giant life-size figure Slipknot masks all the scream masks so definitely the collector a fan of the horror films cool to have some of that in the room if you think about it you don't even really need a security system you'd have to worry about anybody coming and stealing your stuff because they walk in that room they're gonna see the life-size Michael Myers there and turn themselves in but all in all Matt good stuff good to see the 20/20 refresh here all right now we've got Jared and this one is actually set up I've been saving for a while cuz I was gonna include it on a minimal edition but I think I just completely forgot about it in the emails and I was going back I was like oh yeah this setup was pretty dope so I want to show it off because I love just the mixture he has going on you saw in the original shop with RGB lights it looks completely different than in the daytime with the lamp in the corner on you know though the wooden desk looks really nice complements the green in the plants and the wallpaper all that kind of stuff you know I can go on and on about this so checking it out for the monitors the primary one is a 27 inch Acer 1440p and the one mount that off to the left side is the same 27-inch model but in a 1080p version if I'm moving right along to his peripherals that keyboard is the tech where phantom in the full-size with Logitech G 403 mouse and his headphones audio technica ath m40 x that's hooked up to the file a 10k USB amp and DAC then also for audio on his test you could see in both sides for his speaker's there the Eclipse Pro media 2.1 speakers clips clips wherever you want to say let underneath the right side of his desk you can see his PC kind of mounted underneath its NZXT s340 case in white inside the intel i7 8700 k cpu where the cooler master hyper 212 evo for the cooler got 32 gigs of rip javy ram on an asus z 370 a motherboard with a gigabyte GTX 10 80 TI graphics card and whatever people have their PC under their desk I see a lot of comments about it but in this case where it's kept off the ground and not you know right up against the rug it's not an issue so as long as it's not right on the ground it'll be fine it does seem to be a good amount of desk lay still though on the right side but hey either way some people like it on the floor some people like it on the desk some people like it on the wall people like it outside yeah so all-in-all Jared really good stuff again love that kind of nature theme you got going on that nice walnut veneer on the desk for the IKEA kind of setup going on diggin the function now we've got some bosch and this one I love because a lot of DIY going on including the Nana leaf canvas that's like those RGB squares above the setup and he used just tape black tape to outline it which gives it this really cool design overall and then the desk he also made himself by putting a piece I guess acrylic in the middle with a LED light ship so it shines outward just really creative stuff and it looks great as a final result like got to give him props for this this is killer for the displays rocking the singular Samsung 34 inch curved ultrawide monitor of course got some plants on each side and then for the peripherals he's using a Razer BlackWidow X chroma key board with the Razer DeathAdder elite Mouse on an extended RGB mousepad said it's just the generic one and you could see in the back here's the laptop and this entire setup is ran off of a laptop so no dedicated PC who's also gonna you know add to that really clean vibe he's got going on it's the huawei mate Book X Pro has an i7 inside MX 154 graphic 16 gigs of ram so remember they don't all have to be just hardcore gaming setups for stuff like this he can build a really six spot in the room and still have a complete death set up but just having it run off his huawei mate Book Pro laptop so again the whole idea on the show is to give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup and if you look at this DIY masterpiece and you don't get any inspiration what are you doing with your life a sebastian man I'm loving this now we've got Ryan s in hot damn this is really nice so we've been seeing these like though the 3d wall geometric our panels pretty frequently lately but this mixed with the RGB lighting how it's just deflecting off the different shapes and stuff looks insane purple and blue I always said just looks really really good together and even that wallpaper just the cherry on the top of the pie terracotta pie so for this side of the l-shaped desk which is his primary workspace he has a 34 inch LG ultra wide mounted beautiful and force peripherals we got custom keyboard here it's actually the glorious Jim MK compact 60% but different key caps different like a nice coil cable some artisans and stuff really making it personal and unique now the glorious is Malo Oh mouse in matte white with their glorious white mouse Bungie SteelSeries quick prism RGB mouse pad with the elgato stream back there in the back and then for audio the sennheiser 598 SR headphones to go along with his desktop speakers the bose companion 3 man good stuff all around and only gets better because we got a hell of a pc built so this is the leon lead pc o 11 dynamic case where insides got until i $9.99 hundred k cpu with n 60 crackit x 72 a io 32 gigs of g.skill tried NZ royal RGB ram on an asus rog maximus 11 code motherboard with an EVGA r TX 28 ETI FTW three ultra GPU but just look at these pictures man I'll tell you what a lot of time what makes or breaks setup submission is the quality of the photos and this is like some of the best I've seen their real quick to take in a glimpse back over to the left side of the l-shaped desk what you said is his primary workstation over here he has a Dell Latitude East 6 540 laptop with a Dell 27-inch monitor but good stuff Ryan definitely fallen in line with one of the best of 20/20 loving everything about it cable management is flawless execution all the mounting just the flow of everything this is hands-down a 10 out of 10 easy and then last but not least we've got Domino with a very chill setup this is got that chill vibe to it you know big old window for some natural lighting the IKEA desk set up I'm digging it I'm digging it both of those monitors are the Acer nitro 27-inch one vertically one horizontally I call this the tetris orientation and then fours peripherals is going with the eraser black widow elites 2014 keyboard with the razor basilisk Mouse and for audio although not pictured we have the SteelSeries arctas pro wireless headset then over to the PC with the fantex eclipse p3 50x case we have a rise in 1800 X CPU with the cursor h 115 I Pro a IO interestingly here take note 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws vram but then he has two modules of the dummy 6 from corsair with their corsair RGB program so they're pretty much just the RGB light bar not actual Ram modules but helps fill it in and give us PC that extra glow it's all in the asus rog Strix b 450f pro motherboard and the gigabyte gtx 1080 OC GPU really diggin that teal interior lighting for the pc kind of matches the wallpaper there as well but this guy is definitely a collector as well exceed the massive integrated bookshelf on the wall tons of books collectors items all the hardware boxes and stuff definitely helps fill out the room a bit and then it's got his own little retro corner as well good old 4 by 3 TV tons of retro consoles and stuff a nice they're gonna kick back and chill that's what I said in the beginning a real chill set up maybe it's just the teal RGB lighting that he has behind the monitors and with the PC you know it always looks good but either way it's nice and organized good stuff Domino in this episode of room tour project is brought to you by Corsair and the k95 RGB platinum xt keyboard this 2020 release is gonna give us now a brand new wrist rest all the same features you love from a4 plus an integration with their shreem deck software with those six macro keys allowing you
