no this video is sponsored by red magic red magic just released their brand new gaming phone the red magic six and they were kind enough to send one over to me to try out and i gotta say it's the perfect phone for serious mobile gamers first of all the red magic 6 has an incredible display that can output a refresh rate of up to 165 hertz that's one of the fastest displays on any smartphone just in general but more importantly this allows you to get some of the best frame rates as possible in game and can give you a slight advantage in gameplay and speaking of advantages we're just getting started the red magic 6 also has two built-in side triggers that can be mapped to any part of your screen this is especially helpful in fps games like pubg mobile for example where you can map one of the triggers to aim and the other to fire which in my opinion is a lot easier to control than using the standard touch controls these are just two of my personal favorite features there's a heck of a lot more like the dedicated game space mode fast charging and more that i can't fit into this whole ad read so if you're interested in learning more about the red magic 6 the link is in the description [Applause] oh god oh you you little oh i would have had used if i wasn't in the open [Music] a little no no [Laughter] no yeah basically yeah b laughs me [Music] um no it does work it didn't hurt oh yeah it did yeah yeah stand still again yeah it went brave through you stand still don't move okay she's so worried about it it goes right through you what that when throwing me throw it at me watch it it goes right through me oh my gosh ow three i guess only jackson has the phasing abilities hey his friends coming miss all the shots he's already in i don't know it was 389 i think but you said something like because you said something why did we look i think you said something like cherry [Laughter] just way down foreign bow no fun for you oh my god later baby [Laughter] so an assist okay what the [ __ ] you gonna do something i [ __ ] saw him
